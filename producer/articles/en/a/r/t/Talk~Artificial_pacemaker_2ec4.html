<p>I'm trying to create a timeline for the history of artificial pacemakers:</p>
<p>1954 - First cardiac pacemaker stimulates a human heart - Used skin electrodes, caused skin burns.</p>
<p>1955 - Dr. Paul Zoll, MD, developed a pulse generator that stimulates the heart. Manufactured as the PM-65 by Electrodyne, it was intended for use as emergency support during cardiac surgery.</p>
<p>1957 - After a power outage caused a PM-65 to stop functioning, Dr. C. Walton Lillehei asked Earl Bakken to create a device that worked on batteries. This prototype lead to the 5800 line of pacemakers by Medtronic, the first wearable external pacemaker. This device was also the first with implantable internal electrodes.</p>
<p>1958/Oct/8 - Under the direction of Dr. Åke Senning, Rune Elmqvist developed the first fully implantable pacemaker. The first implantation was performed on a Swedish man named Arne Larsson. He was 43 y/o at the time, and suffered from life-threatening Stokes-Adams seizures. (The first device worked for three hours. A second one was inserted the next day, which worked for a couple of weeks. In 1971 Mr. Larsson got a device that worked well. Mr. Larsson lived a long and full life until his death on December 28, 2001. Over his lifetime, Mr. Larsson received a total of 22 pacemakers over 43 years.) The power supply for this first pacemaker was two <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickel_cadmium.html" title="Nickel cadmium">nickel cadmium</a> battery cells which were recharged from the outside by an inductive coil. The battery cells and the silicon transistors were encased in <a href="../../../e/p/o/Epoxy.html" title="Epoxy">epoxy</a> resin. The entire pacemaker device (excluding leads) measured 55mm diameter by 16mm thickness.</p>
<p>1959/May/19 - First long term transvenous pacing wire used. A 67 year old male with high degree heart block underwent insertion of a transvenous lead via cephalic vein cut down. The transvenous wire was attached to an externalized pacing system via the skin incision. The pacing system was able to sense native ventricular activity, but was not able to inhibit pacing output based on sensed activity. The gentleman was discharged from the hospital on June 23, 1959. Because the pacing lead exited through the skin, the skin site required frequently infected. However he never developed a systemic infection due to the pacing system. After using the device for 41 months, he underwent implantation of a completely internal pacemaker system on November 8, 1962. He died 20 days later due to complications from the surgery.</p>
<p>1959 - Dr. William Chardack and Dr. Andrew Gage at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Buffalo, N.Y., working with William Greatbatch (an electrical engineer), developed the (first) a fully implantable pacemaker using primary cells as a power source.</p>
<p>1960/Feb/3 - Orestes Fiandra MD and Roberto Rubio MD implanted the first pacemaker in the Western Hemisphere in a 40 year old woman with complete heart block and syncopal episodes. The device worked for the 9 months that the patient survived her other ailments. The device was designed in cooperation with, and produced by, Rune Elmqvist.</p>
<p>1960/Jun/6 - Chardack, Gage and Greatbatch implanted a self-contained, completely internal pacemaker powered by a non-rechargeable mercury zinc oxide batteries, in Buffalo, USA. The patient died 2 years later of unrelated causes.</p>
<p>1960/Jul - Greatbatch files for a patent on the implantable pacemaker. It is granted(!)in 1962.</p>
<p>1960 - Medtronic creates (first)a long-term implantable pacemaker system</p>
<p>1972 - Cardiac Pacemkers, Inc. (<a href="../../../g/u/i/Guidant.html" title="Guidant">Guidant</a>) creates first pacemaker with lithium battery</p>
<p>1974 - Plutonium battery devices in use.</p>

<p>There is some "first"-words that can be removed when discussing Greatbatch. I have put them in parenthesis above. This as the swedish device was really the first to be implanted, and that the Uruguay one was the first long-live one. I also added some details about the Swedish devices. The development of these devices continued, and pacemakers are still being produced and developed in Sweden, now under the name of St. Jude Medical Inc. One of their products is the worlds smallest pacemaker.</p>
<p>Ake Senning and Rune Elmqvist did present their pacemaker design on the second international conference on medical electronics in Paris in june 1959. The title of their abstract is "An implantable pacemaker for the hearth."</p>

<dd>I agree that "artificial pacemaker" is a bizarre title for this article. How about moving the article to "implantable pacemaker"? No one in medicine uses the name "artificial pacemaker" when talking about the implantable device. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 18:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove

<dd>I get it now. The article includes external pacing and transvenous pacing. I looked up pacing in a book I have called the History of Cardiology and it does make reference to the "artificial pacemaker." Perhaps implantable pacemaker should be a separate article, and include the NBG pacemaker code. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 01:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</dd>

<dd>I agree with that. There's already an article for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcutaneous_pacing.html" title="Transcutaneous pacing">transcutaneous pacing</a>. I didn't find one for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvenous_pacing.html" title="Transvenous pacing">transvenous pacing</a>. Implantable pacemaker, in my opinion, is an important enough topic that it deserves a dedicated article. As for biventricular pacing, it could either be a part of the implantable pacemaker article, or be separate. I see no particular reason to merge it, since there have been so many important studies dedicated to the use of resynchronization therapy for heart failure. It comes down to article size once these topics are fully expanded. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 14:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</dd>

<p>I was unable to find anything on the wayback machine, but maybe I didn't use it correctly. By reviewing the edit history for this article, its pretty clear that much of the basic structure of the WP article dates back to 2003 and approaches its current form fairly well by 2004. As best as I can tell, the doctors-lounge article was copied from WP in summer 2004. I'm using the opening sentence of the third paragraph as evidence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The first pacemakers required wires (called leads) to be placed surgically on the</i></dd>

<p>Meanwhile, the 5 April 2004 version of the WP article ends its opening paragraph with</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Generally, pacemakers do not treat fast rhythms of the heart.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>which is absent from the doctorslounge article. This sentance was removed from WP on 19 September 2005 by User:202.156.2.147 in this edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Artificial_pacemaker&amp;diff=23568345&amp;oldid=23568327" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Artificial_pacemaker&amp;diff=23568345&amp;oldid=23568327" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> The doctorlounge article seems to have been copied from WP between april and december 2004, but subsequently edited to track the newer intro paragraphs that WP has.

<p>The term "Brain Pacemaker" is an inaccurate journalistic term, not clinical terminology. A "pacemaker", as in cardiac pacemaker, is a device which applies a singular electrical impulse by way of one electrode contacting the heart muscle in order to evoke a single muscular contraction, or may apply singular or grouped impulses to 2 or more electrodes in order to terminate a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_arrhythmia.html" title="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmia</a>. A "brain pacemaker" does not use a singular electrical impulse to evoke an immediate contraction, or singular response by the brain; instead it appplies a train of impulses at a frequency upwards of 80Hz, to block or change the manner in which <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_synapse.html" title="Chemical synapse">chemical synapse</a>'s operate in groups or in communication between groups and thus acts in the manner of a chemical drug but with more focus than a drug. Thus, I argue that reference to "Brain Pacemaker" within the top section of Artificial Pacemaker is incorrect and misleading to the lay reader.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffrey_Wickham_8b1a.html" title="User:Geoffrey Wickham">Geoffrey Wickham</a> 03:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I find is from Schoenfeld, "Pacemaker Programmers: An Updated Synopsis": "...in 1973 [10] the ability to effect stable and lasting alterations in programmed parameters was achieved via an external electromagnetic programmer emitting a pulsed magnetic field that would open or close a pacer’s reed switch. Radiofrequency waves were~rst utilized for programming in the late 1970s." Mossig 10:45, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I remember hearing something about the magnetic reed switch. Even that is quite fascinating. It sounds to me like there's an excellent chance that the Fischell team at Hopkins was the first to use radiowaves for programming and telemetry (by applying satellite technology to implantable devices). I'll do more searching and see if anyone else makes the claim. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 13:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</dd>

<dd>The Wikipedia article itself is not relevant, since it's a dynamic source that stands or falls by verifiability. But the article from the Heart Rhythm Society webpage is interesting. It's strange that other sources credit Fischell and other inventors in the late 60s, early 70s with inventing the rechargeable pacemaker. Perhaps what they mean is "rechargeable in a practical sense." I did find a PubMed citation on the Fischell pacemaker. Love JW, Lewis KB, Fischell RE, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=1099261&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=1099261&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">"The Johns Hopkins rechargeable pacemaker.

<dd>My sad experience is that articles about inventors and the claims in them often are very biased (and sometimes flat out wrong). One typical way of twisting history is the use of "practical" and similar soft words. One example is all the articles and webpages which names W. Greatbatch as the inventor of the implantable pacemaker. An example from another field is teh museum at Kennedy Space Center: all exhibits are either "the worlds first" or "the first american". And all of the exhibits are of american spacecrafts. The choise between the two fists clearly follows a political agenda in that case. Mossig 10:45, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Noted. For the record, I wrote a significant portion of the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Fischell_56cf.html" title="Robert Fischell">Robert Fischell</a> article, and I've done my best to base it on verifiable references. I don't know the man, but I'm impressed with the scope of his achievements. It seems to me that a new design or improvement that makes a technology practical for clinical use can be a break-through moment. The key is presenting the invention in its appropriate context. The Johns Hopkins Rechargeable Pacemaker was supplanted relatively quickly by the advanced lithium battery, but it seems to me the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins deserves to be mentioned somewhere in the article. I'm going to try to get a full text version of the JAMA (1975) article and see if I can gain a better appreciation for what happened during the short time frame that 6000 of the devices were implanted in humans. I'll let you know if I find anything interesting. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 13:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</dd>

Three days later, he and his colleagues at the lab had built an effective prototype that changed the way pacemakers were built." <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 14:38, 22 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</li>

<dd>I am a bit sceptical about the last claim of the cited text, as I do not know of any modern pacemakers that uses rechargable batteries, This is due to the risks of forgetting to charge the implant, and the psychological strain the need of recharging places on the patient.

<dd>The first reference acknowledges that the advanced lithium battery made the rechargeable pacemaker obsolete. In the meantime, 6000 rechargeable pacemakers were implanted in humans. It just seemed it me that in a period of rapid technological advances in pacemaker technology, it was something worth mentioning. Since other editors have taken on the pacemaker history section as a pet project, I thought I'd post the information here for consideration. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 18:03, 22 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</dd>

"One of Mr. Mann’s early customers was the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at Johns Hopkins University. APL was trying to utilize some of its advanced technology and engineering to advance the state of the art in medical devices. One project was to create a pacemaker that would last longer than the 18 to 21 months that was typical at the time and proposed to make a rechargeable device. Spectrolab/Heliotek were primary sources for space power systems so it was natural for APL to seek out Mr. Mann. The eventual result was the formation of a new company, Pacesetter Systems. The initial technology transfer was important to the development of this product, but key to its success were the additional technological advancements that were offered in their first product: not only would it last for many years, but it was smaller than any other. It was the first device with telemetry, it was hermetically sealed, and it was the first pacemaker system to be essentially immune to electronic interference, such as microwaves. The first rechargeable pacemaker was implanted in 1973 and the first patient lived with that device for over 12 years. Today there are over 1000 patients with these systems, some with over 24 years of operation. The later advent of lithium iodine batteries would change the market, but Pacesetter became widely acknowledged as building the most reliable and most technically advanced products on the market." <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 18:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</li>

<p>Hello to MoodyGroove and Mossig with compliments on your contributions and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a> manners. It may be helpful to put forward some of my memories of pacemaker history. In relation to rechargeable pacemakers, and ignoring the pioneering 1958 work in Sweden, the first practical rechargeable device, using the NASA-developed sealed nickel-cadmium cell for it's battery, was in ca 1976 by Pacesetter Systems Inc. It was a bulky device, similar in volume to the early lithium-iodide devices which used the Greatbatch 702 cell in 1972-1974 and which were to demonstrate lifetimes of up to 15 years if the patient lived that long. But, by 1976 the lithium-iodide cell had been evolved to a much smaller size and with a projected lifetime of 5+ years met the clinical need for a pacemaker which was sufficiently long-lived for most patients, small enough to be implanted or replaced using local anaesthesia, and which did not require the regimen of recharging. Thus, the Pacesetter Systems device while certainly using the highest level of rechargeable battery technology was a case of too much too late, but none the less had quite high clinical acceptance with many thousands being implanted mainly in the USA. Going to the matter of external programming, the first innovations in 1964-65 used a simple 'two choice' arrangement where a magnetic reed switch was flip-flopped from outside the body by reversing a bar magnet. Then in ca 1976 the Cordis Corporation Inc followed with a system using using a reed switch in the implant which was pulsed from outside by a 300Hz magnetic field, allowing the first digital multi-parameter control. Pacesetter Systems Inc introduced the first RF (radio frequency) coupled programming system in ca 1982, using the work of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Fischell_56cf.html" title="Robert Fischell">Robert Fischell</a> and, as I recall, co-operation of John Hopkins Uni; this was followed in ca 1985 using bidirectional telemetry by Pacesetter Systems and others. Bidirectional telemetry, with different manufacturers using different protocols, became the standard. Modern pacers also use non-volatile memories to allow examination of the patient's pacing/cardiac activity by RF coupled interrogation. It is very difficult to find verifiable published sources to support my memory, so if any reader can help it would be greatly appreciated. Kind regards to all. <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Wickham_1a90.html" title="Geoffrey Wickham">Geoffrey Wickham</a>60.230.49.110 02:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's very helpful. I'm on duty tomorrow, but sometime in the next week I'll see if I can put together a paragraph or two for the article that is to everyone's liking (unless someone else would like to work on it in the meantime). After that, I'll probably set my attention to clinical indications and the NBG code.

In those days cardiac pacemakers weighed about a pound and were one inch thick making a large bulge on the chest, and needed to be surgically replaced approximately every 18 months. and in some instances every year. Many great research developments from universities often are released as a publication, but rarely are made into a product for the public. Al Mann wanted to make sure that this product was made available to the public, so he obtained the manufacturing rights to guarantee that it was made available to the public. In 1969 he hired Joe Schulman to take the technology from the Applied Physics Lab and set up a production line to manufacture commercial quantities of the pacemaker, and help develop new products. Four years and two major design changes later, and the first commercial rechargeable cardiac pacemaker was implanted in 1973, and Pacesetter Systems Inc. was born. The company developed the first pacemaker with two-way telemetry." <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 19:35, 25 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</li>

<dd>Comment on above re date of first implant of Pacesetter. 1973 would probably be right for the "first" as it generally took about 2 years to get past the FDA. The "weighed about a pound" statement is very wrong. Typically for that era the implant weighed 90-110 gms (a bit over 3 oz)<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffrey_Wickham_8b1a.html" title="User:Geoffrey Wickham">Geoffrey Wickham</a> 21:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Furman S., The early history of cardiac pacing. <i>Pacing Clin Electrophysiol</i>; 2003:26(10):2023-32. PMID: 14516345. "The earliest models of the pacemaker manufactured by General Electric Co. during 1961 contained a bistable magnet switch. Magnet movement of the switch in one direction produced an asynchronous stimulation rate of 70 beats/min, in the opposite direction, 100 beats/min, one rate for rest and the other for activity, with the rate selected at the patient's discretion. The value of this capability was not appreciated at the time and not duplicated by other manufacturers. In 1972 Medtronic Inc. introduced a technique of varying the output pulse duration at a fixed output voltage, to change the output per stimulus. Variation was accomplished by noninvasively rotating a gear train within the implanted pulse generator. This gear train was attached to small bar magnets. The programmer was an external device in which similar, but much larger, bar magnets were manaully rotated. The external magnets attracted and caused the rotation of the magnets and thus the gear train within the implanted pulse generator. An asynchronous (model 5931) and a ventricular inhibited generator (model 5961) were available. Both were nonhermetic but metal clad to resist electromagnetic interference. During 1972 the Cordis Corp. introduced a noninvasive true programming system in which the external programmer introduced a rapid magnetic pulse train in which the duration of the train was different for each setting to be programmed. Within the hermetically sealed implanted digital circuit, a reed switch was opened and closed magnetically, and counted. The circuit settings were modified accordingly. Constant currnet output was programmable at four levels and rate at 5. Four different pulse generator models were available, asynchronous, ventricular inhibited, ventricular triggered, and atrial synchronous. A year later Medtronic introduced a radiofrequency programming technique which varied the rate only, in six steps. The programmer contained a magnet which when placed over the pulse generator closed a magnetic switch within in the pulse generator, allowing it to receive the radiofrequency signals transmitted from the programmer. Other manufacturers soon introduced other programming systems making pacemaker programming a standard feature in a wide variety of pulse generators."</li>

<li>. Roger MG. Sy Furman is held in high regard both for his work in the early years and for his endevours in the last couple of decades in creating a record of pacemaker history by way initially of NASPE &amp; then the Cardiac Rhythm Society, so anything published by Sy surely meets the Wikipedia criterion for verifiability of edits. If an editor wishes to go further it is often useful to check the publication to see whether statements made in it are verified by cited references; and to keep searching for other sources. Back issues of the Journal you cite are available at the Uni Melbourne so I'll make a point of having a look when next in Melbourne. I could make some comments about possible inaccuracies in the Furman article, but because they would come from memory it would be unwise. I think we both have a common objective of providing the Wikipedia pacemaker history with an accurate synoptic history so let's keep at it and keep in contact.

<dd>Thanks, GW. This reference seems to imply that Medtronic was the first to use RF signals for telemetry, although it looks like both the Medtronic device and the Hopkins/Pacesetter device had RF telemetry in 1973. Can you think of a way to confirm the exact dates? The other references claim that Hopkins/Pacesetter was the first to utilize bidirectional telemetry (I am guessing that means the ability to receive information from the implanted device about pacing parameters and battery strength). Does that sound reasonable? By all means, let's keep at it!
