<li><b>Keep</b>, as a self-labelled agnostic I get irritated when second-year philosophy majors tell me that I'm <i>not</i> "agnostic," I'm either "agnostic theist" or "agnostic atheist," or perhaps "gnostic theist" or "gnostic atheist." Still, I must concede that these terms are all used regularly in religious and philosophical discussions. It's most certainly not a neologism. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 04:22, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <i>An agnostic theist is one who disavows knowledge of God's existence but chooses to believe in God in spite of this</i>. However, you need knowledge of him to form a belief. Agnostics ignore the question of theism until there is absolute proof. If you believe, your'e a theist, if you don't, your'e an atheist. If you don't know if god exists, then you don't believe in him. In other words; knowlegde, wether it's accurate or not, dictates belief. Thats why it doesn't make sense/ logical fallicy.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You need <i>knowledge of the concept of God</i>, which is entirely different to <i>knowledge that God exists</i>. I know about concepts such as God and unicorns, but I don't know that they exist. I might still believe in them, anyway. Also, you are confusing different meanings of "Agnostic" - the sort who withholds belief is only one meaning of the term. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 11:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Whether the term makes sense or not, it is certainly commonly used. The article could use more citations, but the fact that it's used in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._Smith_e6b1.html" title="George H. Smith">George H. Smith</a>'s book <i>Atheism: The Case Against God</i>, written in 1974 and pretty well known, shows that it's not a neologism. The paperback edition has a sales ranking of 11,150 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087975124X/ref=ed_oe_p/002-6258474-1448009?ie=UTF8" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087975124X/ref=ed_oe_p/002-6258474-1448009?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">at Amazon</a>; it's a reasonably common book.

<li><b>Comment</b> - agreed; for purposes of this AfD, the focus should be on whether or not the term exists, and it seems that it does so verifiably. Debate over any possible inherent fallacies in the term and its use should be saved for philosophy forums. If anything, more sources could be added, but I'd guess that some philosophy-oriented Wikipedians will have a pretty easy time coming up with some print sources. .

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not about agnostics, but about a particular sort of theist. I've encountered several people like this, who believe in God (and are therefore theists) but claim that it is impossible to know anything about God (agnostic). It is a peculiarly irrational viewpoint, but they do exist. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoatBringer_f2ea.html" title="User:StoatBringer">StoatBringer</a> 11:17, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The issue should not be about whether we think Agnostic theism is a "logical fallacy" or not. That is a POV, and if people nonetheless fit this description, it should not be discounted (I think many religious beliefs are a logical fallacy, but clearly that's not a reason to delete the articles!) The issue is notability and verifiability, of the term and/or the concept. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 11:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> please define agnostic theist on google. all articles of agnostic theist are from blogs and Wikipedia's own sources.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a>: Despite the fact that the term is used, it is used primarily as a species of agnosticism. Further, what it describes is a state of doubt rather than an active and positive philosophy. I think the subject is better understood, better found, and better discussed in the context of agnosticism in the 20th century. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:28, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The issue of whether the term is logically inconsistent or not is totally irrelevant. It's widely used, therefore notable, and it's distinct enough from the beliefs of most people who identify as simply agnostic to deserve a separate article. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenelope_D_a4b7.html" title="User:Penelope D">Penelope D</a> 21:26, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Some how it reminded me of Halldór Laxness' quote, <i>"All gods are equally good except the god that answers prayers, because he is nowhere."</i> Which convinced me that <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_Theism_9bfb.html" title="Agnostic Theism">Agnostic Theism</a> is not an incredible concept (albeat difficult for my weak brain to encompass); if it is not utter nonsense, it warrants discussion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 21:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is interesting in itself, though somewhat confused in places. Agnostic Theism may or may not be an active and positive(?) philosophy, but it is a philosophical position that is not unsuited to a deeper level of description than might be provided on the Agnosticism article. (Incidentally, agnostic theism is not necessarily a "state of doubt". The two may coincide, but one can be an agnostic theist who is certain of God's existence while recognising that there is insufficient justification - certainty is a psychological state, knowledge is not) --<a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtob_3e39.html" title="User:Atob">Atob</a> 02:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
