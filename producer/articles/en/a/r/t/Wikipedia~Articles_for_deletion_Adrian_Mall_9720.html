<p>Group nomination of articles about malls created in an apparent spam campaign of Dvac (<a href="../../../d/v/a/User_talk%7EDvac_1f79.html" title="User talk:Dvac">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dvac_945f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dvac">contribs</a>).

The same thing happened for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mesilla Valley Mall</li>

<li>Central Mall (Lawton, OK)</li>

<li>Killeen Mall</li>

<li>Yeah, Calton, they are just one-of-a-kind non-notable local architecture, just like high schools, bridges, parks, radio towers, public libraries, regional airports, and other structures that typically occupy categories named after the cities in question. But what rational person would attempt to apply <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> to any of these?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Malls are notable in general because they (together with their tenants) are significant employers and significant parts of the economy. Moreover, crimes sometimes take place in or near malls; people are arrested at malls, perhaps for crimes committed elsewhere; mall owners enact curfews to keep teenagers out during certain hours; mall security personnel are sometimes accused of racism or other forms of misconduct; politicians and developers discuss the benefits and disadvantages associated with construction or expansion of malls. Some of the articles nominated here have been expanded since the initial nomination and may now have enough references to unambiguously demonstrate notability. Consider that a regional mall (together with its tenants) employs more people than live in a small town, and the encyclopedic nature of many malls becomes increasingly clear. Moreover, documentation of the history of a mall makes it easier to understand the forces that affected the downtown shopping areas of communities adjacent to a mall. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 05:34, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>are significant employers and significant parts of the economy</i> That's an assumption on your part, especially the use of the definite "are". <i>Moreover, crimes sometimes take place in or near malls</i>. As sometimes happens in parking garages, garbage dumps, single-family homes, farms, liquor stores, country clubs, schoolyards, vacant lots, and corporate boardrooms. That something important -- or, as in this case, not really important -- <i>might</i> take place is a very flimsy rationale for notability. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:03, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have updated the references. Either I made an error with the first reference or the newspaper reassigns the URLs for its most recent articles. I added the permanent URL for the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Taking these sources in order, they appear to establish that: 1) A developer who worked on this mall is now planning to work on another mall; 2) A store in the mall has expanded its space; 3) Shoppers go to this mall for holiday shopping; 4) There are occasionally new stores; 5) The mall hires temps for the holiday season; 6) Another developer is considering purchasing the mall; and 7a-7d) The mall actually exists. What exactly about these facts makes this mall different from any other active shopping mall? These sources all appear to be trivial for the purpose of establishing notability. None of this information seems encyclopedic. Shopping malls as a class are notable, but this particular shopping mall does not appear to be a notable shopping mall. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:39, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> No. Especially in the present case where the creator of these articles has been blocked for apparent spamming. If the Wikipedia community somehow decides that we should keep all mall articles then hey we can always recreate this, it's not like this is containing any info not available on the mall's website. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 04:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per TT. If an <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordanhill_railway_station.html" title="Jordanhill railway station">obscure suburban Glasgow railway station</a> can become Wikipedia's millionth article (and be turned into a respectable "good"-class article), then we most definitely have room for a major, regionally important shopping centres.
