<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE Composers</b> and <b>NO CONSENSUS on artists, but NOM WITHDRAWN</b>. I've read this quite carefully to make sure I've seperated people's preferences for the two articles. I think there is rough consensus for the decision, and although this is a case where the numbers really are less important than the discussion, the numbers back it too. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:57, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a combined AfD for the <i>List of Catholic artists</i> (actually painters and sculptors) and the <i>List of Catholic composers</i>.</p>
<p>These lists could actually be useful, one might list people devoted to religious art, such as composers of hymns or painters whose Catholic faith is evident in their work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the entries are so sloppy ("the great majority of French and Polish composers") that there is no point in having them.</p>

<li><s><b>Delete.</b></s> First, the problem with the case for "fixing" is that unfortunately these lists have been constructed in such a slipshod way that it is impossible to fix them, because the list a) does not specify what the inclusion criterion are, and b) does not provide any shortcut to determining whether an entry fits the criteria other than to research each one from scratch. They are intrinsically unfixable and unmaintainable. If the first sentence had say, for example, that this is "list of composers whose Wikipedia articles cite them as adhering to Roman Catholicism during their adult life" something could be done. But, in any case, b) this list serves absolutely no function that a category would not serve better. Finally, c) "to be a source of pride" to a specific group of people is not Wikipedia's mission. In fact it is somewhat at odds with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>, and in the long run could even result in silly list-duels. You know... someone constructs a "list of Mennonite composers" and someone retorts by constructing a "list of Mennonite felons." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:34, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm changing my vote as you suggest, because the "artists" list is now more than a simple list, criteria for inclusion are stated, and at least rough reasons why the artist meets the criteria are given for most artists. I'm doing this <i>on the assumption</i> that you've checked the names on the artists list and that the information in them is, at least, confirmed by our own articles; and that, reading the articles, a reasonable person would agree that they show that "Catholicism was vitally important" to the artists named. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:28, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You can't be one-fourth Catholic. Anymore then you could be one fourth atheist or or one fourth Muslim. It's not an ethnicity, as Jewish or maybe Zoroastrian(as traditionally they downright discourage conversion) would be, it's a religion. Either you believe, or believed, it or you don't. Even if you accepted one fourth of it, (this doesn't quite work but to give some sense that'd be like, "I like two of their sacraments, but I could do without the other five" or "I like Purgatory, but I can't go for intercession of saints or Papal infallibility or transubstantiation" or "I accept priestly celibacy, but as a non-priest I want to have lots of gay sex, group sex, and non-marital sex"), you wouldn't be one-fourth Catholic.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Comment</b>: No, and I doubt that I could identify the nationality/sexuality of the composer, the particular symphony or even the style of music. The same goes for painting. The fact that I can’t is not a disqualifying factor. Since I think religion/sexuality/nationality etc. can all strongly color artistic expression, I have no problem with listing artists and composers on this basis. These facts may not always be necessary to judge/appreciate an individual selection, but are often essential to understanding meaning and context (i.e. knowing <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Byrd_dab5.html" title="William Byrd">William Byrd</a> was Catholic does seem critical; that <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copland.html" title="Copland">Copland</a> was American and Jewish adds meaning to his work; just like Picasso’s nationality adds force to <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guernica_%28painting%29.html" title="Guernica (painting)">Guernica_(painting)</a>). I understand the inherent dangers of all these lists. In the present case, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahler.html" title="Mahler">Mahler</a> would seem to be a bit of a stretch. If this was a List of Catholic symphonies rather than composers, I might vote delete. Nevertheless, if <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Catholic_artists_1130.html" title="List of Catholic artists">List of Catholic artists</a> is worth keeping, why not List of Catholic composers?-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:57, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. However, the presence of other inappropriate articles in Wikipedia is not a justification for including this one. If it were, there would be a rapid "race to the bottom."
