<li><b>Keep</b> While I disagree with the content on the website, the website has generated a fair amount of controversy on Wikipedia (e.g. see <a href="../../../m/m/r/Talk%7EMMR_vaccine_7f6b.html" title="Talk:MMR vaccine">Talk:MMR vaccine</a>) and is notable in that regard.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This page seems to have sprung from the seemingly intractable RfC on whale.to on <a href="../../../m/m/r/Talk%7EMMR_vaccine_7f6b.html" title="Talk:MMR vaccine">Talk:MMR vaccine</a>. Basically, the RfC was meant to determine the appropriateness of whale.to for external linking on a variety of sites. Several editors suggested that whale.to receive its own page in lieu of links on the multitude of topics that whale.to objects to. Personally, if having its own page stops <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> from spamming it on the medical pages, I'd support <b>keeping</b> it. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 04:32, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll <b>abstain</b> for now, but I have a question for John that may help us work through these issues. You keep adding links to your <a href="http://whale.to" class="external free" title="http://whale.to" rel="nofollow">http://whale.to</a> website to many, many medical Wikipedia pages. Are you doing this because you believe whale.to is currently a notable resource, or because you are hoping it becomes a notable resource in the future? --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 17:15, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't added any links for weeks, I'll be back in the saddle in a week or so. I did a Wiki page some time ago which had a few links pointing out the allopaths game, and I'll update that in due course, eg deleting pages I have done such as Lily Loat, and attemting to delete these <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viera_Scheibner_10a0.html" title="Viera Scheibner">Viera Scheibner</a>, and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination_critics.html" title="Vaccination critics">Vaccination critics</a>, that one took an hour to do. While I have been off whale.to for a few weeks, for various reasons, I have been doing Wiki pages, eg <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Anti-Vaccination_League_e1b9.html" title="National Anti-Vaccination League">National Anti-Vaccination League</a>, started this one <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harris_Coulter_7642.html" title="Harris Coulter">Harris Coulter</a>, so I may do more of that as Wiki certainly needs more of a balanced viewpoint as nearly all of the vaccine pages and vaccine disease pages (for starters) are purely allopathic thinking, with no vaccine criticism allowed, and I enjoy doing that. I did manage to create <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Kalokerinos_9e2b.html" title="Archie Kalokerinos">Archie Kalokerinos</a> and put his vitamin C cot death prevention on the SIDS page---after a big battle on the Talk MMR page (not sure that was worth the talk). But at least he seems to be still up there, fingers crossed. I may put a link to the Wiki page I have done on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_National_Anti-Vaccination_League_5236.html" title="The National Anti-Vaccination League">The National Anti-Vaccination League</a>, rather than duplicating it on whale.to. That needed doing and I doubt I would have done it if I hadn't come here, so that is one plus point. I have the books on the shelf. I can't see Wiki ever improving on my pages eg Scheibner <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/scheibner.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/scheibner.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, unless you have a document facility, and can keep the allopaths from deleting them or the links. As to your query about whale being a notable resource, I feel (IMO) it is the most valuable resource on medicine on the internet, right now, but i don't expect anyone who hasn't done the research I've done to see that, especially allopaths for obvious reasons, the main reason being the lack of real knowledge of most people who have been fed propaganda, like I was. (Medical) Truth is very simple, but really annoying to man, as Goethe said. I have the best vaccine document resource on the internet, especially smallpox. I have taken apart vaccination already, so any additions will be gilding the lily, but I will have all the relevent smallpox books up there one day, as I like to be thorough. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 23:47, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
