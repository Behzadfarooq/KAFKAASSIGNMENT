<p><s><b>Delete</b></s> (changed to <b>Move/Merge</b> see my comment further down) Insufficient material to justify an article. The few paragraphs seems to be culled from a single work. POV, whether or not Israel is "one of the most progressive nations in the world when it comes to animal rights" is an entirely subjective statement dependant on whether or not one views kosher/halal slaughter as more or less humane than other pratices. It's not clear cut (no pun intended). And the bit about whaling is just odd - Isreal's never had a whaling industry is likely because there are no whales around. That it's government voted for a ban on whaling is not especially meaningful. Homey 03:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, since the article could theoretically be de-POV'd and possibly prove useful (in much the same way as we have articles on <i>human</i> rights in different countries, <i>animal</i> rights could make an worthwhile collection of articles). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 03:12, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That was my point. One could either rewrite this to remove any POV-ness and then make articles on "Country X and animal rights" to go along with it or alternatively rename this article, use what we can and make a whopping great list about how every country treats its animals. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 03:29, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This appears not to be a good-faith nomination. The article was created some time ago, but I just noticed it today and tried to tidy it a little. Homey is currently following my edits because we're in a dispute. He knows I'm interested in Israel and in animal rights, so he's taking this opportunity to be unpleasant. He also hates to see anything positive written about Israel. The article does need a lot of work, but it's correct that Israel is one of the more progressive countries in the world when it comes to animal rights, so it could definitely become a legitimate article. There would also be valid criticism to add (from a rights perspective), regarding the continued use of animals in research, and so on. I doubt there's a huge amount of material out there, but certainly enough to justify an article. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:17, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, that's a POV dependant on your views on kosher/halal slaughter. If you think it's crueller than regular slaughter then Israel as well as Muslim countries would not rank as more progressive, if you think it's less cruel than they would. As for your personal attack, users should judge the article based on its merits and demerits, not on Slim's personal views about users. I don't hate to see anything positive about Israel, I just have a distaste for silly propaganda - it reminds me of the stuff you used to see from the old Soviet Union about how the grass is greener, the sky is bluer and the animals are happier - but again, the article should be judged on its actual merits.

<dd>Yes, and since I put it on my watchlist when I first noticed it last year it came up on my screen when I logged on. Thanks for reminding me about it. It doesn't seem you have very much to actually say in defence of the article itself since you're spending so much space attacking me. You write "I doubt there's a huge amount of material out there, but certainly enough to justify an article." the first part of your sentence is true, I suspect, so I don't see how the second part follows. With scant material, only one source it seems, it doesn't seem to justify a whole article. Homey 03:56, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You didn't nominate it when Das Baz edited it on July 10. I won't keep arguing with you, because it's clear what you're up to. You should perhaps reflect on the wisdom of an administrator behaving like a troll and a stalker. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:03, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You know, I don't remember what I was thinking in October - I suspect I put it on my watchlist because I was dubious about the article and wanted to keep an eye on it to see if improved and then it dropped off my radar and I forgot about it. Please don't embarass yourself with specious accusations because I've AFD'd one of the hundreds of articles you've edited in the past week, particularly since you know I edit Israel-related articles and have for a long time. Homey 09:52, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I've had fine interactions with each of you (many of my extra-Wiki views, I think, are a bit more consistent with those of SV than those of Homey), and I appreciate that each of you is sincerely interested in improving the encyclopedia. Here, FWIW, I don't think Slim's inference apropos of Homey's <i>wikistalking</i> is unreasonable, but, notwithstanding concerns about less-than-ideal inter-user <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> or impaired <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">collaboration</a>, where a nom can reasonably be understood as consistent with encyclopedic purposes, such that it is, relative to the project, propitious, the underlying motivation isn't particularly relevant. The nom here isn't disruptive—since several of us appear to support deletion—and can be justified on encyclopedic grounds, so, even as I'd likely conclude that Homey's conduct is indecorous, I think we'd do well to overlook it and focus on encyclopedic concerns. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I can see some potential value in a systematic series of "Animal rights in X country" articles, but this one is just sloppy and reads like a propaganda piece.

<ul>
<li>Expand using what material? As for stalking, if there were a pattern of someone habitually following someone around and posting comments where they post comments or editing where they edit (see, for example, Zeq's edit below) then you can speak of wikistalking. It's absurd to make such an accusation on the basis of one article, particularly one as obviously substandard as this one and particularly when I am well known for editing on Israel related topics. Homey 14:13, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think the most practical course is to create an <b>Animal Rights around the World</b> section in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a>, NPOV and move this article to that section, add other countries then, if warranted, create a spinoff AR around the world article. Anyway, given the lack of AGF exhibited above I'm taking both this AFD and the article off my wathcpage and will leave all this to others to implement if they so desire.
