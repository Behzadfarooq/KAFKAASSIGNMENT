Moreover, it's seems inconceivable to me that the tide could change so drastically that a consensus in the other direction could possibly evolve. On top of all that, the debate has turned into a nasty brawl, which is never a good thing. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 01:26, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This page is being used as part of a POV war by a group of medical contributors - a partial list found here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:86.10.231.219" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:86.10.231.219" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. It is their latest tactic. They are at present hoovering up numerous Wikipedia pages containing information they do not agree with, dumping it here to marginalise it. A recent example which is a safety issue and is not "anti-vaccine" but a concern to protect infants and children worldwide is the demand for the complete removal of the mercury neurotoxin thiomersal/thimerosal from childhood vaccines - see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=37920764&amp;oldid=37916966" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=37920764&amp;oldid=37916966" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>].</dd>
<dd>They have invented a broad definition of "anti-vaccinationist" to catch anything that remotely could be considered critical of the medical profession and harm caused by their use of vaccination - see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=37916966&amp;oldid=37901745" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=37916966&amp;oldid=37901745" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] and the agenda.</dd>
<dd>Here are recent page deletion attempts (another new tactic to strangle Wiki pages almost before they have emerged from "stubdom") [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Whaleto#PAGE_DELETIONS_and_DELETION_ATTEMPTS" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Whaleto#PAGE_DELETIONS_and_DELETION_ATTEMPTS" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]</dd>
<dd>This critique exemplifies how they use RfC's and suchlike to attack users who contribute to pages they disagree with [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Ombudsman#Outside_view_by_86.10.231.219" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Ombudsman#Outside_view_by_86.10.231.219" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]</dd>
<dd>Here are examples of edit histories showing a small number of the kinds of pages where some of the people identified here [[[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:86.10.231.219" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:86.10.231.219" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>]]] are active on these issues:-

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This kind of activity is an anathema to Wikipedia and is extremely damaging to its concept as an encyclopedia and the objective of NPOV. It can also be seen from the above and the deletion of the information from the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal.html" title="Thimerosal">Thimerosal</a> page that the following comment by one of this determined band of individuals is not true:-
<dl>
<dd>Strictly, at least in my concept of the article, which is subject to change in the wiki, it <i>isn't</i> about the <i>objections to vaccinations</i>! It is about the people making them, how they are made, and less about the relationship of the objections to truth than the behaviour of the people and the torpes or memes when it is demonstrated sufficiently clerly for most people that an objection is not grounded in objective reality (usually that is it scopied a few more hundred times and not corrected anywhere) <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 04:16, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At the time of this writing my user page is included in the list of users that this anon claims are a group of medical contributors engaging in a POV war. This represents a big presumption of bad faith on the anon's part. I sort of think I should complain to someone about his assertion, but it is such an outlandish claim I cannot think anyone would take it seriously. What should I do?

<dd>People can be vegetarians for many reasons. Some oppose killing animals for food. Some believe that grazing cattle for food is an inefficient use of natural resources. Some feel that a meatless diet is healthier. Some have discovered that vegetables are less expensive. Still, we have an article on <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism.html" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a>. This doesn't rule out the creation of subarticles to discuss the different aspects of vegetarianism—indeed, as the main article has grown, many articles describing various aspects of vegetarianism have been spun off. A similar process has taken place at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservatism</a>, with appropriate subarticles addressing the many disparate social and economic philosophies that can fall under the 'conservative' banner.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps move this stuff over to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccination_movement.html" title="Anti-vaccination movement">anti-vaccination movement</a> and parcel it up from there, but I think it's quite appropriate to have an article on this topic. That there are different philosophies and degrees of opposition to vaccination should not preclude Wikipedia from discussing the forest as well as the trees. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:12, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An excellent example of the idea, es, but I actually wondered if anyone would produce a particular person or group who goes to the trouble of broadcasting that they are <b>against</b> vaccine A but <b>for</b> vaccines B C D E F G H I and J. I'm sure there are plenty of people who hold those views on their own, but is what was asserted demonstrated, that that viewpoint is pressed upon others. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 21:25, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To discuss all skepticism to vaccines under one category is misleading - there is an Anti-Vaccination League, but it is not clear or documented how many of those who perhaps oppose thimerosal, or combining multiple vaccines, or innoculating against every childhood disease would sign up with the Anti-Vaccination League. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 04:18, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine, but it is a fallacy to assume that all skepticism to thimerosal or a particular vaccination schedule, etc., is caused by individuals who are categorically against vaccinations, as the editor and title seems to suggest. <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">Vaccine controversy</a> is framed as a neutral description of the controversy with plenty of space for both sides of the issue.

<li>Yes.

AfD is supposed to be about more than votes; there's good information in the article; as the article stands it needs some serious refactoring and possibly renaming; the closing admin for this AfD isn't going to be able to fix everything magically at the end of the discussion period, so we're going to have to talk about this; you can take those points in any order you like. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 14:16, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Plenty of evidence, including on Wikipedia, that opponents of vaccination have organised themselves and have a collective viewpoint that can be dealt with in an encyclopedic fashion. A paper in the BMJ and numerous extant organisations most eloquently argue against Leifern's assertions.

With all due respect to those who have made good faith efforts to establish a viable article, the pov seems to have worsened, the discussion veers away from the anachronistic 'anti-vaccinationists' toward attacks on modern vaccine critics, and even the dispute tag keeps getting removed.

<dd><b>Important Point - Summary</b> <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a>'s concern is valid in general regarding page hijacking:-
<dl>
<dd>This is an untrue assertion, unbacked by any indication (eg from the page history) that a page existed which I hijacked. It is probably a lie, but could in other people be a misapprehension due to not understanding how to read the history of a page (which Ombudsman has effectively pointed out, I am not perfect at, yet). I <b>started</b> the page. John has made significant additions to it which are definitely of value in teh article that is evolving. Without re-reading the history, my recollection is that Ombudsman's (a bad name offering a false impression of offical status I deprecate) contributions have been restricted to adding tags and barracking on the talk page. I assert bad faith.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is simply a lie. I created the page de novo. Other pages have existed, one probably was created to set out hte view of a group who the author asserted were not "anti-vaccinationist" but "critics" and was deleted after WP procedure. (After several references to vaccine_critics and Ombudsman's changing the name of the existing page to vaccine_critics, I attempted to resolve this in a helpful fashion to anyone who wanted to read about vaccine critics by making a redirect to the page in question. <b>Redirects are cheap</b>. Anyone who wants to write vaccine_critics as vaccine critics and demonstrate a distinction is perfectly at liberty to actually do so, just undo the redirect.)<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 13:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can only laugh at your characterization of my personality.

As for my feelings and motivations, I can only note that they keep being mischaracterized constantly. What I have made abundantly clear to you is that I believe the public has a right to make an informed judgment on thimerosal by understanding the full controversy. Any responsible physician would agree with me both out of moral conviction and legal necessity.

<dd>I am a responsible physician. Your version of an article would be along the lines of "Thimerosal is bad and does harm in teh following ways. BTW, here is somethign abu its chemistry." We now have an article about its chemistry, which is quite good, we also have an article about the arguments over how bad it is and whether it does harm, which is an argument which has been assimilated by a population of people who wish to abolish all vaccination for a disparate overlapping collection of reasons, as well as - I think, and Leifern asserts - being used by people who are in favour of some vaccinations, or even all vaccinations, except if they contain deliberate or perhaps molecule-couting traces of Thiomersal. THe world is complex and fluffy - Lefern displays a tendency to being concrete. And should not assume that any Physician who disagrees with his ordering of data is not a responsible one.

<dd>I would thank you, Migdley, not to put words in my mouth. And the controversy about Thimerosal is not about "molecule-counting." If the world is complex and fluffy (notwithstanding your baseless allegation of my "tendencies" - one of several ad hominems against me by you and others, I might add), then we owe it to our readers to present accurately the state of various controversies.

<dd>Yes but this assumes that vaccine detractors only have concern for a single specific issue, rather than jumping on every possible theory (whether conventional conjecture/hypothesis or new-age alternativism) to dismiss vaccinations, micro-organisms as cause of disease etc. It also assumes that vaccines cause 'harm', something that the overwhelming majority of doctors, researchers, statisticians, epidemiologists, health policy advisors and governments across the world find no evidence for.
<dl>
<dd>- The meaning of 'harm' is here used to imply a generalised nature inherent in the procedure, rather than any specific individual's mild reaction, or very rare more serious reaction - one can reject a blanket view that 'antibiotics are harmful' (I've seen a couple of children nearly die from cellulitis due to parental disbelief of conventional medicine/antibiotics vs homeopathy) as separate from 'some people experience discrete allergic reaction to individual drugs'</dd>
<dd>- The proposition initial use of the phrase 'a group of medical contributors' might imply some equivalence in the numbers of people on each side of a debate. However anti-vaccinators are numerically a tiny minority view-point. Were it not for how vocal &amp; strident they were, nor the media's fixation with sensationalist reporting, then their views would not be notable to the vast majority and would be denied credence under WP's policy of not accepting trivial minority view-points. However this is clearly not the case and the media-sociological 'controversy' is notable and therefore should be noted within WP.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The vocal detractors do form an anti-vaccine (and anti-medicine) sentiment, even if one accepts that some only have single concerns rather than accepting entirely the general conspiracy belief. However the various web sites duplicate unverifiable, poorly cited non-evidence based references and manage to confuse journalists, and thus the public, neither of whom have a responsibility for critical-reading of pseudoscience's obscurification. Yes people are entitled to good quality information (after all it is reasonable to ask if everyone else is vaccinated what is the utility in the remaining individuals having a vaccine&#160;?) but this is what pier-reviewed journals, governments &amp; medicine generally seeks to do. With UK official estimates of over a hundred children dying as a consequence of poor uptake of Pertusis vaccine with no eventual proof found for the assertion it causes neurological damage, anti-vaccination movement is clearly real and posses a threat to societies wellbeing, however well intentioned individual anti-vaccinationists are. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 16:20, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for pointing this out, but it is a nonsense and instead of levelling accusations you should have sought explanation.</dd>
<dd>Contrary to your allegation, shooting first and then asking questions, you presume I have intentionally deleted text. If you take another look at the text you will see that there is a stub of text which would not be left by someone intentionally deleting votes:-

<dd>"<i>- :::A reason to edit it - not to ...</i>" from a posting by <a href="../../../t/h/s/User%7EThsgrn_05b9.html" title="User:Thsgrn">Michael Ralston</a> 03:48, 3 February 2006 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You will also see that I had been editing the page at the time.</dd>
<dd>I regularly copy and paste the text from the window as I edit to save it and can have several windows open at once. It is quite clear to me that a chunk of text has been deleted from a window with nothing intentional about it. Take a look elsewhere through all my edits and see if I have done anything like it. You will not find it because I have not. If I had deleted text intentionally, I would not have been banging on about my good faith.</dd>
<dd>Also, no one would deliberately delete for example <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>'s vote, the chief protagonist in the matter. That would be so obviously noticed and there were very few votes in any event and people will have pages on their watch lists.</dd>
<dd>You might like to look at this text of mine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABeddow_Bayly&amp;diff=37675714&amp;oldid=37620809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABeddow_Bayly&amp;diff=37675714&amp;oldid=37620809" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>] deleted in its entirety by <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>. Are you going to accuse <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> of deleting it deliberately so that my vote would not be counted? No you will not. So kindly afford me the same courtesy and do not be so quick to accuse. It is done with monotonous regularity in these pages and it is so unnecessary.</dd>

<dd>I accept your explanation &amp; apology (I think) regarding the deletion, however:
<dl>
<dd>-I can't engage in dialogue if you are an anon user without their own user page/talk-page.</dd>
<dd>-WP normally posts a warning if I inadvertently engage in an edit conflict, does being anon alter how WP works for you?</dd>
<dd>-You had edited 4 times after CDN99 had pointed out the deletions without identifying your role in this and correcting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'm sure we can both accept we are never likely to agree on the topic of vaccination, but both 'sides' exist and can't in truth dismiss the existence of the other. Other topics are strongly argued over (eg Electroconvulsive therapy, but there is no denying that the detractors highlighted a very badly referenced article, and the debate improves the discussion of both sides, even if no final consensus yet reached). Is not POV/NPOV debate something for a talk page to reach a consensus (or at least agreement on where to disagree, e.g. abortion or contraception pages), rather than outright deletion? I think some of 'detractors' comments in the talk page have been very constructive, even if they clearly dislike having in principle an article that focuses on a (loose) movement. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 16:50, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>-&#160;:Comment: It is not based on a premise as given in the delete header. Leifern has not had sufficient time to read teh large collection of material already there, which probably accounts for that false meta-premise. It does assert that there is a commonlaity, a thread in history, and a collection of unifying themes whisch make this a social phenomenom of some note. It is interesting that some vry clearly identified members of the class are resisting attempts to describe the tendency they put signifciant effort into, and asserting that things are unknown or material does not exist, rather than adding or finding any. I'm impressed with Geni's demonstration fo good material in moments, if not with Leifern's apparent Google search - perhaps it was an inadvertent miskeying. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 04:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - this is a real movement (albeit perhaps loosely co-ordinated) as witnessed by any health worker who daily comes across the fear &amp; rejection of generally safe &amp; effective vaccinations by parents who are understandably reacting to the cynical nonsence targeted at them. To see the distress of a child then going through 3-months of whooping cough, or suffer perminant hearing loss that could have been prevented by MMR vaccination is an outrage, however some in alternative medicine would dispute that microorganisms cause diseases at all. Then again its only doctors/schools/health departments/researchers/government health-policy that try to be proactive and prevent this, but they are all in a financial conspiracy according to anti-vaccinationists whose concience need not be troubled by having to take responsibility.</li>

<dd>Whilst I agree that <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">vaccine controversy</a> links with this, the overall subject is too large for one article.

As will be seen in this article, the point-by-point demolishing of the anti-vaccinationists' pseudoscience requires great detail, that has been carefully collected <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECite_a996.html" title="WP:Cite">cited</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">verified</a> in this article.

<dd>I was quite surprised by finding out that there is an identifiable and articulated world view underlying what seemed to me to be total incoherent rubbish (note that this is complimentary and indicates an improvement in both understanding through researching and writing this and an increased iota of respect for the people with it). Given this underlying framework which I do not think is laid out anywhere in a form easy to understand even that it exists, it is to be presumed there is a common ancestral viewpoint back at perhaps the time of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pericles.html" title="Pericles">Pericles</a> to pick a random historical figure who might believe in spontaneous generation of life from rotting meat etc.</dd>
<dd>In order to understand the present day, and interpret the actions and beliefs of some people of a group which is definable though not crisply enough to saitisfy those here who behave as members of it, it is necessary to consider the past, in order for others later to understand it is useful to lay out a trail for them, and that looks to me like one of the better articles to come out of the one being discussed.</dd>
<dd>I do claim that the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal_controversy.html" title="Thimerosal controversy">Thimerosal controversy</a> article is a good one, as is <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal.html" title="Thimerosal">Thimerosal</a> and that they are each and both better as a result of the fission and fusion of this and the previous version of the Thimerosal article. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 16:01, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is fine; it's a notable topic, historically and currently. What's not fine is the basis of those edits in frequent personal abuse, breach of NPOV, and openly stated bad faith assumptions about editors who disagree with them. For instance, check out the lists at <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a> and User:86.10.231.219. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 16:33, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>As a piece of logic, I would agree with you. The problem is that many (I logically can't claim all) who present as raising just a single critism have as their agenda outright banning of vaccinations, but realise that they are more likely to succeed by advancing in more reasonable-sounding small steps. Or to put it another way, for each point that one might argue against, another and then another point will be raised. Over the decades there has been concerted attacks against (?all) vaccination programmes with each 'supportive' study dismissed as being misinterpreted, biased or part of some corrupt government-medical-pharmaceutical conspiracy, and so the appearance is of a anti-vaccination agenda even if one accepts some individual detractors truely have just a single area of (reasonable) concern <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:41, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The proposition above can be improved upon. Try: " While "anti-vaccinationists" are critical to (substantially) all vaccines, not all those who are critical of some vaccines are anti-vaccinationists? " but I'd suggest inverting it - "While some people individually have criticisms of some aspects of some vaccines, vaccination in some circumstances, or aspects of vaccination policy, there have also been since 1798 and still are at the present day some people who work, commonly in concert against all vaccination with all vaccines in all circumstances. A factor frequently found among the latter is that they present their opposition as to some aspect or subset, whereas by their behaviour its scope is as described. Other common factors include the types and quality of argument advanced." I think that one is quite good, actually. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 17:37, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Be very careful about what you imply here, lest it sound like a conspiracy theory. There is no question there has been an anti-vaccination movement that categorically rejects the benefits of vaccinations. But to imply that all skepticism toward some aspects of vaccination is part and parcel of that movement is a fallacy - it would be like saying that those who were against <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thalidomide.html" title="Thalidomide">Thalidomide</a> were against medicine. The article - which looks like it will survive - should limit itself to discussing the movement itself and contain links to articles about the specific controversies.

<li>I quoted a phrase which is already in the proposition you are criticising. It is in there because when I wrote it I worked out what it needed to say.

<li>The page should be called <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_critics.html" title="Vaccine critics">Vaccine critics</a> like I suggested before you hijacked it, as anti-vaccinists (a better term, and used historically) are a subset of the larger group of vaccine critics, eg <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Yazbak_778e.html" title="Edward Yazbak">Edward Yazbak</a> is not anti-vaccine. And unless you have a page to vaccine critics there is no place for them on an anti-vaccine page. Was that your design, to eliminate 90% of vaccine critics? Also few want to be labelled "anti-vaccine" as it a label similar to "kook", so I can't imagine anyone saying they are anti-vaccine, even if they were. We can see your POV leading to that ie marginalising the radicals--- <i>"The first step in his strategy is to isolate and marginalize the radicals. They're the ones who see the inherent structural problems that need remedying if indeed a particular change is to occur. To isolate them, PR firms will try to create a perception in the public mind that people advocating fundamental solutions are terrorists, extremists, fearmongers, outsiders, communists, or whatever."</i>--John Stauber. In summary your page is another kook page that suppresses the majority of vaccine critics.

<dd>Your articles, John, are being attacked not because of their topic, but because they are selective and biased, and show you're making no effort to create the kind of broad-based biographies suitable for an encyclopedia. You merely pick the bits from articles favorable to your beliefs floating around on the anti-vaccination circuit, and make no effort to find other details (even simple stuff like birth and death dates that you can often find via Google) that fill out the biography in areas not related to your <i>idee fixe</i> about vaccination.

If he writes about the larger group that criticise vaccination while regarding some vaccination as good, then we can see how the material sorts itself out and who remains in the smaller group who are against all vaccination and describe themselves variably as a tactic in argument.

<dd>I'm not quite convinced that the explanation of the Kano activity is actually anti-vaccinationism. It may be, but I suspect it is itself being used as a small ploy in a much wider dispute and conflict over power and influence - possibly along the lines of the West is bad: the vaccine comes from the West: therefore the vaccine is bad. To join that into a seamless whole with the current western anti-vax (if that is an uncontroversial label, of what is it a contraction?) would require exploration of the world-views - being done - and a demonstration that a substantial proportion not only retain an 18th century view of why milk goes sour and grapes become more interesting which is possible, half-asserted by John, but undemonstrated and gives me for one trouble swallowing since <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasteur.html" title="Pasteur">Pasteur</a>'s work is so easy to duplicate in the kitchen, but <i>crucially</i> have a burning and possibly "religious" desire to spread this to the rest of us.

If there was a page to vaccine critics or opposition to vaccination then anti-vaccine could be a sub page, but by itself it is being used to marginalise the radicals into a pen labelled <i>kook</i>, which is an old ploy. If that wasn't the game why did they change the name <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_critics.html" title="Vaccine critics">Vaccine critics</a> into this page? That was an obvious name but they couldn't label us with the kook tag <a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/vaxliars1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/vaxliars1.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, and it eliminates 90% of vaccine criticism from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 00:12, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A point for negotiation, perhaps? If you find "anti-vaccine" etc pejorative, people might be more receptive to finding a mutually acceptable term if you stop using the term "allopath" that others find pejorative. It cuts both ways. 213.130.142.10 00:50, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The viewpoint of the vast majority (medical, health policy) is of the terms anti(-)vaccination(ist)(s) (over 68,000 hits on Google.co.uk search for permutations) and my preference is for the term, in the same way one describes 'vegitarians' rather than 'opposition to meat eating', or 'pacifists' vs 'opposition to taking up arms'. The semantics are difficult here, for each choice has some POV behind it, and I am not sure are necessarily precisely the same things (eg concerns for excess red-meat eating as a risk for cancer is quite different from ethical/moral approach taken by vegitarians or vegans).<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:41, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, Leifern it was an attack on your action, not your person. This is another example of you not understanding (or misusing) the basic definition of important terms around here. This article did not meet any of the AFD criteria even remotely. It was a detailed, coherent article about an encyclopedic topic that other people have written articles about in the medical literature. It was not original research. It is hard to come to any other conclusion than that you nominated it for deletion because you disagree with some of its interpretations of fact-- precisely a <b>bad faith</b> nomination. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 00:35, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not a term in current coinage. This article contains no definition of the term. It is not exactly an independent or impartial source - written by a vaccinator in the in-house journal of the British Medical Association. This source has already been cited several times suggesting there is a lack of sources to justify the use being given to the term on this page.</dd>
<dd>Also, interestingly, I have searched multiple dictionaries and that includes a medical dictionary and, whilst struggling hard to find even one definition of "anti-vaccinationist" "vaccinator" does have a dictionary definition [<a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vaccinator" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vaccinator" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>]</dd>

<dd>The Invisible Anon, I agree with you that "anti-vaccinationist" may be more of a historical term, and perhaps the purposes and the spirit of the article would be better suited with a different name. On the other hand, the British Medical Association represents more mainstream opinion than other potential sources like whale.to, etc. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 12:22, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, it's a long-standing misconception that words are only valid if they appear in dictionaries (the long omission of <a href="../../../c/u/n/Cunt.html" title="Cunt">c**t</a> is a classic example). If they appear in the general corpus of written English, particular when repeatedly used in mainstream publications, they exist. As to the particular extent of "anti-vaccinationist", see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=38415619&amp;oldid=38413765" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=38415619&amp;oldid=38413765" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In the Times archive up to 1985, I find 31 hits for "anti-vaccinationist" (spread from 1833 to 1964) and 71 for "anti-vaccinationists" (1870 to 1962). Google Books finds more, from George Bernard Shaw to recent books. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 13:40, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"<i>Anyone who has real trouble working out what defines an anti-vaccinationist (and why the Chief Medical Office of the UK is not an anti-vacciantionist because he thinks that we should vaccinate against Rubella, but not, routinely against Chickenpox, in 2005) then I suggest two things:-</i>
<dl>
<dd>* <i>1. Look at the tables and try to match beliefs to people;</i></dd>
<dd>* <i>2. describe a person here on the Talk: page, and we'll come to a delphic concensus on whether they are, or are not.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And by <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>'s definition of "anti-vaccinationist" The UK's Chief Medical Officer is an anti-vaccinationist because, according to this definition he objects on "<i>principled or other grounds</i>" to some vaccinations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As for the proposition <i>describe a person here on the Talk: page, and we'll come to a delphic concensus</i>? That is extraordinary. You mean it is not possible to tell from the definition? But I thought these people were identifiable and organised? And where do vaccine critics who are not anti-vaccine fit into all of this? They do not, but <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>'s definition includes them.</dd>
<dd>Further, it just will not be possible to get all relevant information onto just one page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size" rel="nofollow">Article Size</a>] but is that the idea? To restrict all further information because this is the one page for it all?</dd>
<dd>And this is not an excuse to create one page where all criticism of vaccines is to be dumped and marginalised? Difficult to agree that one.</dd>
<dd>As for accusations of "bad faith" not being a personal attack, I will bear that in mind and quote it if ever anyone accuses me of accusing them of "bad faith". However, I do not rate my chances of success too highly with that one.</dd>

<dd>Self-awareness should include understanding that when people come to conclusions, even wrong ones, there is usually some basis. I could suggest as a possibility that if someone has a hissy fit in public, issues threats and asserts another editor of a page one has a clear and declared personal interest in is a vandal, and then instantly lists for deletion a page of that editor when it is, to quote an also experienced editor above here "obviously not going to reach a consensus for deletion" that there is a risk that any or all of it may be taken as prima facie evidence of bad faith. If Leifern prints that out and hangs it on his monitor he will have a reminder of how a proportion of the human race think, and what conclusions they may draw from some possible acts. Now, as to the actual motives and degree of accuracy of the suggested deletion I think that is best left out of here, becuase it isn't relevant to the advice above. In the course of work I often find myself giving similar advice to people whose lives are less happy than many bystanders think they could be, and it is often rejected. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 18:46, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can only judge the actions that I observe on Wikipedia. Now, let's take your accusations:
<ul>
<li>Blanking entire sections of articles is listed as vandalism in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a>. There are ongoing debates as to whether it is vandalism only if there is evidence of bad faith, but I find it very hard to ascertain motivation here on this medium and in general. So I issued a warning that such behavior does amount to vandalism, and that it would be reported as such if it was repeated.</li>
<li>There is a policy in Wikipedia also against POV forks and articles with titles that beg the question. In your original version of the article, both these were fulfilled.</li>
<li>"Prima facie" means, quite literally, "on its face." In no way can my conduct be viewed as prima facie evidence. It could, I suppose, and with some imagination and ill will, be construed as "circumstancial evidence," but that is the exact opposite of prima facie.</li>
<li>I think the debate about this article has been useful and probably led to some improvements in the article itself. I don't know how many articles that are put up for deletion get deleted, but the advice of one "experienced editor" is not going to dissuade me from doing what I think is right.</li>
<li>As for what most of the human race thinks, I think our work here is to overcome prejudices and fallacies that we all succumb to every once in a while. A common one among mediocre physicians (as well as a few other exposed professions) is that they have a superior intellect to others, or that medical science has answers to most things. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:32, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, it is entirely consistent with what I have said all along. I have a son who I believe was poisoned - I don't expect everyone to agree with me, but I think parents have a right to make an informed decision based on full knowledge of the controversy. This is an entirely rational point of view. I made it clear why I thought your deletions were vandalism, and I warned you that they were. Because both you and Geni have a problem with orthography and remarkably congruent views and similar ways of expressing yourselves, I thought it best to ask. Geni has already had a (fully disclosed) sockpuppet before.
