Chevy &amp; the Titans is a country/rock band from Grand Rapids, Michigan founded in 1970. They sang songs about driving tractor-trailer trucks, such as "Drivin' In My Big Ol' Truck" &amp; "22 Tons of Detroit Diesel Power". Their name is derived from both the Chevrolet Titan tractor-trailer truck &amp; from Chevy Ford, the leader of the band, who was a distant cousin of the Ford family that founded Ford Motor Company. Though an obscure group, Chevy &amp; the Titans has been credited with contributing to the tractor-trailer craze of the 1970s.</p>

During this time he learned multiple programming languages including <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASIC_e4ac.html" title="BASIC">BASIC</a>, 68000 Assembler, <a href="../../../c/_/_/C.html" title="C">C</a>, and 80 x 86 Assembler. He was a jack of all trades. Gower designed all of his programs, graphics, sound, music, etc. His software was highly acclaimed. He created the game Destruction Imminent for the <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Atari ST">Atari ST</a>, which was commercially published by Goodman's International. He then continued to computer-programming, and wrote an entire 3D engine and Object Modeling program in <a href="../../../c/_/_/C.html" title="C">C</a> and optimised assembler.</p>
<p>Starting in 1997, Andrew became a freelance JAVA programmer, who was paid to create Java-based games for websites. He ported his entire 3D engine to Java and wrote a Java audio and graphics library which included up to 350 functions.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1999, Andrew worked for GamesDomain, which was a very popular gaming website at the time. He created games for them, and also carried out other programming tasks for them.</p>
<p>Andrew Gower enjoyed/s <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">Karate</a>, Sailing, Programming, Playing the keyboard, reading <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science-fiction.html" title="Science-fiction">science-fiction</a> books, playing board games, and kite-flying.</p>

<p>Andrew Gower has created several games, as well as other things.</p>
<p>He Ray Traced a couple of pictures. There were a total of 4 ray traced pictures posted on his personal web-page in 98-99.</p>
<p>Andrew also created a program called "Fractal Overload". It is a fractal generator which was made with speed in mind. According to him, it was one of the fastest ones around.</p>
<p>He made a screen-saver called "Fireworks". It displays pixels being exploded in a fire-work-like fashion on-screen. It was created in Direct-X.</p>

<hr />
<p>Andrew's big project at the time was DeviousMUD, a multi-user <a href="../../../r/p/g/RPG_6fc6.html" title="RPG">RPG</a> game. It was being coded in <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java.html" title="Java">Java</a>. It's based on a <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUD</a> engine, which he turned graphical instead of text. It was similar to <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>, since the game is, after all, its predecessor. It was going to include weapons, armor, quests, monsters, and usual RPG elements. Here is a list of the features that were never updated/weren't in the public one-week release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level and Skill Advancement.</li>
<li>Play Variables</li>
<li>Projectiles</li>
<li>Player Trading</li>
<li>Various NPC options</li>
<li>Bigger Map with Quests</li>
<li>Health Regeneration</li>
<li>Added features to quest engine</li>
</ul>
<p>There were some bugs with the program that Andrew pointed out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stairs problems</li>
<li>Characters don't face each other when talking</li>
<li>No feedback given when an illegal action is taken</li>
<li>NPCs walking too close to walls</li>
<li>Strange effects when players die occasionally</li>
</ul>
<p>Development stopped on DeviousMUD seemingly around 1999-2000. Updates stopped coming, and the page was just sitting there. Andrew later began development on RuneScape.</p>

A town located at 49° 26'N, 27° 25'E within the country of Ukraine, population approximately 4,500.</p>
<p>Also known as Mezibezh, Medzibozh, Mezhibezh, Miedzyboz, Mezhbiz, Mezhybizh, Меджибож, Меджибіж, and many other variants. It has a history that began in the 12th century and was a strategic stronghold during various invasions. Located on the Yuzhny Bug river for which it is named (its name literally means "between the Buzhenka and Bug rivers"), it was a prosperous town and district capital particularly during the 18th century. It is notable as the home of a vibrant Jewish community that spawned the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasidism.html" title="Chasidism">Chasidic</a> movement. Traditionally, Medzhibozh was part of <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podolia.html" title="Podolia">Podolia Province</a>, but since the Soviet rule is now part of <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmelnytskyi%2C_Ukraine_195f.html" title="Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine">Khmelnitsky Oblast</a>.</p>

<p>Medzhibozh is first mentioned in the annals of Russian history as an estate of the <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus_36a8.html" title="Kievan Rus">Kievan Rus</a>. It was given to Prince Svyatoslav by the prince of Kiev in the year 1146. In 1148, ownership transfered to Rostislav the son of Yuri Dolgaruky Svyatoslav. By 1360, the territory passed into the hands of the Lithuanians. It suffered numerous attacks, most notably by the <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatars.html" title="Tatars">Tatars</a> in 1453, 1506, 1516, 1546, 1558, 1566, and 1615. In the 1500s, the territory was controlled by Sieniawska and <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potocki.html" title="Potocki">Potocki</a> Polish noble families. In 1511 work began to replace the wooden palisades with massive stone fortifications, many of which can still be seen today. A dam was built across the Yuzhny Bug river to provide a defensive lake, and a rhomboid castle with four towers was built. The state-of-the-art fortifications made Medzhibozh one of the strongest military sites in the region and thus led to its prosperity in later centuries.</p>
<p>The first records of Jews in Medzhibozh show up in the early 1500s. In these records, various Jews are granted special privileges by the Polish Kings, including a proclamation in 1566 by King Sigizmund II August that Medzhibozh Jews are forever released from paying taxes. The earliest known burial in the Jewish cemetery dates from 1555. In 1571 a census was recorded, listing 95 Russians, 35 Jews, and 30 Poles.</p>

<p>In 1648 <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky_651d.html" title="Bohdan Khmelnytsky">Bogdan Khmelnitsky's</a> invaded the region. At the time, there were approximately 12,000 residents of Medzhibozh and environs. A Jewish <i>historish lid</i> records that 5,000 Jews were massacred by <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky_651d.html" title="Bohdan Khmelnytsky">Khmelnitsky</a> that year in Medzhibozh. <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_II_Casimir_3b11.html" title="Jan II Casimir">Jan Casimir</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky_651d.html" title="Bohdan Khmelnytsky">Khmelnitsky</a> negotiated a treaty in 1649 to end the hostilities, but pogroms continued in 1651 and 1653. By 1661, only a handful of Jews remained in Medzhibozh. The year 1664 marked the last of the cossack pograms. By 1678, only 275 Jews were counted in the region's census.</p>

<p>Weakened by the cossack uprising, Podolia was invaded and occupied by Turkey in 1672. Medzhibozh became part of the Turkish Ejalet of Kamieniecki. In 1682, Medzhibozh was recaptured by the Poles under <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Sobieski_22ca.html" title="Jan Sobieski">Jan Sobiesky</a>.</p>
<p>After Medzhibozh was repatriated from the Turks, it went through what many consider its golden age during the 17th and 18th century. Under the Sieniawski family and later the Czartoryski family, the town prospered. Medzhibozh apparently successfully defended itself from several <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haidamak.html" title="Haidamak">Haidamak</a> attacks. By the mid 1700s, Medzhibozh was the seat of power in <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podolia.html" title="Podolia">Podolia Province</a>. It had a population of 2,500 Jews, which was more than half of the town's population.</p>

<p>Medzhibozh fell into Russian hands during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Partition_of_Poland_00d2.html" title="Second Partition of Poland">second partition of Poland</a> in 1792. The Czartoryski family continued to own the town until <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Jerzy_Czartoryski_0811.html" title="Adam Jerzy Czartoryski">Prince Adam Czartoryski</a> was forced into exile in 1831.

The economy of Medzhibozh deteriorated as the nearby town of Letichev flourished and the railroad bypassed the town to the south.</p>
<p>In the late 1880's through <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_war_I_644e.html" title="World war I">World War I</a>, Medzhibozh was the center of military activity, housing an important garrison within its castle grounds.</p>

<p>After the 1917 <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Bolshevik Revolution</a>, the territory was occupied by German and Hungarian troops until the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_war_I_644e.html" title="World war I">World War I</a>. Medzhibozh was the scene of numerous pogroms during the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Civil_War_dc1c.html" title="Russian Civil War">Ukrainian Civil War</a> of 1919-1922. The town changed hands many times as different militia units from either the Bolsheviks, Ukrainian Nationalists, Poles, or Whites gained temporary control. What little wealth was left was stripped in these pogroms turning the entire area into ruins.</p>
<p>Under Soviet rule starting 1922, the region's economy improved. Electricity, schools, roads and other infrastructure were built. Several <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkhoz.html" title="Kolkhoz">kolkhozi</a> (collective farms) were established near Medzhibozh.</p>
<p>In the early 1930s, pressure from the government to collectivize and the needs of private peasants resulted in severe food shortages that resulted in <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famine_in_Ukraine_13a6.html" title="Famine in Ukraine">famines throughout Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>Medzhibozh was astride an important east-west supply road that the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> wanted to expand into an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobahn.html" title="Autobahn">autobahn</a>-like highway.

<p>A Jewish <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghetto.html" title="Ghetto">ghetto</a> was established in Medzhibozh and in Letichev to assist <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todt_Organisation_2715.html" title="Todt Organisation">Organisation Todt</a> in providing human labor for the road building project. Because of this special road project, Medzhibozh retained its Jews longer than most of the surrounding communities, where <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einsatzgruppen.html" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a> units executed entire populations of Jews shortly after <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> occupation. However, when the road project was completed in the summer of 1942, the <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einsatzgruppen.html" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a> units were called in. Three separate mass shootings of Jews occured between August 21, 1942 and October 31, 1942 that eliminated all Jews in the <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghetto.html" title="Ghetto">ghetto</a>.

<p>Medzhibozh was the center of Jewish culture in this region. Many key rabbinic leaders lived here during the 17th through 20th centuries. The earliest important rabbi to make Medzhibozh home was <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Sirkes_c050.html" title="Joel Sirkes">Rabbi Joel Sirkes</a> (1561-1640), a key figure in Judaism at that time. He lived in Medzhibozh from 1604-12.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important Jewish rabbi was <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Rabbi Israel ben Eliezar Baal Shem Tov</a> "Besht" (1698-1760). He lived in Medzhibozh from about 1742 to his death in 1760. His grave can be seen today in the Medzhibozh old Jewish cemetery. The <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov</a> is considered one of the key Jewish personalities of the 18th century who has shaped Judaism into what it is today. His work led to the founding the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasidism.html" title="Chasidism">Chasidic</a> movement, established by his disciples who also lived in Medzhibozh. In Medzhibozh, the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov</a> was known as a "doktor" and healer to both Jews and non-Jews. He was known to have been given a special tax-free dispensation by the Czartoryski lords and his house shows up on several town censuses.</p>
<p>Many different rabbinic dynasties came from Medzhibozh. There were two fundamentally different rabbinic leaders in the town, those who were Chasidic and those who were not. In general, both groups got along, but the Chasidic leaders believed themselves to have a special connection with God and their followers were cult-like in their devotion to their "rebbe". The non-Chasidic leaders tended to follow a scholarly path and were more responsible for the Jewish institutions, such as observance of <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashrut.html" title="Kashrut">Kashrut</a>, the social structure of the town, liaison with the town's nobles, and control of the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bet_din.html" title="Bet din">Jewish court</a>.</p>
<p>Chasidic leaders included <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medzhibozh_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_07d5.html" title="Medzhibozh (Hasidic dynasty)">Rabbi Boruch of Medzhibozh</a> 1757-1811, the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov's</a> grandson. <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medzhibozh_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_07d5.html" title="Medzhibozh (Hasidic dynasty)">Rabbi Boruch</a> was notable for his principle of Malkhuyot (kingship), feeling that his family pedigree with the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov</a> entitled him to special treatment. He grew rich and powerful at the expense of his followers. Known for his "melancholy" (probably a mental illness) he had a fiery temper and was often irrational. His followers brought in <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hershel_of_Ostropol_efe9.html" title="Hershel of Ostropol">Hershel of Ostropol</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hershel_of_Ostropol_efe9.html" title="Hershel of Ostropol">Hershel</a> was one of the first documented Jewish comedians and his exploits are legendary within both the Jewish and non-Jewish communities. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hershel_of_Ostropol_efe9.html" title="Hershel of Ostropol">Hershel</a> is also buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhibozh, though his grave is unmarked.</p>
<p>Another Chasidic leader, <a href="../../../a/p/t/Apter_Rebbe_50d4.html" title="Apter Rebbe">Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heshel of Apt</a> (1748-1825)"The Apter Rebbe", made Medzhibozh home from 1813 until his death in 1825. He apparently filled the power vacuum left after <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medzhibozh_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_07d5.html" title="Medzhibozh (Hasidic dynasty)">Rabbi Boruch</a> had died. The <a href="../../../a/p/t/Apter_Rebbe_50d4.html" title="Apter Rebbe">Apter Rebbe</a> is also buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhibozh, very close to the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov's</a> grave. The Heshel family became one the foremost Chasidic rabbinic dynasties and various descendents remained as Medzhibozh rebbes well into the 20th century. This family took wives several times from the Friedman rabbinic family of the <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadigura_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_2c1a.html" title="Sadigura (Hasidic dynasty)">Sadigura Rebbe</a>. The famous American Rabbi and civil rights proponent, <a href="../../../h/e/s/Heschel.html" title="Heschel">Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel</a> (1907-1972) is a notable descendant.</p>
<p>The non-Chasidic rabbinic leadership of Medzhibozh was controlled by the Rapoport-Bick dynasty. Rabbi Dov Berish Rapoport (d. 1823) was the first to make Medzhibozh his home. He was the grandson of Rabbi Khaim haCohen Rapoport of Lvov (d. 1771), a notable sage during the mid 18th century. Dov Berish Rapoport's grave can be seen today at the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhibozh. Other rabbis of this dynasty include Rabbi Isaac Bick (1864-1934) who immigrated to America in 1925 and founded a synagogue in Rhode Island. Rabbi Chaim Yekhiel Mikhel Bick (1887-1964) was the last rabbi of any sect to reside in Medzhibozh. He left Medzhibozh for New York in 1925.</p>

<p>Medzhibozh was the home to at least two synagogue buildings and probably numerous small minyanim. One synagogue still stands today but is used for other purposes. It is a stone fortress-like building thought to be <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Sirkes_c050.html" title="Joel Sirkes">Rabbi Sirkes</a>' synagogue. The other synagogue, the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov's</a> old wooden synagogue, was torn down during World War II to use as firewood for the Jewish ghetto.</p>
<p>Medzhibozh also contains two Jewish cemeteries. The old Jewish cemetery contains the grave of the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov</a> and other famous and notable Jews. It has turned into something of a tourist attaction, a magnet for Chasidic Jews from all over the world. The new Jewish cemetery has graves from the early 1800s through to the 1980s. A Nazi mass killing site outside of town holds the graves of almost 3,000 Jews in 3 different trenches.</p>

<p>Today, Medzhibozh is dominated by a castle and fortifications built during the Polish period. Many of these fortifications are deteriorating, however inside the castle is a museum which describes some of the history of the area. The castle itself consists of four towers and overlooks the main road and the dam.</p>
<p>Just outside the castle, the dam and the lake are still in working order. Adjacent to the dam are two old mill buildings that are no longer used but used to be a valuable concession (arenda) during Tsarist and Polish times.</p>
<p>North of town is the old Jewish cemetery, which has turned into a tourist attraction primarily for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasidism.html" title="Chasidism">Chasidic</a> Jews making a pilgrimage to see the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov's</a> grave. Legend has it that this cemetery remained protected and well-preserved during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_war_II_a9a1.html" title="World war II">World War II</a> because the local Ukrainian population remembered the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov's</a> healing powers during his lifetime and they were afraid of his powerful magic even beyond the grave. The old Jewish cemetery contains a modern building over the graves of the important Jewish dignitaries. Other gravestones in this cemetery are worth visiting as the artwork on many stones shows a level of cultural achievement matching the rise of importance of the town. The oldest burial in this cemetery dates from 1555.</p>
<p>Toward the central western portion of town is the new Jewish cemetery, which is only in fair condition. Here Jews are buried from the early 1800s through modern times.</p>
<p>Outside of town to the west, and adjacent to the Yuzhny Bug river, is the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> mass killing site where approximately 3,000 Jews were buried. A monument marks the site. The three ravines that holds the graves are covered in concrete.</p>

<p>Carlos2earth 05:05, 28 December 2006 (UTC) During the anticommunist epoch of U.S history much attention was given by the American government to identifying and/or overthrowing foreign governments not party to the anti-communist effort. During the 1950's American Secretary of State John Foster Dulles participated in forming an alliance named Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which pledged to stop the spread of communism in the area.</p>
<p>Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, seeking to keep his country neutral, did not join SEATO, leading Dulles to believe Sihanouk was simpathetic to the communist cause (If they're not with us they're against us.) That set in motion CIA plots against Sihanouk.</p>
<p>During the early American intervention in Vietnam the CIA established contact with the plotting brother-in-law of Sihanouk, Lon Nol. Money was paid Lon Nol to fund a private army called the Khmer Serai, trained by American Special Forces in Vietnam with a "cover" they were there to aid the defense of South Vietnam, as hired mercenaries. The Khmer Serai did participate in combat missions against Viet Cong and NVA, but their primary purpose was to receive US military training.</p>
<p>The recruits were paid with CIA funds, with their American Special Forces advisors as conduits and paymasters. They were supplied the same US weapons and uniforms as other VN indigenous forces, and a red scarf distinguished them as Khmer Serai.</p>
<p>In 1970, as Prince Sihanouk vacationed in France, Lon Nol convened the National Assembly of Cambodia and Sihanouk was deposed, in a reportedly bloodless coup, with Lon Nol backed by his US-trained private army, the Khmer Serai.</p>
<p>In subsequent years Prince Sihanouk has rightfully claimed the coup that caused his overthrow was aided by the U.S. government, and of course American involvement is denied, particulary by Henry Kissenger of the Nixon Administration.</p>
<p>This writer was a member of A341 (Bu Dop), a US Army Special Forces advisory team, which trained and led Khmer Serai elements 1966-67. This is an attempt to correct the historical record of The American War in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-28_cd51.html" title="Edit section: Tantray">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tantray</span></h2>
<p>To understand the HISTORY behind TANTRAY we first have to go through the early HISTORY of KASHMIR itself.</p>
<p>The people who read the “RAJ TARANGEE” and “NEET MAT PURAN” know some of the first habitants of KASHMIR.</p>
<p>These books suggest that In the early days of KASHMIR it was a mountainous lake and its name was SATEE SAR (the origin of the name SATEE SAR are not known). A Pandit “KASHAP RISHI” gave way to the water of this lake and brought BRAHMANS and colonized them here.</p>
<p>According to my research studying the snow age maps 5000 year ago Kashmir was in SNOW AGE this explains prehistoric gigantic lake formations.</p>
<p>Brahmans used to stay here in summer and went back to lower lands of INDIA in winters. In those days Tribe named PSHACH and YAKSH are also living there, contrary to the Brahmans of Kashmir they stayed here for winters and went back to TIBET.</p>
<p>With the suggestion of “NEEL NAAG” the writer of NEEL MAT PURAN who also was the leader of Tribe JUNAAGON, Brahmans stated to give some gifts to the tribes of PSHACH and YAKSH, so that they do not attach their settlements. (Reason of that seems to be that YAKSH AND PSHACH attacked the JUNAAGON Tribe).</p>
<p>Due to this a event was originated in KASHMIRI BRAHMANS which is known as, KHICHREE MAOUS every year on 15th of POOS a moth in HINDU calendar (name originated from two words, KHICHREE an INDIAN cuisine made of RICE and other word AMAWAS which mean DARK NIGHT which is moonless night.) on this night food is prepared and placed in the windows of the houses for YAKHS people. Even now after thousands of years this event is carried on as it is.</p>
<p>It is a saying about YAKSH peoples that they where small height people with strong body.</p>
<p>Originated from these Tribes there are many nations and tribes which we can read in the book NEEL MAT PURAN which is oldest book on the habitants of the Kashmir. (Where as RAJ RARANGEE comes after it.) names written in these books are TANTRAY, DAR, AIKAG, NYATAK, MLEECH, SHUD, KHSH, BHATT, BHAKSH.</p>
<p>These nations not only attacked the RULERS but took on to BRAHMANS as well. Most of the people of these nations are Formers, Solders.</p>
<p>TANTRAY CASTE In the eyes of Kshmiri Brahmans the word TANTRAY comes from TANTER, TANTRIC or TANTRA which means the one who know magical words. Which seems to be the reason that in 1891s statistics on page 164 and 166 the castes which are written as Brahman Formers, Tantrays are written to be one of them.</p>
<p>But Sir Walter Laurence who was a commissioner and had a keen eye over Kashmiri casts and creeds says in his book “Valley of Kashmir” that Tantray are “Shatriya” warrior main case of Hindu Caste Tree and writes that they are among those nations who have blood of warriors in them.</p>
<p>Another write of Kashmiri History “Hassan” says same thing that they are warriors and strong and their occupation was agriculture.</p>
<p>Book: (History of Kashmiri Nations) the book says In Kashmiri History a Family Ruled Kashmir by the help of LON, DAR, TANTRAY, MAGUWAY and DANGAR.</p>
<p>According to RAJ TARANGEE its writer KALHAN suggests, “The old pronunciation of TANTRAY was TANTREEN or TANTRAN”. The good time of this nation was in (904 to 906) when a queen named SUGANDHA ruled Kashmir after RAJA GOPAL VARMAN (902 to 904) with the help of TANTRAY ARMY, when tried to extricate of their influence they kill her in (906).</p>
<p>In 1011 when RAJA AWCHAL / AUSACHAL wanting to break the influence of Tantrays in Army dismissed some high ranking officers of army they made such a conspiracy against him that he was killed in same year (1011)</p>
<p>In those years GRG CHANDAR DAMER was a king maker, his own caste was with him (DAMER) but Tantrays always worked as his right hand.</p>
<p>In the first rule of RAJA SASAL When great generals of the Army of GRG CHANDAR DAMER were killed fighting the royal army in (1112 to 1120) RAJA SASAL ran away to LOHAR (Punch), the elders of Kashmir took some serious suggestions from Tantray Elders for the next Kashmiri Ruler. All in all Tantray nation had their social and political importance in history of Kashmir, in the start of 1900 this caste has lost its place as a king maker caste among Kashmiri castes and is working only as farmers due to the brutal killings of rulers of Kashmir. As statistics suggest in 1891 the number of this caste were 5478, in 1911 they were 8056 and in 1931 (when the reference book was published) they were 12253 which can further be segregated as 6158 Men and 6095 Women.</p>

<p>The London ward of Vintry is bounded by Queen Victoria Street EC4, Cannon Street EC4, Queenhithe EC4 and Cousin Lane EC4. The ward has several large office complexes such as Thames Court, Vintners Place and Senator House and Walbrook Wharf (City Of London Corporation). The Vintners Hall, a Livery Company, is situated by Southwark Bridge. Mansion House Underground station is within the ward as well as a major trunk road, Upper Thames Street, which is managed by Transport for London.</p>
<p>The Ward was so named because of the Vintners (wine-merchants from Bordeaux, who settled on this part of the Thames' bank). They landed their wines here and were obliged to sell what they landed within forty days. In 1320 it was the second richest ward in the City, Dowgate being the richest. In Stow's time it contained four parish churches: St. Martin Vintry; St. James Garlickhithe; St. Michael Paternoster Royal; St. Thomas Apostle. Only St James and St Michael survive.</p>

<p>Originally intent on making it as an RNB solo artist El Pego enlisted the advice of Usher upon commencement of his quest for fame. He played a prominent role in the release of Confessions part 1 and 2 but afterwards had no further interaction with Usher citing creative differences as the reason for their falling out. After the split El Pego focused much of his artistic attention on developing his own personal mix of powerful vocals with humorous lyrics. On venturing towards this new path it was decided he should change his name to Ice Cube as it was felt this would engage more with his new audience. The move proved to be an astute one as he immediately found success with such recordings as"the boy who cried sheep", "your sister is much hotter than my sister" and the critically acclaimed "i don't eat any chips" under the supervision of Seamus Grealy. However his career took a turn for the worse with the circulation of rumours regarding"The Curse of El Pego", which still flow at present</p>

<p>Pham Ngu Lao was a native of Phu Ung village, Duong Hao district (currently belonging to An Thi district). He was born in 1255 and died in 1320.</p>
<p>Since he was small, he was agile and excellent in martial arts. In his essay "Notes taken on rainy days", Pham Dinh Ho described the meeting between him and Tran Hung Dao as followed:</p>
<p>On that day, Hung Dao Vuong and his entourage were heading for the royal capital. There was a man sitting by the side of the road weaving a basket. When the vanguards approached to clear the way, he continued sitting patiently as if he did not notice anyone. When they used their lances to stab him into his thigh, he continued sitting without stirring. Seeing that, Hung Dao Vuong stopped and asked him questions, he then answered that he was thinking of a sentence in a military manual, so he did not notice anything. Knowing that he was a talented man, Hung Dao Vuong let him sit with him in his palanquin and left for the royal capital. Since then, he became a special guest of Hung Dao Vuong, who had fondness for him and married off his daughter to him. He also recommended Pham Ngu Lao to the royal court. In the two resistance wars against the Nguyen invaders (1285-1288), Pham Ngu Lao made many contributions.</p>
<p>Under the reign of Tran Nhan Tong, he was in charge of the right back army. Under the reign of An Tong (in 1924), he followed Thuong Hoang to fight Ai Lao in Dao Long river.</p>
<p>He took the position of Kiem Nghiem general in 1298 and Than Ve general in 1299. In 1301, he defeated the Ai Lao troops in Muong Lai and was promoted to Than Ve chief general. Under the reign of Minh Tong, in 1318, Chiem Thanh army staged an invasion; he led the army to defeat the enemy. He died in 1320 at the age of 66. The king ordered a five-day recess of court to mourn over him.</p>
<p>Pham Ngu Lao is an excellent army general who trained his troops with strict disciplines. His career was renowned in the Tran dynasty. As Pham Ngu Lao's military career, wherever his troops came, their enemies were frightened. Pham Dinh Ho wrote about Pham Ngu Lao as followed: “When alive, Pham Ngu Lao was a chief general. When he died, he was titled a good genius. A temple of his worship was set up to replace his own house. He had a famous poem:</p>
<p>Hoành sóc giang sơn cáp kỷ thu Tam quân kỳ hổ khí thôn Ngưu Nam nhi vị liễu công danh trái Tu thính nhân gian thuyết Vũ Hầu.</p>
<p>(Practicing lance-dancing throughout the longevity of the country The army was strong enough to swallow the Buffalo star As a man, I have not completed my position and fame I am ashamed when listening to the story of Vu Hau)</p>
<p>This poem was evidence of his strong mettle.”</p>
<p>Pham Ngu Lao’s works include:</p>
<p>Thuat hoai (extracted from Viet’s full poem collections). Funeral oration for Hung Dao Vuong (a god story of Phu Ung commune)</p>

<p><b>The Elderberries</b> is an Anglo rock group situated in France. The group is composed of 5 members, hailing from different international locations. Their main influences include Led Zeppelin, Iggy Pop, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and The Ramones, as well as more contemporary groups such as The Hellacopters, The Hives, or The Mooney Suzuki. The Group is comprised of:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Chris Boulton</b>, English, Lead Vocals</li>
<li><b>Ryan Sutton</b>, Canadian, Lead Guitars and Backing Vocals</li>
<li><b>Jamie Pope</b>, English, Bass and Backing Vocals</li>
<li><b>Tom Pope</b>, English, Rythym or Lead Guitars and Backing Vocals</li>
<li><b>Yann Clavaizole</b>, French, Percussions</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Releases by the group include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Double Demons</b> (Single + B-Side, 2004)</li>
<li><b>The Little House</b> (4 Song EP, 2005-2006)</li>
<li><b>Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained</b> (Album To Be Released, 2007)</li>
<li><b>Soundtrack to Hellphone</b> (Film Sountrack To Be Released, 2007)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The founding members first met in September 2002. Originally the group played without a drummer, yet had a natural percussion to them. After playing two concerts with the existing lineup, on oppurtunity presented itself in the form of Yann, an aspiring drummer. The group decided to let him in. After joining the band, it was revealed that Yann was in fact the son of Producer/Musician <b>Denis Clavazole</b> (of <b>Daniel Darc</b> and <b>Jean-Louis Murat</b> fame). The expertise of Denis came as help to the band, serving as a guiding light to help focus the band's creative element, without ever controling it. Over the span of 4 years the band wrote over 40 songs, recorded a single, an EP, and an album. Early March 2007 should mark the release of The Elderberries debut album, <b>Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained</b>, featuring artwork by <b>Chuck Sperry</b>. The band is appreciated not only for its relentless rock, but also it's youth (The majority of the band being only 16 at the release of its first single), and their charm. Other aspects of the band may be found to be appealing, such as the presence of family (Jamie and Tom being brothers, much like Angus and Malcom Young of AC/DC), and the seemingly endless supply of good songwriting.</p>
<p>The Elderberries have also worked on some soundtracks, notably a Quicksilver DVD, and recently the next big French release, <b>Hellphone</b>. The Elderberries were also voted 30 points in advance in the Printemps de Bourges selection of 2005-2006. They have played over 80 concerts to date (December 2006), including numerous concerts with <b>The Datsuns</b> and <b>Kill The Young</b> (the latter being very good friends with the band).</p>
