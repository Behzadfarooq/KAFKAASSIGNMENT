<p>Unencyclopedic, Wikipedia is not a directory (WP:NOT). Detailed information such as this can not be easily maintained as bus routes and frequencies change. Information on the areas served by buses should be on a general page such as Buses in London, with a link to detailed information of bus timetables etc that is readily available from the Transport for London's website <a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrHarper_12cb.html" title="User:MrHarper">MrHarper</a> 22:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep:</b> These articles provide an insight not just to where they are now, but where they have been. It is common knowledge bus routes are changing but this adds to the history. I think the bus routes are not really showing to be timetables either and are constantly expanded. Also, in what way are they directories? They do not show adresses and contact numbers or any other similar info. Those are not my only reasons.<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 23:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It is a good index for the route articles (which have themselves survived AFD). Furthermore, the information is not set out in the style of a timetable (which may be cited as criterion for deletion); instead it shows which operators control the various routes and their scope (start and end points). The information, in this format, is not available elsewhere. Mrsteviec 07:46, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> London bus routes do not change that often, and this list, with just start and end points, is not that detailed making it easy to maintain. It does not contain frequencies as mentioned in the deletion request. It is an efficient way of presenting information not available in this format from the TfL website. How exactly would "Information on the areas served by buses should be on a general page such as Buses in London" work? Sounds like one very long and complicated page to replace a simple, easily used (and maintained) list. <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPage94_2518.html" title="User:Page94">Page94</a> 10:30, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> - Most of the article seems to simply be a directory of unverified and (possibly) non-notable facts, which has presumably been sourced directly from bus timetables. If that was all there was, then I'd recommend deleting the article for breaching <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in several ways (mere collection of public doman material, directory, indiscriminate information). <i>However, a part of the article is a list of links to articles.</i> The linked articles have recently survived the deletion process (see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_London_Buses_route_1_5c19.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/London Buses route 1">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/London Buses route 1</a>, though it is worth noting that despite that AFD those articles still all look to be OR), so can be regarded for the sake of this AFD as valid articles. So while I think that this sort of article shouldn't normally belong on Wikipedia, as <i>this article</i> is a valid list, linking to a large number of articles, it should be kept. It's also worth noting that it, and all the bus route articles, are in need of some references. Hopefully this AFD process will motivate someone familiar with the subject to reference these articles. --<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 22:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> as has been stated earlier, the bus routes in London do not change very often. Also the fact that the article <i>is</i> up-to-date and has continuously been so shows that your assumption that it cannot be kept up-to-date is wrong. There are many articles that most people would not even consider deleting that are not being kept up-to-date (e.g. <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva_2200.html" title="Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> (President of Brazil), <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Air_66fc.html" title="Ryan Air">Ryan Air</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29%2C_2003.html" title="September 29, 2003">September 29, 2003</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republika_Srpska_295d.html" title="Republika Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> all contain the phrase "expected in 2005" used in the future tense). <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 03:55, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This isn't a timetable, it's a useful compendium of routes, along with links to dozens (hundreds?) of related articles. Could be further enhanced by adding historical routes now discontinued, as has been done in similar articles. While this information may seem trivial to some, it is useful to others, and doesn't detract from the project. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 08:07, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Another <b>comment</b>. As I mentioned above, keeping it "up to date" shouldn't be the issue. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory. If something is worthy of being included in Wikipedia it doesn't matter if that thing is active or not (for example we have articles on topics such as <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>, even though those things do not exist today).

<li><b>Keep</b>. The London bus route structure has been remarkably stable, and we have been able to have articles on individual routes because of it.
