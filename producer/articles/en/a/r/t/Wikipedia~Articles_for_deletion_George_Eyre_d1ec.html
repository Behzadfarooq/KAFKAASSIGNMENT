<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b> Leroy Heller, Franklin Pierce Heller and Anne Eyre Heller for lack of notability and verifiable, reliable sources.

<p>This is a series of artilces related to Leader of the Eyre/Heller Dynasty in the United States (also see associated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Leader_of_the_Eyre_Heller_Dynasty_in_the_United_States_139c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Leader of the Eyre/Heller Dynasty in the United States">AfD</a>). Basically, this seems to be a chunk of geneology research. Hard poking at the references yield nothing. I noted that there's a castle eyre, but then again, there's a castle Breitenstein sitting in Europe too, but there's no article on that. The thought of a hoax comes to mind, but its probably more likely, as I said, geneology research. I really can't find anything special, nor can I find substantiated evidence beyond the wikipedia articles of any sort of <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty.html" title="Dynasty">dynasty</a>. Its just a family line. However, if someone can actually clinch the existance of a serious power-management dynastic old-money family that existed under these names, I will happy withdraw this nomination. In point:</p>

<p>Okay, this:</p>
<p>Title: Business papers, 1795-1847 (bulk 1800-1805). Description: 720 items. Notes: Manuel Eyre, a Philadelphia merchant of Quaker ancestry, was born in 1777. His father, Manuel Eyre, Sr., [take note, as this man was the subject of one of my articles] (1736-1805) was a shipwright in Kensington and a colonel in the Contintental Army. He obtained his training in the counting house of Henry Pratt and Abraham Kintzing and in 1803 joined with Charles Massey, Jr., (b. 1778) to form the mercantile firm of Eyre &amp; Massey, a partnership that lasted until Eyre's death in 1845. The firm of Eyre &amp; Massey owned over 20 vessels, ranging in size from ships to sloops, and traded around the world, mounting voyages to Europe, the Caribbean, South America, China, India and the Pacific Islands. Manuel Eyre also served on the Philadelphia City Council and was a founding director of the Schuylkill Navigation Company (1816) and the Second Bank of the United States (1816). After 1820 he gradually retired from active trading and devoted much of his time to agriculture. He owned two farms outside the city and three in Delaware. He was the founder of Delaware City, Del., at the mouth of the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal, buying the entire site in 1828, erecting public buildings and dividing it into lots.</p>

<p>This:</p>
<p>Mr. Rumsey says in page 2, "That in the month of September, 1781 he exhibited the model of a Boat to his Excellency General Washington at Bath in Berkeley County, calculated for stemming the current of rapid rivers only constructed on principles very different from (his) present one&#160;; satisfied of the experiment of her making way against a rapid stream by the force of the stream the General was pleased to give me a most ample certificate of her efficacy." Here it is to be observed, that no mention was made to General Washington of steam at the time of such exhibition&#160;; the principles on which the Boat was propelled, were entirely unconnected with, and distinct from steam; being simply a model propelled by water wheels, cranks, and setting poles&#160;; a mode which was many years ago tried on the river Schuylkill by a farmer near Reading, but without success. From an exhibition of this plan it was that Mr. Rumsey procured the certificate from General Washington, and on that certificate were Mr. Rumsey's laws founded. In his petitions to the several legislatures, he prayed for no exclusive right, for the use of Steam Boats; neither did be make mention of Steam, to their committees; or even suggest an idea of the kind; as proof of which, I offer the following petition to the Assembly of Pennsylvania the certificate from General Washington, accompanying it, and the certificate of Manuel Eyre, Esquire, who was one of the committee of Assembly, who reported in Mr. Rumsey's- favor.</p>

<p>This:</p>
<p>The same day the Navy Board recommended to Council that as there were reasons to believe that some vessels of the English fleet would attempt to approach the city, a certain number of persons should be assigned to flood Hog Island, and that ninety or one hundred men should garrison the fort at Darby Creek. Council requested the Navy Board to see to the flooding of the Island, and ordered a company of artillery and a company of "Musqueters," under the command of Col. Jehu Eyre, to the works at Darby Creek.</p>

<p>Since its founding, the cemetery has had a self-perpetuating board of trustees to look over its affairs. The board has included such notables as the Emmanuel and Jehu Eyre, shipbuilders to the Continental Navy. The board of trustees has kept the cemetery independent over all these years and has also withstood an attempt by a local church to usurp it.</p>

<p>This: When the Revolution broke out in 1775, Hewson organized a company of volunteers from his own Kensington workmen and served as their Captain. He was joined in this patriotic response by the shipwright Jehu Eyre, who captained his own ship carpenters, workmen, and apprentices in the "Kensington Artillery." The Eyre shipyards at the foot of Columbia Avenue hastily constructed thirteen gondolas and galleys for use in the defense of the city.</p>

<p>This: Manuel Eyre built the first gun-boat for the Government. It was launched at Philadelphia, July 26, 1775, and was called the “Bull Dog.” He organized his workmen into a company of minute men and commanded them at Trenton and Princeton. When he was selected by the Council of Safety as a member of the Navy Board, his company was merged into that of his brother Jehu.</p>

<dd>Oh Crusader for Truth! (uh... given your hardline keepist stance, don't you find your chosen <i>nom de guerre</i> a bit of an ironic drag on your general thrust?), where do you get the idea that the early US government (I think you mean the Continental Congress, but lets not nitpick) was kept afloat by the Eyres? The $6,032 claim is completely unsourced and the claim on the Jehu Eyre page that this amount is worth $1.8bn today is grossly inflated and misleading (its more like $85,000 - see my comment on the Jehu Eyre talk page). You do realize that Wikipedia attracts all kind of unreliable and sometimes deliberately hoax material every day? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:58, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The family remained wealthy and powerful long after the Revolution, retaining its political sway until 1929 and its monetary strength until 1934. The Revolution was important in establishing the Eyre family, but it was not the defining event of the dynasty. The Heller family was itself enormously wealthy (which is the main reason that Anne Eyre Heller and Franklin Pierce Heller are significant in their own right). George Eyre was the first member of the family to live in what was then the American Colonies, which makes him noteworthy as the family's American founder. And, of course, Leroy Heller saw the downfall of Eyre/Heller might, which makes him highly important.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will soon be posting sources about the Hellers. I ask that you give me time, and please also look at the Articles for Deletion for Leader of the Eyre/Heller Dynasty in the United States.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Eyre Empire was one of the first articles I ever debated on Wikipedia. I supported it enthusiastically then, and, while I have since had reservations about some of the material contained therein, I still stand by the essence of the piece, which stated that a family of greatly powerful patricians existed in this country that played a pivotal role in the Revolution, the Civil War, and later financial developments in American history. I hope that everyone will please actually read the sources that I provided. The reaction of some members leads me to believe that that has not been happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eyre Empire first sparked a deep interest in this family for me, and led me to do extensive research and then write the articles now up for deletion themselves. I worked quite hard, scoured the Internet, went to various libraries, and even spoke with several descendants of the family.</p>
<p>As an American patriot (some would so jingoistic, though I disagree with them), I think that the Eyre and Hellers ought to be hailed as individual heroes, and that, as a group, they should be recognized for the tremendous influence that they have had in forming and then helping to lead the greatest nation in the history of the world.</p>
<p>The United States is the single most wondrous power that the world has or ever will see, a beacon of freedom that has stood as a symbol of hope in the hearts of millions of immigrants for centuries, has been almost solely responsible for the salvation of democracy (through heroic struggles in World Wars I and II and in the Cold War), has defined the very idea of modern liberal government and human rights, and remains the world's brightest light in the dark.</p>
<p>America has given millions not only the reality of freedom, but has granted the people of Earth the very conception of liberty. The idea itself was a mere fantasy to the thinkers of the Enlightenment, trapped as they were in their Absolutist kingdoms. The American Revolution and the subsequent establishment of our Constitutional system showed legions of oppressed, impoverished wretches everywhere that freedom was not a myth but something that could be achieved.</p>
<p>The French Revolution of 1789 was directly inspired by its American predecessor, as have countless other liberal revolts throughout history. And without the selfless sacrifices made by Jehu Eyre and his kin, none of that would have been possible. The influenc of this family on world history is incalculable.</p>
<p>His descendants went on to continue contributing to the American Republic, finally reaching their ignominious end in 1929 under the disastrous leadership of Leroy Heller (a historical figure who, the more I learn about, the less I like). For two hundred years, from their arrival in 1727 to their ultimate collapse in 1929 (and/or 1934), they were one of America's greatest and riches families. They founded cities (Delaware City, Hellertown), established banks (Second Bank of the United States, which a Heller still sits on today), fought in wars (the Spanish-American War, the Civil War), and maintained a position as an economic powerhouse (Eyre/Heller shipping yards and trading companies in Philadelphia). All of thi points to a highly significant family deserving of the articles I have written about them.</p>
