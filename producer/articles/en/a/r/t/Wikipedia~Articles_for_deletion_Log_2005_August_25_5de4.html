<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b>. All of the rename suggestions have been redirected back to the original title, so I'll not move it (and there's no gathering around any one name here anyway). -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 00:14, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The lead of the article pretty well sums up the reasons for why the list should be deleted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nation-building is a long evolutionary process. It is therefore practically impossible to come up with a single date for a nation's "birth".</li>
<li>The following list is mainly based on data published by the CIA, and is therefore restricted to nations whose independence is recognised by the USA.</li>
<li>The situation is futher complicated by the confusion between the terms nation (genereally considered an ethnic or cultural grouping) and state (an independent political entity).</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no way to make this list useful, let alone NPOV. What makes it particularily biased is the chronological order which suggests that some nations are "older" than others. Still, many nations are listed more than once, with different dates.</p>
<p>I know many people have put considerable effort into the development of this list, but this cannot be an excuse for keeping a useless and biased article on WP. ‚Äì&#160;<a href="../../../k/p/a/User%7EKpalion_93cc.html" title="User:Kpalion">Kpalion</a> <a href="../../../k/p/a/User_talk%7EKpalion_7aef.html" title="User talk:Kpalion">(talk)</a> 00:16, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful and informative. As for your objections:
<ol>
<li>Yes, it certainly is. That's why several nations are listed with more than one date. I consider it very appropriate.</li>
<li>Since creation of this list, it has been greatly expanded with data from other sources. Btw, "nations whose independence is recognised by the USA" is pretty much the same as "nations whose independence is recognized by some country", with Northern Cyprus, Palestine, Taiwan, and Western Sahara being the only contemporary exceptions I can think of.</li>
<li>This is a purely technical issue, that can be solved by rewording the introduction, or perhaps renaming the article.</li>

<li>No, it's no good either. I'm afraid you can't escape a US-centric perspective. Nationhood or statehood not always equals independence. Many countries have existed since times immemorial but later lost and regained independence. For instance, Poland has existed since mid-10th century and the traditional date of Poland's statehood is 966. But because Poland was partitioned in the late 18th century and regained sovereignty after WW1, the date of independence is November 11, 1918. Poland's just an example, there are many more countries with similar histories. Perhaps, if the list is to stay (as it clearly is) it might be good to split it into (at least) to lists: one for countries by date of nationhood, and one for countries by (most recently regained) independence. The US, then, would be near the bottom of the former, and near the top of the latter. ‚Äì&#160;<a href="../../../k/p/a/User%7EKpalion_93cc.html" title="User:Kpalion">Kpalion</a> <a href="../../../k/p/a/User_talk%7EKpalion_7aef.html" title="User talk:Kpalion">(talk)</a> 17:33, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>O.K., I'm going to start with the problems one by one. The problem of <i>why shouldn't I redirect/move a VfD page</i> is dealt with in both <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a>, an article you should have read before voting on a VfD, and in <a href="../../../p/e/d/User_talk%7EPedroPVZ_5c0b.html#List_of_countries_by_date_of_nationhood_VfD" title="User talk:PedroPVZ">the message I left you on your talk page</a>. Problem 2 is that moving this article is somewhat contentious and is not an opinion shared by the majority, some people want it moved to a different place, AND the title your moved it to is misspelled (capitalized "independence") and is disagreed with for various reasons. Your going ahead and moving it anyway shows a lack of respect for other's opinions. I also mentioned this on your talk page. Problem 3 is that you lied and said that you didn't know it was in VfD (three posts up), and when I called you on it, you said, "so what? It should be redirected again," which I take to mean that you don't paticularly care for the opinions of others, and that you didn't bother to read my message, which is what talk pages are for, or <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> and <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This VFD crap is getting ridiculous and abused. If it passes this VfD, I request that the page be protected. BTW, I'd admit it up front before some idiot slanders me. I'm a member of SDN, true. But I've also been on Wiki for a full year and have made about 76 edits in all. I just don't post a lot. If you ever find me on SDN you will also notice the number of posts as being disproportionately low to the time I've been a member (continued below).</li>
</ul>

<dd>This will be the 77th and the first I bothered to waste on a VfD. The website it describes is a <b>cardinal</b> one in the STvsSW debate on par with the SWTC (which no one tries to delete so far, I think) and the USVSD (which AFAIK does not have its own article here). Since we decided to have a STvsSW debate article, the discussion of the topic would hardly be complete without a strong mention of this site. The article should be <b>expanded</b>, not deleted (continued).</dd>

<li><b>Keep and Protect</b> I have carefully examined the guidelines that recommend against vanity pages at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines</a> in comparision to the page in question. Stardestroyer.net has a large amount of information on technology used in the two fictional universes, as well as some information on general science issues. Given the popularity of these two franchises (how many Americans don't know who Darth Vader and Captain Kirk are?), this information would likely be of interest to many. This site can also be a rough environment for those just entering, and some forewarning is appropriate. I myself do not like the environment present at the site, and do not participate in the forum there whatsoever. However, the philosophy behind wikipedia is free access to information, even about topics we find disagreeable. If SD.net is controversial, then its article should be edited to ensure impartiaility, not deleted - an activity practiced extensively in that page. As for my use of Wikipedia, I browse it frequently, but I seldom edit, for I usually find the author has adequately covered the subject, and any additional information is unnecessary. <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaPaladin_6b9d.html" title="User:OmegaPaladin">OmegaPaladin</a> 07:16, 28 August 2005 (UTC) <small>New votes go at the bottom. <i>My apologies - OmegaPaladin</i> This user has 7 edits. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 09:10, August 28, 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>Sigh. More silliness that can't be speedied. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">‚òØ</font></a> 01:55, 2005 August 25 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is silly, as is much of the cultural heft that needs to be cataloged. The question is not whether it is silly or not but whether, first, if it is legitimate, which is appears to be, and second, whether it is large enough to warrant inclusion into Wikipedia. Now, granted, this thing's not getting as many hits as the Flying Spaghetti Monster (Nor is it pertinent to a particularly tawdry current affair) but it is something. As a historian, I have to say the worst part of studying primary sources is when the writer neglected to include information because, at the time, it was considered inconsequential to him. I say include it, until the Jamoombas of the world are overloading Wikipedia, at which point, if it becomes an issue of performance, then consider it for deletion. Were this a self-aggrandizing personal page or simply an attempt to create such a cultural indicator by seeding it within Wikipedia, then I'd be in favor of deleting. Otherwise, why expend so much effort to point out that a silly thing is silly.</p>

<p>Nonnotable apartment building. Advertising. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 06:25, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not advertising. I live in them. Altitude is a apartment block for students to live in and it would be nice if there is a record of the people who have ran it, any notable events that take place there, and what the place is like, so that one day we can lookback and see the history of the building. Do you propose that we delete en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ormond_College_(University_of_Melbourne), en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ's_College,_Cambridge etc.... I realize that Altitude is newish, as in the last couple of years, but it would still be nice to keep a history of the place on wikipedia. Well, I don't really know how this voting system works, but it would be nice to keep the Altitude at Taringa Apartments page. Just my two cents.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A place where students live is not notable. Where did I even suggest deleting the University pages? You're making strawman arguments. Please explain what makes this apartment building more important than any other apartment building in the world. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 07:00, August 25, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I guess I misunderstand the concept of Wikipedia. The building is not notable as you correctly state. So it should be deleted if this is one of the criteria for deletion. What about the fact that it is not advertising, does this have a higher weighting over "non notable"? For future reference, can you please direct me to where to look to understand if something fits the criteria to be added to Wikipedia. Many thanks for your kind help in getting me started in Wikipedia and telling me what is acceptable to add to it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks Sdedeo. If you are wondering why I'm trying to get you to give a valid reason for deleting this entry, please refer to the wiki guidelines on VfD. You see, this isn't a vote, so my alleged "sock-puppeting" and your de-facto sock-puppeting (reposting what another user has said without adding any insight of your own) don't matter at all; it's all what is brought to the table.Octagon 17:10, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thanks Sdedeo. I draw your attention to the definition of the word "alleged." Basically, it means "described as but not proved," In other words, I did not admit to sock-puppeting, which would have been rediculous because I am quite a different person from whoever wrote this article. Give me a method, I will gladly prove it. My frustration is with your inability to cite where this entry is in violation of wiki's generally accepted guidelines, and your inisitence to vote against it because you consider it not "notable."Octagon 17:30, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Phillipian newspaper exists, I'm just not sure about those individual articles. By any chance, does the gentleman with the sockpuppets have a copy he can scan so that we can see it?

<li><b>Comment</b>. ] I just want to deal briefly with accusations of "sockpuppetry" (I just looked that phrase up and realized what you all were talking about. I am not a creation of the author of this article, nor have a posted on wikipedia before. sorry. I happen to know the author of this entry in the real world (god forbid), and was directed to this vote by him ("yo, I just wrote this wiki-entry, and people are trying to delete it"). I realize that there is no way to proves this, but I don't really care, you can choose to beleive me if you like. I am not deeply invested in wikipedia, nor am I well versed in meta-wiki terminology, but that does'nt necessarily invalidate my argument. I was pretty surprised to find that there were self-appointed wiki-censors, or self-styled guardians of the gates of knowledge who presume to know what others should and should not be able to read about on wikipedia. That's absurd. I understand that there has to be a certain level of quality control, but I think that once offensiveness, bias and errors have been eliminated from an entry, there's pretty much no reason to delete it. And I do not see anyone here arguing that this entry is plagued by any of those three things. Additionally, I doubt that this entry in particular is more frivolous than any number on wikipedia ("sock puppet," for example). I know that I learned some from reading it...nothing earth-shattering, but it was interesting enough for me to read the whole thing. Also, if, as opposed to asking people to vote (which is legit) the author was using sockpuppets, why would this vote be close at all?.[[User:GaelClichy|GaelClichy]

<dd><b>Comment:</b> People asked to vote by the author are called <b>meat puppets</b>- they're real people, but they have the same effect as sockpuppets. The question is really about whether or not this particular entry can be independently verified (please, someone, anyone, put those scans on their user page and let us see them), and whether it is important enough to cover- because although we aren't a paer encyclopedia, our server space is finite.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 19:58, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> to the user(s) supporting this page, being free of bias and errors are not the only qualifications an article must pass to be considered worthy of being on Wikipedia, it must also prove itself notable enough. I could write an article about the mailbox down my street and it would be verifiable, and free of bias/errors but it would be nowhere near worthy-enough to be on Wiki. This article is not notable enough, no one really knows about this except people who read The Phillipian which at most encompasses the Andover community. Secondly you criticize the VfD process for judging "what people should be allowed to see". Far from it, please feel free to host this information somewhere else on the internet and remember that anyone on Wikipedia (including yourself) is free to vote on VfD, however wiki also has certain standards to be met, notability being one. The reason we have people vote is because notability is highly subjective so the best way to determine what stays and what goes is the democratic process. And finally the reason you have been accused of sock puppetism is not because it was your first edit or because you supported the article but because of the manner in which you did both of those. I too made my de-lurking wiki "debut" the other day voting Keep on a VfD. I and my vote were accepted however because I made a case for why the article should stay. You on the other hand have really just argued that it is verifiable (not enough of a reason for the article to be kept) and have attacked not only other respected editors but the Wiki-process itself despite admitting you are new and have no real interest in Wikipedia. With that in mind please read our guidelines and join the community if youd like, but for now the article should be deleted. -ShadowStaller 02:46, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. First off, I want to apologize for not having read entirety of the wiikiipedia guidlines.

<p>Moving on, I have placed the cited articles for those of you who have requested them as proof on the web.

<p>I hope this helps the people who feel that this post is entirley nonsense. It is merley documenting a trend at the oldest secondary school newspaper in the United States. Not to mention it offers insight other than that of the TUB society, it adds to the schools history, explaining how there used to be societies at Phillips Academy, which where banned in 1950. The topic on secret societies has at Phillips Academy has also been thought to be interesting enough to merit their own chapter in "Youth from Every Quarter: A Bicentennial History of Phillips Academy, Andover" by Frederick S. Allis (Amazon link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0874511577/qid=1125030571/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-5077754-0876052?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0874511577/qid=1125030571/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-5077754-0876052?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0874511577/qid=1125030571/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-5077754-0876052?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846</a> ) This all being said after reading everyones posts I am still confused as to what exactly constitutes a "notable" secret society. The dilema I am having is that since they are all secret none of us really know anything except for what they have led us to believe. For all we know, other secret societies that have been listed on wikipedia are just social clubs that like to call themselves secret societies. We really do not know anything else about them except for that they care to share with the pulblic eye. T.U.B. could be several decades old, or a what is left of a public society that went secret on the decision of Hedmaster John Kemper in 1950. Also, I have found this article to be more complete than some of the other societies pages that are on wikipedia. The point is we only know what they have let us find out.</p>
<p>I am an alumni from Phillips Academy and I can tell you that most students would be interested in the information on the T.U.B. society, hence the reason the highly awared newspaper chose to write about it. I don't see the harm in keeping it as it is merely collecting the information that students have come across over various years on this society. Whether you find it notable or not is up to you, but I believe that a society that supposedly exists in a school that has been around since 1778, has been written about over three times in the past five years by the nations oldest secondary school newspaper, and is against the institutions rules has more than enough reasons to be documented by the wikipedia. 200.106.189.82 04:59, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The main problem as I see it is that TUB is a very young group (according to the Phillipean headline, "In Violation of School Policy, PA Group Forms Secret Society", 2000.) That students did something that broke a school's rules is not notable, even if the students attend a private school. In general, the criteria for secret societies should be a combination of longevity and notable members -- as of yet, the oldest members of this society have just graduated college. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 19:14, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Although this society does not have any notable alumni as of yet, societies at Andover have produced such notable characters as Henry Stimson and Preston, George and George W. Bush. Maybe not popular, but notable nonetheless. Although just any society at any school may not be deserving of wiki fame, a society in the tradition of long lasting secret brotherhoods (it was an AUV alumni that allegedly co-founded the Skull and Bones), and at a school that has matriculated Samuel Morse, Oliver Wendell Holmes, two presidents, two nephews of George Washington, and half of the Kennedy family arguably deserves a slice, albeit thin, of this presumably free exchange of information.Octagon 19:44, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Sdedeo, I would like to point out that the first encounter with the society was in 2000, this by no means confirms that this was the date the society was started. For all we know it could date back a couple of decades. Also, keep in mind that this is under the heading of secret societies, organizations which usually keep their membership and most other information private. This means that even if it did have notable members, we would not know about them. Therefore your standard of "a combination of longevity and notable members" is completley based on something that we do not know. This means your standard requires a secret society to make public their membership and their date of founding, two things most societies will not do. The author obviously chose to write only on the fact that he could reference from the school newspaper because it is the nature of the wikipedia to contain information that can be confirmed. I can tell you for a fact that the author left out the rumors that exist about this society, such as the story that they have members in the administration, they run all the clubs on campus, have society cars and a society house near by in Lawrence, MA. Basically, the point of the article is to start building information on this society which is not just rumor, which last time I checked was perfectly all right in the wikipedia. I don't mean to be petty or insulting but it is begining to seem that you are trying to try and remove this article for personal reasons rather than to keep the wikipedia free of unworthy information, because clearly this article has been written for the purpose to collect fact checked information that would otherwise be lost to an ill managed archvie of The Phillipian.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. See Samdupont &amp; Alf. Also, note- to claim that non-notability to a select audience is a basis for deletion rather than non-notability to the audience as a whole is unfair to those who do in fact find an article about a secret society notable, i.e. just because you don't care doesn't mean someone else doesn't. Phillips Academy is a school with enrollment of over 1100 students, and hundreds of faculty and staff. The references have been verified. Wikipedia is now a credible reference that consolidates the available information about something that pertains to at least 1500 people who are affiliated with the school at this moment, not to mention the hundreds that have passed through at least since its the year that it is supposed to have been founded. Obviously this is something notable to them, as they had multiple articles in their school newspaper. Will we deny them? Perhaps these people will have information to add. Wikipedia employs the same philosophy under its policy on stubs; not much information now, but with potential. <small>(Unsigned vote by PanteraCC09 (talk <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PanteraCC09_dba5.html" title="Special:Contributions/PanteraCC09">contribs</a>), first edit)</small></li>

<li>Well, 'music in zambia' (without quotes) gets over two million Google hits, so you'd expect at least a few of them to mention something about this band if it's 'very popular'. I strongly suspect it's a hoax, since it doesn't get any Google hits (except that there's apparently a 'Zambian Boys Choir' in <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>), it's been written by an anon user who specialises in hoaxes (see Medieval black metal and Jorma Himokas, for example), and the names of the purported band members are suspiciously close to Finnish words (eg 'Oiva Pera' means 'nice ass'). - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 12:59, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. We can only report information that's available elsewhere. Until someone can prove this project is in the planning or actually exists we can't accept an article about it. Likewise, with Juan himself: we need sources that say he's an artist. And 1000 meter towers would reach 1km into the sky. To my knowledge it's impossible to build that high.

<p>This list is not and has no potential to become encyclopedic. The concept of a "war hero" is inherently POV and, more often than not, dependent on specific cultural context. As such, this page is liable to become the breeding ground for edit wars. The page, at present, lists a somewhat random collection of soldiers without any apparent rhyme or reason. The page has lasted for at least eighteen months without the development or use of inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>I would argue that this is so because there is no possibility of developing a satsifactory system that would be both neutral and useful. For most people heroism is not simply the effective discharging of one's duty. It implies something special, something particularly daring. Yet the phrase "war hero" seems to generally connote any effective military leader. On that grounds, this list might contain thousands upon thousands of generals and admirals, with endless debates over whether each one is "heroic" or "considered heroic." Therein lies the other problem. Someone who is heroic for one group of people is anathema to another. The British might still consider <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Kitchener%2C_1st_Earl_Kitchener_d207.html" title="Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> a war hero, but to many people of Afrikaner descent he's a war criminal. Which is he? Depends on who you talk to.</p>
<p>Brings me to my last point. This list, as it stands, is original research. It's a compilation based on subjective criteria and value judgements, which cannot be independently verified. We aren't here to judge who's a hero and who's not. Now, the link at the bottom to recipients of the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a>‚Äì<i>that's</i> useful. That's a list of people that the British consider heroic. This is a list of people that members of the Wikipedia community consider heroic. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 10:32, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Let me suggest to the above two voters that what they really want is an article entitled "<a href="../../../w/a/r/War_hero.html" title="War hero">War hero</a>," which currently redirects to this list. At war hero there could be a discussion of what a war hero is, without attempting to create a list. This way, someone can read the discussed criteria and decide for themselves, who they think is a war hero. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 19:45, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I disagree with the above two votes. This can never be comprehensive or even consistent and therefore is inherently unencyclopedic. There is no standard for asserting someone is a war hero so who judges whom to include. Most of the soldiers who have died in Iraq are being called 'heroes'. Four Canadian soldiers who died in a friendly-fire accident in Afghanistan are referred to as heroes. Slaughtered Belgian Peacekeepers in Rwanda are considered Belgian heroes. None of these should really make this list - but <i>whose call is that going to be</i>? I say this should be tossed as a flawed enterprise. If it stays it should be renamed to List of people known as war heroes that we can think of with more to be added as they occur to us. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 16:58, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was keep. Note that I ignored "votes" which I interpreted to be either sarcastic, joking or, in one case, made by a suspected troll.</p>
<p>Two serious people explicitly asked for a "delete then redirect". The target is very similar to the version being nominated, convincing me that there was at least some content reuse. If so, we cannot delete this version without violating the attribution history requirements of GFDL.

<p>I first heard it during a talk at the UKUUG Linux Technical Conference in Swansea by Thomas Lange. I contacted Thomas to ask wether it was his idea. Here's his feedback</p>
<p>&gt; Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>&gt; I've been googling etc but can't find anythin.</p>
<p>&gt; Who actually coined the term "the 10th floor test"&#160;?</p>
<p>I know it from Steve Traugott, www.infrastructures.org how did some talks on this topic.</p>
<p>The fact that it isn't a Higly common IT-related term YET should not be a reason for deletion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kris, Wikipedia is not a primary source. We only report known and documented information and everything needs to be referenced or at least be possible to verify someohow. Since this term is not yet in common usage, there's no reliable third party resources on the subject. - 131.211.210.10 13:27, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is an almost exact analogue of the Stephen Hawking example in <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:verifiability</a>. Readers cannot verify something that is only mentioned in an unpublished electronic mail message whose very existence itself they only have a complete stranger's word for. If the conference has no record of proceedings that records the explanation of this concept, then it is unverifiable and does not belong here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:52:57, 2005-08-25 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this article because I was interested in Nodezilla, and the Wikipedia is a great place to collect NPOV information. Since I added a short stub other have come and put more into the article. If the article is not accurate (it's proprietary rather than open-source) we can fix that. I think they deserve an article because they claim to offer anonymous file-sharing. Personally I believe their method is flawed, but we can write about that. I also do not see a problem with Wikipedia containing articles about many pieces of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Software" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Software" rel="nofollow">software</a> of varying popularity. It has been cited before, and I shall cite it again <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="meta:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wiki is not paper</a>.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Brightorange and Yuckfoo. You can't make a category about songs which don't have articles, but a lot of them are notable and should have an article. Hence a list is currently the best option. Besides, if people look for a list of articles, they go to the main article space with our search, so that's where you should find it, not the category name space. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:04, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Roads are best described in images as they convey the geographical location much better than any writing ever could.

Why not suggest a WikiAtlas project to migrte all this stuff to? BTW, I've noticed roadcruft is extremely US, Canadian and Uk centric.

<p>The result of the debate was keep. However, the form of "keep" is in doubt. There were some excellent arguments raised in favor of keeping this only as a redirect or as a merge and redirect (to preserve GFDL). Consensus was not reached on that recommendation.

<li><b>Keep</b> it's a very famous photo, and a groundbreaking point in photo journalism. Redirecting to the man misses the point. Furthermore, if you merge it with something, is it with the article on the general, <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen_Ngoc_Loan_5afa.html" title="Nguyen Ngoc Loan">Nguyen Ngoc Loan</a>, or the one on <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Adams_%28photographer%29_daff.html" title="Eddie Adams (photographer)">Eddie Adams (photographer)</a> the photographer? You're going to end up with a lot of duplicate information in either case.

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 14 opinions to "delete" (2 anon or very new users discounted), 6 opinions to "keep as is" (3 anon or very new users and one known troll discounted) and 4 that appear to prefer "keep as merge". While the community's opinion on the claim of "original research" remained ambiguous, I will note that the samples presented of specific outside sources were successfully rebutted.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a decision that this content should not remain as an independent article. However, there is not the overwhelming consensus necessary to delete the content. Despite arguments and counter-arguments, conflicting opinions continued to be added to the discussion. I am going to call this as a "no consensus" decision.</p>
<p>However, noting that the content was originally part of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly_%28television_series%29.html" title="Firefly (television series)">Firefly (television series)</a> article, I am going to place a copy of the content on that article's Talk page, redirect this article there (to preserve GFDL) and ask the editor/readers of that article to make the final determination of the use or removal of this text. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:54, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The first and third links have persons unfamiliar with the series making this comparison, then being corrected by people that have actually seen all of the series. In the second link a person made the comparison, but after being chastised said "I was being slightly facetious." The fourth involved someone claiming Whedon plagiarized Outlaw Star, which I doubt a fan of Firefly would say seriously. The fifth mostly seemed to be people insulting the show, including comparisons to Outlaw Star, Trigun, and Cowboy Bebop. The sixth link seems to have involved persons who were not fans, and did not seem very familiar with the show. The seventh is a Wikipedia mirror. On the last page you linked to, the comparison was only made before the person watched the show, and I did check the other five pages of the thread to see if it was mentioned later. These links only show that a few persons on the internet that are unfamiliar with, uninterested in, or dislike the show have made comparisons to other Sci-Fi/Western shows like Outlaw Star, Trigun, and Cowboy Bebop, which does not justify this page's existence. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethoeph_fb67.html" title="User:Sethoeph">Sethoeph</a> 03:47, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

I don't think it's necessary to explore it at great length. (These are not exactly brilliant deductions. They are in fact fairly obvious.) As an individual article I feel that it's more of a fan essay than an encyclopedia article. It would make a wonderful article on a fansite. Perhaps such an article (on a reputable, well-established fansite) would make a useful external link. I happen not to think it merits coverage as an encyclopedia article.

<dd>Key word being "discussing". Wikipedia is not a venue for opinion, which this article strongly implies; the opinion being that there is some sort of connection between the two series. Otherwise, why create the article, besides to report on people's beliefs (which this article fails to do so)? Still otherwise, articles for the sake of comparsion are inane. George W. Bush and Willaim Clinton have netural-colored hair, were presidents at one time in their lives, have wives, wear suits, and lives/lived in the White House! Let's make a article that details every aspect of their lives that are the same! No. I can be swayed by the fact that it's believed by many people, but the article isn't written like that. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 04:45, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. The comparison is well-known in fandom in a way that 'George Bush and Hulk Hogan' is not, and while in some literal sense it's original research, so is just about any popular culture article. However, much of it is ridiculous. There are genuine points of similarity between the series like the "space western" setting, the girl in a box, and the Chinese influence. These are enough that people have noticed them--and then grasped at straws in their search for more. Elements like a musclebound warrior and a mystic, which can be found in almost any series, are not reasonable as similarities between the two shows. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 21:40, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the refurbished article is no original research according to whats said on original research: "In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims that are easily verifiable by any reasonable adult, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources." I have to note, that I found this page only because i was interested in the article (as a firefly fan, searching for crossreferences) and it gave useful knowledge to me. It says in which points the two shows in question have things in common. Just stating facts resulting from the original film material (primary source), nothing more nothing less. Offering facts to the user i thought is the aim wikipedia has. Crossreferencing between entrys is a thing lacking as much as it's necessary to get a view on a topic in its whole width when you doing a research via wikipedia (I'am not speaking of linking from Lincoln to every other "President of USA"-Entry). Linking to similar things is the lowest level of crossreferencing. Declaring on what facts a crossreference is build on is a true help when you wan't to find out about the value of a crossreference. As I saw the crossreferences on Firefly article to other shows, I asked me why are they crossreferenced and where are the relations. This article gave me the understanding of that. So besides from passing the wikipedia guidelines on original research, this article was a chance of getting the knowledge (not an speculation) on which facts the crossreference of Firefly and Outlaw Star (I heard of before) is based on.

<li>I wasn't sure whether your nomination was "odd character" (which by the way looks fine on Firefox and Mozilla too, though IE5:Mac won't deal with it at all) or "article about a single letter". If the latter I'd say 'keep', if the former, Arenel has a good point, but searching for the article would be a bit tedious if your browser wouldn't allow you to input the character. <s>81.153.185.255 21:50, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</s> <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b6/Pentacle.svg/15px-Pentacle.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" /></a>&#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 21:51, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Mate, I wasn't objecting to this because it's not pop culture; I know WP has medicine in it. I was objecting to it because it's not a common enough medical procedure to warrant an article here. There does seem to be a condition called a "tethered spinal cord," which (from what I can tell) is a kind of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spina_bifida.html" title="Spina bifida">spina bifida</a>. If there's someone who knows spinal procedures well enough to comment on it more than this article says, maybe it could be put into the spina bifida article. Otherwise, it's just an unheard of medical procedure. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackcap.html" title="Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 22:13, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable gameshow contestant. No Big Brother contestant should have an article about themself unless there is something notable about them other than their appearance on the show.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Any Big Brother contestant that anyone wants to take the time to write a bio page for should be allowed a page. Many other contestants have them and they seem to do no harm and indeed are informative. Ms. Vasquez is also an actress and a dancer for the Dallas Desperado's. That the article is being frequently updated would show to me that there is at least some interest in her. Some of what I believe Zoe refers to as personal attacks are facts about the subject that some might find unpleasant. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFiredrake_f9df.html" title="User:Firedrake">Firedrake</a> 23:04, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Look, personal attacks will not help this. IPs starting with 200 are quite common in Chile, so your assetions that we are the same people are COMPLETELY FALSE. Your assertion that 200.73.82.173 "went on" to vandalize "several pages" is blatantly FALSE.

<li><b>Keep</b>. These things are facts that are reported in the newspapers. Maybe it should be heavily edited, but the fact remains: it should be kept. Two major Chilean newspapes, El Mercurio and LAS ULTIMAS NOTICIAS (see talk page for links), have decided to put this in the front page (the latter actually occupied the whole front page with an image of Bachelet). Additionally, this came at the same time Bachelet's daughter suffered a car crush while she was riding drunk, and some analysts believe it could affect her candidacy. In conclusion, this sould be kept but edited. 200.55.213.30 16:57, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm sure this merits a separate article, although I agree more should be added to the Bachelet page. I also agree with 200.55.213.30 in the fact that this article should be heavily edited for more encyclopedic quality. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E200.119.238.115.html" title="User:200.119.238.115">200.119.238.115</a> 20:03, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the article should stay, but I think that someone with knowledge of the topic should expand the article to add more specific information, examples of Anti-racist mathematics. I dont feel that the article really provides enough information for a decent understanding of precisely what Anti-racist mathematics is, merely expressing a general sentiment of post-modernism somehow applied to mathematics.

<p>I must still remind you that the original article with this exact content is on Wikipedia since june 25th, 2005. It seems inconsistent with Wikipedia's philosophy to engage an article who was approved and part of this free encyclopedia for 2 months in a process for deletion.</p>
<p>As for the reasons of why this article exists, even if it is uncommon in Wikipedia for one to justify and defend the presentation and description of a social activity, the Underground barbecue is -I must repeat- a social activity and it is pertinent for people to know about it and expand the idea. Some Internet content exists about similar activities, and the persons who created it are not related to me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<li>In response to the above: it would appear that your article slipped through the cracks in June. Had someone noticed it then, it most likely would have ended up here at VfD. While it may be true that underground barbecue is pertinent to "people who know about it", that's not measure enough to be in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not an avenue to publicity, it is a tertiary source that records information from other sources.

<p>Keep this article alive, please. Or, you know, you might want to review my numerous articles concerning Hamas and the Ezzedeen-al-qassam brigades because some consider them as terrorists and writing articles about them may promote terrorism. Then, respectfully, you'd be missing the point, just as you do now. It's just about giving information.

<li><b>Delete</b>. However, I will vouch anytime for Leon, who is indeed the youngest admin on de. He is a fine and intelligent young man, who definitely never wrote this entry, and probably never would have made such comments as have been made here without prior verification. Whoever made this entry must have read <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article307970.ece" class="external text" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article307970.ece" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<li><b>Delete:</b> I had the opportunity to meet Leon at Wikimania, and he is a very fine person, who immediately began helping out with everything that needed to be done as soon as he arrived. While I don't believe he should have an article about him (perhaps one day ...), I do think that Leon has proven himself beyond a shadow of a doubt in the German Wikipedia and should be treated with respect for that. While the article should likely be deleted, I do want to thank Leon for everything that he has done for Wikipedia, and particularly for showing that maturity and an ability to contribute competently are far more important than a person's age. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 23:27, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
