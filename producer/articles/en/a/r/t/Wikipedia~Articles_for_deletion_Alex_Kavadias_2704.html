<dd>That's cause they are well-known <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a> models in the Greek fashion world and entertainment industry, many of them also used in music videos. Some have branched out into the international fashion world. You also can not say if a person is well-known or famous with a search you might do from a non Greek search engine. Perfect example, if you do a search on one of Greece's most famous actors as Θανάσσης Βέγγος, you only get three or four hits<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. When dealing with Greek names, you also have to take into consideration of the fact that the name can be spelled in numerous different ways and that pronunciation plays a big part of getting the correct hits when doing a search. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 10 April 2006

<dd><b>Comment</b> I notice, by a remarkable coincidence, that it seems these well-known Greek models are all clients of the same modeling agency. You wouldn't, by chance, happen to be associated with <a href="http://www.acemodels.gr" class="external text" title="http://www.acemodels.gr" rel="nofollow">Ace Models</a>, would you? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 13:00, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is a coincidence since I've also listed models from various other agencies as well. But to answer your question, no, not at all, I have no association what so ever with any of the model agencies these people are associated it with. The reason why Ace Models is representing most of them is because <a href="http://www.acemodels.gr" class="external text" title="http://www.acemodels.gr" rel="nofollow">Ace Models</a> is one of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> biggest model agencies and a partner for many fashion magazines found in Greece, as well as advertising agencies, film productions houses, leading fashion catalogues and fashion designers use their services. Plus many of their models are former Miss Greeces and have been branching out internationally. Here I ago again sounding like I'm adversting for them but I'm not, just trying to explain why Ace Models is representing most of them. The next agency I'm planning on posting model info from is another big one from Greece <a href="http://www.i-m.gr/#" class="external text" title="http://www.i-m.gr/#" rel="nofollow">IMAGE MANAGEMENT</a> which represents <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katerina_Georgiadou_6d25.html" title="Katerina Georgiadou">Katerina Georgiadou</a>. Besides I live in the States, they are from Greece....a)reason why my searches since they are done by non Greek search engines, such as yours, do not produce many results on their names. I do read/understand Greek though (aka magazines and other info pertaining towards the Greek pop culture) and own Greek satellite channels,in which these models as well as other Greek celebrities are featured on quite often.&#160;;) ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 11 April 2006

<dd>OK, if you don't like non-Greek search engines, show us a search on a Greek search engine that shows him as notable. Seriously, there are thousands of models who've done multiple magazines and ad campaigns. Does that make them notable? For the most part, no. There are a handful of models (mainly female) who become celebrities. The vast majority are unknown to everyone except the agencies that hire them. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:56, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't believe I said anywhere in my posts that I don't like non-Greek search engines. What i did say is, it is difficult to get hits from non Greek engines, since Greek names can be spelled in various ways including pronunciations which play a big part in the Greek language. As the example I gave above with Θανάσσης Βέγγος, one of Greece's most famous actors, where you only get three or four hits when searching for him with his name spelled that way, even with Greek search engines<a href="http://www.google.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7+Google&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7+Google&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 12 April 2006

<dd>You ducked the issue. Can you show us a search, in any language, on any search engine, that shows this guy to be notable? I've never heard of this Thanassis Veggos, but when I try the same search for Μελίνα Μερκούρη (Melina Mercouri) I get over 50,000 hits. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:30, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I didn't duck the issue, the point is just because you didn't hear of them, or are not familiar with certain individuals, or don't get many hits on search engines, does not mean they are not popular or not well know in their native countries. I brought up Θανάσσης Βέγγος because being of the biggest Greek stars in Greek movie history, he is a perfect example of what is being debated here; you only get a few hits when typing in his name even though he was one of the biggest comedy actors in Greek movie history. BTW, Θανάσσης Βέγγος was a more well known star then even Μελίνα Μερκούρη was in Greece, even though Μελίνα Μερκούρη was more in the spotlight for international issues. So saying that you get such amount of hits from a search engines, does not amount much of anything. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006</dd>

<dd>Well for one thing the guy is on the covers of Greek music CDs for the 2004 Olympics and a familiar face in the Greek fashion world, his more recognized then you would think. ~ So are we to understand that popularity of non English celeberties is based on how many hits a person's name gets on search engines and not how popular a person is in his/her native land? In that case I can prove that theory flawed with the Θανάσσης Βέγγος example I gave above. It is stated above that since Βέγγος name does not produce many hits, he must not be well known, unlike say Μελίνα Μερκούρη who gets over 50,000 hits. Well as Greek-American I can tell you with 100% certainty that if you ask any Greek person who Θανάσσης Βέγγος is they will know. Oh and BTW notice that the search done on his name here<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, does not produce any hits about the fact that a municipal theatre of Piraeus was named after him. Non-notable people do not get buildings named after them. So once more, saying that you get such amount of hits from a search engines does not amount to much of anything in regards to how popular an individual is in his/her homeland. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006</dd>

As I said before just because you don't get 50,000 hits from search engines does not amount to how well known an individual is in his/her homeland. Case in point Βέγγος, one of the biggest Greek stars with only 3 search hits. You also forgot to add fashion shows, runways and presentation events to your list above. As for his popularity, you can find that out if you check out Greek magazines, the Greek fashion world and Greek tv pop culture. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

<dd>Please review the Wikipedia standard for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. "You can't prove he's <u>not</u> famous" does not count, and there's no rule that says the standards should be ignored for people who live in another country. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:15, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well that's a double standard if I ever heard one. So am I to understand that a person's popularity is based on how many hits he/she have on search engines? Because if that's the case then as proven above that is a flawed way of determining a person's popularity. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

<dd>There's no double standard at all. Why should you not be held to standards of verifiability?<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:23, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Which I ask you again; is the standards of verifiability "popularity" due on the amount of hits an individual gets on his/her names? Cause I can include numerious famous Greeks who get only a few search hits but are well known to the Greek culture in general if that's the case...and to make it more interesting, I'll include all the spellings of their names or as many spellings as I'm familiar with. &#160;;) ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006
<dl>
<dd>I've read the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and I don't see anything in the rules which says that the popularity of an individual is based only on the number of hits he/she get on search engines....unless I'm missing something...? ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006</dd>

<dd>By the way, Veggos gets 9,000 hits on Greek Google if you spell his name correctly: Θανάσης Βέγγος. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:23, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>BTW his name is also spelled Thanassis Vengos, Thanassis Veggos, Thanasis Vengos, Θανάση Βέγγος and Θανάση Βέγγο. Which points to what I said above and I quote: "When dealing with Greek names, you also have to take into consideration of the fact that the name can be spelled in numerous different ways and that pronunciation plays a big part on getting the correct hits when doing a search." By pronunciation I'm also talking about the τόνος. I've seen Kavadias in the Greek media that was talking about the male and female models used for the 2004 Olympics, mostly because it was made into such a big deal, the Olympics I'm talking about, spelled with two "v's", one "v", his first name as Alexander, Alekos, Aleko and Alex; Alekos written with a "w" and in other cases with a "o". ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

<dd>Fine. Find some verification of his notability uner <u>any</u> name. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 17:10, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My question still stands: is his "verification" on how popular he is solely based on the number of hits an individual gets on search engines, even if he/she are more talked about and noticed in media outlets, then search engines? ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

<dd>Read the policies: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Do you have some verification that he is being talked about in other media outlets? For lack of anything better, search engines are a good indication of whether somebody's being talked about, and it's the usual standard for inclusion.<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:40, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I do, as mentioned previously, he has been featured in numerious Greek media outlets. As for the policies of wikipedia, I did read them and I didn't see anywhere where it says that a person's "verification" is based solely on how many search hits he/she gets on search engines. I did come across this though:</dd>

<dd>That's understanable but I'm not associated with nor do I know Kavadias....wish I did, I'd be able to hang out with hot models...
