<li><b>QUESTION: How many times can an article be nominated for deletion?</b> As noted above, this article had already been nominated for deletion and was deemed fit to remain within Wikipedia's database. I had assumed that passing the deletion nomination once would mean that this article was fit to remain in the database. I feel like I'm trapped in an odd rerun here.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why vanity? Anyway, I've been working to improve it and oppose deleting it. There is, in fact, such a controversy. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Ward_Smith_f812.html" title="User:Gene Ward Smith">Gene Ward Smith</a> 07:45, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It seems a well-cited piece spun off from an already long main article. It could use some editing/formatting work, but I see no grounds for deletion. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 07:58, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and maybe change the title to something more neutral, e.g. Authorship of "A Course in Miracles". What's the vanity aspect? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:12, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I agree that the nomination should be withdrawn. If you read the original deletion nomination, you will see that the administrator who closed the voting noted that the quality of the page increased from the time it was nominated for deletion to the time the voting for deletion ended. The quality of the article has only improved since then. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 23:51, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> compared to some of the vanity crap I come across this is great.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. How many times can an article be nominated for deletion? I thought the rule was nominated once, and if the consensus is keep, then you <b>keep</b>. If anything speaks for the need to keep this article, it is the fact that it is so continually controversial.

<li><b>Comment</b> The name of this article has changed, as well as the topic matter. This is no longer a discussion about an article which itself debates the credibility of claims about its author, but instead about the history of some book. Since the name of the article has changed, I advise that you also change the name of this AfD since it looks rather confusing. Thanks.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The name of the article has been altered, with the words "Jesus Christ as Source" being replaced with "Authorship", though the topic matter has remained the same. Wikipedia allows for the changing of the names of articles, though the articles are recognized as sharing continuity with their previous names; this is why the article history lists all edits made while the article had a previous title. This is a discussion about the source of <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a>, a book that has sold over one million copies, been translated into over a dozen languages, and has generated many best selling books of interpretation. Whether the name of this deletion nomination request is changed or not does not change the fact that the article with its present title is the same article as it was when it had the previous title, and therefore this article has been nominated twice for deletion, a situation found by most editors on this page to be very unusual indeed (note the suggestions for "speedy keep"). While the article has certainly grown, it remains the same article and remains concerned with the same topic. You see, Wikipedia allows for editing, which often involves expansion and growth. In fact, expansion and growth is actually <i>encouraged</i> on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 10:17, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

It must be remembered, of course, that on one level this was Helen's experience. But similar to the misperception of the sun's rising and setting every day, one's experience , though valid for the individual, nonetheless, should not be taken for the actual truth, let alone as a model in form for other people's experience."</i>.</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> Isn't this article baffling? It's continually being attacked from EVERY DIRECTION. It's a bit surreal. Obviously, it's struck quite a nerve with a lot of people. In my opinion, the most interesting case has been Ste4k, who suggested that the article is not notable, and when contacted he himself referred to this as simply being "some article" about "some book". After slapping just about every sentence with a "verify credibility" tag, he's off to the main <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> page, slapping every sentence there with a "citation needed" tag. It's really quite astonishing. Just when one person is done going on a rant about this article, someone else comes along. This deletion attempt is a perfect example.... Anyway, yes, more neutral people here would be wonderful. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 07:00, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Addendum</b> The user by the name of Ste4k <i>really</i> doesn't like A Course In Miracles. After refusing to listen to reason on this "authorship" page, after slapping just about every other sentence of the main page with a "citation needed" tag, he/she is off to the page about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Foundation_for_Inner_Peace_34f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Foundation for Inner Peace">Foundation for Inner Peace</a> and trying to get it deleted by saying it is not notable. Ste4k has said that none of this is personal and he/she doesn't have an attachment to any of this; just doing his/her "job". But obviously he/she has a real investment here in saying that ACIM isn't notable, despite loads of evidence that it is. Fascinating. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> After editing each and every citation in this article and checking each reference including name and address of owner, reading each article, and etc., as the logs will bear out, I made appropriate and factual edits with comments. I prefer 0RR as a philosphy and haven't much concern or time to play revert games. I asked what was the importance of this book and instead of giving me a simple answer, I was left to perform that investigation for myself. I have a NPOV on this topic matter, but I have a strong POV about the presentation of original research when it comes to this encyclopedia. It doesn't matter to me whether the book, or it's stories, or the claims of several insignificant web sites are true or not. But whatever is used as a citation and reference must be used as the material in the article. Anything less, should simply be deleted if for no other reason than to allow an opportunity for authors to do more research on their topics. Ste4k 08:32, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I wonder, why is it only <i>you</i> who continually accuse these ACIM-related articles of being "original research" and not being "verifiable." It doesn't seem to me that anyone else makes these claims. And, by the way, I'm not the only one who has made this comment about you. These pages you are attempting to destroy are not "original research." Rather, they are about a topic you do not like and are apparently obsessed with getting rid of. Well, have at it, but you're going to fail. ACIM has sold too many copies, has too many followers, too many critics, and has too strong of a presence on the Internet for you to claim that it is not notable and not verifiable. Basides, aren't you late for the local <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkie.html" title="Trekkie">Trekkie</a> convention? -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Curiosity</b> Perhaps if you would take some time to show the verifiability in the article I might change my vote. Whether this article remains alive or not matters little to me. What matters is a well rounded high quality encyclopedia. I was not the one that nominated this article for deletion. I was the one that put the facts from the cites which were quoted into the article. And this would actually be a good place for you to explain your edit summary. Such as the reason why the court case mentioned had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;offset=20060625194312&amp;limit=7&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;offset=20060625194312&amp;limit=7&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">plaintiff confused with the defendant</a>, or why you insisted on using the word "widely" when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60459899" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60459899" rel="nofollow">first three sources only exist in Texas</a>, or why was it you don't feel I'm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60594722" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60594722" rel="nofollow">important enough to speak with in Discussion</a>, or why you delteted that contradiction tag without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60530702" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60530702" rel="nofollow">explaining it in the article</a>, or why most of the cites you listed hadn't their actual titles, or why you had listed them with without any mention who wrote them. Did you not, here, in this very conversation scream at me that you had <b>TEN OUTSIDE SOURCES and is not "original research"</b>? Why were they all in only three books? Please stop harassing me now, I have better things to do than answer your questions. Thanks. Ste4k 10:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This person is without a doubt the strangest and most annoying person I've ever met on the Internet. After he/she paid a great deal of attention to many ACIM articles (which means slapping just about every sentence with a "citation needed" tag), I contacted him/her on his/her talk page. The response I got was that he/she hardly remembers his/her comments about "some article". Later, I was told to "stop harassing" him/her, when in fact all I had done was attempt to understand why he/she will not trust any source offered. (Sources that he/she has not found acceptable have been found acceptable by many others.) I'm really at a loss with this person. Hopefully, others will keep an eye on him/her as well. For some unknown reason, he/she wants to destroy all ACIM-related articles. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 18:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In addition to supporting the deletion of this page and attempting to get the page about Foundation for Inner Peace deleted, this person is also behind deletion attempts of the article about <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>. I'd like to know what it is about ACIM that this person finds so unappealing. Oh, and on this person's talk page they are whining to someone that I am part of "some advocacy group" or something (fascinating how on one hand this person whines about the need for verifiable facts, and then turns around and makes such unverified statements; I'm a part of NO advocacy group), and then says I am harassing him/her. And apparently someone is "collecting information" on me and my "harassment" of this person. In reality, it isn't harassment but an attempt to understand why he/she will not be reasonable and accept perfectly decent citations. But I suppose that's a futile attempt, because this person, apparently, doesn't like to explain his/her real motives. His/her own personal Wikipedia page contains the weird self-description: "Explaining anything about myself personally would violate my neutrality", as though his/her own talk page is an actual Wikipedia article that would be debated by others. Weird. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 18:43, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
