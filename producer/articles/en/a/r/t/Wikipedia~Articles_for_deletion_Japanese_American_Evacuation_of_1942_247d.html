<p>No references? What are you talking about? The POV reparations activists lock out opposing views from the original article and when our views are provided here you attempt to have them deleted.

<dd>In cases like this you need to cite every 'fact' and note when they are disputed. Citation makes a strong argument against somebody with an opposing POV, having a POV fork doesn't. Basically this article needs deleting and you need to play nicely in the original. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 17:45, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To be fair, more citation is required for the article in its current (protected) revision. That is, many of the "pro-fork" editors have raised reasonable questions about the legitimacy of claims in the current revision. Whatever anyone thinks about the content of the fork, more citation is required in the <i>entire</i> article, not just with the revisions proposed by the fork advocates. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 18:41, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Care to provide us with some examples Yomangani? My additions included sources and I challenge you dispute any additions that is not historically correct. Of course you can't. That's why you and you ilk have locked the original article and want to delete this one. You don't care about historical accuracy you care about furthering an agenda - but that's what happens when political activists play historian.</p>
<p>I'm not going to note what you dispute because there is no basis for your dispute other then it's not what you want to believe or want others to believe. What a loade of crap. You delete this article i'll just put up another and another and another... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.207.79.202 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.207.79.202.html" title="User talk:207.207.79.202">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.207.79.202_c340.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.207.79.202">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I meant 'you' (plural), as in you and everybody else who edits the original. As far as I can see the whole of this new article is your work, in which case most of it is uncited. If it isn't all your own work (and is in fact a copy of the original) then you (singular) have argued yourself back into only having one article. For the record, I don't agree with locking the article on one point of view (once it gets to that stage I'd prefer to have it taken down pending resolution of the dispute)...and by the way one of the rules of WP is 'assume good faith'. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 18:59, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Show me my additions that are uncited. You can't and that is a non issue. The original article is so full of uncited pro-reparations POV it's a joke. Your clear bias is showing but I have faith the original article will be unlocked and "tom" will have his administrative priviledges suspended.</p>

<p>This whole "fork" talk is a non-issue. My additions are citeable, relevent and historically accurate.

Even the little addition of "disputed history" has a weasel words disclaimer. What a joke.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - forgive the understatement here, but it is an extremely bad idea to have two articles on the same subject. The place that the facts of a topic should be debated is on the Talk page for the original article, not in a new one. A separate page on the same topic isn't "the next best thing"--it's not even a valid option. As for <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>: "POV forks usually arise when two or more contributors disagree about the content of an article or other page, and instead of resolving that disagreement, someone creates another version of the article (or another article on the same subject) to be developed according to their personal views rather than according to consensus. This second article is known as a "POV fork" of the first. This is generally considered unacceptable."

If one page has been hi-jacked by an activist pov group of editors then it is entirely appropraite. I challenge any editor to point out my additions as historically incorrect. First you critize the style, then say sources aren't cited then say it's pov - all of which is untrue. You are looking for any reason to delete an opposing point of view while providing one explanation after another as to why the pro-reparations pov article should remain. Not only that but you attempt to ban IPs.

<p>That's great but the "Japanese American Internment" article has been locked by pov repatations activists. The current article is full of factual errors and the writing is just plain bad history. In the meantime this article needs to stay. While it could use a rewrite to be more concise and correct grammar the substantial history is a heck of a lot better.<b><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.131.114.43.html" title="User:203.131.114.43">203.131.114.43</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.131.114.43.html" title="User talk:203.131.114.43">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.131.114.43_9803.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.131.114.43">contribs</a>).</small></b></p>

<p>Anyone following the discussion at the Japanese "Internment" article can see that the it has degenerated into making explanations supporting one's pov. The original article is still up and locked with incorrect history and bad history and history that needs clarification. That is reason enough why this article needs to remain to provide balance as the original has been totally hi-jacked by pro-reparations pov activists.</p>
