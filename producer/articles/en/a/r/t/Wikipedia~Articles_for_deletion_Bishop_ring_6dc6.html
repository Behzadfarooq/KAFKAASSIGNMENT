<li>I am in the process of doing a full literature search for this type of structure. It's definitely been written about; it's finding the references that is time-consuming. So far most references assume a structure with similar properties that's centered on either Earth or the Sun. I'm also kind of curious as to why you're asking for a literature search for a science fiction habitat, especially when <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_Orbital_3fe5.html" title="Culture Orbital">Culture Orbital</a> doesn't have one. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 23:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>A literature search that finds appropriate references would render your objections invalid. I'm _still_ wondering why you consider the article unacceptable in the first place, but have no problems with other articles about similar structures with less backing material. Care to give a more detailed answer on this?--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 03:36, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no evidence this structure exists, the idea for it got started in SciFi fiction (not theoretical physics), the article is misleading, the topic is trivial cruft and it reads like a joke, for starters. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 08:55, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>The idea for a rotating ring habitat was proposed by <a href="../../../w/e/r/Wernher_von_Braun_52ea.html" title="Wernher von Braun">Wernher von Braun</a> in 1952, and revisited in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a> thought experiment funded by <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a>. While the name "Bishop Ring" appears to have been an invention of the Orion's Arm group, calling the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Ring_0949.html" title="Bishop Ring">Bishop Ring</a> version of the article (as opposed to <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_ring.html" title="Bishop ring">bishop ring</a>) "trivial cruft" about a "nonexistent" idea is, frankly, incorrect enough to make me wonder if you so much as _skimmed_ literature on space station concepts before deciding this article was a waste of space. I can accept redirection to "Stanford Torus" as an interim measure, though the Torus was proposed as a much smaller structure. I'll create a new article about feasible megastructure-scale ring colonies once I have a few peer-reviewed paper citations to quiet most of the objections voiced here. I agree that "Bishop Ring" probably isn't a good name for the article, but it continues to disturb me that most of the people posting here prefer to delete an article out of hand rather than change it to something they like, or merge the few bits they feel have merit with other more appropriate articles. Deletion is for articles that are <i>completely</i> inappropriate or meritless. Heck, if any of you had proposed blanking the article and making it a redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a>, I probably wouldn't even have blinked. I am always open to constructive suggestions for alteration; however, the only one offered to date was JoaoRicardo's stub tag change. The rest has been nothing but aggressive confrontation (with varying degrees of politeness, which I do recognize and respect).--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 05:20, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My wording was only an artifact of the heavily qualified language I use on these VfDs, and was meant to separate the article topic from reality. From an encyclopedic perspective, IMO the topic is trivial cruft. From a SciFi perspective, it might work has a "hard science fiction" plot device. I'm not aware that WP is an "encyclopedia of science fiction". <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 13:31, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I question your placement of the dividing line between "science fiction" and "hypothetical engineering project that nobody's built". Why do you not object to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_elevator.html" title="Space elevator">space elevator</a> or any of the various <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_fountain.html" title="Space fountain">space fountain</a> proposals? I can certainly see you objecting to the _term_ "Bishop Ring", but there is ample literature (mostly cited from the pages linked from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a>) about ring-shaped space colonies. Thus, I challenge your assertion that there is nothing of technical merit in the version of <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Ring_0949.html" title="Bishop Ring">Bishop Ring</a> I posted. The distinction between science and science fiction is that science fiction either a) makes propositions that irreconcilably violate known physical laws or b) has no reflection in publications by the scientific community. Neither applies to the article I wrote (though I can, as mentioned earlier, see arguments for folding it into other <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_habitat.html" title="Space habitat">space habitat</a> articles).--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:58, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If those articles showed up on VfD I might vote to delete them too, but at the moment we're talking about this one. I disagree with your opinion on the difference between science and science fiction, but even that's not related to this VfD. Further, I never said "there is nothing of technical merit" in the article you posted. I said it was fiction, not science. Fancruft can be wonderful, but it's usually not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 20:45, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you believe that there _is_ content in my version of the article that _does_ have technical merit, then why didn't you suggest that it be merged with a more suitable parent article, rather than deleting it? Or that any non-redundant fancruft components be merged into the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion%27s_Arm_d364.html" title="Orion's Arm">Orion's Arm</a> article? I asked this several paragraphs ago, and still didn't get an answer from you. Surely you agree that if an article _does_ have any salvageable components, they should be salvaged and put somewhere more suitable?--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:58, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neither did I say I thought it <i>did</i> have technical merit. I said it was fiction. Another problem I have with the article is it doesn't make that clear at all, which will mislead some readers. I also noticed the article's author has muddled the contraction <i>it's</i> with the possessive <i>its</i>&#160;:) As for any merge, I don't see much point in that but please keep in mind I don't assert myself as any final authority, only one vote.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Christopher, in deciding where to redirect, I believe it is important to think what someone who typed or followed a link to this article would like to know about. (This is my opinion, not Wikipedia policy.) If the expression "bishop ring" is only found in one specific science fiction work, or in one specific series of works (eg. Asimov's Foundation series, Star Trek series etc.) then it probably should redirect to that work or series, where there should be a discussion of the space habitat as it applies to that work. There we could include a link to other article that discuss the same concept in real life. If however this is used in many works of sci-fi and/or in academic papers as well, than we should redirect to a more "real-life" article, like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a> as you suggested. The current article doesn't establish either position. Could you clarify this for us? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 05:32, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's looking like a redirect to <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion%27s_Arm_d364.html" title="Orion's Arm">Orion's Arm</a> would probably be the most approriate, as they appear to be the only place that actually used the term <i>Bishop Ring</i> to refer to this type of structure. I'm thinking about adding a "types of megastructure featured in this work" section to the OA page. The material about real life limits to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a>-like structures can be shelved until I have refereed literature references for it. I know where to look (late 70s, early 80s, when the structures were in vogue and whisker fibers were fashionable), but don't have them on-hand, so such an article would just be VFDd as either primary source or sci-fi, depending on who's VFDing it. Link to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a> can go into the OA page, as a part of my intended edit.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 06:01, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

As appointed by Wyss, that is jargon for something in which only hardcore fans would be interested. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> is a worthy article, but an article on, for instance, an expression Bart used in episode 34 of the 6th season is fancruft. Only hardocre Simpsons fans would be interested in something so specific. <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringworld.html" title="Ringworld">Ringworld</a> is an article on an apparently notable sci-fi novel, and therefore is not restricted to fans. However <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_Orbital_3fe5.html" title="Culture Orbital">Culture Orbital</a> does seem to me to be fancruft.

Keep or redirect the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Ring_0949.html" title="Bishop Ring">Bishop Ring</a> article as you see fit. If <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Ring_0949.html" title="Bishop Ring">Bishop Ring</a> is still around after the VFD for <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_ring.html" title="Bishop ring">bishop ring</a>, I'll end up redirecting it some time before writing up a citation-rich article on ring habitats. I'm reluctant to modify <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Ring_0949.html" title="Bishop Ring">Bishop Ring</a> while a vote is still in progress.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 03:36, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
