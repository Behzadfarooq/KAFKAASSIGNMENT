<p><b>Merox:</b> - Merox stands for <b>Mer</b>captan <b>Ox</b>idation. A Process wherein Petroleum fractions such as LPG, gasoline and heavier fractions is treated to remove mercaptan sulfur (Merox extraction) or to convert mercaptan sulfur to less-objectionable disulfides (Merox sweetening).</p>
<p>The method of treatment is the reaction of caustic (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) with the feed stream. The oxidation of mercaptans (<a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiols.html" title="Thiols">thiols</a>) converts them to disulphides, which are soluble in petroleum products and are not corrosive.</p>

<p>A hexapod walking robot is one which walks with six legs. The main advantage of a six legged walking robot is that it can provide a stable walking platform due to three legs (a tripod) always being in contact with the ground.</p>
<p>Although it would appear that synchronising all six legs is difficult, it can be achieved using BEAM robotics very easily.</p>

<p>his is an attempt to make all you unhappy career people realize that your job can be your tool to carve out happiness &amp; satisfaction in your lives, provided the job you choose is by your choice or is a choice of people surrounding you.</p>
<p>Life may not give us a second chance but when it comes to our career, its far more than just one or two chances. Thanks to the numerous job consultants and job portals that have not only simplified our job search but also keep dropping in several job offers almost each day. One such portal is Naukri.com, which is India‚Äôs number 1 job portal and has recently launched its international branch in the Middle East for Jobs in Middle East called NaukriGulf.com. For more information on these job portals log on to <a href="http://www.naukri.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.naukri.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naukri.com/</a> - jobs in India and <a href="http://www.naukrigulf.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.naukrigulf.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naukrigulf.com/</a> - jobs in Gulf.</p>
<p>Our real challenge is in using these job opportunities in a way that won‚Äôt leave us regretting in the future. For this we first need to understand what we feel as right, is our own thought or a thought coated by other people‚Äôs thoughts. Following is a list of guidelines that will help tap your hidden colours that‚Äôll brighten up your career life and find your dream job.</p>
<p>Be as you are: Be your true self all of the time because it takes a tremendous amount of energy to step into a false persona. This way you will preserve on a lot of positive energy and as a consequence your productivity at workplace will also improve.</p>
<p>Failures are pillars: Failure isn't something anyone can avoid. Failure is merely a tool, a gauge that tells us whether we achieved our goal or not. The proper response to failure is always: re-assess your actions, regroup and try again. That‚Äôs why failures are nothing but pillars, which make us stronger to take up more risks without letting us shatter.</p>
<p>Do what you enjoy doing: Your work shouldn‚Äôt seem to be a mere job to you. Find a job that fulfills you, aligns with your passions and gives you energy instead of draining you.</p>
<p>Your job gels with your life: Find a job that will integrate perfectly into your lifestyle and will feel like a natural part of you. It will have the same values as you and will not ask you to embrace values that do not resonate with you or to go against your beliefs. You will wake up every day excited about going to work instead of dreading it.</p>
<p>If you had just 1 year to live: If you had only one year left and had to continue to work for a living, what would you change about your day to day life right now? Would you continue to work for your current employer or would you do something that satisfies your heart? Think about it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Take some time to let your thoughts wander beyond the confines of your normal routine and see the possibilities that exist. Take out a piece of paper and list them! Popular Motivational writer, Josh Hinds said, "While aimlessly waiting for their so-called SHIP to come in and change their life for the better, far too many people miss the boat that could actually carry them to a brighter future. They are often so afraid of testing new waters that they spend an entire lifetime waiting on the shore...Begin your journey now!"</p>

<p>The company was founded in October 2003 by Dr. Kurt Stokbro, Dr. Jeremy Taylor and Dr. Thomas Magnussen. Dr. Stokbro and Dr. Taylor are co-authors on the article [1] introducing the eletron transport method and program TranSIESTA (based on the SIESTA program [2]) for acedemia. This method, and methods used in Dr. Taylors Ph.D. research, was the starting point for Atomistix first product, TranSIESTA-C. The C refers to the program being written in the programming language C as opposed to Fortran in which TranSIESTA was written.</p>
<p>Since the very beginning the company has been working in close collaboration with the Nano-Science Center at the Niels Bohr Institute of Copenhagen University, to enhance the product development.</p>

<p>Atomistix was the first to develop a system of integrated software modules based on quantum theory - the Atomistix Virtual NanoLab‚Ñ¢. This program has a user friendly interface to make complicated calculations more accesible. The setup of the interface resembles more that of an experiment. Its underlying engine is the Atomistix ToolKit (ATK) which is the next generation of TranSIESTA-C.

<p>A hexapod walking robot is one which walks with six legs. The main advantage of a six legged walking robot is that it can provide a stable walking platform due to three legs (a tripod) always being in contact with the ground, whilst allowing for a robot which can move on uneven terrain.</p>
<p>Although it would appear that synchronising all six legs is difficult, it can be achieved using <a href="../../../b/e/a/BEAM_59de.html" title="BEAM">BEAM</a> robotics very easily.</p>

<p>Wissinoming is a neighborhood in the Near Northeast section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is bordered by Tacony on the north, Bridesburg on the south, I-95 and the Delaware River on the east, and Frankford on the west. Its zip code is 19135. The intersection of Frankford and Harbison Avenues is considered the "heart" of Wissinoming. Although the southern borders of this neighborhood are ill-defined, Wissinoming stops where Harbison Avenue becomes Aramingo Avenue.</p>
<p>Throughout much of the twentieth century, Wissinoming was a strong Irish-American community, but its population has diversified in recent years.</p>

<p>The Frederick Branch of the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad_cb42.html" title="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> runs from Frederick Junction on the west side of the Monocacy River to its terminus at South Street in downtown Frederick, Maryland. The branch officially was opened in December of 1831 with a ceremonial train (pulled by horses) carrying directors of the company and various politicians arriving from Baltimore. The branch first provided a rapid means for the many mills in the city to ship flour to Baltimore for sale. Over the years outbound freight traffic diversified to include milk, bricks, limestone and some manufactured goods from Frederick. The branch connected with two other railroads within Frederick. The <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Railroad_68f4.html" title="Pennsylvania Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> connected near East Street and South Street in downtown Frederick and the Hagerstown and Frederick Railway connected near the small B&amp;O Railroad yard and terminal along South Street in downtown Frederick. Passenger service lasted until November of 1949 and the branch gradually fell into disrepair as local customers switched to trucks. As of 2006 the only remaining freight customer on the branch is Wickes Lumber which receives car loads of building materials via a local freight. In December of 2001 passenger traffic returned to Frederick in the form of MARC commuter trains. The state of Maryland funded upgrades to the Frederick Branch and to the portion of the Old Main Line that ran from Frederick Junction to Point of Rocks. A small yard was also constructed along Reichs Ford Road with capacity for three entire train sets. Two new stations were constructed to handle passengers, one in downtown Frederick near the original branch terminus at South Street and another located behind a shopping center near Frederick Junction.</p>

<p>After being expelled from various schools, arrested and nearly driven insane by LSD, Rotating Leslie were born. Three friends from school, Greg, Adrian and Dan, went on a journey of discovery in their formative years which saw them DJ'ing at illegal raves, get carted off in Police vans and almost lose their minds in East London squats. The only way out was to turn their backs on the scene they had immersed themselves in, move to a farmhouse in the countryside and form a band.</p>
<p>Here, with brother and bass player Stuart, they recorded their debut single 'No Requests'. Put out as a self funded limited 300 7" and CD at the end of the summer, they sold out in Rough Trade in the first two weeks and received airplay on Londons XFM. With over 1500 copies of the CD sold and 10,000 downloads they needed to build their live shows. They've gained a large and loyal following through their annual free festival at the farm and their extensive gigging over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Now in it's 3rd year, the Woodendstock Raves put on by the band have attracted more and more people with over 400 revellers in attendance at this years party. They put on some indoor parties in warehouses across London through the winter to keep the vibe alive!</p>
<p>This has seen them play with The Subways, The Paddingtons, Dogs, New Rhodes, Kill City, The Rifles, Thee Unstrung, Queens of Noize, The Boxer Rebellion, 65 Days of Static, The Gliteratti, Goldie Lookin Chain and many more.</p>
<p>NME Described the band as making 'gritty, harmonic, art pop'. Call it what you will, they have steered away from the obvious indie clich√©'s and instead, relied on there diverse influences to create something fresh and exciting.</p>
<p>In May 2006, Lee Hague joined the band on drums. After touring with the Rakes for 3 months around Europe, 18 year old Lee decided it was time to settle down.</p>
<p>The band released a limited fanbase album 'Infrequent Mild Peril' which sold out of it's 500 copies in a matter of weeks. They are touring extensively playing the festival circuit, as well as jetting off to play the Fool's Gold festival in South Africa in the Autumn.</p>
<p>The band recently headlined the new band stage at the Isle of Wight Festival and will be playing at this years Secret Garden Party in August.</p>
<p>With new music guru John Kennedy championing the band and Zane Lowe's listeners already salivating over them, things are looking pretty good for the Hertfordshire lads.</p>

<p>The Louisville Massacre of 1983 is one of the most spontaneous murderings in the United States. Taking the lives of 8 apparently unconnected citizens of the area. The range of the murders extends from the upper western corner of the city limits to the eastern entrance of the the city. The supposed murderer has been caught, yet due to the fact that he is clinically insane, and has been put under much public scrutiny as to finding the details of the killings he is being housed in a correctional facility of an undisclosed location, the murderer has been documented as being a male,authorities involved with the arrest have all declined comment, and have not issued a statement since the murderer's incarceration.From what is known about the evening and the individual incarcerated, he apparently had no past behavior or criminal record, he was driving in from an undisclosed location, that many believe is Southeast Missouri or Southwestern Illinois. Locals in that area say, althought the facts have become almost unverifiable due to the intense secrecy of the officials, that on the evening the murderer picked up a split personality clinically psycopathic individual who escaped from a nearby Institution. Many credit the killings in Louisville to what happened on the trip to Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>PocketFives.com is one of the leading online forums dedicated to the world of poker, both live and online. While much of the discussion stems from the online world, noticeable achievements in the world of live poker are also recognized. The site has grown by leaps and bounds over the past year, and has become a recognizable image in the world of poker.</p>
<p>Also of note are the PocketFives.com online tournament player rankings, which attempt to define the best in the online poker world. The rankings take into consideration the most prestigious online tournaments and new players can play their way onto the rankings, getting the respect of the online poker world. In the 1 1/2 year history of the PocketFives.com tournament player rankings, only two players have occupied the top spot, while a countless number of players have inhabited the 74 remaining spots on the list. Player 'brsavage' occupied the #1 spot from January 18th, 2005 to April 18th, 2005. On that date, Cliff "JohnnyBax" Josephy took over the #1 spot, and he has remained in that position ever since. Many in the online poker world have complained of his stay at the top of the rankings, but he has continually proved himself since April 2005, and those in charge of the rankings have kept him at the top.</p>
<p>PocketFives.com truly seeks to aid the poker player on his route to success, offering everything from helpful articles about the game to a FAQ section on taxes and poker. The Poker Discussion section offers valuable insight into the minds of some of the games greats, the Hand Advice section provides interesting analysis encountered worldwide, and the Bad Beats section allow for players to vent the frustrations of the poker world.</p>
<p>Finally, the Off Topic section on PocketFives.com has spawned a life of its own, sponsoring everything from organized online tournaments, to parties in Las Vegas during the World Series of Poker. While the talk of poker has been outlawed from the OT (Off Topic Section), it provides a great escape from the hassles of poker.</p>

<p>Age: 23 Occupation: Cashier Hometown: Emeryville, ON Audition City: Kitchener-Waterloo, ON Place of Birth: Windsor, ON Nickname: "Ashley Girl" Identifies With: Patsy Cline/Sheryl Crow Musical Style: "My own." Favourite Song: Society's Child Motto: "Live. Love. Sing."</p>
<p>"The best day of my life was hearing a live blues band for the first time. I felt like the music was being injected into my soul and it inspired me to start singing again."</p>
<p>Ashley feels that for her, the most challenging part of being involved in Canadian Idol will be witnessing people who she has bonded with be eliminated. "Great friendships have started because of this experience," she says.</p>
<p>Ashley promises to give viewers 110 per cent every time she performs. "I love music and I plan on doing it the rest of my life," she says. "I hope to help others through my music."</p>
<p>Ashley comes from a family of seven children and still lives in a busy household. She has two cats (Ziggy and Zoey), a miniature schnauzer named Monty and an Alexandrian parakeet named Alex. Ashley enjoys chicken schwarmas, fatoush salad and hummus.</p>
<p>Her favourite movie is Mary Poppins and she is a fan of reality TV. Ashley's hobbies include painting, playing guitar, writing songs, swimming and knitting.</p>
<p>Roy Orbison's "Crying" is the song that Ashley connects with the most. "There are so many reasons why I love this song but the reasons are personal. That's what makes the song so beautiful," she says. If she could meet one person it would be Patsy Cline. "I grew up singing Patsy Cline songs and have always loved her voice and grace," she says.</p>
<p>What does Ashley think it will take to become Canadian Idol? "I feel every competitor will say it takes a lot of hard work. Everyone is so unique and talented in their own way, so ultimately it's left in the viewer's hands."</p>
<p><br />
Canadian Idol Song List: Top 22: "Bring it On Home to Me" (Sam Cooke) Top 18: "I'm the Only One" (Melissa Etheridge)</p>

<p>Sulanuth - A sea monster ordered by God "...which was in the sea, to come up and go into Egypt. And she had long arms, ten cubits in length of the cubit of a man. And she went upon the roofs and uncovered the raftering and flooring and cut them, and stretched forth her arm into the house and removed the lock and the bolt, and opened the houses of Egypt." (Jasher 80:19-21).</p>

<p><b>His Art</b></p>
<p>Can Y√ºcel is known for often using slang and sometimes vulgar and rude language in his poems. However, his critics also agree that his effectiveness in using words in a simple and undertandable way is noteworthy of praise and appreciation. His main themes and inspirational sources in his poems are nature, people, events, concepts, excitements, perceptions and emotions. His loved ones are mentioned in many of his poems. His family was of utmost importance to him and he reflected his love for his family in poems like "To my Little Daughter Su", "To G√ºzel", "I Loved My Father the Most in Life" are some of his poems that attest to this love.</p>
<p>Y√ºcel also translated the works of Shakespeare, Lorca and Brecht.</p>
<p>He died in Dat√ßa in 1999 and is buried there.</p>
<p>A translation of one of his poems is below:</p>

<p>203.88.147.42 19:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC) In the Yoga tradition there are certain mantras (sound syllables) and yantras (forms to meditate on) which belong together. The form which belongs to the mantra Om is said to be Sri Yantra, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Is this relationship between form and sound a purely subjective experience - one that certain people claim to have seen within? Or can it be measured?</p>
<p>Dr. Hans Jenny spent his life investigating the connection between sounds and forms (see page 6). He was one of the world's foremost researchers in the field and the founder of the science of Cymatics. In his Wave Phenomena Research Institute in Switzerland, around 1970, he constructed what is called a tonoscope - an apparatus which converts sounds into forms. He wrote several books on Cymatics and documented through films and photos the influence of sounds on various materials.</p>
<p><br />
According to our sources, a person who could pronounce the mantra "Om" correctly, was asked to sing it into the tonoscope's microphone. At first a circle was generated on the membrane of the tonoscope, then various triangles formed themselves inside the circle, and when the "m" faded out, Sri Yantra was completed. Another mantra created concentric circles.</p>

<p>A secret society at the University of Virginia founded in 1889. T.I.L.K.A. supposedly stands for the five mystic Hindu words for power.</p>
<p>Along with Eli Banana, T.I.L.K.A. is considered to be one of the "cool" groups on Grounds and there is a sense of rivalry between the two groups, although many members are friends. Both groups are active in controlling the student government and social scene at the University.</p>
<p>T.I.L.K.A.'s focus on students who are members of the Greek system led to the creation of the Z Society in 1892.</p>
<p>A document dated 1961 in the Special Collections library at the University of Virginia reads:</p>
<p>"The T.I.L.K.A. Society was founded at The University in 1889 -- its purpose to bring together students who will work for the ideals and traditions of The University. T.I.L.K.A. has been termed an honorary society. If a person examined the records of the organization, he would find that the past members have set examples of leadership not only while in college, but also in their lives after graduation. Thus, the term honorary is applicable; for it is indeed an honor to be placed on the rolls with men who have done so much for Virginia.</p>
<p>"T.I.L.K.A., however, is more than just a recognition society. It has fostered many pleasant associations. Our social gatherings have often been the highlight of a weekend."</p>

<p>Karamesutlu is a village in the town of Babaeski within the province of Kirklareli in northwestern Turkey. It lies on the highway connecting Babaeski to Kirklareli and Derek√∂y, the customs at the Bulgarian border. It is 7 km to Babaeski and 30 km to Kirklareli. The name is believed to have originated from a shomaker named "Mesut" who settled in the area and was tan in complexion. Agriculture is the main way of living along with cattle and little sheep raising. Wheat and sunflower are the main commercial crops grown.</p>
<p>Seytan Deresi flows through the lands of the village and thus provides an important source of irrigation for the agricultural practices. The land is mostly flat with some rather gentle rises covered by small bushes and short oak trees.</p>
<p>There is an alementary school in the village but has been closed down due to the low number of students. Thus now, students commute to Babaeski for their schooling.</p>
<p>The climate is typical continental climate with cold winters with occasional snow and dry, hot summers.</p>

<p>The association is comprised of US Combat Veterans from all branches of the Armed Forces. The Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association (CVMA) is a group of riders that have two common bonds. They are Combat Veterans and ride motorcycles. CVMA reason for being is solely for the intent towards Veterans causes and issues.</p>
<p>The incorporated colors of the patch: Red represents the blood that has been shed on the battlefield. Gold (the Military gold) represents the many ethnic backgrounds in the Armed Forces. Black represents the heavy hearts possessed for those who gave their lives and for those who are considered missing in action or prisoners of war. The Skull and Ace of Spade represents the death that war leaves in its wake.</p>
<p>National CVMA: Is a non-profit association, non-territorial and not affiliated with any club. CVMA all share the common bond of being combat veterans of many conflicts and wars who also ride motorcycles. CVMA is where combat veterans can get together to carry-on the brotherhood that is shared during military service. CVMA assist veterans in any way they can. CVMA require that memebers are not dishonorably discharged and have proof of your combat service by way of your DD214. If still on active duty, proof of combat service. The headquarters is in Missouri with chapters in several states. All branches are welcome.</p>
<p>History of the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association: In the year 1999, the Combat Vets Motorcycle Club was introduced to the internet. Up until the first part of 2001 many of memebers were led to believe it was a true and established motorcycle organization. Through many turns of events it was found out that CVMC was an internet scam to milk money from Combat Veterans. In the early months of 2001 many of the members found this scam out &amp; alerted one another. Since the memebers were all interested in the issues of Veterans, 45 members decided to form a Combat Veterans Association. After this was decided, the birth of CVMA appeared as a non profit Association on or about May 1st 2001 &amp; CVMA now will be able to continue with the main objective which is helping Veterans. The 2 main things that brought memebers together was motorcycle riding &amp; being Veterans from Combat zones or theaters. The original 45 members have adopted a patch to wear indicating that they are the original founding fathers of CVMA.</p>
<p>CVMA In Hawaii(CVMAHI): CVMAHI aim is veterans helping veterans. The CVMAHI wishes also to raise awareness for the plight of POW‚Äôs, MIA‚Äôs, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of veterans returning from combat theaters, and their families. CVMAHI rides for memebers therapy and to enjoy each other's brotherhood, which you can only get from being in combat. CVMAHI support all veterans' runs.</p>
<p>How CVMAHI Started In Hawaii: Bulldog was planning to start a combat veterans club in Hawaii for the brotherhood you can only find in combat. When checking on the Internet, he found Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association. So in stead of starting a club with the same principles, Bulldog and his wife She Devil joined the CVMA on Feb 14, 2004. After 3 months of proper protocol on May 15 2004 the local dominant club, The Allis Of Hawaii MC, granted Bulldog official approved to fly Combat Vets Association patch in the State of Hawaii. January 11, 2005 Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association Hawaii (CVMAHI) became a member of Street Bikers United Hawaii (SBU). On Nov 18, 2005 National Coalition of Motorcyclist (NCOM) informed CVMAHI that it had been accepted as a member of the coalition. March 19, 2006 CVMAHI State Chapter is established. On April 10, 2006 CVMAHI is incorporated, and is a registered domestic nonprofit in the State of Hawaii.</p>
