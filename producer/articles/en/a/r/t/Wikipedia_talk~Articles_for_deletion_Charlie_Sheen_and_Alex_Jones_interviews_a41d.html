<p>As far as I can tell, Charlie Sheen never graduated high school. He claimed to the LA times that he was offered a scholarship to Univ of Kansas, due to his remarkable baseball skills.</p>

<dd>Northmeister claimed credentials for him on the basis that he's an engineer, based (I think) on my statment that "engineer questioning 9-11" is significant, "actor questioning 9-11" is not. The credential unfortunately didn't wash out. Cheap personal attacks? Questioning his academic qualifications is fair game.

<p>It seems that most of the 'Delete' voters have strong POV against Sheens views. This should not and cannot be a reason to delete the article. Calling non-acceptance of the official 911 theory 'lame' just shows the ignorance of the voter. The official theory includes the claim that the pentagon plane was vaporised by a jet fuel fire. If that were true, then all planes would be in serious trouble each time they start their engines. As a physicist, I think the claim that jet fuel can vaporise metal is 'lame', but I'm not voting to delete the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Commission_Report_401b.html" title="9/11 Commission Report">9/11 Commission Report</a> article. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhc√°n</a> 12:25, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Oh, that makes sense... not. Do you know the powers needed to vaposize over 60 tons aluminium? You are really suggesting that power was contained in the jet fuel? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:32, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There were aircraft parts all over the place...the term vaporize has been (not surprisingly) miscued by those moronic websites you keep pushing....they meant that it disintegrated...or vaporized...but they don't mean it "disappeared". They collected over 7,000 pieces of aircraft from the Pentagon...gee, wonder why the "missle hit the pentagon" folks seem to never mention that...golly.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 13:53, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, 7 000 pieces? With a combined wheith of? 1 ton? 2 tons? did all the 7 000 pieces weight more than 40 tons? Even if so, did the jet fuel manage to vaporize 20 tons of aluminium? I dont think so. I dont care how warm it gets, Jet fuel does not <i>vaporize</i> aluminium, <i>ever</i>. Where did the two <b>gigantic</b> engines go? Did they also vaporize? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 14:00, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Back to the original POV issue. I'm not voting againt the article because I don't believe in it. I'm voting against it because the specific issue (an actor has an interview) is not that notable. Remember, Wikipedia is not supposed to reflect "the truth", just "the truth as the world sees it". If the world is wrong, Wikipedia should be wrong too. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 14:29, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't buy the non-nobable argument. Wikipedia is full of far less notable stuff. There are tens of thousands of articles on characters from 1980's computer games, for example. Yet here we are debating the notability of a controversial interview between two well known people about an event that 100% of humanity knows about. And the topic recieves 10,000s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22Charlie+Sheen%22+%22Alex+Jones%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22Charlie+Sheen%22+%22Alex+Jones%22" rel="nofollow">Google hits</a>. The very fact that 60+ users have voted proves notability. I can't see any <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> rules which this article would come under. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhc√°n</a> 14:42, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>More than half of those 60+ users are specifically voting that it's <b>not</b> notable. There are considerably more computer and video game players than there are conspiracy buffs. I have nothing against either hobby - the first builds hand-eye coordination, while the second builds political skills and a healthy distrust of the government - but just as there can be notable and non-notable video game character articles, and notable and non-notable conspiracy theory articles. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmen_Sandiego_c911.html" title="Carmen Sandiego">Carmen Sandiego</a> the video game character is better known (more notable) than <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Sheen_87eb.html" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a>, yet you don't see a separate article detailing each and every appearance of her in each of her games or TV shows. Similarly you shouldn't see a separate article on each appearance or view of Charlie Sheen. Glom them together under his article. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 14:56, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why is there a need to <i>delete</i> this article? Its a current event and a developing topic, I think that the wise thing to do is just leave it be. In a few months we can re-visit it and see it is notable then. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhc√°n</a> 15:05, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not "developing". Charlie Sheen said he agrees with Alex Jones and then parroted some of the things he said. Bunch of people called him brave, others called him a coke-snorting looney. It's not like he's contributing any new developments to the arguments. It's quite hyperbole to say 100% of humanity knows both these guys. About as many people know Howard Stern and Hugh Hefner, do we have an article for every time Hefner shows up on Stern's show? --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 15:19, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>A couple of thoughts about comparing the Sheen/Jones article to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Berlin_controversy_involving_Michael_Jackson_a882.html" title="2002 Berlin controversy involving Michael Jackson">2002 Berlin controversy involving Michael Jackson</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not denying Sheen's notability, Michael Jackson is more notable by an order of magnitude.</li>
<li>Rather than detailing each day's new revelation, the Jackson article provides a brief synposis in narrative form of the event.</li>
<li>The Jackson article does not try to provide links to every media mention of the event.</li>
<li>The Jackson article does not attempt to provide transcripts of the event's related media coverage.</li>
<li>The Jackson article does not include a large section of "statements by the two, and not as necearly verified facts" (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen_and_Alex_Jones_interviews#March_20.2C_First_interview_with_Alex_Jones" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen_and_Alex_Jones_interviews#March_20.2C_First_interview_with_Alex_Jones" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).</li>
<li>The Jackson article provides three external references that neutrally report on the event. (Sheen/Jones includes an incredible number of links to PrisonPlanet.com and other Jones-related websites).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while the Sheen/Jones event might be considered worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia, its current structure is <i>not</i> very encyclopedic. The Jackson article provides a suitable model for the encyclopedic mention of such an event. It should summarize the event, provide its context, provide a few relevant links. --mtz206 17:17, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It does, however, add support to the notion that the article, standing by itself, is not notable or would be better merged with the Sheen article or some other related topic. As to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Berlin_controversy_involving_Michael_Jackson_a882.html" title="2002 Berlin controversy involving Michael Jackson">2002 Berlin controversy involving Michael Jackson</a> article, that one is currently undergoing a vote for merger with the main Michael Jackson article.

<dd>Please read the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> and the summary I wrote when deleting it, which explains how I arrived at the figures I did and why I made the decision I did. Discounting votes by new and anon users is normal and AfD isn't a vote anyway. This is being discussed at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:52, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AfD isn't a vote; it's an attempt to determine a rough consensus. If a consensus is not reached, the page should be kept. That's black-letter policy, and I don't think anything resembling a consensus was reached in this case. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 20:40, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This deletion is a scandal, i demand the article to be undelted right now! --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 17:25, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thryduulf, I have read the policy, and frankly you're not following it. There's no "rule" that people with less than X number of edits must be "discounted". According to the policy "civil" and "logical" comments, even by new users, shouldn't be discounted. You clearly didn't follow that rule. Nakedtruth 18:47, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>GRuban, you only gave part of the quote. "Civil" and "logical" comments by new users aren't to be discounted. Nakedtruth 22:05, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The full passage is: "Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith (for example, if they misrepresent their reasons). Conversely, the opinions of logged in users whose accounts predate the article's AfD nomination are given more weight." <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 22:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
