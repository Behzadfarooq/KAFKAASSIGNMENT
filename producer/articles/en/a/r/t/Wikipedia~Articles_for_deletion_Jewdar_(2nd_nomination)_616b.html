<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Of those who argued 'keep', I find very little to back up their claims. Richard Arthur Norton's argument that people come to Wikipedia to find out what a word means is untrue - that is what a dictionary is for (and Wiktionary don't accept urban neologisms). Weirdoactor asserts it passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> without showing why, and proceeds to attack all those who opined 'delete'. AnonEMouse says to keep as it's a 'many-off joke' (I do not understand this). RockMFR admits it has not been the subject of multiple reliable references yet suggests 'keep' anyway. Tarninth's keep is ignored. House of Scandal's keep is based on 'I like it'. Lyrl states it has multiple reliable sources, when it does not. Pseudothyrum states it ought to be kept as it will pass into the mainstream at a later date - Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Darkspots, finally, fails to address <i>why</i> the article should be kept with any reference to policy or guideline, instead saying that it should be kept as <i>there are people who simply know whether or not someone is Jewish--and they really do, there is a set of signals</i>; not a good reason for an encyclopaedia article.</p>
<p>The "delete"s surround its lack of reliable sources (agreed), original synthesis (maybe), trivial coverage only (agreed), it being a dictionary definition (not really correct), and being a neologism (agreed). I beliebe the arguments for deletion strongly outweigh those to keep, and thus, delete. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 14:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was previously nominated at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jewdar_45b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jewdar">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jewdar</a>. The article had a substantial re-write after most of the "delete no sources" weighed in, and although the sources were weak, they were enough to nullify the previous arguments. I closed it as no-consensus and suggested that it be renominated so that there could be frank discussion of the quality of the sources. It's oddly gone through <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2006_December_29_0f13.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 December 29">Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 December 29</a> first, but right back here it is.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article now provides a lot of references, but these are all to mere <i>use</i> of the term.

<li><b>Keep</b> it's a many-off joke.

<li><b>Delete</b>, if you take out the stuff that is sourced to Urban Dictionary, mailing lists and forums, you're left with "Jewdar means you can tell when other people are Jews."

<ul>
<li>If by "next to nothing", you mean "articles that assert the notability of Jewdar", then you are SPOT ON. I'll read more carefully if you promise to do the same, especially before making counterfactual arguments in an AfD. And re: "Jewdars" (sic), the term has no plural; much like <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deer.html" title="Deer">deer</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moose.html" title="Moose">moose</a>. As to how Jewdar has affected me; I have it, passed from my mother and father, and it has led me to MANY tasty meals and lovely parties. So there. I’m not sure how jewdar has affected me PERSONALLY should be relevant as to it’s inclusion in the encyclopedia, as the last time I checked, it’s called “Wikipedia”, and not “weirdoactorpedia” or “recurypedia”, and thus the entries should <i>probably</i> reflect a broader range of needs and experiences than yours and mine. After all, what is Wikipedia but “a comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field”, correct? -- <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">weirdoactor</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/e/i/User_talk%7EWeirdoactor_eae5.html" title="User talk:Weirdoactor">t</a></sup><sup>|</sup><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Weirdoactor_bb16.html" title="Special:Contributions/Weirdoactor">c</a></sup> 20:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not talking about notability (although that case for deletion can certainly be made). I'm talking about having sources to actually write an article from. Even if they did assert notability (which they don't) that would leave us with an article that says: "Jewdar means you can tell when other people are Jews. Jewdar is a notable neologism that has been used upwards of 3 times in published writing." Find some reliable sources that talk about the term enough that you could actually write something substantive about it, or it's going to be deleted. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 20:44, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

Yes, the term is used "jokingly" - that's the nature of the term not a basis for deletion of the article. BTW, I think "jewdar" <i>is</i> stupid, unclever, and (yes) quasi-racist term -- but it is of interest to Wikipedians and my opinion of the word doesn't matter.

<dd><b>Comment</b> If Wikipedia was around 25 years ago, we'd be having this argument about "Yuppie". And I think there is definitely a phenomenon where, if you're in a particular group, you can tell who is and isn't one of your group even when you can't go by physical appearance. The use of the terms "Jewdar" or "Goydar" are allusions to the obvious example of this phenomenon, "Gaydar". <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquidfryerchef_cfcf.html" title="User:Squidfryerchef">Squidfryerchef</a> 22:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>User:Humus sapiens says that Wikipedia doesn't have articles on neologisms, yet "Category:Neologisms" is alive and very well stocked; in fact, there are about 150 words in that category (not to mention "Category:Portmanteaus," "Category:Slang," among others) and I just added that category to this article. Echoing User:Weirdoactor, just a brief look around Wikipedia and one finds such words as Tillmonkey, <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yak_shaving.html" title="Yak shaving">Yak shaving</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kripkenstein.html" title="Kripkenstein">Kripkenstein</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmocrat.html" title="Cosmocrat">Cosmocrat</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraudience.html" title="Fraudience">Fraudience</a>, among MANY others -- these pages are in existence and are not disputed (and are not as notable and/or widespread as Jewdar), the only sources supporting most of those articles being the Urban Dictionary and various informal blogs. In fact, some of those articles <i>don't even have sources</i> and yet no one disputes their existence, while this article has at last count <b>12 sources</b> (including the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, <i>The New York Press</i>, salon.com, etc).</dd>

<dd>At base this is an issue of what is and is not considered 'JC' by the people (overwhelmingly Jews) that create, expand, and upkeep articles dealing with Jews, Judaism, and Jewish issues -- there are certain people here that let their own personal views of Jewish issues cloud their judgment when it comes to keeping a NPOV in regards to Jewish-themed articles and vehemently (nay: FANATICALLY) oppose anything that is not entirely squeaky clean and 'JC.' This is obviously what is happening here. --172.132.170.249 05:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Apparently you neglected to read the info-box at the top of that page -- I quote: "<b>This is an essay</b>. It is <b>not</b> a policy or guideline." The part about "<b>not</b> being a policy or guideline" is, as you know, quite important, so I'm not why you would try to present it here as binding Wikipedia protocol. Finally, I would just like to say that the continued irrationality and blatant POV with which this article deletion (or 'vote') is pursued only reveals the true motivations of the people advocating for its deletion. --172.135.86.62 00:25, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article, with the new material, convinces me of its relevance and notability. The basic cultural question is, <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> There is no really quick answer, although I guess a lot of folks would differ with that assertion. Writing about Jewdar is uncomfortable but it makes the point that on the one hand you have a complicated definition with a lot of nuances and debate and angst, but, cutting through that, there are many people who simply <i>know</i> whether or not someone is Jewish--and they really do, there is a set of signals. It would never fly but <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> should link to this article.
