<p><b>(1)</b> Delete <b>this article as completely and utterly unencyclopedic.</b><br /></p>
<p><i>First off, this provides no reason. You are just saying it does not belong on Wikipedia through no argument. It is not a point. Also, encyclopedia is defined by the American Heritage Dictionary as "Embracing many subjects; comprehensive." By embracing many subjects, it means none are excluded. Thus, by this definition, argument (1) is proven false.<br /></i></p>
<p><b>(2) Nobody has ever been blocked just for nominating an article on VfD. There are no restrictions on what can and cannot be nominated here.</b></p>
<p><i>My votes have been changed, you are assuming things that aren't true. Also, this is completely irrelevant to the arguments and voting</i><br /></p>
<p><b>(3) Calling people who frequent Wikipedia retards (as in your link) is flaming, which is not tolerated here.</b><br /></p>
<p><i>Aside from being completely irrelevant, you should enjoy some humor in a conflicting situations. Americans make fun of themselves as stereotypes, so do some <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipediholic_2ec3.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipediholic">Wikiholics</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a>. Even Helen Keller did. Also, this is not vandalism or "flaming," as you call it. In here we can make points and the points are even better if they are right or can't be disproven. Also, to use this as an argument is <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_Hominem_3cf8.html" title="Argumentum ad Hominem">Argumentum ad Hominem</a>, which is a logical fallacy.</i><br /></p>
<p><b>(4) A "sub-legal" process? Filtering the information in our articles is perfectly legal; there are no laws prohibiting us from doing with our website what we want, and we choose to include and exclude information based on what we collectively deem worthy to be in an encyclopedia. This process allows us to build an informative resource without being flooded with inane contributions that have no place in a work of reference (like this).</b><br /></p>
<p><i>Please note that referring to forensic or legal does not imply anything about American law. I was talking about a process, in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">the place of conflict</a>, which is used to destroy information while upholding certain integrities and rules, which make a legal process. This is a partition in this legal process. Also, by the earlier definition of encyclopedic, this work is encyclopedic. Would you like me to look up informative to give you an idea of what it means? This article gives <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>, to <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_Wow_6ef4.html" title="Bow Wow">Wikipedians</a>. By your logic, I chose to include the article because it is based on what <a href="../../../s/o/m/Some.html" title="Some">some</a> deem to be worthy to be in an encyclopedia. Your logic is faulty, proving me right</i> No hard feelings? --24.93.213.84 23:11, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm really not going to nit-pick this issue since in the end, all the votes that count (yours doesn't count because you have not registered an account) have been to delete, and there is no way this article is being kept. For the record, no reason has to be given <i>why</i> something is unencyclopedic for a vote to count. It seems pretty obviously not appropriate for a reference work according to everyone else so I don't really feel the need to explain myself. Just because something counts as information doesn't mean it belongs in an encyclopedia. Someone on here (I don't remember who exactly) once made the analogy of Wikipedia as an organism: we must take in food (information) and build the useful parts of that food into the bulk of the organism while excreting that which doesn't contribute to the overall health of the organism. In our case, this means deleting that information which doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. We get a lot of articles which are clearly factual in nature but the subject matter is not notable enough or appropriate for inclusion in an encyclopedia. This is not just some collection of every piece of information we can possibly find. No hard feelings, but I won't continue to debate this issue any further as VfD is cluttered up as it is and none of this is going to change the fate of the article. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 01:02, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Where does it say that? All people that know how to edit and use Wikipedia should be given "voting rights". If not, then it would be considered elitist; and judging from your views on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-communism.html" title="Anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a> in your user page, there should be no rigid class structure where it is not needed. Also, he/she isn't really anonymous because everybody who can connect to the internet has an IP address. --24.93.213.84 23:30, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Because of serious problems in the past with people attempting to use <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a> to "stuff the ballot box", we have established a fairly firm rule on this page that the votes of anonymous users and very new users are subject to steep discounting by the admin who finally makes the decision. However, any facts you can add to the discussion are welcome and will be considered by the community. To whoever has been blanking the anonymous votes, <b>PLEASE STOP</b>. Trust that the deciding admin will investigate them and weight them appropriately. Marking suspicious votes is a courtesy but erasing comments just confuses the discussion thread and incites unnecessary confrontation. To the anon who was tampering with other people's votes, stop that too. What you did is immediately obvious to anyone reviewing the edit history. It seriously prejudices the case against you. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:36, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Allowing anonymous users to vote would create a few problems: firstly, an IP address does not identify a user uniquely -- some people's ISP does not give them the same IP every time they log onto the Internet, for example. Or a logged-in user could log out and get a second vote signed with their IP. Or somebody could vote five times at five of their friends' houses. Getting an account only takes a minute and is free. You don't even need to give out your name or email or anything, so in theory everybody is equally entitled to a vote, although it helps a lot to have a history of helpful contributions attributed to your account. While not strictly necessary, it lets people know you're not a sock puppet, plus it helps to have experience in Wikipedia community so you get a good feel for what is and isn't encyclopedic before voting on Votes for Deletion. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 00:24, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b> the article. Not notable enough for a whole article. Wikipedia is not a jokebook. However, this <b>was</b> a real category of joke that experienced a vogue circa, um, (counting on figures... age of kids... grade they were in when they came home with these kneeslappers...) the mid-1980s. Or maybe it's long been popular among fifth-graders. When I was in junior high school there was a fad for what were called "sick jokes" of this kind; I don't remember a Helen Keller subcategory but it probably evolved over time. I would love to think that all the delete votes are because these jokes <b>have</b> gone out of style and are no longer familiar. Do we have an article tracing the rise and fall of categories of jokes? We should, and this category should be mentioned. Do people still tell "elephant jokes?" (Q: How do you put six elephants in a Volkswagen? A. Three in front, three in back. Q: What did Tarzan say when he saw the elephants coming over the hill? A: "Here come the elephants over the hill.") <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:50, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> — no potential to become encyclopedic, and Wikipedia is not a jokebook. However, as I understand it, anonymous users <i>do</i> have the right to vote; no one should be removing their votes. If the user has done something questionable or not signed the vote, one may add a comment; or, if the user has added irrelevant material, like complex voting schemes, one may <del>strike</del> the extra material—but it should normally not be removed. Administrators traditionally give little importance to anonymous votes due to the problems mentioned above, but anonymous users still have a voice here. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker দ</a> (<a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">talk</a>) 05:25, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
