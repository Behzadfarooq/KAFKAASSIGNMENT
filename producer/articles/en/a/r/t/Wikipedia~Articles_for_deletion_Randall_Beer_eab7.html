<dd>There's a higher bar for professional sports team selection than for being academic, and its silly to throw out the idea of relative degrees of academic notabilty altogether. Just getting a PhD or even a Master's means that you have published academically and have a high chance of being cited (<i>I</i> have a master's degree thesis which has been published by a major university and in a leading industry online magazine (with an Alexa rank of ~8,500). The research has recieved coverage in a Canadian national newspaper and a couple of US regional newspapers. It's also been cited in at least two published books, one by a leading academic and another by a mainstream journalist, as well as being cited in several other academic papers, including one published by a leading law school. I've also co-authored an article for the Harvard Business Review. Does this citation/authorship record make me notable? Definitely not.) The "all academics publish" argument is not as simple as you state it - another key part of the argument is that much of what is published is not academically or encyclopedically notable. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man_argument.html" title="Straw man argument">straw man argument</a>. I have never argued that "being academic" should be the bar for inclusion or even that all academics who have been published should have articles. Being a 20-year old selected for a professional soccer team and playing a couple of seasons before retiring into obscurity is currently enough to get an article in Wikipedia. That is not an achievement comparable to what is usually required to be appointed to a professorial chair at a university, or what most professors achieve over a lifetime. I will admit that I am more familiar with Northern European universities, and I realise that in the U.S. almost any teacher at a tertiary institution is a "professor" of some kind, but I think allowing articles on full professors at major American research universities is usually reasonable. By "major research universities" I mean institutions internationally known for their research and having doctoral programs in most fields. I'm not very familiar with <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_University_Bloomington_7806.html" title="Indiana University Bloomington">Indiana University Bloomington</a>, where Beer works, but I believe it qualifies. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 17:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An academe's publications need not be sufficient to meet <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> Ball players play ball. Academes do not routinely publish books that are read beyond academia. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 22:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure I follow your argument. There is nothing inherently notable about playing ball. And publishing books read beyond academia is not necessary to be notable as an academic; what counts is publishing books or articles influential and widely cited in one's field ("regarded as an important figure by those in the same field" in the words of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> – looking at citations is one of several ways to determine that). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 08:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
