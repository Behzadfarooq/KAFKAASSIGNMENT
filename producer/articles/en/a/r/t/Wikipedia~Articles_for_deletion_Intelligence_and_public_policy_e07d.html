<li><b>Comment</b> I was using the phrase "original research" as per <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a> with regards to 'synthesizes work in a non-standard way' as well as 'introduces an original argument purporting to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position described in the article'. It, in conjunction with the other article <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> by this same author that recently passed VfD, begin to present a disturbing trend that seems to violate <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Not a soapbox</a>. Please note that the above the fold here contains, <i>"A large body of research indicates that intelligence varies between individuals and, to a lesser extent, between racial groups."</i> How is that relevant to this article? Why has the author chosen to include that? This article is well written and referenced, but that is not the criterion for inclusion. Perhaps I am being <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melodrama.html" title="Melodrama">melodramatic</a>, perhaps I'm not demonstrating <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">faith</a>. But I highly recomend that anyone who choses to vote on this make a careful reading of the text, examine other contributions by this user (and by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman">me</a>, for that matter) and <i>think carefully</i> before you vote. Just as you should do every time, of course. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 03:45, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I saw it, the reason the reference to racial groups is made is because IQ tests seem to favor certain racial groups; thus, policy that is based on IQ scores is going to run into racial discrimination problems. I definitely think that it's POV to say "intelligence varies between racial groups," as this implies that IQ tests accurately measure intelligence, which is far from an accepted fact. But, putting POV issues aside as of course is appropriate in VfD discussion, I do believe an NPOV article on this subject is possible, just like it is possible with <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>. Probably a nightmare to actually make it happen, but, oh well.

<li>That's right; race is only mentioned because it is a primary topic in the debate, has been a subject of two Civil Rights Acts and a Supreme Court decision, and remains an active area of cognitive research and policy debate today. While I cannot countenance Aaron's suspicion, I do support his prescription.

<li>In what way is an article entitled Intelligence and public policy encyclopedic? I could write a huge article on the stregths and weaknesses of policy issues from government's around the world, and the intelligence involved in creating them, but that's way too broad. The title is broad and meaningless. Unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 18:01, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is about intelligence as a subject of public policy, not the role of intelligence in crafting public policy. --<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikurzhen_bafb.html" title="User:Rikurzhen">Rikurzhen</a> 18:28, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your description is way too broad. The scope of the article is much narrower than your comment suggests. The article, a planned expansion of related material in other articles as indicated in the second vote above, focuses explicitly on public policies which specifically regard intelligence testing (e.g. employment law and disparate impact), intelligence measures (e.g. execution of low-IQ criminals), or correlates for which a significant and specific debate exists regarding the role of intelligence (e.g. achievement gaps and No Child Left Behind). The article's title reflects the commonly used terms; that it can be read too broadly is a common problem with titles, and misunderstanding should be quickly dispatched by the article's content, which is quite focused. --<a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrummond_f766.html" title="User:Drummond">DAD</a> <a href="../../../d/r/u/User_talk%7EDrummond_069e.html" title="User talk:Drummond"><sup>T</sup></a> 18:37, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly. The title is broad and meaningless, and so unencyclopedic, and the content POV or at best poorly mistitled, since many states do not even entertain execution and all the examples seem to be U.S. based. The content would thus still be unencyclopedic as surely it's a thesis. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 22:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Restriction to US is hardly grounds for deletion. Specific policies cited in the article are US-only yet have their own WP pages. "...since many states do not even entertain execution" -- this is a red herring, since the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Supreme_Court_76bb.html" title="US Supreme Court">US Supreme Court</a> ruled on the issue and created a US-wide law. "Surely its a thesis" -- given the citations, one can <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verify</a> quite easily that it's not a thesis. WP editors are invited to do so. The charge of POV is of course fair, though as many voters have noted, need for POV cleanup does not imply need for deletion. Similarly, the request for a more specific title and the vote to delete seem quite disparate. --<a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrummond_f766.html" title="User:Drummond">DAD</a> <a href="../../../d/r/u/User_talk%7EDrummond_069e.html" title="User talk:Drummond"><sup>T</sup></a> 23:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Try these: <i>All military recruits take the Armed Forces Qualification Test</i>, what, everywhere? and <i>The present article covers particular policies and policy areas, generally in the US</i>. A self referring article as well no less. Also, at the very least it has to be Western in bias, and therefore unencyclopedic, since the scope of the article's title will not allow anything less than a broad meaningless overview of all policies, all government and all examinations of intelligence. The only true content on this page would surely have to be something akin to <i>some people think public policy in some parts of the world is designed to discriminate in some way on the issue of intelligence, which may possibly be measured in certain ways, but then again may not, and other people may disagree, whilst in other parts of the world people don't even recognise these as issues. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 22:36, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</i>
<ul>
<li>Which part of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> does that satisfy?

<li>"The only true content on this page"...fascinating. I stipulate that the Supreme Court rulings, the discussion of disparate impact, the No Child Left Behind law, the quote from Murphy, the citations attributed to Gottfredson, the statement regarding cognitive ability testing's status as the single best predictor of job performance, the reference to the theory of situational specificity, and the statement regarding the AFQT (when properly restricted to the US military) are all <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiable</a>, among (many) others. Please, don't take my word for it; verify. Moreover, the claim that an article must cover all policies, all governments and all examinations of intelligence is pure opinion (and <i>prima facie</i> difficult to swallow, IMHO); WP policy stipulates no such thing. The article is the proper place for material on other countries' policies as well. As the article is roughly 24 hours old, it can hardly be faulted for being a bit drafty. You're invited to flesh it out -- verifiably, of course. --<a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrummond_f766.html" title="User:Drummond">DAD</a> <a href="../../../d/r/u/User_talk%7EDrummond_069e.html" title="User talk:Drummond"><sup>T</sup></a> 23:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course, some of these statements regardless of their verifiability need to be limited or qualified in various ways. For instance, the statement that cognitive ability testing is the single best predictor of job performance: what were the other predictors against which it was tested? Obviously, not all possible ones. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 14:12, 2005 July 12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's true. In this case the statement is part of a direct quote. Also, similar statements appear widely in the literature (and the Hunter and Hunter paper cited is among the seminal primary references for it); the statement represents the consensus position among experts. Perhaps the tweak you're looking for is "best single predictor <i>known</i>" which for experts is perhaps implicit. For the curious (and this is not meant to be a defense of the article, only a response to the comment) cognitive ability testing has been compared to job interviews, job experience, biographical inventory, education, age, personality characteristics such as conscientiousness and agreeableness, and a host of other predictors; in most cases, and particularly for medium- to high-complexity jobs, nothing else comes close to IQ testing in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predictive_validity.html" title="Predictive validity">predictive validity</a>. --<a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrummond_f766.html" title="User:Drummond">DAD</a> <a href="../../../d/r/u/User_talk%7EDrummond_069e.html" title="User talk:Drummond"><sup>T</sup></a> 15:42, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Important topic carefully and articulated explored, if in a somewhat POV way. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarmeld1_1b08.html" title="User:Carmeld1">carmeld1</a> 22:36, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>: This could become a very useful reference article, a hallmark of what the Wikipedia is all about. The issue strikes to the heart of matters related to man-made disasters and the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_principle.html" title="Peter principle">Peter principle</a>. So long as public administrators continue to veer toward 'no child left behind'-esque lowest common denominator policies, then all the more thought provoking counterbalances need to be added. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Keirsey_435c.html" title="David Keirsey">David Keirsey</a> has found slight IQ differences along the four parameters of temperament, and it might be noted that the non-linear conjunctive traits, INFP, are the ones his research found to have to one to three point higher IQs, in comparison to the more linear, disjunctive traits, ESTJ. The upshot is that education and politics tend towards <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-intellectual.html" title="Anti-intellectual">anti-intellectual</a> discrimination against those who find it uncomfortable to toe the establishment line. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 04:37, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Cryptoracist POV. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 12:05, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>IMHO, that a very unhelpful opinion. In the U.S. population, most variation in IQ occurs (1) within familes and (2) between families of the same race and social class. Claiming that discussion of this topic is racist is like claiming that a discussion of poverty is racist. --<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikurzhen_bafb.html" title="User:Rikurzhen">Rikurzhen</a> 23:14, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
