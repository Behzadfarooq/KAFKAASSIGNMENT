The Greater Kingston Girls' Hockey Association (GKGHA) is a hockey program in Kingston, Ontario, Canada especially for girls wishing to partake in the game of ice hockey either at a recreational or competitive level. The age of the players ranges from five to adult.</p>
<p>The Ice Wolves were formed from existing girls hockey programs in the City of Kingston during an amalgamation process that took place during the period November 2001, to April 2002. An amalgamation committee - with representation from both Comet and Kodiak Girls' Hockey Associations - facilitated the amalgamation process, and succeeded in securing the support of the membership of both organizations in creating the Greater Kingston Girls' Hockey Association.</p>
<p>An interim Executive Committee and Board of Directors formed on 17 April 2002, and its first meeting took place on 24 April. This group immediately went to work to create a Constitution, Terms of Reference, Operating Policies, a fundraising campaign, a budget, a registration plan, a league structure, an equipment procurement plan, to complete incorporation, and so forth. Key organizational efforts were focused on selecting the club name, logo, and colors.</p>
<p>On 1 June 2002 , the Greater Kingston Girls' Hockey Association celebrated its inauguration, having by then selected its club name - the Ice Wolves, along with a logo, and club colors - black, white, and gold. A committee comprising a wide range of Ice Wolves selected the name, logo, and colors. The winning logo was designed and submitted to the committee by Melissa and Michelle Scott of Kingston.</p>
<p>The Ice Wolves were privileged to present the very first Ice Wolves jersey to our hometown Olympic Hockey star - Jayna Hefford, on 26 July 2002, at the Amherstview Arena.</p>
<p>The very first House League Game played in the Greater Kingston Girls' Hockey Association was played on 12 October 2002 . The legendary "Cookie" Cartwright dropped the puck to start the game.</p>
<p>The Ice wolves hosted their first competitive teams tournament - the Kingston Cup, during the weekend of 1-3 November 2002. The first Ice Wolves Association House League tournament - the Ice Wolves Cup, was held during the weekend of 17-19 January 2003.</p>
<p>Currently, the President is Dan Dolan, accompanied by Randy Scott, Paul McAuley, Ann St. Cyr, and Mike Gillis in the positions of Vice President, Tresurer, Secretary, and Director of Hockey Operations, respectively. Other than members of the executive, the organization is comprised of numerous board representatives of the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Online advertising is advertising done exclusively on the web or through e-mail. Different Types of online ads include static banner adverts, enriched media ads, email advertising as well as newsletter sponsoring. Some sites also allow for page branding for organizations to ensure exclusivity of certain web pages within a site.</p>
<p>The role of the Internet in enabling online advertising cannot be over emphasized. Regardless of the technology gap between developing countries like Nigeria and developed countries, it is imperative for multinational organizations, their affiliates, banks, manufacturing industries, telecommunications, oil and gas sectors as well as small businesses to maintain their competitive edge when competing in the global market place. In maintaining this edge such corporations have ventured to the unfamiliar territories of online advertising.</p>
<p>Internet audience size in the US has grown 16% over the past 12 months and half of the American Internet population (57 million users) log on at least once every single day. Consequently growth of online media spending is increasing at a rate of approximately 30% year to year. In Africa alone, there are currently about 33 million Internet users in the continent with a growth of over 625% between 2000 and 2007.According to the Australian media, online advertising topped one billion dollars in 2006. Statistics for Nigeria in September 2006 states there are currently 5 million internet users (3.1% of population) but with a significant 2400% growth between 2000 and 2007.</p>
<p>Online advertising offers a unique combination of scalability, cost-effectiveness, desirable demographics, highly targeted marketing, a rapidly growing audience and unmatched tracking capabilities. Ad banners combine the benefits of broadcast, print, and direct mail advertising, making them a great tool both for branding and for driving transactions. Other benefits of online advertising include scalability, desirable demographics in terms of the users of Internet, targeted marketing, and flexibility with regards to the volumes you can purchase as a result of ability to buy ads by impression. It also acts a gateway to advertiserâs site thereby providing more content than traditional media. As an online advertiser, you would have access to monitor the performance of your site from any location with Internet access which can assist in changes to your marketing strategy. You can take advantage of new technology that use video or, animation for a more visual message.</p>
<p>Increasingly as a result of these benefits, various organizations including Blue Chip Companies are reaping the benefits of including online strategies to enhance their marketing campaign. One of such companies in Nigeria proving this e-platform for advertising is enownow.com. In addition to online advertising features on this portal, enownow.com also offers its visitors dynamic portal services to create a rich experience. eNowNow.com also has a range of services for the corporate world. It provides an e-platform for advert placement for organizations wishing to have a presence on the World Wide Web. Other companies offering such services include web gallery Nigeria which is similar to the million dollar website.</p>
<p>These services are tailored in response to organizations needs for an e-platform for their marketing campaign in order to take advantage of the internet.Online advertising can be tailored to any organization regardless of size. advertising online provides endless opportunities for both marketers and advertisers.</p>

Stephen Hensby was a native of Hall Carr, Rawtenstall, Rossendale, Lancashire. In his fifty's he received notoriety when he was the centre piece of an armed dispute in July 2005. The actual reasons for such a dispute centre on his eviction from the propertly as a result of anti social behaviour. However, the officers that got involved in the dispute, have been said to be merely making a 'routine' visit of Mr Hensby's property.</p>
<p>A fairly well known person in local vacinity, many saw him as an ecentric which was typicalised by his alter-ego, "Krusty Man". Often seen around local walls and bridges by spray paint, often with a figure of a bmx under or next to the words.</p>
<p>The dispute ended abruptly, eighteen hours after it has initially started (a policeman had received a gun shot injury in the meantime), shots were heard from the property and after police hade gained entry, they found Mr Hensby dead alongside his dog, also dead.</p>
<p>This news made television and newspaper headlines, and shocked locals as Rawtenstall had never seen such events previously.</p>

<p>EXCLUSIVE: AN INTERVIEW TOO PERSONAL WITH MR.MARKETING (PROF. PHILIP KOTLER) BY NWOKOCHA CHINENYE SMITH.ON THE 3rd FEB. 2007.</p>
<p>Marketing guru Philip Kotler is S.C. Johnson &amp; Son Distinguished Professor of International Marketing at the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, USA. He is widely regarded as the worldâs leading authority on the strategic practice of marketing and was instrumental in transforming marketing into an academic discipline. Professor Kotlerâs 700-page Marketing Management (originally published in 1967 and soon to appear in its 12th updated edition) was named by the Financial Times as âone of the 50 top business books of all timeâ and it is the most widely used text in graduate schools of business throughout the world. Kotlerâs textbooks have sold over three million copies and have been translated into 20 languages. Kotler on Marketing: how to create, win and dominate markets, his latest book, is written specifically for business leaders and managers.</p>
<p>Philip Kotler was voted a Leader in Marketing Thought by the academic members of the American Marketing Association (AMA), and he was the first recipient of the AMAâs Distinguished Marketing Educator Award. In 1995, the Sales and Marketing Executives International (SMEI) named Professor Kotler a Marketer of the Year. Philip Kotler has been a consultant in the areas of marketing strategy and planning, marketing organization and international marketing to numerous companies including IBM, General Electric, Ford, Apple, Motorola, AT &amp; T, Honeywell, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Merck. He may not have invented Marketing, but Philip Kotler sure has done more than any other person to reinvent the discipline and bring it to its modern maturity. In fact, some would argue that Marketing truly came of age only as Kotler did; with more than half-century of academic leadership as this year marks his 76th birthday.</p>
<p>He is my âMentor and Lord in Marketingâ</p>
<p>QUESTIONS FROM SMITH NWOKOCHA TO THE FATHER OF MARKETING</p>
<p>QUESTION 1</p>
<p>You had your first degree in Economics and today you are a known marketing professor, author, consultant of world most leading firms like International Business Machine (IBM), including Bank of America and many others too numerous to mention, how did you arrive to this?</p>
<p>ANSWER FROM PROF. PHILIP KOTLER (MR. MARKETING).</p>
<p>I felt that economists did not sufficiently understand the marketplace. They focused on explaining price determination but left out all the other demand shaping forces in the marketplace such as advertising, promotion, and distribution. Economists were not able to offer help to producers on such questions as how many sales people are needed, how much to spend on advertising, what kinds of advertising works best, and a host of other unanswered questions. These questions seemed more interesting to me because the answers would help business people make better decisions.</p>
<p>QUESTION 2</p>
<p>You are a mortal with immortal words and wisdom in the field of Marketing, Management, Business and the like. What is your advice to other marketing lovers, students, lecturers and firms?</p>
<p>ANSWER FROM KOTLER</p>
<p>I hope that marketers will no see marketing as a bag of tricks to get customers to buy things they donât need. Marketing is the art and science of meeting human needs and desires with solutions in the form of goods, services, and ideas. Its essential purpose is to raise the standard of living and the meaningfulness of consumer experience.</p>
<p>QUESTION 3</p>
<p>Is there any comparison between Marketing and Economics that can graduate to MARKETING ECONOMICS?</p>
<p>ANSWER FROM KOTLER</p>
<p>I am in favor of creating a branch of economics called marketing economics positioned between macroeconomics and microeconomics.</p>
<p>The rest of the questions and answers can be gathered from âguruâ books, etc.</p>
<p>Time does not permit further interviews.</p>
<p>Cordially,</p>
<p><br />

<p>THE FUTURE OF MARKETING AND THE DYNAMISM OF ITS OPERATING ENVIRONMENT (WITH CONTEMPORARY ISSUES)</p>
<p>In a globalize world like the 21st Century we are, virtually everything is marketable. It is a universal truth that marketing is the wheel and spring of life for products.</p>
<p>With the continued proliferation of the Internet, the meaning of the word âmarketingâ also proliferates. There seem to be as many definitions of marketing as there are marketers.</p>
<p>Many see marketing as a series of tactics or gimmicks. Some see it as a push pyramid programs [multi-level marketing (MLM) or network marketing] as the way to successful marketing.</p>
<p>Others may say the Web has made traditional marketing obsolete. I say the internet has expanded our capabilities, created new ways of doing business, and radically changed business dynamics. It has not, however, changed the foundation of marketing.</p>
<p>Basic, traditional marketing is as relevant as ever. The Four Pâs â Product, Price, Place (distribution), and Promotion â whether you tack on added Pâs, Câs and Lâs or not, are still very much alive. Strategic thinking, segmenting, and targeting can still earn you a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Marketing still means determining what our customers need and want, planning how we are going to meet those needs and wants, and then implementing our plan.</p>
<p>We still have products, services, and ideas to sell at some price. We still deliver to our customers via some means of distribution. We still promote and we still advertise. Those are the basics. Those basics still exist and always will.</p>
<p>What has changed is the business environment. Companies compete with more efficient technologies. Customers have better access to their cost options and they communicate to each other in a not even conceivable in the pre-Internet age.</p>
<p>In some industries, the Internet has lowered the cost of entry so that entrepreneurs â many times from a home office â have entered the competition. The changes in competitive environment are numerous. What have also changed are marketing strategies and the marketing programs we have available to implement those strategies.</p>
<p>These have changed, but basic marketing has not. Superior marketing is and always has been analysis, then action. It is strategy development, then logical and thought-out tactical implementation. It is the way to customer satisfaction and increasing profit. (Bobette Kyle,2004).</p>
<p>These are some of the reasons why we have to rethink our marketing, and here is my argument about marketingâs new test: marketing may have won the war and destroyed itself in the process. What do we mean by that?</p>
<p>Many product driven companies have become market driven, we wanted them to become market driven, we said âPay attention to the customer, do not make a widget and try to sell it, try to figure out what unmet needs customers have and design a solutionâ. And we have won that war, at least conceptually most companies say yes we want to be market driven. Every one in these companies focus on satisfying the customer, we want the manufacturing person in the company to welcome prospects and customers into the factory which looks clean, efficient and impressive on the customer; the factory becomes a tool for marketing. The accountant should answer the question of any customer immediately about why the bill is what it is. We want every function to think customer. So we won that point.</p>
<p>So then the question is, âWhat is marketingâs role?â That is, we, like doctors who have cured every disease, are no longer needed. Maybe we are needed in a company with the role of providing colleagues with a deeper understanding of customer needs, perceptions and preferences. It might be argued that thatâs our role. We are so customer minded and sophisticated that we can help our colleagues understand customers better.</p>
<p>My argument is that marketers have really two new roles now. One, they should help their company move from being market driven to customer driven. Let me explain that in a moment. And then to help their company move from being market driven to market driving.</p>
<p>Well, let us take the first one just briefly, and it goes like this if you want to visualize it: we have been product driven â most companies start with a product and then they look and search for customers, they hire salesman and say please find us customers, and now we have changed the idea, we say no, find a market, target it, find out its needs, do the best you can and be superior to your competitors in satisfying those needs. So that is what we call the STP formula, Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning.</p>
<p>Example: Dell computer today is selling N1billion of computers, each day, over the Internet. Thatâs astonishing. Now this is direct marketing of computers. Compaq is in a bind. Compaq sells its computers through retailers. It now has to move direct too. Now it is hard to do what we call dual distribution, namely you are selling through retailers and you are selling around them by going direct. And it hardly ever works, and I do not know if Compaq are going to make it for the following reasons: they are going to do patch work on their business system to do some direct marketing but they are not wholeheartedly committed to only direct marketing, they are going to continue to do retail marketing, and somehow they are not duplicating the cost structure that is enjoyed by Dell as a computer. Dell will have the competitive advantage of a lower cost structure in spite of what Compaq does. In other words, Dell has made it too hard for Compaq and other competitors to actually reach the efficiency of the system that they are using.</p>
<p>Then the question arises, basically how do you do breakthroughs? What kind of breakthroughs are we talking about? We are talking about the market driving firm can create new markets to begin with â that is not something you do every day or every year, but you think about new markets. CNN of course created a whole new market called âreal-time 24-hour global newsâ. FedEx developed a whole new market called âovernight deliveryâ. (Prof.Philip Kotler, 2005)</p>
<p>MR.MARKETING (PROF. PHILIP KOTLER)âS TRUISM ON MARKETING</p>
<p>Todayâs central problem facing business is not a shortage of goods but a shortage of customers. Most of the worldâs industries can produce far more goods than the worldâs consumers can buy. Overcapacity results from individual competitors projecting a greater market share growth than is possible. If each company projects a 10 percent growth in its sales and the total market is growing by only 3 percent, the result is excess capacity.</p>
<p>This in turn leads to hypercompetition. Competitors, desperate to attract customers, lower their prices and add giveaways. These strategies ultimately mean lower margins, lower profits, some failing companies, and more mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Marketing is the answer to how to compete on bases other than price. Because of overcapacity, marketing has become more important than ever. Marketing is the companyâs customer manufacturing department.</p>
<p>But marketing is still a terribly misunderstood subject in business circles and in the publicâs mind. Companies think that marketing exists to help manufacturing get rid of the companyâs products. The truth is the reverse, that manufacturing exists to support marketing. A company can always outsource its manufacturing. What makes a company proper is its marketing ideas and offerings. Manufacturing, purchasing, research and development (R &amp; D), finance and other company functions exist to support the companyâs work in the customer marketplace.</p>
<p>Marketing is too often confused with selling. Marketing and selling are almost opposites. âHard-sell marketingâ is a contradiction. Long ago I said: âMarketing is not the art of finding clever ways to dispose of what you make. Marketing is the art of creating genuine customer value. It is the art of helping your customers become better off. The marketerâs watchword are quality, service, and valueâ.</p>
<p>Selling starts only when you have a product. Marketing starts before a product exists. Marketing is the homework your company does to figure out what people need and what your company should offer. Marketing determines how to launch, price, distribute, and promote your product/service offerings to the marketplace. Marketing then monitors the results and improves the offering over time. Marketing also decides if an when to end an offering.</p>
<p>All said, marketing is not a short-term selling effort but a long-term investment effort. When marketing is done well, it occurs before the company makes any product or enters any market; and it continues long after the sale.</p>
<p>Lester Wunderman, of direct marketing fame, contrasted selling to marketing in the following way: âThe chant of the Industrial Revolution was that of the manufacturer who said, âThis is what I make, wonât you please buy it?â The call of the Information Age is the consumer asking, âThis is what I want, wonât you please make it?ââ</p>
<p>Marketing hopes to understand the target customer so well that selling is not necessary. Peter Drucker held that âthe aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous.â Marketing is the ability to hit the market.</p>
<p>Yet there are business leaders who say, âWe canât waste time on marketing. We havenât designed the product yet.â Or âWe are too successful to need marketing, and if we were unsuccessful, we couldnât afford it.â I remember being phoned by a CEO: âCome and teach us some of your marketing stuff â my sales just dropped by 30 percent.â</p>
<p>Here is my definition of Marketing: Marketing management is the art and science of choosing target markets and getting, keeping, and growing customers through creating, communicating, and delivering superior customer value.</p>
<p>Or if you like a more detailed definition: âMarketing is the business function that identifies unfulfilled needs and wants, defines and measures their magnitude and potential profitability, determines which target markets the organization can best serve, decides on appropriate prducts, services, and programs to serve these chosen markets, and calls upon everyone in the organization to think and serve the customer.â</p>
<p>In short, marketingâs job is to convert peopleâs changing needs into profitable opportunities. Marketingâs aim is to create value by offering superior solutions, saving buyer search and transaction time and effort, and delivering to the whole society a higher standard of living.</p>
<p>Marketing practice today must go beyond a fixation on transactions that often leads to a sale today and a lost customer tomorrow. The marketerâs goal is to build a mutually profitable long-term relationship with its customers, not just sell a product. A business is worth no more than the lifetime value of its customers. This calls for knowing your customers well enough to deliver relevant and timely offers, services, and messages that meet their individual needs.</p>
<p>The function of marketing is typically organized as a department within a business. This is good and bad. It is good because it brings together a number of skilled people with specific abilities for understanding, serving, and satisfying customers. It is bad because other departments believe that all marketing is done in one department. As the late David Packard of Hewlett-Packard observed, âMarketing is much too important to leave to the marketing department â¦ In a truly great marketing organization, you canât tell who is in the marketing department. Everyone in the organization has to make decisions based on the impact on the customer.â</p>
<p>The same thought was well-stated by Professor Phillippe Naert: âYou will not obtain the real marketing culture by hastily creating a marketing department or team, even if you appoint extremely capable people to the job. Marketing begins with top management. If top management is not convinced of the need to be customer minded, how can the marketing idea be accepted and implemented by the rest of the company?â</p>
<p>Marketing is not restricted to a department that creates ads, selects media, sends out direct mail, and answers customer questions. Marketing is a larger process of systematically figuring out what to make, how to bring it to the customerâs attention and easy access, and how to keep the customer wanting to buy more from you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, marketing strategy and actions are not only played out in customer markets. For example, your company also has to raise money from investors. As a result you need to know how to market to investors. You also want to attract talent to your company. So you need to develop a value proposition that will attract the most able people to join your company. Whether marketing to customers, investors, or talent, you need to understand their needs and wants and present a competitively superior value proposition to win their favour.</p>
<p>Is marketing hard to learn? The good news is that marketing takes a day to learn. The bad news is that it takes a lifetime to master! But even the bad news can be looked at in a positive way. I take inspiration from Warren Bennisâ remark: âNothing gives me a greater joy than learning something new.â (Mr. Bennis is Distinguished professor at the University of California and prominent writer on leadership).</p>
<p>The good news is that marketing will be around forever. The bad news: It wonât be the way you learned it. In the coming decade, marketing will be reengineered from A to Z. I have chosen to highlight 80 of the most critical concepts and ideas that business people need in waging their battles in this hypercompetitive and rapidly changing marketplace.</p>

<p><br />
EXCLUSIVE: AN INTERVIEW TOO PERSONAL WITH MR.MARKETING (PROF. PHILIP KOTLER) BY NWOKOCHA CHINENYE SMITH.ON THE 3rd FEB. 2007.</p>
<p>Marketing guru Philip Kotler is S.C. Johnson &amp; Son Distinguished Professor of International Marketing at the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, USA. He is widely regarded as the worldâs leading authority on the strategic practice of marketing and was instrumental in transforming marketing into an academic discipline. Professor Kotlerâs 700-page Marketing Management (originally published in 1967 and soon to appear in its 12th updated edition) was named by the Financial Times as âone of the 50 top business books of all timeâ and it is the most widely used text in graduate schools of business throughout the world. Kotlerâs textbooks have sold over three million copies and have been translated into 20 languages. Kotler on Marketing: how to create, win and dominate markets, his latest book, is written specifically for business leaders and managers.</p>
<p>Philip Kotler was voted a Leader in Marketing Thought by the academic members of the American Marketing Association (AMA), and he was the first recipient of the AMAâs Distinguished Marketing Educator Award. In 1995, the Sales and Marketing Executives International (SMEI) named Professor Kotler a Marketer of the Year. Philip Kotler has been a consultant in the areas of marketing strategy and planning, marketing organization and international marketing to numerous companies including IBM, General Electric, Ford, Apple, Motorola, AT &amp; T, Honeywell, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Merck. He may not have invented Marketing, but Philip Kotler sure has done more than any other person to reinvent the discipline and bring it to its modern maturity. In fact, some would argue that Marketing truly came of age only as Kotler did; with more than half-century of academic leadership as this year marks his 76th birthday.</p>
<p>He is my âMentor and Lord in Marketingâ</p>
<p>QUESTIONS FROM SMITH NWOKOCHA TO THE FATHER OF MARKETING</p>
<p>QUESTION 1</p>
<p>You had your first degree in Economics and today you are a known marketing professor, author, consultant of world most leading firms like International Business Machine (IBM), including Bank of America and many others too numerous to mention, how did you arrive to this?</p>
<p>ANSWER FROM PROF. PHILIP KOTLER (MR. MARKETING).</p>
<p>I felt that economists did not sufficiently understand the marketplace. They focused on explaining price determination but left out all the other demand shaping forces in the marketplace such as advertising, promotion, and distribution. Economists were not able to offer help to producers on such questions as how many sales people are needed, how much to spend on advertising, what kinds of advertising works best, and a host of other unanswered questions. These questions seemed more interesting to me because the answers would help business people make better decisions.</p>
<p>QUESTION 2</p>
<p>You are a mortal with immortal words and wisdom in the field of Marketing, Management, Business and the like. What is your advice to other marketing lovers, students, lecturers and firms?</p>
<p>ANSWER FROM KOTLER</p>
<p>I hope that marketers will no see marketing as a bag of tricks to get customers to buy things they donât need. Marketing is the art and science of meeting human needs and desires with solutions in the form of goods, services, and ideas. Its essential purpose is to raise the standard of living and the meaningfulness of consumer experience.</p>
<p>QUESTION 3</p>
<p>Is there any comparison between Marketing and Economics that can graduate to MARKETING ECONOMICS?</p>
<p>ANSWER FROM KOTLER</p>
<p>I am in favor of creating a branch of economics called marketing economics positioned between macroeconomics and microeconomics.</p>
<p>The rest of the questions and answers can be gathered from âguruâ books, etc.</p>
<p>Time does not permit further interviews.</p>
<p>Cordially,</p>
<p><br />

<p>In 1996, Muno's first publication was a triple surprise for the Luxembourgish book market: the author was not only female (which was rare until then), she was also young (16 years old), and she wrote in English, a language rarely used in Luxembourgish literature. In the following years, Muno has published a novel in French, one in German, and three in Luxembourgish. She has also co-authored two children picture storybooks with Pascale Junker who did the illustrations, and she has written two plays in Luxembourgish: <i>Speck</i> and <i>Krakullen</i>. Book critics have compared her writing style to the Belgian writer <a href="../../../a/m/%C3%A9/Am%C3%A9lie_Nothomb_7d3d.html" title="AmÃ©lie Nothomb">AmÃ©lie Nothomb</a>.</p>

<p>Although Muno's first CD was first published by her book publisher, she is nationally and internationally known As Claudine Muno and The Luna Boots, who have already produced two albums.

<p>A humorous singing menâs group, Drop The Octave is Gettysburg Collegeâs Premiere (&amp; only) all-male <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_cappella.html" title="A cappella">a cappella</a> group. With an ensemble of 7-11 people (on average) they do several performances a year including a final concert each semester, &amp; yearly Valentineâs Day A cappella-grams, which is where for a determined fee the group will actually serenade a person of your choosing with a song of your choosing.<br />
In the year 2001, having just entered into their freshman year at <a href="../../../g/e/t/Gettysburg_College_e855.html" title="Gettysburg College">Gettysburg College</a>, Brendan âBernieâ Klitsch, &amp; Ryan Paige auditioned for the only a cappella group on campus, the very established and Four Scores, co-ed a cappella group. Now at this time the Four Scores were the only a cappella on the Gettysburg campus &amp; it came at no surprise that Mr. Klitsch &amp; Mr. Paige were turned away because of their lack of experience in the vocal training world. Being that one was primarily a trumpeter and the other was primarily an actor. But the two were not about to allow that groupâs legacy bring them down. Causing an uproar in the fall of 2001, the two gathered a group of seven people they knew had also been turned away from Four Scores and asked if they would be interested in forming an all male a cappella group; and together they coined the name âDrop The Octaveâ. This of course due to the fact that they would quite literally drop the notes and/or parts of a song down into the octave they could sing it in (when learning music traditionally higher or composed with womenâs voice parts in mind).<br />
Originally the group had their advisor, a professor at the college, teach them the music, up until conflict arose with him. After this happened unknown incident, the group employed the services of its members to teach the music and oftentimes they actually looked at people who could play piano in their auditions, giving these people preference over those that couldnât play.<br />
Today the group still thrives today with a fairly large fan base primarily made up of females, and holds several concerts on and off the Gettysburg College Campus.</p>

The Care for Kids Foundation, formerly the Guardian Home Foundation, was established in 1995. One of our first projects the Foundation took on was the modernization and redesign of the Marion County Childrenâs Guardian Homeâs, an emergency shelter care facility for abused, neglected and abandoned children. The childrenâs dormitories, living quarters and staff offices were renovated and additional community rooms were added. This $10.8 million project was completed in December 2001.</p>
<p>The Care For Kids Foundationâs mission is to support programs and services which provide positive life changing experiences that impact the outcomes of vulnerable children. To this end, the Foundation looks for programs that provide concrete, common sense, positive experiences that help young people develop the qualities essential to them successfully persevering over their lifeâs circumstances and obstacles.</p>
<p>The Care For Kids Foundation works with nonprofit youth organizations and agencies that serve children who by no fault of their own, live under disadvantaged circumstances and may have experienced abuse, neglect, abandonment, or children who may be orphans or live with foster parents. The Foundation considers funding requests for year-round programs and projects of a one-time nature, which are in-line with our mission. It is our expectation that funded programs or projects will lead to deeper, positive impact in the lives of children served.</p>
<p>The Care For Kids Foundation provides support to programs the Foundation designs solely or in partnership with other organizations. We welcome the opportunity to develop signature programs with community partners that lead to positive life changing experiences that impact the long-term success of vulnerable youth.</p>
<p>We treasure programs that provide opportunities for program participants to play a part in community service activities helping them learn the value of community caring and community involvement. We help vulnerable youth connect to sectors of the community which help them contribute to a healthy and respectful sense of community. We like to see projects that not only recognize these vulnerable youth, but also provide nontraditional opportunities that impart experiences which may lead to a career path impacting not only their long-term outcomes, but have positive outcomes in a community.</p>

<p>Nitazoxanide is a synthetic nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivative and an anti-protozoal agent. It is approved for treatment of infectious diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia in patients 1 year of age and older. Following oral administration it is rapidly hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, tizoxanide, which is 99% protein bound. Peak concentrations are observed 1-4 hours after administration. It is excreted in the urine, bile and feces. Untoward effects include abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>

<p>Meyer did just about everything in high school, Atlantic. While he focused on football, he also played baseball, basketball, and ran track. As a junior quarterback, he was named as a top 35 Iowa prospect by Rivals Iowa, made all-conference, all-region, and all-state teams, but he wasn't yet satisfied. The next season, as a senior, he passed for 2,000 yards and 20 touchdowns to lead Atlantic to an undefeated record and a state championship. He was the MVP of the finals and a top-ten Iowa prospect. He also made all-conference and all-regional teams in basketball.</p>

<p>In 2004, Meyer narrowly beat out former starter Austin Flynn for the starting job, and passed for 1,926 yards, the tenth greatest total in Cyclone history. He had a 5-3 touchdown to interception ratio, impressive for a freshman. Bret also showed he could run as well, piling up 331 net yards, second on the team. Perhaps his best performance came against Miami of Ohio in the Independence Bowl, showing he could take his game to another level when the pressure was on. He passed for 114 yards and ran for 122 more, leading ISU to victory. He also had a great performance against Nebraska, accounting for 381 yards of total offense.</p>

<p>As a sophmore, Bret came near just about every Iowa State record, chalking in fourth in career yards, fourth in career completions, second in single-season yards and in single-season total offense---and he still had two years to play. He brought the Cyclones excrutiatingly close to the conference championship once more, while throwing for 300 yards or more three times. His best was a 371-yard show against Texas A&amp;M. He also threw for 317 and 314 yards against Nebraska and Illinois State, respectively. He led the Cyclones to the Houston Bowl against TCU, where Bret threw for three touchdowns but got edged, leaving ISU at 7-5. Expectations were high for 2006 after Meyer threw for 2,876 yards and was named to several all-Big 12 teams as an honor roll member. However, he entered 2006 as a first-teamer all-Big 12 in many preseason predictions.</p>

<p>Meyer couldn't quite regain hs form in 2006, mostly because of injuries to key players. Among these were starting running back Stevie Hicks and star receiver Todd Blythe. With no one to take the pressure of Meyer's shoulders, the team endured a tough season with a 4-8 record, although Meyer himself didn't put up horrible numbers. He threw for 2,546 yards and twelve touchdowns, but all in all, it was a disappointing year. However, with Meyer returning for 2007, among many others, he might be ready to put the Cyclones right back where they left off in 2005.</p>

<p>ZeroYear is a metal/hardcore outfit from the small town in Washington called Snohomish. It started out with Kyle Zelmer and Kristian Helle with guitar duties, and Kyle Butcher on the skins. As a 3 piece they only played in front of an audience a few times. People liked them, but they couldnt reach their full potential without vocals and even a bass. In about April of 2005, they heard of a kid a few years younger than them who could play bass and had similar influences. His name is Brent Eaton. They played one show with Jordy Dettmer on vocals/guitar but that phased out quite quickly. In the fall of 2005, Kyle Butcher and ZeroYear went their seperate ways. So now they had no drummer. There was another Snohomish metal outfit by the name of Inuratic who had recently broke up, and Brent was best friends with the ex drummer of Inuratic. Since Inuratic was no more, Derek Martin began playing drums for ZeroYear. About that time, Brent dropped bass duties and picked up guitar duties. Kristian and Kyle switched off between vocals and guitar so at all times, one of them was on guitar and the other was on vocals. They played a few shows without a bass player, but they got sick of it fast. An old friend, Josh Stone had just recently moved back to Washington so he started playing bass for them. That finally got the ball rollin for ZeroYear. They played an end of the year show in Snohomish in June of 2006, and he obviously fit in the band. Ever since then, ZeroYear has been playing tons of shows. Theyve shared the stage with the likes of Blacklisted, A Dying Dream, Capistrano, I Declare War, Nothing to Prove and many many more. They continue to play shows all over Washington and have a bright future ahead of them.</p>
