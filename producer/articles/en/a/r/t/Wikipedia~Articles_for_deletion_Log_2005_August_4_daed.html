<li><b>Keep</b> - Even if this was not actually mentioned on screen: mention in a novel is plenty, Star Trek is notable, and includes novels on the subject, since they are able to list about 10 Luna class vessels, it seems the subject is not so minor: whether film producers consider something <i>canon</i> is an arbitrary distinction, about whether Hollywood thought it was most expeditious to pay attention to certain topics in building their own stories, and there are many things that might have not appeared on screen which would still be notable. You have a point about possible speculation in the article, but that is more of an editing matter. If the subject was mentioned in one of their books, it obviously has some meaning in the <i>Star Trek</i> universe. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 04:05, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is completely different. The Harry Potter books are written by the person who created Harry Potter. The Star Trek books are not written by Paramount. Paramount does not take their content seriously or make any attempt to incorporate it into their own Star Trek productions. If Paramount did make a series about the Titan, there is a good chance they would design a new starship class of their own for it and completely ignore the Luna class which was invented by their licensee Pocket Books.</dd>

<dd>With respect, you have misinterpreted by typing. I was referring not to <b>your personal definition</b> of canon, but to which of the various defintions of 'canon' (whether ST or otherwise) you choose to subscribe. Paramount may own the copyright on ST, but there are aspects of the show which vary in canonicity. One example is the sehlat -- canon for the word, not (as understand) for the animated version. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 14:34, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

"non-notable?" -- begging your pardon, but you do have other entries of similar nature and it's, at a minimum, at least as interesting.</p>
<p>I can't see how a 3-day internet hoax merits a Wiki yet a 10-year old site that has been an incubator for developments in the internet is somehow inherently unnoteworthy. The idea of Wiki used to be that experts could craft a summary of what something is and why it's significant. Give us 48-hours and you'll have a wiki entry equal to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenlighting.html" title="Greenlighting">Greenlighting</a> or <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula_3000.html" title="Dracula 3000">Dracula 3000</a>--70.33.127.116 03:49, 4 August 2005 (UTC)Geoff</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. And I'm arguing anyway. Reluctant as I am to give BotF any more exposure than it has (imagine Thai beaches 15 years ago), I humbly submit that you might want to give the interested parties some time to put a coherent article together in appropriate wiki style before deleting the current effort. You can always delete it later, if you judge the entry to be of little merit. It might not hurt to have a look at BotF before passing judgement on its worthiness for wiki-inclusion. And consider BTC News <a href="http://www.btcnews.com/btcnews/" class="external free" title="http://www.btcnews.com/btcnews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.btcnews.com/btcnews/</a> spawned by Fray regulars, one of whom now attends White House Press Briefings. It's not an inconsequential site. DC</p>
<p>I apologize to all regular wiki users for my inadequate understanding of both the mechanics of the site, and any breach of etiquette I may inadvertently commit. I am the original author of the entry, it is a collaborative product of users from the Slate forum, our goal is to ultimately create an informative and helpful article for the sake of all interested parties (we estimate this to be a non-negligible number of people), and with a few days (and help from any interested parties, whether Fray-users or not) we hope to accomplish that task. I also apologize for being argumentative, but Wiki's documentation itself claims: "If you are the author of the article, you are welcome to join in the discussion, <b>make your case</b>, and vote like everyone else." I am attempting to do exactly this - to make a case for the importance of this information and for preserving the page long enough for users to develop it into an objective source of useful information. I admit the first stirrings of the entry are underwhelming, but feel it would be a shame to strangle the entry in its crib.--70.33.127.116 03:56, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike>: This was interesting. I’ve taken a little time to review wiki’s attempts to address the many issues that plague it (and other open forums like BotF), and it looks like they’ve done a good job. Still, the speed with which the wiki familiars put BotF up for deletion is evidence those guidelines are somewhat unfamiliar to, or ignored by the wiki familiars who would sooner vote for deletion then satisfy their supposed encyclopedic curiosity and learn what it is exactly they’re deeming non-notable. But although I’m a BotF regular, and the one who suggested this article, I vote for deletion. Not because BotF is non-notable, but because the wiki familiars who’ve apparently resigned their contributions to voting to delete articles they fail to appreciate have done an effective job of discouraging BotF’s authors from pursuing the endeavor. Wikifolk, you’ve wielded your power to the desired effect. Your fiefdom is safe. Have a nice life. BOTF 16:17, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There really is no reason why you can't present something encyclopedic on a first edit when it comes to something that has been around as long as Slate Magazine. However, if the idea was to merge all of the relevant information over to the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_Magazine_82e2.html" title="Slate Magazine">Slate Magazine</a> article, that would be more appropriate. I just don't see how an acronym for a sub-forum is just cause for an encyclopedia entry. And don't think that a VFD is an attempt to insult the author OR the topic of the article. It is defenitely not so. - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 19:29, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you know, I imagine what I’m about to say will break some wiki etiquette rules, so stop reading now if you don’t want to be offended. I guess what is getting me is you really don’t know how ridiculous you sound. Honestly, I came here to write an article on BotF, not argue its merits with someone whose expertise appears to be PS2 and its accessories. Mind you, I’m not criticizing your obsession. On the contrary, mine (BotF) is as pathetic, if not more. What I’m getting at is this: I’m not going to suggest JogCon be deleted even though I feel about it the same way you apparently feel about BotF. So why am I not devoting myself to getting your article deleted? Because I’m sure it’s relevant to someone, so what business is it of mine? Other points:
<ul>
<li>a) You clearly don’t have any idea what BotF is. You do, however, seem to know the ins and outs of placing a VFD on an article. So, why am I not surprised you’re partial to your VFD? If I didn’t know better (and I don’t) I would guess you’ve taken to using VFDs as a means of getting attention.</li>
<li>b) The fact of the matter is, a VFD is detrimental to the article. Why would someone devote their time and effort to an article that begins with, “<b>This article is being considered for deletion…</b>”? That’s your doing, and you did it before you even knew what it was you deemed “Neologism”. But then, that says it all doesn’t it. You have no idea what it means, prefer it be meaningless as an excuse and for good measure, want to deny others the opportunity to recognize what is of apparent interest to its contributors.</li>
<li>c) Lastly, so I’m clear, I am an <a href="http://fray.slate.msn.com/?id=3936&amp;m=13871201" class="external text" title="http://fray.slate.msn.com/?id=3936&amp;m=13871201" rel="nofollow">expert</a> in not only BotF, but the vagaries of all the types of people who find their little niches in the internet. In other words, I know exactly what you are JogCon, and I’m done feeding your appetite for attention. It is sad though, that you would burden the great idea that is WikipediA with the responsibility of quenching your desire for validation. You have power here JogCon, the power to judge, and you live for it. You’re a sad spectacle and a sorry excuse for a wiki ambassador. BOTF 20:48, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For someone criticizing another person for supposedly wanting attention, you sure went out of your way to attempt to insult me in as long of an elitist rambling as possible. I reiterate that the VFD was not an attempt to insult the author, the topic of the article, or by extension, it's user base. If that is how you feel, I am truly sorry as it was never my intention to do so. However, I do stand by my original word that an acronym for a sub-forum is not encyclopedic. I have attempted to be as civil as possible. Had it been that everyone voted to keep the article, then so be it. My opinion would be overturned and that would be the last of it. You can feel free to put a VFD on any article you want. That is your right as someone who can access the board. However, I do respectfully request that you leave personal arguments and insults toward my character out of this matter. That is rather uncalled for. And the fact that you resort to such remarks is further proof that you do not know me as you have suggested. - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 21:45, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That’s not long, and certainly not as long as possible JogCon, and not by any standard much less BotF standard. And yes, I got personal, but it was called for as you effectively shut down the article without giving it a second thought. I mean, really, don’t you have anything better to do than to stomp on other people’s ideas? Sure, you’re civil, and if I had a power equal to the VFD you <b>slapped</b> on BotF, I’d <b>slap</b> civility right back at you. But I don’t. All I have are these words, and no, I’m not going to return the favor and put VFDs on all your articles. That’s your lesson in civility JogCon. You were thoughtless, and the damage is done. Live and learn JogCon, so the next time you get the urge to <b>slam</b> a VFD on someone’s work, think twice and consider the only reason you think it doesn’t belong is your own prejudice. And yes, you’re right, an acronym for a sub-forum is not encyclopedic. And thanks to you, you’ll never know it to be anything else. Now shove off, you won, be a good sport and let the loser have the last word. BOTF 22:08, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hint to JogCon: your objection - that we felt compelled to use the acronym (because an earlier stab at a clearer title was speed-deleted) has a simpler remedy than deletion. It's called "Moving the Article." You are very defensive about your VfD, despite your protestations to the contrary. Yet none of your arguments are rooted in Wikipedia's deletion criteria, and - had you not killed it - it would have been rather easy to assemble an article explaining the larger significance of this particular site that would have been relevant to those interested in the relationship between certain internet forums and political issues. Memo to the general public: The word "encyclopedic" means "comprehensive." Describing the existence of things is an "encyclopedic" endeavor. Censoring the description of things which exist is the opposite of encyclopedic.--Geoff-LA 22:31, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have already stated that a previous article that was previously posted was given a Speedy Deletion tag (and it seems to have gone through, although that explanation has not been explicitly confirmed). Don't you think that's justification enough? You've reduced this to a petty, childish argument. This is NOT about winning or losing. Regardless of what you may think, I take no joy in "stomping" on your or anyone else's work. It has been and still is my opinion that "BotF" on its own, is not worthy of an encyclopedia article. The reason I put the VFD tage rather than Speedy Delete tag on it was because I don't feel I need to be the sole voice on the matter. I wanted the opinions of other Wikipedians. You still seem to be speaking under the assumption that by putting a VFD on this entry that I was attempting to insult you. I don't know how many times I must explain that this is simply untrue, but if I must keep doing so, I will. So like I have been saying, if what I did came across as a personal insult to you or your user base, I am truly sorry. If the article deserves to remain on Wikipedia according to other users (and more importantly, the admins) then so be it. It won't hurt me at all to see the page remain, as I will understand that it's remaining in the view of the "greater good" so to speak. So I will ask you again, politely, keep the personal insults aside. It does nothing to benefit your argument. I did not "kill" the page, as Geoff-LA suggests. It can still be edited and improved upon (and in fact, doing so could very well re-inforce your argument of why it belongs). - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 23:27, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In the matter of winning and losing, you win. The speedy delete tag (if that is what happened - another user tried before I decided to help by grabbing some unused real-estate) might only indicate that someone with less restraint flagged it (i.e., the actions of wiki-users are not perfectly co-extensive with objective merit). Nobody here has claimed that the VfD tag was an insult. We've claimed that it was inappropriate (because the VfD is not grounded in the criteria for deletion that constitute Wikipedia policy), that it has a chilling effect on the development of the article (because the original authors no longer have an interest in completing the article), and that it is ludicrous in light of the pre-existing content of the Wikipedia. In all likelihood, Slate's Fray has more unique viewers per day than <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula_3000.html" title="Dracula 3000">Dracula 3000</a> has had at all. This alone should make it more significant in its field (the internet) as your own entry is in its field (cinema). You did "kill" the page, as I suggest, and we are inviting you to take pride in this fact. At this point, you are not arguing the merits of creating an article describing the pheonomenon which is the Fray - but rather dodging and weaving in self-defense because you don't seem to like the fact that you've made a very negative impression. This article wasn't about you, and it still isn't about you. You'll have your way on the question of this article's lifespan. It's beyond reason to ask that the people you've censored also respect you.--Geoff-LA 23:42, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, to me it is not (nor has it ever been) about winning or losing. That is not the view I take on Wikipedia. If that's how you choose to take it, then that is your choice. The reason it seems that some people have taken the VfD tag as an insult it comments that have been about attacking me rather than the issue at hand. I can't see how someone would just up and insult me without having previously felt offended. All that had to be done was to plead the case, and be done with it. I am not "dodging and weaving". I still stand in my original position that "BotF" on it's own seems like a weak article on it's own. My stance has not changed and I have only been returning posts because of the attacks on my person and not on my actions. Please do try and understand this. - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 00:16, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How have you been insulted? Because we've examined your own contributions to the Wikipedia and compared it to ours? If that's an insult, it would seem you have very low self-esteem. If your previous entries are inherently more meritorious of description than the Fray, then there would be nothing insulting at all in our confusion over your standards. As for whether someone "wins" or "loses" - you've asked that this article die, and you're going to get your wish. You win. What more do you want? Why the need to keep interjecting your own emotions into the discussion.--Geoff-LA 00:23, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here are but some of the personal attacks that have NOTHING to do with the article on hand. "...you really don’t know how ridiculous you sound", "You clearly don’t have any idea what BotF is", "I would guess you’ve taken to using VFDs as a means of getting attention", "You have no idea what [neologism] means", "I know exactly what you are JogCon, and I’m done feeding your appetite for attention", "You’re a sad spectacle and a sorry excuse for a wiki ambassador". You mean to tell me that none of these are personal attacks? - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 00:44, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What makes those personal attacks? From the listener's perspective you do sound ridiculous (for the reasons elaborated). Do you have an idea of what BotF is? If you do, do you suppose you've demonstrated that fact? Have we, or have we not, been forced to discuss your sense of aesthetics instead of a phenomenon we consider of material interest to thousands of people? Do you understand what a neologism is? I always thought a personal attack was "you're a stupid fucktwit." It seems by your standard any unflattering assessment of your behavior counts as a personal attack. But your behavior has been, quite frankly, outrageous. Why should your victims pretend they've enjoyed it? Why aren't you satisfied with the fact that your objection has been acted upon, and that this article is now dead? From my perspective (and I would bet from BOTF's too) your interest in trumpeting your own opinions rather than discussing the object which we attempted to wiki indicates that this isn't about The Fray, but is in fact about you. Given that this is your apparent topical preference, it's pretty hard to discuss the matter at hand without making reference to your behavior. Nobody I've seen from the Fray has asked you to stop saying anything you're saying - despite the fact that you've significantly misrepresented both the topic which was being discussed (The Fray) and the motives of the people seeking to discuss it. --Geoff-LA 03:09, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fail to see how "You’re a sad spectacle and a sorry excuse for a wiki ambassador" is not a personal attack. I never once tried to make this discussion about me. In fact, I've tried several times to re-iterate that this page is for discussion of the subject matter in the article and not of the people who edit it. In fact, as I recall, it was someone else who brought me into it in a personal matter. In fact, even after such attempts to attack my character, I have still tried to reach a resolution, only to be met with a very rude comment by BTOF about me, rather than the article in question. "Dude, get a grip and shrink your head down to size." is what I received in response to my attempt to help resolve this issue. The fact that my behavior is "outrageous" should have no bearing on the discussion. Never was it my intention to make the discussion about me in any way. I felt the information did not justify it's own entry, posted the VfD tag to allow other users to voice their opinion ABOUT THE ARTICLE, not about me. In fact, if BTOF hadn't called me a "sad spectacle", it never would have been an issue. Remember, I didn't bring myself into this discussion on a personal level, the two of you did. But if it somehow helps you justify the article's legitimacy by insulting and blaming me, then by all means continue. Remember, I didn't bring myself into this discussion on a personal level, the two of you did. Thanks and have a great night! - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 03:23, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, gee. What kind of ambassadorship do you think it is to drive off new users because... what? What have your arguments been? That the thing which was trying to be discussed was a neologism? Even if the point's conceded, it's grounds or renaming, not deletion. That "There really is no reason why you can't present something encyclopedic on a first edit when it comes to something that has been around as long as Slate Magazine."? What kind of reason for deletion is that? There were half a dozen authors! How on earth were they supposed to get it write on the first edit? That it's "not notable"? Well, it's obviously "been noted" - an easy claim to refute. You haven't advanced any substantive claim that couldn't be knocked down with a flick of the little finger. So, what is this? It's your personal opinion acting as a proxy for objective merit. Given your personal assessments of what is objectively meritorious, calling your fitness to judge in this matter seems pretty damned obvious. <b>YOU</b> don't think it's important, so you wanted <b>US</b> to explain its importance to <b>YOU</b>. If you didn't want to get personal, you could have flagged it and come back in the morning to see whether we were describing something of importance to you. But instead, you threw a big fat red flag on the field so we'd come over here and have a chat with you. It's absolute thuggery, and it's a direct product of your behavior. If you want to understand the objective merit of the forum as a wikipedia entry, just follow all of our cites to the <b>Wikipedia deletion policy</b> (which you apparently are under no obligation to read or respect) or refute our explanations of its historical significance with something resembling a cogent rebuttal. All I see is a man who really wants to be talked about, and is pretending quite badly that this is somehow something else--Geoff-LA 03:37, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But again, that is all your opinion and is not relevant to the article itself. I also see that I am not the only one holding this opinion. The discussion never should have been made about me. I've tried to turn the conversation away from me, but since you and BTOF insist on making it about me, I will concede from this discussion. I'm not sure what's worse. The fact that your best argument is that I haven't read the site and the Wikipedia policies (which I have, in both cases), or the fact that you consistently say I'm craving attention, when the only reason I am being singled out is because the two of you have <b>chosen</b> to do so. I still hold the same opinion I have since the very beginning. But since you refuse to discuss the point at hand, I feel I have no other choice but to end this line of conversation right here. So have a good day. Best of luck with your article. And next time you disagree with someone, make it about the points they make rather than how you feel about them as a person. - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 12:07, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hey, I'm feeling charitable this morning. You've been pretty dishonest throughout this discussion, but I'll give you another chance to prove your sincerity. Tell me clearly: Why are 3rd-rate horror movies more important to Wikipedia than boards with tens of thousands of unique users? Tell me clearly: Why have you kept talking so much if you haven't changed your mind? Tell me clearly: Where in the Wiki deletion policy are the grounds you've provided for deletion? Tell me clearly: Why do you insist that your interlocutors have any interest in saving this article, when they've both voted to delete it?--Geoff-LA 16:40, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Opinion of the original author. The emergence of the internet is a socio-political phenomenon on par with the development of the press - and early innovators such as Slate's <i>Fray</i> will ultimately be recorded for their role in its permeation. Certainly, the Fray has been an engine for the dissemination of political ideas and has already begun to transform the nature of news media.

I was willing to try this article on the proviso that the experts would contribute, but having to waste time defending the topic's very legitimacy, when it passes every formal criteria listed on the site's guidelines for inclusion ([verfiability] included) has thrown a damper on the willingness of anyone to work on it.</p>

<li><s><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_Magazine_82e2.html" title="Slate Magazine">Slate Magazine</a>. The Fray and BotF are a part of Slate with no notability other than their connection to that notable web magazine. Therefore, it doesn't need its own article. Now... *rolls eyes* Why must you people take VfDs as a personal insult? And why do you think everything in the world deserves its own article? I know everyone wants their place in Wikipedia, but remember that Wikipedia is an giant encyclopedia, and so topics need to be of around the same notability as would be required by an encyclopedia. Anyway, by the logic of the creators of this article, the forums of any web site listed in Wikipedia should get their own page. And yes, I'm aware of <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_forums_4c70.html" title="Something Awful forums">Something Awful forums</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>, but there's notability outside of the main site for them (the SA forums regulars have, in the past, engaged in forum invasions, attacked other websites, etc.). That having been said, I would still say they need to be the same article. A part of something that is notable is not, in and of itself, notable.</s> And, uh, just because notability isn't an official criterion, it's a de facto one. Entries must be important and encyclopedic. Notability is part of being encyclopedic, IMHO. I won't address the comment of bias except to say that I personally believe that SA and Slashdot are <i>at least</i> as recognizable as Slate's forums, if not more so. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 22:49, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why wouldn't it make sense to write the article first, then determine the proper way to link it back to the article on Slate magazine? The Fray is, at a root level disaggregated from the main site. It has its own search engine and its own mechanics. It also has its own history. <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instapundit.html" title="Instapundit">Instapundit</a>, for example, is a direct off-shoot of the Fray and its format largely inspired by that set out by the forum of Slate magazine. Given the horde of imitators that this website spawned, and their growing influence in the political discourse, it has a legitimate claim to some independent significance which would - if discussed directly in the Slate article, muddy the content of that article. The problem with the VfD slap is that it throws a pall over the process of authorship. A number of Fray users are prominent attorneys or involved directly in national politics and are uniquely qualified to discuss its effects. But, we've found the VfD notice kills the discussion. That's not a personal taking of offence - it's a chilling effect inherent in asking an individual to invest time and energy into writing an article that is clearly marked as "waiting for deletion"--Geoff-LA 23:13, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not really convinced that blogging and forums are really a solid part of the political discourse (my humble opinion, others almost assuredly don't agree&#160;;) ), and I really don't see why mentioning the forums in the main article would disrupt the article. That having been said, I think you do have a point insofar as other web site forums get their own separate pages (I cite Something Awful as an example again -- hell, it has its own category). It seems reasonable by way of precedent that The Fray -- not BotF, but The Fray itself -- should be given similar treatment. My vote, however, is based on the fact that I don't like the precedent, and I don't really see what's added by having an article about a website, then a long article about its forums and their culture, then a long article about things the people in the forum do (<a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot_trolling_phenomena.html" title="Slashdot trolling phenomena">Slashdot trolling phenomena</a>), <i>ad infinitum.</i> If the big aspect of a site is its forums, make a discussion of them into the majority of the article. If the forums are an adjunct to the site (such as, say, the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a> forums), say the web site has forums and be done with it. I don't think it serves Wikipedia at all to go into vast detail on forum culture for every forum. The arrangement of a forum, the levels of users, the cost of membership -- all of these are external link material and not sufficiently important for putting in an article proper. <s>So, my vote stands, but I hope you understand better now why I voted that way.</s> I'm trying to change what I consider a bad precedent, even though I think you have a case for keeping the page as things are right now. I also don't think my position is a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, because my goal isn't to disrupt things but rather to provoke discussion.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 23:52, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This may be fighting the tide, but to say that an historically significant online forum (BotF is that, even as itself) is not worthy of mention in an online encyclopedia is at best hasty and at worst elitist. As a long time participant in BotF, I do not take personal offense in JogCon's initial VfD, but I think his action hasty and ill informed. The page was up for something like 30 minutes when his VfD request came up, and while the matter is not decided, that fat page header immediately gives any reader the wrong idea about the page. Also, you state recognizability as a quality for keeping the page. The Fray gets around 10,000 posts a day and is directly associate with the Washington Post. --<a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwingLowSweetDeej_b351.html" title="User:SwingLowSweetDeej">SwingLowSweetDeej</a> 23:05, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hello. We’re not taking the VfD as a personal insult. Is that how it looks, or is that how you’d like to see it. Either way, it doesn’t matter. The issues with the VfD are: a) As your comments clearly demonstrate, the issue being debated in not the topic matter the authors originally intended the article to address. The VfD was issued within an hour or so of the articles inception and based on the barest of information. Clearly, if the VfD happy wikiperson had show a bit more patience, he might have found is initial objections to the entry were baseless. b) The VfD effectively killed the collaborative nature the article required if it was to be accurate, objective, and complete. You honestly have no clue as to the nature, depth and particulars of BotF and what it represents. The work that would have informed you so that you could talk about it intelligently was stifled by the VfD. For example: You suggest that forums raiding one another makes them noteworthy. Trust me in that raiding another forum is not only problematic in that it stinks of groupthink, but it’s quite frankly beneath BotF. c) This is an esthetics issue really, but the VfD block at the head of the article really does kill it. How can anyone be expected to judge the article on its merits, if it supposedly merits an obtrusive and off-putting warning at its head. Now I’m new to WikipediA, but is seems to me that the process of VfD could be done a little more subtlety. I’m sure you are familiar with all the elements of a wiki-page and don’t need a neon sign to tell you that there is a debate as to its relevance. Lastly, this whole idea that you should know something exists before it warrants entry into an encyclopedia is just absurd. Are you literally telling us that you never read an encyclopedia entry that educated you? The point being, if you knew as much about BotF as that which you find sufficient to justify the inclusion of other more well known to you forums, you’d change your tune. But then, maybe not since I see from your page that you have a penchant for merging. BOTF 23:34, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>BOTF, would you perhaps consider toning down your aggressive stance and dropping the personal attacks? You are the reason I mentioned the insult issue, because you very much seem to be taking it as one.&#160;;) I'm not opposed to seeing the content in Wikipedia. I am opposed to it being its own page. There's a world of difference there. Yelling at other editors isn't going to help reach a consensus, and really doesn't help your case, IMHO. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 23:52, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Since we don't seem to be making a lot of headway in either direction (BOTF and I both seem to be stubborn in our ways), let me try a different approach. As the author, how would you feel about expanding the article to include more than just "BotF"? To merge it with the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_Magazine_82e2.html" title="Slate Magazine">Slate Magazine</a> article, seems more ideal. But if it were to even just expand the article (like another person suggested), to include the entire section known as "The Fray", rather than one small portion of it, would be more than satisfactory in my opinion. I'd love to resolve this issue with the author and the others involved, but would greatly appreciate doing so with being <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_personal_attacks.html" title="No personal attacks">attacked</a> on a personal level. The sooner we can get this resolved, the sooner we can retract the VfD and all be on our merry (or not so merry) ways. - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 23:42, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I feel compelled to note that the article was working towards a description of the Fray as a general phenomenon. The authors merely felt boxed into staking a unique term applicable to the site, because - hey, we're new here and it wasn't clear how to dodge the censorship of wikipedians long enough to get the article started. Once happenstance forced the terminology on us, the introduction had to clarify the relationship between the parts and the whole (which the article as it exists does). Also, given what I know of the man going by "BOTF" on this page, your invitations to finish the article are wasted. We're not going to be able to get our authors to contribute to the page with the VfD tag at its head, anymore than we'd get a roomful of guests to sit down and stay if we had a fresh turd sitting on the coffee table. There's precious little interest in satisfying your criteria, and more than a little annoyance at having been asked to consider the merits of your interests over the merits of the topic originally envisioned.--Geoff-LA 00:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You actually expect me to compromise with you over an article that you have yet to read (since it hasn’t been written), on a subject matter that you willfully have no knowledge of and of which I and my co-authors are the authority? Dude, get a grip and shrink your head down to size. BOTF 23:49, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that is the stance you wish to take, then so be it. I've tried to reach a compromise so the VfD could be removed and you would be appeased, and in the process make an article that better justifies what is in my opinion a proper encyclopedia entry. But I can't force you to cooperate. You keep bringing up the "fact" that I have no knowledge of the subject matter. I personally don't see the relevance in this argument, especially considering you have NO idea what websites I choose to browse. - <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogCon_ab6b.html" title="User:JogCon">JogCon</a> 00:04, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I'm sure it's not a surprise to anyone here, but the keep votes all seem to be coming from people whose only edits have been to the page in question or this VfD. I suspect that's probably why we're seeing this "us versus them" mentality (short of the violation of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_personal_attacks.html" title="No personal attacks">no personal attacks</a> guideline); the BotF people want to see their article stay, and the Wikipedians don't seem to. I want to make a plea for sanity here -- given the way the admins work, I think it's unlikely this article will stay if the discussion continues how it's going. So, could we start discussing compromise and consensus, as opposed to aggressively demanding that the article stay? Historically, votes from users who have a vested interest in the article, or who are new to Wikipedia except for the article in question or the VfD, are discounted. If you want the content to stay, let's talk about how we can make it stay. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 00:05, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd recommend envisioning it as an opportunity to have some useful dialogue with people coming from a different point of view. The votes of several BotF users has been to "delete" and the intention to finish the article is pretty much dead. Your suggestion of a compromise is welcome, but at this point it's largely irrelevant, because there are widely differing levels of commitment to Wikipedia itself between Wiki-users and Fray-users. From the perspective of the Fray, it is in no way diminished by not being included within the Wiki, whereas the Wiki is diminished by failing to include a socially significant phenomenon (recognizing you'd disagree about its significance). Thus, the discussion is taking place at a more meta-level. Why would the users of a site dedicated to developing an "encyclopedic" repository of knowledge (in the word's sense, not in the Wiki-neologism sense) have such a vested interest in preventing the description of things which exist? Also, I think closer attention to distinguishing between "argument" and "attack" would be appreciated by the Fraysters. --Geoff-LA 00:16, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With all due respect, Geoff-LA, BOTF is in fact engaging in personal attacks, and seems to be, in my opinion, taking this VfD as a personal attack. However, I agree that that's probably not a distinction worth making at this point.&#160;;) In any event, the current stance of Wikipedia, as far as I've been able to discover, is that things must be more than just extant to fit in here. Everything2, for instance, is a great example of a Wiki-like system whose goal is to cover everything that it possibly can; Wikipedia wants to cover things that it considers, by consensus, of great import. I don't entirely agree with everything it does, certainly. I don't think Something Awful deserves its own category, as I've stated, nor do I think, say, every anime series ever made should gets its own page. In that sense, I'm what one would call an exclusionist. I try to avoid taking POV (in the Wikipedia sense) positions on the significance of things, though. My vote was based on my opinion that web sites in general need to be very notable to make it here, and that their components have to be just as if not more important if they're to get their own pages. Since that doesn't seem to be the prevailing opinion and I'm comparatively new here, I don't try to pick fights on these issues, but when the perspective of the community is requested (as on, say, a VfD), I try to make my position known.<br />
That having been said, let me suggest a few things here. It's clear the Fraysters want the article to stay, and I think it could be useful information if it's as notable as is claimed -- and I think you do have a good case for that, for reasons I've already stated. After stepping away from the computer for a bit, I think the best compromise here is to go the way of the precedent. The <a href="../../../b/o/t/BotF_7355.html" title="BotF">BotF</a> article should be turned into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fray_1809.html" title="The Fray">The Fray</a>, expanded to talk about the forum and BotF, and linked from <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_Magazine_82e2.html" title="Slate Magazine">Slate Magazine</a>, possibly while adding a category for the magazine itself. As a second option, we can let this go down as it is, in which case everyone loses -- you don't get the notability of being in Wikipedia (not that you may care, but let's say you might&#160;;) ), and Wikipedia loses out on some information content. I'd hate to see sour grapes over what amounts to a technical "where should this go" issue end like that. Finally, of course, the VfD could be retracted, but I doubt that's going to happen.<br />
Out of curiosity, does my first compromise idea seem feasible? I don't like it, but I'm willing to compromise to improve the quality of the site. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 00:48, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I feel you've been quite reasonable, and it's an excellent suggestion of a compromise. It's looking like Deej might have an interest in salvaging the article, which could very well be the beginning of some beautiful peacemaking between two obvious peacemakers. My own guess is that even that article will be slapped by its own VfD tag - which is to say I have a pretty dismal view of Wikipedia in general. I do think you're wrong about the Wikipedia's purpose, in that my own encounters with your founder's arguments on the standards of inclusiveness seem to suggest that his only considerations are verifiability and NPOV, the first of which the Fray possesses, and the second of which we were certainly trying to get to. My impression from what I've seen of the debate is that "notability" in the Wiki-jargon is a pretty ugly concept - masking either impressions that Wiki's job is to emulate the encyclopedias it was designed to revolutionize or (as in JogCon's case) that "notability" is a function not of inherent significance, but of the personal aesthetic preference of individual Wiki users. I'd urge you to consider a less-exclusionist stance on the grounds that people who know about an awful lot of things aren't going to contribute, if their first encounter is anything like this--Geoff-LA 03:28, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>With specific reference to Pagrashtak’s comment: I don’t doubt that wikivets are a bit more accustomed to the wiki-idiosyncrasies in that they recognize a VfD, not as a scarlet letter, but rather a hurdle/challenge. I’ll grant that, but WikipediA should take note that wikinovices do see it as the equivalent of a red letter “A”. As I mentioned elsewhere, perhaps it could be noted a bit more subtlety, and as this experience suggests, new articles could benefit from a two week to one month grace period during which an article can be refined in order to ensure any subsequent VfD vote/debate is properly informed. In general, and as Geoff has noted, the “debate” from our perspective is no longer about whether or not BotF belongs in WikipediA, but rather a discussion about WikipediA’s narrowing standards as a consequence of the ever-increasing idiosyncrasies of its aging community (broadly speaking). As FreelanceWizard notes, there is an “us” verses “them” dynamic to this debate. I submit however that it is the WikipediA community that lacks objectivity in this matter. To that end, I’ve gone ahead and copied this debate into a <a href="http://fray.slate.msn.com/?id=3936&amp;m=15326750" class="external text" title="http://fray.slate.msn.com/?id=3936&amp;m=15326750" rel="nofollow">post</a> in BotF. Assuming the topic garners debate, I think that in the BotF community you’ll find a variety of opinions as opposed to the WikipediA community’s apparent unanimity.

<li><b>Keep?</b> – Changing my vote from Delete, but really, I shouldn’t get a vote since I’m hardly objective. Change to “The Fray” seems fine to me. Curious, but what is the policy on “case in point” examples? It seems to me that “The Fray” would be a worthwhile “example” in a number of articles (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum" rel="nofollow">1.</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board" rel="nofollow">2.</a>, …, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_warrior" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_warrior" rel="nofollow">6.</a>, …). Wouldn’t WikipediA’s “The Fray” article be a good pointer to the actual topic being referenced in these other articles. Another note: this VfD being a good example of what makes The Fray (BOTF) unique, especially if FCYTravis is correct, “<i>Wow. World's longest VFD vote in history.</i>” BOTF 18:18, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I initially voted to delete, so the keep was in part designed to nullify my original vote. You’ll also note I qualified my keep with a question mark (“?”). I did this to show that it was more of a question than a vote. Finally, I said nothing about having no right to try and influence the vote, which is what I was doing. Please understand, my thinking on the subject has evolved over time. Initially, I was excited. That excitement was met with a VfD. Knowing BotF as I do, I assumed the VfD was enough of a deterrent to my hoped-for co-authors, that there was little point in pursuing the article. As far as I was concerned, the VfD then turned into a debate about WikipediA’s policies and procedures, and in particular for me, how those can become tools of abuse by juvenile wikifolk in pursuit of quasi-celebrity. However, the article has progressed (albeit slowly thanks to the VfD) enough that I’m now revising my initial assessment of the VfD. Suffice it to say, I now believe if “The Fray” article survives this VfD, it will ultimately become a highly cross-referenced and constructive addition to WikipediA. p.s. I know we’re not supposed to engage in personal attacks, but I find your petty comments in this VfD rather counterproductive, so if there is any question as to why I am responding to you at such length, it is so I can attempt turn the net negative of your pithily remarks into something constructive.

<p><b>Keep.</b> I really don't care how it's kept or where, though I prefer a Fray entry rather than the narrower BoTF, for there are several frays as notable - though more focused - for fine writing and insight as BoTF. Say I'm a little too imaginative, but to me Wikipedia is akin to the genesis of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Local Earth Edition. There's something fundamentally important about this encyclopedia beyond what I see the "deleters" recognizing: accuracy and legitimacy are crucial, yes, but so are interest and utility, and so all-inclusiveness should be its raison d'etre. The objections to inclusion of this article are notable for their personal subjectivity and narrownesss of vision. Narrow is most assuredly <i>not</i> what Wikipedia is designed to be, which is why the whole world is writing it, and why I expect Wikipedia to eventually contain an entry for everything on the planet that can be known. -- Montfort <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.91.22.126 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.91.22.126_4c26.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.91.22.126">contribs</a>) 2005-08-09 08:46:29 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> (Pardon me for revising a bit here, as I've been filled in more on the situation) I was responsible for the de-listing. I don't have any opinion on the page itself; my concern was that if it was an attempt to propose a policy, it should be accorded the courtesy of assuming good faith and allowing it time to develop consensus. <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion</a> indicates that a wide leeway should be granted to the Wikipedia namespace. Policies are created in the project namespace and gather consensus there; the nomination seemed to me to say "It hasn't gathered consensus yet, so it shouldn't have Wikipedia: in front of it" which does not conform to our way of doing things. Considering that there was significant interest here in the proposal (both for and against), I felt it should be considered in line with policy-proposal policy and not VfD. At this point, <b>if it is a legit proposal</b> I would suggest the creator move it to userspace and seek consensus there. I believe we all would agree that deleting legit policies is not how we do things (for example, a VfD on <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> would not result in Wikipedia adopting a different POV policy). If it's not legit, then it should be deleted, and the creator should be warned against similar acts in future (particularly because it not only violates NPA, but confuses the heck out of the community). -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 11:23, August 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just so you know - Noone has any idea what you just said. I moved it to Project Space because the word really has no meaning outside of the project - it is not the kind of word you would expect to find while browsing an encyclopedia. You're suggesting Userspace - which to me sounds like private space - and therefore the same as no space at all. If policies start - they have to start somehow, and under the general rules of Wiki engagement - they just <b>start</b> - there is no magic starting policy, or starting namespace, wiki is wiki - grok that. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></li>
<li>How is the community confused? It's legitimacy has nothing to do with the intentions of the author - it has to do with the acceptance and support of the community. There is some support, some opposition, and some "This can't really be happening." The first two I respect. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand why people are using <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> to support a delete vote. One could just as easily consider putting this up for VfD to be a disruptive way of making a point. Looks to me like people voting delete here as a way of expressing disapproval not of this page, but of Ed's deletion. We already have plenty of places to discuss that. Why not keep this deletion vote focused on the matter at hand? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 14:14, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, people suggest that this proposal runs foul of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (since it basically states that people should be protected from being censured if they do something intentionally disruptive in an attempt to bring perceived wrongs to the public's attention). That is almost by sheer definition the opposite of WP:POINT. It also started out as a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a> against Ed Poor, which is very inappropriate for a 'proposal'. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 14:19, August 4, 2005 (UTC)

<li>This may well be a valid point. But surely the way to hash it out is not simply to delete the page. There are existing policies that are sometimes at odds with each other, so I don't see how that's grounds for deletion. What's next, someone putting the VfD on <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>?

<ul>
<li>In that case, not only does this proposed policy directly contravene WP:POINT, it also is redundant with WP:IAR.

<li>This article was never a personal attack - While I reserve judgement as to whether the alleged harms of VfD are porportional to the harm of a 5 minute burp - the purpose is to promote a <b>lawful</b> justification - and to argue <b>against</b> a meritocractic resolution, or a hyprocritical hierarchy in which those at the top are <b>above</b> the law.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Like some others, I am confused as to whether this is really a legitimate and serious attempt to make policy. Assuming it is serious then, while I'm (so far) opposed to this policy, I think it deserves a chance to develop before we just delete it out of hand. I've yet to be involved in developing a new policy (just tweaking old ones) and perhaps this is the wrong mechanism for doing so. If someone can explain to me how this violates normal policy creation procedures then I might be inclined to change my vote. If on the other hand this is really just a backhanded swipe at Ed, then while I can not condone Ed's actions — I think what Ed did showed a profound disrespect for the entire Wikipedia community of editors — I also can not condone using such methods in response. However I'm willing so far to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>, and take the authors statements at face value.

<li><b>Delete</b>: First, it is not policy, and yet it is name space. Second, it is WP:POINT. Third, it is totally inaccurate (see Ed Poor's own words about why the nastiness occurred, so this would-be ally is, in fact, entirely misinformed). Fourth, namespace does not obey the same rules as article space, and the deletion guidelines do not quite apply there, but they fail to apply there the same way that copyright fails to operate in China. It is merely <i>courtesy</i> to even have a debate, as anyone could simply speedy delete the article (and I nearly did so). Fifth: NAME SPACE IS NOT A PLAYGROUND. It is not where you go to whine. It is not where you go to plot. It is not a place to express your inner self. The creator has his user page for that. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to even <i>think</i> about things like whether his faith was good or bad: it is an article that is wholly inappropriate for namespace. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:50, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So Howabout you explain why the two names in the Arbcom case just happened to be the first two names on this VfD - random chance right? What kind of morons do you take the rest of the world to be anyway? Of course this has to do with the arbcom case - that where the policy is to be tested. The policy exists to provide a rational case for non-sanction Ed Poor because he is entitled to Whistle-blower protection. Your Arbcom case appears to be that he _Should_ be sanctioned - that's fine - but deleting the counter argument is in poor taste. And you failed to follow policy so you're certainly not setting an example, but then at 17 I wouldn't expect you to set an example - have fun - I applaud your participation learn from the process and do good. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></dd>

<li>C'mon. Let's not be prudish here. The song is an entity unto itself, and I remember it from film (Parenthood?). I'm no academic but I am educated, and I was glad to see those silly lyrics here. I'll show them to the kids. Isn't that what Wikipedia is all about, and what separates it from Encarta/World Book/etc? It's worth noting that the word "diarrhea" was not listed.</li>

</ul>
<p>I'm not even going to argue the responses. I just want this deleted. We obviously made a terrible mistake by starting a project page for our project. Even though, I'm sure there's 100's of other pages about game projects and other such things. Let me end by saying though, I had no intention of using this as advertising space. I and others were under the impression that Wikipedia was a place where anybody could contribute information about a project. I know, there wasn't much information on the project page, at the moment, but we were new to this, and just getting started. Anyway, I just want this to go away because if anything, this is negetive attention for the project, which we don't want.

<li><b>Expand</b>, I am one of the authors. Please do not be to quick to dismiss this entry. The Common Archive is a framework that is being developed within the Wikipedia environment in order to demonstrate how temporal location can be used as version control. The term Common Archive is used as an expansion of Creative Commons but it is not the same. It combines temporal information with geospatial co-ordinates to locate any kind of digital material within a datascape. As for being 'hypothetical nonsense', this seems to indicate an unwillingness to conseder new ideas. Perhaps this user should read the Wikipedia manifesto.

<li>The concept is already fully developed and in place, we're not developing it here... we're writing about it. We could, of course, go and write it up and then post it here in it's entirity... but is that the way Wikipedia works? I have to stress again that <b>this isn't hypothetical</b> and as for nonsensical, well, that's very much a matter for persoanl considersation. I suggest that if you really want to proceed with deletion you are quite clear about eactly why this need to happen and that that requires discussion. The reasons above are not adequate. --James Farmer 00:58, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>At the very least, you should have a few references to mainstream mentions of the term "common archive": newspapers, academic journals, etc. You say it is related to the "creative commons" license, but a google for common archive and CC together pulls up nothing remotely like you've described.

<li><b>Merge</b>. I am the original creator of this article, and my intention in creating it was to show SS's noteriety for precisely the reasons you mention - being a weak, common card, but not just that - for being the weakest of them all. SS is famous among fans of the game for being the extreme on the lower end of the spectrum, and thus has notability enough for a mention. Your points are well taken, however, and the above plan seems to be a good one. Masterdramon 18:11, August 5,2005 (HST)</li>

<p>transwiki to wikicities or something? Although it might be forumcruft, it is a useful explanation for over 3,000 forum users so there must be a place for it somewhere.--Caverider 13.50, 4 August 2005</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Forumcruft, not notable. <b>Alexa rank 2,972,997</b>. In response to the poster above, it would make far more sense for the forum to host its <i>own</i> list of trivia and in-jokes than to foist it on WP or Wikicities. Things like <i>"Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt Gary Holt (a typical post by Hong Kong NCFC fan XXL16)"</i> obviously are only of interest to those who post there, and are neither interesting, important, or understandable by anyone else. As for the "3000 forum users" bit, the article itself states that there aren't really that many, and that many of them are sockpuppets (see the third in-joke part). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:07, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, vanity-hoax. Seeing as how the only lineage records that survive from the 18th dynasty relate to the nobility and all the lineage records end with Octavian's execution of Ptolemy XV Caesarion, this individual would be *astoundingly* famous if they had managed to trace their ancestry to the time of Tutankhamen. Historians and egyptologists would be falling all over themselves to view their research, and they would generate tens of thousands of hits on every major search engine, at least.

<li><b>Comment</b> Regretfullly, my vote stays the same on the revised version. Deliniating every possible X-American is inviting the creation of thousands of stubs just like this one, and the page is an orphan - nothing links to it.

I would like to say that I think the re-write was a well-intentioned and heroic effort at saving the page, however. =) <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 22:54, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>None of this is "original research"</dd>
<dd>Cites for where it comes from are on the Ancient Weights and Measures Discussion page</dd>
<dd>I'm fascinated by someone refering to cites from books</dd>
<dd>whose publication has now run through four or five printings "original research"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is original research because it seems to be an attempt by the author</dd>
<dd>to show the great interconnectedness of all units of measurement of all ancient cultures.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No. Its just a collection of readily available sources, many classical or ancient,</dd>
<dd>which point out how people use measures to define property, and church and state</dd>
<dd>use measures to levy taxs and tithes, and none of them tolerate changes in their</dd>
<dd>source of income very well.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This truly is original research.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe a couple of centuries ago it was, now its more or less main stream.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are also claims that the metric system really is based on a Sumerian cubit,</dd>
<dd>which is by definition 500 mm.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Try going to Metrum and checking the claim out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh yes, they knew the exact diameter of the Earth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That claim [that ancient geographers, surveyors cartographers and navigators</dd>
<dd>such as Marinus of Tyre, Pithias, Claudius Ptolomy and Eratosthenes</dd>
<dd>knew not only that the earth was round but how to divide it into degrees and</dd>
<dd>how to measure a degree] goes back to before the time of Alexander</dd>
<dd>let alone Alexandria.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How can we check that?</dd>
<dd>A Mesopotamia Sos is listed in Wikopedia as 180 m</dd>
<dd>An Egyptian itrw is listed as 21,000 royal cubits = 1 schoinos (Herodotus)= 1/10 degree</dd>
<dd>A Greek Stadion is 185 m, there are 8 to a Milos and 600 to a degree</dd>
<dd>A Roman Stadium is 185 m, there are 8 to a milliare and 600 to a degree</dd>
<dd>In both cases 75 'miles' = 1 degree of 111 km</dd>
<dd>That produces a great circle as they put it of 24,830 modern English miles.</dd>
<dd>The modern value is about 24903.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, the content of the table is not verifiable,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The sources are on the discussion page for Ancient weights and measures</dd>
<dd>Egil is in such a rush to delete these pages he hasn't</dd>
<dd>given me a chance to finish putting them up.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>and the subject about ancient units is fully convered elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, since the massive edit Egil made to the page, everything is</dd>
<dd>now neatly compartmentalised so that if you want to compare units</dd>
<dd>you can't just scroll up or down, you have to go to a different page</dd>

<dd>The same author created Standards of measure in the Jemdet Nasr, Standards of measure in the Copper Age, Standards of measure in the Near Eastern Bronze Age, Standards of measure in Iron Age Europe, Standards of measure in Medieval Europe, Standards of measure in the Pre Conquest Americas, Standards of measure in the Medieval East, Standards of measure in the Modern West.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just because user Egil doesn't have any familiarity with ancient units</dd>
<dd>it doesn't mean they don't exist</dd>

<dd>The metric system is indeed based on the Sumerian cubit, because like many other weapons in the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">Devil</a>'s arsenal, it originated with <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiramis_of_Babylon_f22f.html" title="Semiramis of Babylon">Semiramis</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimrod_%28king%29.html" title="Nimrod (king)">Nimrod</a>.

<dd>The metric system is based on ancient measures because after people like Egil</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Looking at unit standards of measure comparatively by cultures</dd>
<dd>makes it much easier to see who shared measures with whom.</dd>
<dd>Mile standards are used by cultures going back to the Sumerians.</dd>
<dd>The documentation of this is not original research just a collection of facts</dd>
<dd>cited by both classical and contemporary experts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Miles are always related to stadia and stadia are always related to degrees.</dd>
<dd>Miles are divided into stadia which are generally used as the sides of fields</dd>
<dd>They are further divided into ropes or cords, chains, rods, paces, fathoms, yards</dd>
<dd>all with primary agricultural or nautical measuring and navigational function</dd>
<dd>used to define large distances and areas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the level of the cubit,remen, foot, hand and palm the larger units are</dd>
<dd>corelated to the units used to measure bread and beer and other commercial</dd>
<dd>consumables. Those are two separate but related sytems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Iron age standards are probably the best place to look at the consensus of opinion</dd>
<dd>about how to define the Mile because iron age standards are different than</dd>
<dd>copper age, bronze age or medieval standards in that their relation to the degree</dd>
<dd>is discussed in classical documents in considerably more detail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because this is the period when the Greek and Roman and for that matter</dd>
<dd>Phoenician empires are heavily engaged in trade with Europe and a period</dd>
<dd>when traders moved overland, up rivers and along coasts which they surveyed.</dd>
<dd>Many Greek, Roman and Phoenician geographers of the period have data</dd>
<dd>which they provide about the distances between places in Europe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As the Greek and Roman traders moved into into Germany well in advance of</dd>
<dd>any conquering armies they carried with them standards of measure for</dd>
<dd>commerce and agriculture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These Greek and Roman units are already well established in the popular literature</dd>
<dd>as opposed to obscure technical publications written in dead languages</dd>
<dd>for copper and iron age units so they are much easier to document</dd>
<dd>and have much more accessible web sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to giving their values to the nearest whole mm rather than to several</dd>
<dd>decimals of mm, iron age standards are not precise to decimal mm</dd>
<dd>or variant to 10's of mm and generally best established to +/- 1 mm per foot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For those cultures for whom there is a written contemporary primary reference</dd>
<dd>to sharing a standard (as with Ptolomy;s geography) which was cited on the</dd>
<dd>discussion page for ancient weights and measures, there are long term</dd>
<dd>investigations of the units involved and the results</dd>
<dd>are now considered basic historical fact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the past many people have applied an ethnocentric perspective</dd>
<dd>to "their measures" stating that they are "Anglo Saxon", "German",</dd>
<dd>"Danish" French or "English" when they actually have much longer</dd>
<dd>histories that have been explored in the literature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Being able to see the connection broken down by conventional archaeological</dd>
<dd>period rather than simply lumped to gether as ancient makes the similarities</dd>
<dd>and differances much clearer</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The objection that these studies are original research is invalid</dd>
<dd>as their original sources have been cited on the discussion page and</dd>
<dd>in some cases transcriptions of the original ancient language with</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> [Author:TCross, 09:19, 5 August 2005 (UTC)] This word is obviously NewSpeak (George Orwell, "1984"). The purpose of Newspeak according to Orwell: Compress a thought down to a few syllables so that the mind glosses over and accepts the embedded concept without careful consideration. In this case, the inventor of the word is attempting to implant the idea in the public mind that some Muslims hate non-Muslims, and that hatred is a kind of hatred similar to Islamophobia. Certainly the author of the article may state that idea anywhere and everywhere he likes as often and as loud as he wishes. But the Western world has known about Muslims for a thousand years, and we should ask two questions 1) How have we got along until today without a word like this? 2) Now that we are making war on the Muslims, why do we suddenly discover a need for this word? Here is my answer to these questions: In this entry is the authors define the word as a form of racism that is not between races.</li>
<li><b>Keep (Vote made by Anon ip)</b>. It seems to me that this is a useful word to define the concept of hatred which is clearly visible in the behaviours of extremists within the islamic faith. The existence of this page here does not imply that all Muslims hate non-muslims, but the existence of this word is useful when needing to refer to those who do hate non-muslims and it is good to be clear that this is about a sub-section of the faith, not all members of the faith. Muslim organisations in the UK condemn the actions of those who we could now say are "suffering from Kaafirphobia". Does the definition state that all muslims hate non-muslims? I do not think so. If we are clear about the definition I see no reason for deletion. 86.133.173.24 06:44, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Might I be right in coining a neologism for "hatred of non-Christians by Christians"? Because if this article is kept, that is EXACTLY what I'll do. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> 17:18, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Revolución, yes please go ahead and create your own neologism for "hatred of non-Christians by Christians" because we already have neologisms like <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianophobia.html" title="Christianophobia">Christianophobia</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a>, and Kaafirphobia in Wikipedia. You have my support. Here in Malaysia, Kaafirphobia is a word commonly used in colloquial speech as all non-Muslims, irrespective of religion are commonly lumped together as one category, <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaafir.html" title="Kaafir">Kaafirs</a> by Muslims. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam%40mysite.com.my_9863.html" title="User:Sam@mysite.com.my">Sam@mysite.com.my</a> 08:23, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (Vote made by anon IP)</b>. (Its a useful word that is the reverse of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> and is used in regular speech here in Malaysia, where there are two categories of people, first is the Muslims, and second is the non-Muslims who are treated as inferiors, irrespective of their religion) 219.95.180.120 18:45, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep (User has less than 50 edits)</b>. I support its inclusion in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> as this word has prior use, which can be proven through a search at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> and also on various other blogs, such as <a href="http://www.minishorts.net/?p=373#comments" class="external text" title="http://www.minishorts.net/?p=373#comments" rel="nofollow">Minishorts</a> . Also, it accurately describes hatred of non-Muslims by radical Islamists who are usually condemned by moderate Muslims. Rajanr imposter 07:13, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please, various blogs? you stated just one and even that, the word kaafirphobia came up in the comment section.<a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarth_4e50.html" title="User:Earth">__earth</a> 12:50, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I cannot speak for Rajanr [since renamed "Rajanr imposter"] but are not entries in Wikipedia based on common use? Even the terms such as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianophobia.html" title="Christianophobia">Christianophobia</a> were developed by common use. So, I do not see anything wrong with the poster who said the word kaafirphobia came up in the comment section of a blog for this is how a word gets created. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam%40mysite.com.my_9863.html" title="User:Sam@mysite.com.my">Sam@mysite.com.my</a> 02:53, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafir.html" title="Kafir">Kafir</a> and make a subsection of Kaafirphobia there. The term has no widespread use and a google search gives merely 3 results - 2 from a blog and 1 from wikipedia itself <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarth_4e50.html" title="User:Earth">__earth</a> 12:47, August 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me add that your claim that a google search gives only 3 results is inaccurate for you searched Google Web only and not Google Groups, which gives an additional 1 result. And if we take this third web site, minishorts.net it also has the word kaafirphobia in it except it is not displayed in Google Web or Google Groups. So, I believe this article should be retained as there are 4 known usages but there are surely other usages on local Malaysian e-communities not connected to the Internet. This term was invented by a Malaysian sociologist, Dr Colin Chee. What is your opinion, Earth? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam%40mysite.com.my_9863.html" title="User:Sam@mysite.com.my">Sam@mysite.com.my</a> 16:12, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (I vote to keep this neologism as a search on Google, both Groups and Web render 4 results, and a search on minishorts.net render 3 results. I am sure there are other web sites that use this term, which was originated from Malaysian sociologist, Dr Colin Chee. There is justification for this neologism as Wikipedia has allowed <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianophobia.html" title="Christianophobia">Christianophobia</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>. Christianophobia itself is not used frequently at all yet it is in the Wikipedia data base. So, Kaafirphobia has the right to be in the data base too as it is mainly intended to be used by sociologists for hatred against non-Muslims by radical Islamist groups like Al-Qaeda that justifies Kaafir inferiority and Muslim supremacy, which is a form of racism.) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanianCheong_4486.html" title="User:DanianCheong">DanianCheong</a> 17:18, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> as per earth's suggestion.

<li><b>Keep</b> - A search on various web sites gives 12 results, i.e. Google(5), minishorts.net(3) and rajanr.com(4) so it is quite notable to merit its own article. I understand the purpose of Wikipedia is for already used terms and not original research. Since Kaafirphobia has been used already, it merits mention in <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaafir.html" title="Kaafir">kaafir</a> as well as having its own article kaafirphobia. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam%40mysite.com.my_9863.html" title="User:Sam@mysite.com.my">Sam@mysite.com.my</a> 04:16, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually there is at least one good reason to merge this with Mario, namely, if a user is looking for a character in a Mario game, they would find the character there, instead of having to search around for it (presuming they don't know the exact name of the character). This makes for an easier and more efficient source. To have a separate article on for instance "Noki" would mean that whoever is looking for information would have to know exactly what it was they are searching for. If the "Noki" is already mentioned in a Mario article, then this article is redundant and should be deleted. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 22:41, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well since I voted on the basis of the lack of his IMDb entry I will presume that you aren't including me as a vote that should change. I did go and look at that link you put up, and it indicates a short film of 22 minutes. I personally don't feel that this single appearence in a short subject film shown at a fil festival makes the subject of the article notable. There is no indication here that the film was ever distributed to an audience beyond the scope of this festival in 2003. Thanks for doing the research though, I appreciate it. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 03:13, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. That said, it is rare indeed for Singaporean film makers to have their films screened in international festivals like these, and what is particularly note worthy is that this was her first film, quite an unusual feat in Singapore's context.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. Unusually for a discussion involving so many anons, all who voted passed my personal criterion for suffrage by having a reasonably long editing history suggesting an identifiable personality and commitment to Wikipedia. Three editors wanted deletion, two merge and one keep. There being no consensus, the decision mandated by policy is keep. This does not preclude a merge or redirect. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Delete. This article was previously listed in vfd as Krishnaology, it was discussed, and deleted, mainly because it was agreed to be a neology with little use. The article has reappeared under this new spelling. The same arguments for its deletion still apply. The term under both spellings produce a total of 76 google hits. Many or most of these hits are derived from the previous article, and from links and insertions of the term into wikipedia by anonymous logins. These additions seem to be an attempt to use Wikipedia to validate the term in wider usage. I listed the article in Speedy deletions yesterday, and the notice was then speedily removed by 66.68.156.175, one of the anonymous logins that has created the entire content in the past few days. Explanations for the removal of the deletion notice were posted on the article talk page, and on my talk page. I'm not convinced. <a href="../../../i/m/c/User%7EImc_99b2.html" title="User:Imc">Imc</a> 17:34, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>! The present article is not the same content as the vfd article discussed above. This article is about theological infomation, scholarship, new developments, and it is also evolving. There are 5 theological reason for keeping this article.</p>
<ul>
<li>The only term used to discuss theology on the Hindu deity Krishna is Krishnology. It has been used to discuss the theological positions of Vaishnava denominations such as Radhavallabha and Gaudiya Vaishnava.</li>
</ul>

<li>Although the term Vaishnava Theology is an appropriate application to all subjects within Krishnology, it is also too broad of a term. Krishnology, as an aspect of Vaishnava Theology, is a more specified term and is not aplicable to discussions on the role of other Vaishnava avatara such as Rama, Kalki, Budha, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The most important aspect of this distinguishment is discussed in the article; "An important outcome of Beck and Gosvami's work is that they have demonstrated how Krishnology is intradenominational by engaging both Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology and Radhavallabha Theology."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Just as Christology is a universal term within Christian Theology, and Momonism is specific to a form of Christianity; Vaishnavism is a universal term within Vaishnava Theology, and Krishnology is specific to certain forms of Vaishnavism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Specialized terms exist to clarify communications. The term Krishnology is a useful term in clarifying the specifics of Vaishnava Theology, as has been shown by recent scholarship.</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This article and all the stubs it links to seems to me to be an attempt to promote a neologism that ISKCON does not officially use at this time. The only serious ISKON scholar who has consistently used the term "Krishnology" in reference to Vaishnava Theology is the late Tamal Krishna Goswami, who used the term only to reference his specific points vis-a-vis his theological dissertations as a sort of 'shorthand' instead of having to constantly write "Krishna-Focused Vaishnava Theology" over and over again in his Doctoral Thesis, which he <i>did not complete before his death</i> on 15 March 2002. The entire article and all the stubs that were created to link to it are attempting to promote a neologism that ISKCON does not officially use. <b>Comment:</b> Note, however, that ISKCON is undergoing a period of transformation at the present time, and as the works of the late Tamal Krishna Goswami are reviewed and the works of Dr. Guy Beck become more generally accepted, this term may at some point in the future become accepted as standard theological jargon amoung ISKCON scholars - at that point, it should be included in Wikipedia. It just isn't in common acceptance right now, and this article (and the stubs it points to) seems to me to be an attempt to push this neologism into common acceptance outside the community of ISKCON scholars. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:25, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Merge.</b> I agree with the above in that "<i>this term may at some point in the future become accepted as standard theological jargon amoung ISKCON scholars</i>." In contributing to this article I found the 2 most important concepts specific to the term Krishnology have been; "<i>As a term, Krishnology differentiates itself from other Vaishnava theologies by centering its discourse on the Krishna avatar of Vishnu and distinguishes itself from other Vaishnava theologies centered on Vishnu avatara other than Krishna</i>" and that it "<i>is an academic neo-logism for Krishna Theology.</i>" These are two very valuable concepts specific to the term Krishnology!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As the comments above note; Goswavi used the term Krishnaology to stand for "<i>Krishna-Focused Vaishnava Theology</i>." Given the value of the two concepts specific to Krishnology listed above; this article should be merged under more appopriate titles such as; <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaishnavism.html" title="Vaishnavism">Vaishnavism</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaishnava_Theology_1a14.html" title="Vaishnava Theology">Vaishnava Theology</a>, or Krishna Theology, so that these valuable concepts will not be left out. I would suggest <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaudiya_Vaishnava_Theology_0588.html" title="Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology">Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology</a>, but then <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Beck_a033.html" title="Guy Beck">Guy Beck</a>'s work would be excluded.</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> If <b>Merge</b> becomes the decision, then the ONLY appropriate place would be under Vaishnava Theology. As stated above, Vaishnava Theology is an appropriate application to all subjects within Krishnology. The other links listed above are inappropriate! August 4, 2005 198.214.51.1</li>

<li><b>Disagreement</b> - Would you like to know why it's not as widely known as, say... 8-bit theater? It's because I'm highly against spamming my readers with advertisements. Because I don't advertise on my site, nor do I myself ask advertisements to be posted on other sites, it won't be as well known as a site that spams it's existance into every orifice of the web. Remember... some things that don't spamvertise you constantly may not be all that bad. And given I have over 500 comics to date, I can safely say that this site is already doing better than many others out there. And an added note... given many of the major Metroid information databases link to me (Metroid Database, Metroid Source, Metroid Galaxy, several lesser-known ones) of their own free will, that should count for something. - Kabutroid <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 205.239.196.6 (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.239.196.6.html" title="User talk:205.239.196.6">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.239.196.6_9e96.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.239.196.6">contribs</a>) 12:18, 3 August 2005.</small></li>
<li><b>Disagreement</b> - You're right. Planet Zebeth is not a notable sprite comic, it's one of the damn best ones out there, and the only one worth my time to read. Admittedly, the first few strips did suck, but if you read past 100 at least they get pretty damn funny. Kabutroid is also one of the coolest people I've ever talked to. There are few who can compare with him on his juggling skills, also (Life, not eggs). He IS late with the updates sometimes, but if I were in his position, I'd be updating ONCE weekly, not three times. And I have virtually no life! So please withdraw your vote for deletion, as it has no logic behind it. Maybe some misdirected emotion concerning the author, but other than that I can't think of what you might have against the comic.

For those asking to delete it... how often have you SEARCHED for a Metroid sprite comic? Guess what... Planet Zebeth is the largest, longest running one online. EDIT: Oh, and would you like to know WHY it doesn't have an Alexa rating? It used to. However, I'm in the midst of changing from kabutroid.com to zebeth.com. Because any mention I give of the site anywhere (such as a message board signature, etc) is now listed as Zebeth.com, Alexa has dropped it's status of kabutroid.com, since it's significantly less used now. When the conversion from kabutroid.com to zebeth.com is complete, and all sites linking to Planet Zebeth use zebeth.com, Alexa will once again list it with a rating. - Kabutroid <small>(Unsigned vote by 205.239.196.6 (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.239.196.6.html" title="User talk:205.239.196.6">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.239.196.6_9e96.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.239.196.6">contribs</a>))</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As Kabs himself said, how many Metroid sprite comics have you actually *seen*? There aren't that many out there, and even fewer good ones. Few sprite comics, period, have run for as long as this one has. Have you checked ProjectComics? Zebeth is listed as #4 out of several hundred, and has consistently been in the top ten there. This despite the fact that the "vote" button on the home page is pretty well-hidden. The site gets nearly 2000 unique hits per day, and has accumulated over a million. I see no reason not to keep it. Indeed, I see no actual reason to *remove* it--there are lesser-known sprite comics that have their own entries in Wikipedia. Is Wikipedia really in *this* much need of pruning? I think not.

<li><b>Keep</b> A comic based on a massive fan base, that helps to feed said fanbase, thusly keeping it alive. I know many of the readers would not still be interesated in the games if it was not for this comic; This, I believe, makes it notable. Also, with it's wide range of characters, plot twists, sub-plots, etc. there needs to be a place for people who have never read it to keep track of what's going on, and for those who do to let the world know what it is. Again, I shall use Albert Einstein: During his lifetime, was he all that notable? No. For the most part, he was just a guy, doing what he had to to live. So, following that, how can you call something "non-notable" when it hasn;t been given the chance yet to become notable? <i>(unsigned vote by 216.138.232.17)</i> --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 22:17, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Not that I expect you'll read it or heed it, but let me make a point here for the people who are no doubt being directed here from this web site. "Never heard of it" isn't (really) an issue for notability. Consider, instead, whether you think a sprite comic would end up in an encyclopedia. I suggest you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, remember also that Wikipedia is not a webguide, and consider a more appropriate place for this entry, such as Everything2. Chances are, if a researcher isn't likely to ever search for you, you aren't notable. Furthemore, unless you're the absolute exemplar of sprite comics, with a truly massive fan base (such as <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-bit_Theatre_fcec.html" title="8-bit Theatre">8-bit Theatre</a>) or significant age (<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a>) and preferably both, you really don't belong, because a researcher would be looking for general information on sprite comics, not information on your comic in specific or information on Metroid sprite comics (and if they were, you should make your comic an external link from the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroid.html" title="Metroid">Metroid</a> page). In general, this means that sprite comics are, like Internet forums, personal web sites, and other such things, by default non-notable. You're making the claim for notability; back it up with some Alexa rankings that come close to or match the exemplars, provide something that is extremely important (for instance, "first sprite comic to be featured on CNN," "first sprite comic to be talked about in the media by a major public figure," or "first sprite comic to have a video game based on it, not the other way around"), or realize that you just don't fit in here. <i>Subjective quality is not a concern in this vote,</i> unless you can claim you were the first sprite comic to be discussed in a journal of literary criticism or the like. Yeah, I'm mergist/exclusionist -- especially where sockpuppets who delete their IP signatures are concerned. *shrug* --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 20:34, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Kabutroid - Actually, I was the second Metroid comic strip to exist online. The FIRST one was about 10 comics long, and no longer exists online. And as well, I'm the largest, longest running Metroid comic strip in existance. Thusly, if anyone wanted to do any kind of research on Metroid or Metroid fans or the like, they would most likely want to know about Planet Zebeth. And above I gave explanations for the Alexa ranking. However, if NONE of those points count for anything, then I would be glad to just add a link from the Metroid wiki. Given you've said that this is data-based as opposed to vote based, I'll remove my request for people to vote. And I apologize if it appears I'm deleting an IP signature, but I have absolutely no clue how that even gets there to begin with. I'm clicking "edit page", and adding my comments.
<ul>
<li>I didn't mean you when I was talking about deleting signatures. Some of the people who are coming here and voting are, however, doing so, and that shows bad faith (after all, if you stand by what you're saying, why wouldn't you want people to know who you are?). This vote is, I should note, not a democracy (I think <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> describes that), but rather one in which a consensus among Wikipedians is sought with input from others. People from your web site who have never edited here before will, in all probability, have their votes ignored, and it will seem like bad faith on your part to actively drive people here (<a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>). Anyway, I do want to mention something about Metroid fan research. I think a topic like Metroid fan phenomena might not be a bad article, given that it's one of the oldest game franchises around; I think similar ones for Mario Bros. and Sonic might not be bad topics either. A discussion of your site in such an article would be beneficial, but that's because it's part of a notable thing, but is not, IMHO, in and of itself notable. I can further support my argument in that regard by citing this page, where a common argument is that it's the "best" and longest running Metroid sprite comic. Are Metroid sprite comics notable on their own for that reason? I don't think so. However, are they notable as part of a discussion on the fan community of Metroid or sprite comics in general? Definitely. Admittedly, however, this is just my point of view, and there are others. The "vision" of what WP should be is not quite so clear as one might at first surmise.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 22:26, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The Iraqi insurgency was more aimed @ the occupation and the immediate period afterward. As the transition to the new government is complete and reconstruction is given to the new government, the insurgency will be will be a older topic. The brewing civil war is a different topic (internal factions of the state against one another; NOT Iraqis against an occupying force). This isn't my POV, there are others citing this as an outcome for the condition of Iraq. If you think that there are no sources at all except mentioning of a worry about a civil war? There is this: Jaber, Hala, "<b>Allawi: this is the start of civil war</b>". The Sunday Times - World, July 10, 2005. See <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_civil_war.html#External_articles" title="Iraqi civil war">Iraqi_civil_war#External_articles</a> for others. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 19:17, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Response - sources have mentioned the worry of civil war and intent of the insurgents to create civil war from the beginning. These are no different. The difference is that the term "insurgency" makes less sense as the transition to Iraqi democratically elected government occurs, the U.S. states is intends to withdraw (without a timetable), and the Iraqis take on more security functions. Thus the term "civil war" may be used more because the other term makes less sense, but there is no real difference in activity or people involved, except as the possiblity of the occupation ending becomes realized. All this is appropriate for discussion on the main article, not a new subject. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 19:33, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>JDR or Reddi is ok. There is something new. The insurgent article was about the fight against the occupation (and the occupations associate institutions). A civil war is about the factions of the population against each other (not an outside force). It's more than a shift in terminology. The difference is in activity and people involved in those activities. The sunni groups are killing shia groups (and vice-versa). The people involved in a civil war will also include the kurds (they are not part of the insurgency). The Kurds are not mentioned in detail in the insurgent article. They are fighting the Sunni guerrila attacking them, not sure if the shia have attack them. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 19:52, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

And, it's rather critical history - <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_4587.html" title="World War III">World War III</a> was believed to be a possibility for over forty years and drastically shaped domestic and foreign policies for three major superpowers (The US, China and Russia). It also dramatically affected the lives of everyone around the entire planet and literally changed the course of history. Who over 40 in the US *doesn't* remember "duck and cover" drills when they were a kid in school? Or growing up knowing that the whole world could suddenly end in a flash of fire and there wasn't anything you could do to stop it? Other people from other nations have similar stories. And then, in the end... It never happened. Poof. Done, the Soviet Union went away. By comparison, the potential of an Iraqi Civil War is a prediction of a possible future event, not a recap of a historical belief. Even if it happened, it would not be as far-reaching because it would not cause the world to instantly come to an end. It is crystal-ballery at it's finest - yes, it's believed to be a possibility by a lot of important politicians.

<dd>Casting the news reports into the mould of a civil war is an original interpretation of events not in the you-are-the-first sense, but in the sense that it might be, or it might not be. The term is not yet widely used in the media. We do not hear "and today in the Iraqi civil war, another xxxx was blown up". In <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> Jimbo says that <i>"...An article that makes no new low-level claims, but nonetheless synthesizes work in a non-standard way, is effectively original research that I think we ought not to publish. This comes up most often in history, where there is a tendency by some Wikipedians to produce novel narratives and historical interpretations with citation to primary sources to back up their interpretation of events."</i> As to the crystal-ball question, well, I do not think the phrase you cite applies here. That phrase is intended to allow for the discussion of things that <i>will</i> (with reasonable certainty) happen but have not yet. That is not the case here. I will grant that it may not be POV in the usual sense of the Wikipedian phrase, but I meant it more in the sense I just described: that <i>you</i> reckon this can be called a civil war. Moving to Ethnic conflice in Iraq is altogether more tasteful, but if and only if the article is recast into that mould before doing so. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 04:30, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree it's an interpretation - I've felt that all along. However, the author acknowledges this both in the article and in his citations, and the citations do cite people *other* than the author who are making this interpretation. Mainstream sources, including Allawi and major news outlets. I feel with the addition of an "Opposing Views" section, the encyclopedic nature of this article is properly carried forth. I've added a citation to the "Opposing Views" section that helps support the contrary view.

<li>It asserts its opinion as fact to be opposed rather than as a discussion of what's happening in Iraq. The introductions says <i>"The ongoing Iraqi insurgency during the Iraqi reconstruction serve as a sign for the existance of the sectarian civil war in the country."</i> That is pure assertion — it takes a series of events and concludes that, in the author's opinion, it is civil war. It goes on to talk about <i>"the existence of the civil war"</i>. This is not so much a consideration of <i>whether</i> there is civil war as an argument of the case that there <i>is</i>. We already have a non-interpreted <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_insurgency.html" title="Iraqi insurgency">Iraqi insurgency</a> (which is at least a term used everywhere), <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-invasion_Iraq%2C_2003-2005_4f4c.html" title="Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005">Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005</a> and a couple others. This article recounts the newsworthy content from those articles and puts a spin on it. And now I've persuded myself that, apart from being OR it is also POV — it barely mentions the other POV. The content from this article should, at best, be added to one of the others that must surely have sections discussing the political impact of the insurgency without needing to unilaterally conclude that it is civil war. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:34, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Nice work, but still not there and I don't think you can get there, without it truly developing into civil war. Anything with "civil war" in its title must define the civil war. There are no workers verses the elite, north verses south, slaveholders versus industrialists, communists verses the dictator, etc. Many have stated that there are no sides here. It currently is the most extreme form of anarchy, but I do not see "civil war." Yes, they all oppose the foreign occupiers, but they seem to oppose everything, which means simple anarchy. You still have multiple sides (ethnic conflict, religious conflict, social conflict, Bathaist political conflict, geographic conflict) with no objectives at all, or at least no objective other than fighting as an objective. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a></p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I really don't think that people are actively seeking out new articles to decide if they need to be kept or dropped. It'd just be way too much work to keep up with new pages like that, especially given that dropping one, if it can't be speedied, requires the three-step process of putting it up on VfD (and honestly, I've no idea how you'd do that and keep your sanity without a script, macro, or tabbed browser&#160;;) ). I think expecting people to check out <i>all</i> new pages with the current deletion policy is asking a bit much, and things will therefore inevitably fall through the cracks.

<li>Delete: Virtually a speedy delete for recreation of deleted material, except that all of the "clean and merge and redirect" votes made that one a keep and clean. Hence, no speedy here.

<dd>About my redirecting while it was on VfD: I believe the instruction not to blank/merge/move is because the VfD notice should remain visible, and it still was.

<li><b>Delete</b> MAKE IT GO AWAY!!!&#160;:-p I would second the advice that -Ril- and the author head over to arbitration, although I see no indication that arbitration is possible: -Ril- has a vendetta against the author, so strong, in fact, that his actions are over-the-line disruptive; meanwhile, the author is disruptively insisting on getting this material into WP "by hook or by crook". There's a good way to work collaboratively, and a myriad of ways to avoid collaboration. Both of these editors have done an excellent job of demonstrating two of the myriad "destruction" ways. (In other words, I'm disgusted with both of them, but am in the uncomfortable position of having to agree with -Ril- that this article has got to go.) <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 22:15, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>, neologism. Moreover, the article wrong in it's key point - it asserts that the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_evolution.html" title="Theory of evolution">theory of evolution</a> demands less complex organisms evolve into more complex organisms, and thus 'devolution' is the process in reverse. That's simply not true. The theory of evolotion is that organisms evolve adaptations to their environment, with those that develop better adaptations compared to their competitors being the ones that survive in the long term. Whether this process makes them "more" or "less" complex is an entirely relative judgement (I.E. both manatee and platypus can be argued to be more complex or less complex than their theoretical ancestors, depending on viewpoint).</s> Changing vote to <b>Keep and expand</b>, per R.

<li><b>Delete</b> extreme POV pushing.

Article grew out of a previous one that was named like the newly created <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_sexual_child_abuse.html" title="Homosexuality and sexual child abuse">Homosexuality and sexual child abuse</a>. Since the subject is always discussed (and yes, I agree, by pov-pushers) in homosexuality-related topics, it is far better that the articles exist as a seperate one; otherwise, the other articles get flooded with that stuff again. Could need some more work, though, as could most articles. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 07:36, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, reluctantly, unless rewritten to deal with the subject matter. In its current state, this isn't an encyclopedia article about the subject.
<ul>
<li>It covers items only tangential to the subject and from a massively American point of view:
<ul>
<li>the Boy Scouts of America, which doesn't appear to have any direct relation to pedophilia but rather is about the Boy Scouts' misguided concern about gay men as role models;</li>
<li>the Anita Bryant campaign, which tells us nothing about the relationship between sexual orientation and pedophilia but a lot about the influence of religious extremism in the American South.</li>
<li>The Public Perception section is slightly more appropriate, but still somewhat tangential. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:04, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b> - this page is far better than the other options. However, this page is largely POV and should focus on the intersection between paedophillia and all aspects of sexual orientation, and not just homosexuality. -<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> (<a href="../../../a/x/o/User_talk%7EAxon_2304.html" title="User talk:Axon">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Axon_75d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axon">contribs</a>) 09:09, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Because it is about Pedophilia and Homophobia in America, and extremely POV. That said, I think given that there are, as pointed out, 30 times as many convicted heterosexual paedophiles than homosexual ones, then a "Pedophilia and sexual orientation" article seems indicated. So basically I'm saying delete, or keep the title ONLY and delete all content, add a one-liner about the Hetero/Homosexual breakdown, add a stub and hopefully a decent article will result. Editing the current crap has little hope of that. IMHO the title "Homosexuality and sexual child abuse" is POV all by itself unless renamed to "Homophobia and sexual child abuse" so I am firmly against merging two misleading, POV articles. --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 13:28, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I know what a flash is and what a pan is (I cook stuff in a pan every day), but the meaning isn't clear to me. Even in the context of a flintlock, the connotation of "insignificance" is unclear -- a flash can just as well be the mark of a genuine explosion.

Anyway, if I'm not mistaken, you can't VfD comments on an article's talk page. In fact, it's much easier to deal with comments on an article's talk page if they constitute a personal attack.

<li>This content is mean-spirited and negative, and that is made all the more obvious by Witkacy's claims to the contrary. That it constitutes personal attacks is beyond obvious. He's a problem user and the value of his edits are strongly overshadowed by his strong bias and clear difficulty in dealing with other users civilly. However, I believe that the content of userspace should be legislated as little as possible, and people should be free to put pretty much whatever they want as long as it's not illegal and isn't physically abusive of Wikipedia servers. As I explained on this page when it was in Wikipedia project space, "Anyone who wants to hate me is welcome to do so in their own private user space". I meant this when I said it. Per Thorsten1, allowing Witkacy to maintain this page will serve as a strong warning to those who deal with him exactly what kind of a troublemaker he is. When one's character is rotten, no one is better at character assassination than one's self. While this content is offensive and in poor taste, removing it will only hide the problem rather than solve it. We don't really fix his attitude problem by removing this page: the bad attitude will persist, and will inevitably resurface in a different form if this page gets deleted. So, while I admire and appreciate the sentiment behind trying to remove this page, I just don't see that there is any point. I take solace in the hope that universal condemnation of the sort being demonstrated so far on this page will help Witkacy realize that he's doing something wrong. It's too bad that when it comes to rotten character, I have little optimism for any chance of rehabilitation. So, with a sad heart, I vote <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 02:44, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Abstain</b> but will comment. The project is dead (there were no edits for almost a month after it was moved to userspace). Or was dead, since some people offended by it last time found out it was still archived around and caused a stirr, raising the dead and stirring emotions again. All things considered, I think this is a big fuss about nothing, or more precisely, about some users making several offending remarks about Poles, failing to apologise, and other users treating minor incivility as a terrible crime. Personally, I despise racial incivilities and generalisation, and overzealous political correctness, and all of that can be see here. I consider that wasting our time through such discussions is a much bigger crime. PS. I like Jimbo's suggestion of transforming this into some kind of educational page, but I don't have any time to do this myself, and I doubt anybody involved is open to such constructive idea.

<dd>(1) This stuff is cut and pasted (or just moved) from the "Polish Wikipedians' Black Book" page. It was <i>not</i> written by <a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitkacy_80e6.html" title="User:Witkacy">User:Witkacy</a>, whom it obviously pleases to maintain this <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crap.html" title="Crap">crap</a>. That said, the assertion that many Wikipedians assume bad faith because the WPans they oppose are Polish is (a) an assumption of bad faith itself and (b) an oblique threat (watch out or we'll list you here!) against <i>all</i> Wikipedians who might dare to disagree with Polish Wikipedians who happened to think this "project" was a good idea. By using mealymouthed weasel wording ("many Wikipedians", "it is commonly accepted", "numerous people", etc. <i>ad nauseum</i>), the proponents of this "project" attempted to absolve themselves of any wrongdoing by purposely offending other Wikipedians.</dd>
<dd>(2) Half of what's listed on the page presently is only "anti-Polish" if <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith is presumed</a>...in other words, the supposition that everyone is anti-Polish is the "given", and anything Witkacy doesn't like is "proof".</dd>
<dd>(3)The "How to deal with Poles" in meta was <i>written by a Pole!!!</i></dd>
<dd>(4)I <i>have</i> demanded an apology for Witkacy's (and others', apparently) misinterpretation of my statement, as the page recommends, but my demand was deleted, and thus far no rationale has been forthcoming. It is increasingly obvious that I'm listed there because of the fact that Witkacy is on a crusade against me for nominating <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Polonism_d987.html" title="Anti-Polonism">Anti-Polonism</a> for deletion. (That article, incidentally, is an even bigger mess of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV-pushing</a> than it was when I nominated it...but of more interest <i>here</i>, perhaps, is the fact that Witkacy was so quick to remove my VfD tag (and did so so frequently), that it messed up my {{subst|s for 15 minutes. Nominating this page for VfD itself is just more in the same vein.

<li><b>Keep</b> unless the authors of those quotes apologise or at least show their similar comments offending other nations, proving by the same that general abusiveness is simply their unique style of conduct and somewhat weird sense of humour. On the other hand, I think that their comments on that page shouldn’t be removed and also that their quotes should be deleted as soon as they apologise. But of course it’s up to Witkacy as it is his user page. I understand that it’s not a nice feeling to see one’s name on that page but, though none of those remarks was targeted at me, I felt offended all the same. I don’t understand why some editors can see no way for answering arguments of others without offending the others’ nation.

<dd>All nations under Nazi occupation suffered, some more some less, there was nothing unique about the Poles' experience during WW II. Only the Jews, in <i>all</i> countries in Europe were targeted for genocide by the Nazis (and many people, like the Poles helped them do the job), to pretend that the Poles are now like "latter-day Jews" is just plain dumb. Who are you fooling except yourself? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:10, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>IZAK, you know I usually agree with you, but let's try to keep things in perspective. It is true that the Poles were not slated for wholesale extermination as the Jews were. But it is also true that the Poles, as a whole, suffered more under Nazi occupation than any other non-Jewish nation (with the possible exception of Russians). Life in the non-Jewish part of wartime Warsaw may have looked like fun from the perspective the Warsaw Ghetto; but from about any other perspective, it rather looked like hell. Roughly 6 million Polish citizens died during the war, about half of which were industrially exterminated as Jews. However, we should not assume that the other, non-Jewish half somehow amused itself to death. They were not put to do death as systematically and efficiently as their Jewish neighbours. But that's about the "worst" that can be said of them.</dd>
<dd>Also, it strikes me as an unfair simplification to say that <i>"the Poles helped them do the job"</i>. Most Poles simply did nothing. While this may be nothing to be particularly proud of, it is not a basis for saying they "helped the Nazis do the job", either. It should also be taken into account that most death camps were located on Polish territory, and in no other Nazi occupied or allied country was assisting Jews punished more severely than in it was Poland. Thus, to say that the Poles behaved particularly badly towards the Jews, in a way that could only be explained by some special anti-Semitic instinct, we would need to know how the French, Hungarians, Romanians, Russians, Spaniards etc. would have reacted if the death camps had been erected on their soil and if similar sanctions had been imposed against attempts to save Jewish lives. As long as we do not know this, the Poles deserve the benefit of the doubt as much as anyone else.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> We are in the early days of Wikipedia still, and we are still establishing case law, as it were. One one hand, the concept of a user page deserves some protection, this is a user's space to do with as they will. On the other hand, accusation without possible appeal or discussion in a public forum is damaging to our main goal - writing an encyclopedia. A list of anti-Semitic users, a list of stupid users, and a list of right-wing users would all be equally troubling, and disrupive for Wikipedia, since it destroys good faith and creates factions. Its one thing if somebody can appeal a label of "racist" or "personal attacker," quite another if they are branded without due process. We have thresholds and policies for behavior, and I think this sort of vigilantism sets a bad precedent, as does imposing punishments, like demanding apologies, in order to be removed. The community should concentrate on working, and punish policy offenders through official channels, rather than fighting slights, real or not, outside those processes. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 05:57, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This particular user sees Wiki as a vehicle for advancing a certain view, which means purging Wiki of all historical facts, regardless of whether sourced or not or stated in NPOV framework, that in his opinion might somehow reflect badly on Poles or Poland. I would argue for keeping the page for the same reason that a holocaust denier should be allowed to keep a "black book" on declared anti-German users: it allows other users to see that the creator of the black book has an agenda and his Wiki behaviour might not governed by a respect for generally accepted historical principles. If others are more likely to be suspicious of the Wiki edits engaged in by black book creators, the black books will ultimately serve to limit the influence of the propagandists by helping to identify them.<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdell555_915f.html" title="User:Bdell555">Bdell555</a> 10:41, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
