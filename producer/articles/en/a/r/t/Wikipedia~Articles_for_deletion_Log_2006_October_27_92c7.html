<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I don't think that "by definition" local branches/services of government are notable. The information is certainly verifiable, but once you peel back the unimportant information, you're left with "Stoughton, MA has a fire department." (Just like every other city of 15,000+ population in the U.S.) There are only 12 fire departments listed in Category:Fire_departments and only 39 in Category:Fire departments of the United States (most of these are stubs). Contrast <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Fire_Guard_e20f.html" title="Warsaw Fire Guard">Warsaw Fire Guard</a>, which demonstrates notability beyond doubt. Certainly if a fire department participated in a notable event, such as <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> (see <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington_County_Fire_Department_31d5.html" title="Arlington County Fire Department">Arlington County Fire Department</a>), the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Chicago_Fire_f6b6.html" title="Great Chicago Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a>, or even demonstrates a long history of notable service (e.g. the Warsaw Guard article), then the department warrants mention. But to think that details about every city and village's fire departments are encyclopedic is a bit bizarre to me. Information has to be notable, and the fact that a city has a fire department -- well -- isn't. (I would also support <b>deleting</b> many of the other non-notables in the categories listed above.) <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkerHawx_2728.html" title="User:SkerHawx">SkerHawx</a> 12:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Unnotable unaccredited "institute." I get 342 yahoo hits for "Carroll Theological Institute". This "institute" does not even have classrooms, and while its website in 2004 said it hopes to have accreditation one day, there is no independent accreditation group/board that mentions this. The last <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_B._H._Carroll_Theological_Institute_95dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/B. H.

A thorough read through the published, verifiable, independently-sourced articles included in the article regarding the school shows that it is quite genuine. That a new school is not accredited by a national accrediting agency does not make it a diploma mill, nor does the timeframe in obtaining such accreditation constitute any evidence of non-notability. Despite the lack of traditional news coverage, the articles provided and available online provide clear satisfaction of every aspect required by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I find the use of "scare quotes" and other derogatory suppositions regarding those who voted to keep the article in the previous AfD to be yet another staggering violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> by <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a>, and the bad faith shown in taking another stab at destroying this article so quickly to only add to the issues.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Baptist publications are independent reliable sources. They are not by close affiliates of the institute. For those who don't follow Christian denominations, baptists are about as unorganized as something can be and still be worth having an organizational label for. Independent for discussing notability and for <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> purposes means just independent of the particular organization/person/etc... under discussion. Religious POV newspapers are just as legitimate as "alternative" newspapers with a politically left POV (which we use as independent reliable sources on politically left topics). The Baptist Standard is a print newspaper/magazine that has been publishing since 1888, see <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=2807" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=2807" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<li>I find the comment by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> that the sources used are "religious publications with obvious strong biases" to be disturbing and confusing. What is their bias? Each of these sources are used to provide factual information, not to offer an opinion. Each source used is an independent entity that covers religion. The implication that these sources are invalid is false, if not patently offensive. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:27, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The issue here is notability. There are <b>two sources</b> tied to churches. That's all there is. Yes, accreditation is a multi year process; Are they a canidate? Can you verify they have applied for accreditation? All regional accreditators require a school have a library, this doesn't even have a campus. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 16:10, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only one of these points relevant to notability is that the false claim about the independent sources. The sources are not tied to churches. The publishers have near pseudo-denominational affiliations, which is very, very different. (Baptists aren't even really a single denomination; in the U.S. they were for about 50 years, but have been becoming more and more fragmented since they original association broke up due to the same tensions that led to the Civil War.) See the response above for more details about what the publishers are. There have been multiple published, independent reliable sources primarily about them, which is the foundational basis for almost all criteria for notability, and we have no consensus criteria for schools to assert a tighter standard. (The notion of tighter standard for schools is laugahable, given the general AFD discussion about schools.) A trivial google search also produces additional reliable sources. There are 34 articles in The Baptist Standard that refer to the school (natural, given that it covers Baptists in Texas) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+site:www.baptiststandard.com++%22B.+H.+Carroll+Theological+Institute%22+-Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+site:www.baptiststandard.com++%22B.+H.+Carroll+Theological+Institute%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<dd>Please try to turn down the attitude and keep your personal observations about other editors to yourself. And as for the other sources, I don't think publications like the <i>Baptist Standard</i> or the <i>Biblical Recorder</i> count, because they violate, at least in spirit, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>'s dictum that the source be "independent of the company or corporation itself". It's for this reason that we don't give as much weight to articles about Scientology that come from Scientologist news services. Lastly, I think the authors of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> meant "multiple" to be more than just two, because even a hot dog stand in Iowa can manage to get two puff-piece articles written about itself in some paper or other. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Sunject lines such as "Four leave Southwestern Baptist to join new seminary", "Baptist seminary may find itself at home in Arlington", "Texas Baptists to open independent institute" and "Theology education taken to churches" would all seem to be "about" B.

<dd>Scare quotes? Um, no, they were <i>quote</i> quotes. I was quoting the editor above who stated "one of those publishers has thirty-four different articles that mention the institute." And a <i>mention</i> isn't good enough. Many of the articles you refer to came out before the school opened, and are apparently simply passing along what was received in the school's press release. This too, is dealt with in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<dd>First there are no sources. Then the sources are "biased" baecause they're church-related. Now the sources are indeed from widely-accepted news sources, but came out too soon, before the school opened. Every source listed and provided in the article meets every standard specified by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and especially <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> which specifies that <b>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself</b>, which is clearly met by the sources provided.

<dd>Yes, you did quote me saying "one of those publishers has thirty-four different articles that mention the institute." You apparently didn't notice the immediately prior sentence (which you need to read to understand the quoted one, because the antecededent for "those" is in the prior sentence) that says "But we have linked in the article and referenced here, from at least three different independent publishers four different non-trivial published works primarily about the institute." The bit about thirty-four is for people who don't think four is enough and are willing to look at the evidence that has been provided. I think four that meet every test in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> is enough to defeat the claim about inadequate sourcing, so I'm not going to waste my time looking at the other thirty-two.

<dd>In this particular use of the statement, it undercuts the argument that you could create an equivalent school out of your living room, and explains how the hypothetical AFD for your hypothetical school would not be equivalent. This is a real school, not a diploma mill. The evidence on this seems quite clear to me, even looking just at the sources already in the article, never mind the things I saw when I went looking for additional evidence. We have, between the article and this discussion, proof of staff that were college professors before they joined this Institute, a library in excess of 5,000 volumes, a founder that was formerly a college president, and multiple published articles in multiple independent reliable sources that are primarily about the Institute. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:46, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I said the evidence was in the sources already in the article. But I'll copy it here for your covenience. To quote our article <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">diploma mill</a> "an organization that awards academic degrees and diplomas with very little or no academic study, <i>and</i> without recognition by official accrediting bodies." (Emphasis added.) At the present they lack accreditation, as everyone knows - Wikipedia even sources the article to their statement that they aren't accredited. However, the other test for being a diploma mill is "awards academic degrees and diplomas with very little or no academic study". A cursory glance at <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" rel="nofollow">their admission requirements</a> shows that they want students with the ability to do academic study. (This is most blatantly obvious for the advance studies program. <small>"For admission each applicant must submit to the Committee of Senior Fellows for Advanced Studies a research paper either previously prepared (an ungraded copy) or prepared especially for the application on a subject in the student’s chosen major field of study. This paper should be 25-35 pages in length. The paper should represent the applicant’s best quality of research and writing. The form and style should follow the 6th edition of Kate Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations. The paper will be graded in terms of form, presentation, and content to determine whether the applicant is capable of doing research and writing at an advanced level."</small> But it is visible in the admission requirements for all three levels of studies.) Since I went to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_dd6d.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">a school where the typical course was 12 units of credit</a>, I have trouble interpreting course units as used elsewhere, but I'm sure that 48 units in 24 courses for their lowest level or 78 units for one of the second level programs (<a href="http://www.bhcti.org/images/DiplomaChristianMinistry.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/images/DiplomaChristianMinistry.pdf" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a> and <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/images/StudiesPastorNew.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/images/StudiesPastorNew.pdf" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a>), plus a recommendation to take half as many courses per term as one would elsewhere <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/Students/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=126" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/Students/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=126" rel="nofollow">(second to last paragraph)</a>, is not "very little or no academic study". See also second paragraph of their statement on accreditation, linked in the article.</dd>
<dd>I don't know where the physical library is; I'm not in the same part of the world as the Institute. I just know that we have reliable evidence that they have it. I'd guess it is in Arlington, Texas, given that they have a center there where the professors are.

That the school was covered by papers in the Dallas/Fort Worth area could be chalked up to local religious coverage that spits back the contents of a press release (I'm surprised this charge hasn't been made yet), but newspaper articles in serious papers based in Kansas City (519 miles from Arlington) and Atlanta (a whopping 800 miles away) bespeak a newsworthiness that meets the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> standard, using sources that are inarguably valid per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which ergo, by definition fulfil the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> standard.

<li><b>Delete</b> Even if you believe that all schools are notable (fortunately I do not) this institute wouldn't qualify. "The institution does not hold classes in any conventional sense. Rather it trains students in 15 “teaching churches” scattered across Texas, as well as through interactive lessons taught over the Internet" Its not a school, its a church afilliated organization and a non-notable one at this point.

<li><b>Keep</b> (edit conflict) Holy well-poisoning, Batman. Calm down, everyone. Yes, persistent school inclusionists are tiresome and yes this really isn't a school, but the issue is notability and verifiability, as JoshuaZ rightly points out (though I disagree with his ultimate conclusion). Let's look at the sources to see if they establish these. The "church sources" are articles in independent wire services or publications that appeal to Baptists; however, there is no apparent connection with the seminary itself. They are independent and seem credible to me. Also, this has been covered by major daily newspapers. The sources (and, since <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> doesn't seem to be participating in this discussion, let me be the one to point out that you have to actually read the sources) noted the controversy surrounding this organization: it was founded by four moderate Baptist professors forced out of another seminary when it was taken over by fundamentalists (who dispute the propriety of this college using the name of the other seminary's founder). The coverage in the mainstream and religious press generated by this controversy makes this subject notable. (I cannot believe my first edit after coming back from a longer-than-expected wikibreak is to keep a freaking school!) <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 02:19, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> We need to keep cool heads here. I was ready to vote delete right away on this one, but further research bears out. By the so-called "tests" this seems non notable on face value, but deeper digging DOES turn up multiple, independent coverage. The various "tests" we apply for notability are meant to get us LOOKING for notability, but they by themselves do not mean that something fails the primary notability criterion. There is multiple coverage, it is covered in a fairly extensive way, and by independant sources (I know it's "religious" press; but then again you look for music reviews in the music press, don't you???). Just because it fails a guideline doesn't mean it is AUTOMATICALLY not notable. It means we should check it out. When one checks it out, it passes. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:56, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are plenty of things that meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <s>(which this does)</s> (changed my mind, see below) that are still not notable enough to include in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: First off, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is a guideline, not the Bible, and not WP policy. There's a gut check about whether something is notable. 400 students? I can name thousands of high schools with more. Coverage in the Fort Worth paper? I can provide tens of thousands of articles if local news coverage is all it takes to be notable enough to be an entry in an encyclopedia. Per your comment, there's also no criteria that says that I can't use a lack of accredidation and any shred of recent coverage to help form my opinion as to whether this Institute matters beyond its own walls. Lack of accredidation means it's not a school that can confer degrees, which means that it's in essence a Bible Study group. Typically, notable organizations will have ongoing coverage <b>or</b> be historically significant. This fails both. And by the way, the Dallas News article cited is future-looking ("hopes to start classes", "will be based somewhere between Dallas and Fort Worth", etc. Both Ft. Worth newspaper articles focus on the four founders resigning their prior posts and joining this new project prior to the Institute ever teaching a class. No secular (i.e. "independent") news coverage exists after the Institute is founded, so I'm not sure that helps the article's case. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkerHawx_2728.html" title="User:SkerHawx">SkerHawx</a> 13:44, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> On what basis are you claiming that the 2006 article from the news bureuae Associated Baptist Press <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/766.article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abpnews.com/766.article" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> is not independent. There is no link between the ABP and the Institute. This independent coverage has been a source for the Wikipedia article since before this AFD began. The claim that both are Baptist is not a serious claim that they are related parties; as reading our coverage of Baptists could tell you. Baptists just aren't as organized or like minded as most other denominations are; they are splintery like the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Catholic_Churches_6706.html" title="Independent Catholic Churches">Independent Catholic Churches</a>. Per <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists_in_the_United_States_5dfd.html" title="Baptists in the United States">Baptists in the United States</a>, there are four separate major groups of Baptist denominations. The ABP self describes in part as "Working out of our Jacksonville, Fla.- based headquarters, and with bureaus in Washington and Dallas, ABP provides daily coverage of Baptist news, news from the nation's capital, and other general news and information of concern to Christians in the U.S. and around the world." <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b>. I understand how loosely affiliated Baptist Churches are. But the article's author, Marv Knox, is the editor of the Baptist Standard, and the article you cite by the ABP is a <b>direct copy</b> of an article printed by Knox's Baptist Standard <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=4445" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=4445" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Another "independent" article cited (The Biblical Recorder) is written by Mark Wingfield, who worked for the Baptist Standard directly under Marv Knox <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=1070" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=1070" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. The third article is by Ken Camp. Camp replaced Wingfield directly under Knox at the Standard when Wingfield returned to ministry. So, although Baptist churches are very loosely affiliated, it seems all three of the authors of the four referenced articles currently work for, or worked for, the Baptist Standard (and they all worked together and know each other intimately). That's not independent. Two of the other references provided are directly from the school's web site. Okay, now deep breath... Take a look at this article <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist_General_Convention_of_Texas_9a76.html" title="Baptist General Convention of Texas">Baptist General Convention of Texas</a>.

Why? Because each and every author of every single one of the articles published about the school are all part of the vast right-wing Baptist Cabal. Somehow, despite the fact that the <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram_c51a.html" title="Fort Worth Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Morning_News_212f.html" title="Dallas Morning News">Dallas Morning News</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_Express-News_0a0d.html" title="San Antonio Express-News">San Antonio Express-News</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Star_9abb.html" title="Kansas City Star">Kansas City Star</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Journal-Constitution_62d1.html" title="Atlanta Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a></i> are all independent nationally-recognized publications, with editors and publishers looking over reporter's shoulder's, each member of the cabal was able to pull the wool over their eyes and get an article published. Send your theories to Dan Brown, it sounds like a great plot for a new book. But, other than that, it's pure unsupported original research. You'd be hard pressed to find any group of reporters covering any one industry -- Recording, Iowa Hot Dog Stands or Baptist churches -- who haven't worked together at some point in their career. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> I'm sorry, I don't see any citations from the San Antonio, Kansas City, or Atlanta papers in this article. The Dallas and Ft. Worth papers are responding to a press conference covering a notable event (the abrupt resignation of four faculty members at SBTS, as below.) And I searched the papers you mentioned, and they all have articles from (only) November 2003 indicating the same information (faculty resigns, to form new institute - note future tense). <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkerHawx_2728.html" title="User:SkerHawx">SkerHawx</a> 17:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further note</b>: Two of the three secular articles cited are from Nov 5, 2003 (Dallas &amp; Ft. Worth papers). These articles were covering a press conference <a href="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_5_2003/ne051103four.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_5_2003/ne051103four.shtml" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> on Novemeber 4, 2003 and seem to be covering the abrupt departure of the four faculty members from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary as much (or more) as covering the new school. Of course, both articles are (as mentioned above) future tense, since no such Institute existed yet. I'm not paying $2.95 to see the full text of the third article, but the only visible paragraph just repeats the information already known from the first two. Look, the Baptist Standard is the official paper of the BGCT, and all of the religious articles covering this came from the Baptist Standard or its writers. All but one of the articles was published in the Baptist Standard directly (see my citations above). This isn't a conspiracy, it's a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">Public relations</a> strategy. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is crumbling on this one.

<li><b>Almost convincing</b> Where this falls apart is the link between those editors and the Institute. Yes, the Institute is named after one of the founders of the BGCT. But he was also a founder of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, from which the staff broke away. We wouldn't say that the Institute was affiliated with SWBTS because of using one of their founder's names. The argument was enough to go make me look and see if the BGCT supports the Institute. The <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=278&amp;srcid=247" class="external text" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=278&amp;srcid=247" rel="nofollow">BGCT's page</a> on the schools they support does not mention this Institute. The results of a <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2655&amp;srcid=278&amp;txtSearch=%22Carroll+Theological%22" class="external text" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2655&amp;srcid=278&amp;txtSearch=%22Carroll+Theological%22" rel="nofollow">search</a> at the BGCT's page don't show any sort of affiliation. They show trivial mentions a scholarshiop given to a student at the institute, a member of the Institute staff leading a tour group in the U.K, an event being taught by folks from <a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_b30a.html" title="Baylor University">Baylor University</a> held in part at the site of this Institute, that the Institute is one of ninety-seven exhbitors at the 2006 convention, and one of nine schools of higher education hosting a special event at that convention. (The policies of the BGCT do allow non affiliated organizations to exhibit, I checked, and the hotel chain exhibiting is adequate evidence of that.) I also checked the Institute's web You've convinced me that a lot of the articles were written by people who know each other. You've also convinced me that those writers are the world experts on what events among Texas Baptists are newsworthy. You failed to convince me that they have any affiliation with the Institute, which is what independence is all about; see <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a>. So I continue to conclude that the articles are by independent sources. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Last one</b> This will be my last post on this AfD discussion, simply because I'm just not that passionate about whether or not this article is ultimately deleted. I'll answer your question and then just let the facts speak for themselves. Everyone is welcome to vote for a delete or a keep. Alas, you asked for some more detail, so I'll respond this last time. Here you go... Check out the BGCT member church web site <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2869&amp;srcid=178" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2869&amp;srcid=178" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and cross-reference it with the institute's teaching churches <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/Churches/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=158" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bhcti.org/Churches/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=158" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. A 100% match on all 17 churches. Charles Wade, executive director of BGCT, welcomed the Institute in "...our ongoing effort to train effective Christian leaders..." <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=923" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=923" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Dr. Russell Dilday, one of the founders of the Institute was a former president of the BGCT <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/pr/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7804" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baylor.edu/pr/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7804" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. This is the bottom line ... the Institute and the Baptist General Convention of Texas have the same deposit of faith. Their visions are aligned, whether or not BGCT explicitly supports the Institute or not. The Baptist Standard is an official publication of the BGCT, and as a religious newspaper it writes from a certain paradigm. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not unbiased. (If Catholics in Atlanta created a Catholic Theological Institute, the Archidiocese of Atlanta's official paper (<i>The Georgia Bulletin</i>) would cover it (so long as it was in line with Catholic teachings). I wouldn't consider that to be an independent source. Nor would I consider other Catholic publications an authoritative source to help establish <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. So I'm just saying that the beliefs of the official voice of the BGCT and the beliefs of the Institute are 100% on target. As such, the BGCT (and therefore the Baptist Standard) have a vested interest in promoting the Institute. That's all.

<li><b>Keep</b> We are not a regulatory agency, nor are we interviewing graduates of the school as potential employees, so even if it were a giant unaccredited diploma mill, we should only look at notability, not legitimacy. This is the same principle on which we have articles about religions without having to prove the truth of their claimed miracles and the existence of their particular god. Similarly we have articles about hoaxes and pseudoscience, without certifying the truth of the claims. We are not the arbiters of truth, just of verifiable notoriety. The school has faculty formerly with the mainstream Southern Baptist seminary, who were pushed out by the fundamentalist takeover of that denomination. The school is widely mentioned in Baptist publications, has 400 students, and trains them in 15 churches.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This appears to be fairly sizeable institution, if rather new. Comment: Arbustoo and others seem to focus on accreditation as a sole criterion for whether something counts as a legitimate higher education institution. I agree that for an ordinary college, that is a good rule. However, for a seminary or other "vocational" type schools (perhaps, say, a school of auto mechanics) I think the rule is not always applicable - the students' prospective employers (in this case, Baptist congregrations) don't care if the school is accredited, they want someone educated by a group that they themselves trust, and who can demonstrate their knowledge of the field. So, I think we need to focus on other factors - age, size, prominent graduates, connections with established denominations, press, etc. On another point, there also seems to be a tradition of distance education in theological education - probably because prospective ministers can't afford to attend a college full-time. I agree that this makes the institutions less notable, but I don't think it should disqualify them, just because there are fraudulent institutions that use the same methods. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 20:57, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm afriad I question the validity of that google search. 'Ark 22' is a very generic name so it stands to reason that most of those results have nothing to do with this game. How about providing direct links to some of those websites that establish notability? And as for the other games arguement, I feel judging any article in relation to another is a very poor thing to do, as articles should only be judged in relation to Wiki policies and guidelines, and secondly, most fan games are now being examined with a view to deletion if notability is not provided. The other games are usually only being 'allowed' insofar as no-one has had time to look at a specific article, but check the CVG project page to see just how many fan games are currently at AfD, and more are sure to be nominated soon.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 12:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please read the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. Self-published material, because the threshold for creating them is very low, should have more rigorous requirements for verifiability (never mind notability, which requires multiple non-trivial third-party instances of verifiability). The reloaded interview is not sufficient, because most of the article is asking the creator questions (the content that the creator answers is considered primary source material). The fact that it's published on the web should not make the verifiability requirements less stringent then other forms of self-publishing. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:46, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Obviously my vote is <b>strong keep</b>, I mean, G4TV dedicated an entire segment of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h1ROKY4fdQ" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h1ROKY4fdQ" rel="nofollow">Attack of the Show to the game</a> - that passes notability. And what about bandwidth? Over 300,000 downloads and 7 terrabytes of bandwidth. Surely, that, too, passes notability. Most <b>commercial</b> games are considered a success when they sell over 250,000 copies of a game; well, 300,000 people have acquired my game. I need to say nothing further on the matter. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 00:29, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, to pass notability, this game must be "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." As far as I can tell, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show_45ce.html" title="Attack of the Show">Attack of the Show</a> is the only such example -- and that show often runs segments on things like Flash movies, Internet memes, "cool websites," and other assorted non-notable, non-encyclopedic ephemera. Add to that a bit of a vanity concern and I think we have a clear delete. No hard feelings, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory of cool games and links. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 00:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It was <b>NOT</b> just Attack of the Show. Several gaming websites gave it great reviews, as well, and possibly even a few magazines. Face it, the game's famous. Delete the article, and you're probably going to have your head ripped off by a horde of rabid fans. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 00:52, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (formerly <s><b>Weak keep</b></s>) per <i>Attack of the Show</i> coverage and claim of having "been featured in many magazines". These magazines need to actually be cited within the article to "count", but it's a start. Weak keep for now, with the possibility of a full keep or weak delete depending on how the magazine coverage thing turns out. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 00:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have updated my vote. Per below, it seems the magazine coverage is trivial and a mention on Attack of the Show apparently isn't such a big deal after all. I'd also like to point out that the conduct of the article's supporters on this Afd has been truly abysmal. Granted, that is certainly no reason to delete in and of itself, but it certainly doesn't help what is already a borderline case at best. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The game was also in numerous published magazines. The number of downloads, and bandwidth it's used should be more than enough to take care of it's notability.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Andre... You saying, "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory for cool games and links" is so hypocritical. The majority of the wiki articles would never appear in a published encyclopedia, and you can't keep trying to make wiki a, "Standard Encyclopedia" because it's obviously become much more than that. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshuku_d2b5.html" title="User:Ashuku">Ashuku</a> 00:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand what hypocrisy is involved here. Wikipedia <i>is</i> an encyclopedia and articles must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/Wikipedia%7EEncyclopedic_889f.html" title="Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">encyclopedic</a>. Also, observers, please note that this user has under 50 edits. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 01:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Its hypocritical because there are tons of articles on wikipedia like this, which are just as notable, and get keeps all the time. And if you read what I said, I clearly called it, "Much more than a standard encyclopedia".</li>

<ul>
<li>"Trivial" is such a broad term, though. What Person A considers trivial, Person B may not. What about Kotaku? Voted the number one gaming blog for Spike TV's Videogame Awards 2005. They mentioned MarioWeen when it first came out, too. Googling it returns 264,000 sites. Is that trivial to you? Because it's not trivial to me. I'll try to find the magazine scans I have (I saved most of them, but not in a unified folder or anything, and they lack identifying file names, so it's going to take me a while to track them down). Also, <b>Luigifan</b>: Chill out. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 00:57, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Triviality is not in reference to the source itself, but the nature of the mention. Gaming blogs in particular are not <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable sources</a> for notability. They also have a strong tendency to, like <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show_45ce.html" title="Attack of the Show">Attack of the Show</a>, write about non-notable ephemera. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 01:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I want to see this magazine coverage actually cited in the article.

<ul>
<li>What do you mean it lacks specifics? I didn't know I was supposed to list every single last magazine that had a blurb of my game in it. I listed the bigger name ones I could think of; <a href="http://blazefire.mooglecavern.com/GMMarioBlueTwilight.jpg" class="external text" title="http://blazefire.mooglecavern.com/GMMarioBlueTwilight.jpg" rel="nofollow">GamesMaster</a>, for example, the largest gaming magazine in the UK. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 01:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The GamesMaster mention is clearly trivial - it's just one sentence and a screenshot.

<li>Yeah, I let myself get riled up, and that's my fault; I'll readily admit that I overreacted. However, Andrevan's being a bigot. He refuses to change his point of view, even with me, Blaze, and several others prodding solid evidence of this game's notability <i><b>up his eyeballs</b></i>.

<li>Gamesmaster is only trivial to you because you're not British. And because you're determined to see things your way.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- Why on earth should this be deleted?! I mean, for one, it <i><b>has</b></i> been featured on magazines and a TV show, dosen't that qualify it as notable?! If we manage to find the said magazines then BOOM! we have a winner. Anyway, everyone (or mostly everyone) here thinks it's notable, and most "discussions" for deletion usually are decided by the number of people who think it is notable. And, no offense, Luigifan, you shouldn't go to such extremes. I don't wanna sound like I'm nagging, but it'll do more damage than good if you do that. Try to be civillized and maybe we'll be able to hold up a persusive argument. I mean, I wouldn't agree with someone who vandalized a page or is using profanity.

<li>Unfortunately, I am having trouble finding anything more than the GamesMaster scan. It WAS mentioned in Hardcore Gamer Magazine, but it was <i>really</i> trivial - one of the editors mentioned it under "Games I am playing this month". Which really, really sucks. I thought I at least copied the images in when I packed up the MarioWeen source and burned it to a CD, but they aren't there, either. I don't know where else to look unless I go through each and every individual image on my HDD - of which there are <i>thousands</i>.

<dd>Like I said, I lost my temper when I felt that Andrevan was ignoring us. However, now I see that it's because you don't think the citations are good enough. I would agree... if this was a <i>commercial</i> project. However, a mention is the best coverage a fangame can expect, evn if it's pretty good. If it actually gets an <i>article</i> in a magazine, it must be stellar... on the other hand, this game should fit those guidelines. Actually, Wikipedia is probably the site that does the best job of explaining this game, short of Blaze's website itself, and that's one of the major reasons I'd like to keep the article. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 19:51, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> I will agree that any "X" can be notable. The only wikipedia guideline that matters is "Non-trivial coverage in multiple, reliable sources". Can anyone voting keep provide these MULTIPLE, RELIABLE, and NONTRIVIAL citations? If you can, I will change my vote. If all you can do is assert notability without providing evidence, then why should that give the admins a reason to keep the article. Remember, this isn't a vote, this is part of an investigation. Investigations require evidence. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:21, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I'm invoking the common-sense rule. There's no dispute that the game exists, was featured on a television show, and has a large number of players. The guidelines were intended to ensure this type of notability -- to provide a test for it. They weren't intended to disqualify otherwise-notable topics that fall under a certain unspecified threshold of media attention. That said, my personal interest in the game and the article, and in fan games in general (and Mario stuff in particular) is pretty much zero. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 18:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Why should it matter that this is a fan-made game? It's a game that's appeared on television, SEVERAL gaming websites as well as printed magazines in a few countries, and has been downloaded a great amount of times. It has a fairly detailed Wikipedia entry, complete with references and screenshots. All of which is more then I can say about a good amount of officially released games, I can tell you. Oh, and it's also been mentioned in NGC Magazine. A scan here: <a href="http://coldflame.doorsclosing.com/images/twilightNGCarticle.jpg" class="external free" title="http://coldflame.doorsclosing.com/images/twilightNGCarticle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://coldflame.doorsclosing.com/images/twilightNGCarticle.jpg</a> (I have a full page scan for anyone who asks for it) I hope this may help even slightly in proving the article's notability even further. <a href="../../../h/_/h/User%7EH_Hog_547c.html" title="User:H Hog">H Hog</a> 16:03, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The scanned image would count as a trivial source (at least to me). A sidebar is not the same as an actual article, which would be much more impressive. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 16:08, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">guidelines</a> don't specify a distinction between sidebars and other reviews. Their purpose is to ensure that a game actually exists, and that it has wide enough recognition to have appeared in objective media sources. A nine-page spread in some game-industry journal would also be more impressive, honestly, but we've reached that crucial moment in which an article has satisfied the spirit of the guidelines, and has passed the common-sense test (i.e., it's not fancruft, a commercial pitch, or a vanity page), and votes for deletion are going to have to rest on opinion and personal taste. My own opinion is that game stuff is completely uninteresting, but the article isn't for me, if you see what I mean. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 16:51, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>change vote to <b>keep</b>: In light of new evidence (the scaned image from H Hog), coverage is definately NONTRIVIAL. Though short, it is an honest-to-god review, that establishes notability.

<li>If you think this should be deleted, then by that same logic, many, many, wiki articles need to go. Such as the All your base articles, any and all fangame articles and basically 1/3rd of wikipedia. Don't be silly, the fact that wikipedia has articles on such things that have a small or 'cult' following is what makes it a cut above other encyclopedias. To delete this would be to denounce the foundation of wikipedia.

<li>"All your base" has been cited in 44 "scholarly" articles per google scholar. I'm sure I could find enough to make the page stick. It's notable and sourcable--they're not comparable. Wikipedia has a lot of articles that fall short of notability guidelines. If you find similar that you feel do not meet the guidelines, put them up for deletion. But that's not the point. We're not discussing 1/3 of Wikipedia, we're talking about this article. We have objective criteria to determine this article's merits and we should used those to determine rather than the "if we delete this, we have to delete 1/3 of wikipedia" strawman. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 02:35, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>What Perfect Chaos Zero is saying, is that this page does fit in Wikipedia, albeit in a sort of "stubbish" fashion, in that it's encyclopedic enough to be included in an online encyclopedia, but would be a waste of paper (and a bit of extra mass) in a paper encyclopedia. Since Wikipedia is supposed to be dynamic, and to cover things that other encyclopedias would ignore, this page shouldn't be deleted. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 02:39, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Changing to <b>Weak delete</b> in light of magazine mention.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - If only because Andrevan is going around flagging all these for deletion when certain ones should definitely be kept. Andrevan is no doubt aware that nobody is going to defend these poor games; most folks come in and say, "Oh it fails WP: Software so I'll vote delete on principal" without even thinking of anything else. It's very one-sided and kind of sneaky, if you ask me. Besides, Metroid Prime 2D has been mentioned in a magazine, and while somebody will no doubt go "It's a sentence and a screenshot", it's better than nothing at all. <a href="http://blazefire.mooglecavern.com/GMMarioBlueTwilight.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://blazefire.mooglecavern.com/GMMarioBlueTwilight.jpg" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> There may even be more mentions in magazines, but I don't exactly keep up with what magazines mention Metroid Prime 2D; but this just goes with what I was saying earlier: The people who COULD defend Metroid Prime 2D are not here to do so, so I will do my best in their wake. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 19:02, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Voting "keep" because you disagree with the nominating editor is a really, really bad policy.

<ul>
<li>Yeah, but the genius of voting like this is you can vote for whatever reason you wish, and I think Andrevan is being unfair. These are Wikipedia <i>guidelines</i>, not set-in-stone follow-them-or-die rules. In the tidal wave of useless information on Wikipedia, fangames are the minority. While I would definitely support these AFDs if everybody and their grandmother had a fangame on Wikipedia, they don't, usually because the TRULY useless ones end up speedy deleted. However, games like Metroid Prime 2D, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Forever_6ba5.html" title="Mario Forever">Mario Forever</a>, and SRB2 are articles that people generally seem to like and keep more or less up to date, suggesting that the project is known well-enough that people want to contribute to it's article. Andrevan is exploiting vague Wikipedia guidelines, like some cheesy lawyer who looks for every loophole to win a court case. I'm sure he thinks he has Wikipedia's best interests in mind, and I hold nothing personal towards him, but imagine if I went around putting articles up for AFD that I simply didn't care for. Imagine if EVERYBODY did the same. Half of Wikipedia would be up for AFD constantly! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 07:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. Stating your position here one way or the other because one disagrees with the actions of an editor outside the context of this AFD is trying to "make a point".

I'd advise everyone involved to calm down a bit though; accusations of bad faith nominations aren't particularly fun to throw around lightly, especially when these days a lot of fan stuff gets nominated for deletion. Consider AfDs a trial by fire that every topic that isn't on rock-solid foundation has to go through if someone so notices. Consider it an opportunity - a <i>dire</i> and <i>dramatic</i> opportunity, but an opportunity nevertheless - to improve the notability/sourcing details of the article in question. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:03, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Havok, you seem to consistently forget that cleaning up an article is not the responsibility of the people who think it should be deleted. You also overlook that this is a discussion about deleting an article. The comment you replied to was stating why they thought the article should be deleted, as they are supposed to. If someone disagrees, then it is up to THEM to put the proof in the article, which I note that despite making snotty comments about to other people, you yourself never do. So if I were you I would either practice what I preach and clean-up the article myself, seeing as it's you who disagrees with the AfD, or, if your not prepared to do that, stop making snotty little copy+paste comments in AfDs when someone says why they think an article should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:33, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> is a fangame that was made official canon by 3DO. Not to be confused with Clouds of Xeen (which I did confuse it with).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - If only because Andrevan is going around flagging all these for deletion when certain ones, such as Mario Forever, should definitely be kept. The popularity of Mario Forever is what prompted me to make <a href="../../../m/a/r/MarioWeen_9a45.html" title="MarioWeen">MarioWeen</a>. It may not have had very many noteworthy mentions on magazines or on TV, but, well, a considerable amount of encyclopedic information on Wikipedia on software would have to be deleted on the same grounds. Andrevan is no doubt aware that nobody is going to defend these poor games; most folks come in and say, "Oh it fails WP: Software so I'll vote delete on principal" without even thinking of anything else. It's very one-sided and kind of sneaky, if you ask me. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 18:57, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your both coming across as pretty daft to be honest. For all your repeated claims of how significant this and other games have been, I've yet to see you ONCE come up with any of the proof that would save the article. <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> says why merely saying 'It's popular' or 'I like it' doesn't cut it. We need news stories, and other associated THIRD-PARTY (translation: Nothing to do with the games creator) sources of information. If you can't get them, then Wiki policy states the article must be deleted. Blaze merely votes to keep something with no actual reason, and has recently been voting to keep solely based on who nominated the article, which is stupid, to be frank. And FYI Blaze, people are saying 'This article should be deleted because it fails to meet WP:X, Y and Z' because that's the point of having policies. They ensure standards are (supposedly) maintained and prevent cases like this where an article seems to be being used solely to attract more traffic to the creators site. Wiki is not an advertising service, and if someone can't be bothered to say WHY an article should be kept, then it wont be. If you think this article doesn't deserve to be deleted then prove us wrong. Find some news stories (and 7 word mentions in another article don't count either), put the information in the article, and cite them.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't know about House, but if you look at most any article on a Star Trek episode, it is more than simple plot summary. Plot summary alone does not make for an encyclopedia article. And seeing as how these are the only episodes with an article for the show and not a whole lot of activity in improving them, I don't see any reason to keep them. I mean, if you want to bring them all up the the level of quality of Star Trek episode articles, that'd be just great--but, good luck with that. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 02:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, a precedent has <i>not</i> been set. The best indicator of whether Wikipedia should have articles on individual episodes of television series is whether those episodes have <i>already</i>, <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia, been documented in detail individually, independently of the show's creators/producers/promoters. Episodes of series like <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Babylon 5</i> <b>have</b> been documented in detail, individually and independently. <i>That, not precedent,</i> is the basis upon which we can justify having articles on the individual episodes. Precedent, i.e. "If article X then article Y.", is a fundamentally flawed argument. To make a good argument, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>, in this case sources where this episode of a television show has been individually documented in detail independently of its creators/producers/promoters. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:09, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Provisional Keep</b> as an episode of a notable TV show, I'd say it's a keep by default. However, this article should be tagged for clean-up and other improvement.

<li>It was on KidsWB! and now the CW, and it involves derivations from long-established Looney Toons characters. Pretty much says notability for a television series to me. How is it not notable?

<li><b>Delete</b> This topic has been coming up a lot lately. Notability guidelines for fiction require that articles be MORE than just a summary and that they MUST provide real world context. Having articles for every single episode of every single tv show is a bit much, wouldn't you say? I've suggested that in cases where a show has lots of such articles that they be merged into articles covering the show by season, which also helps to place them in context with the show as a whole at least. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I vote on a number of AfDs daily anymore, it's not very confrontational, just an administrative type function that average editors on the Wikipedia do. The suggestion was to merge it into a broader article that covers the season in which it appeared; if there's nothing to merge it into, I <i>still</i> think it should be deleted. The article of an individual episode needs to be deleted regardless. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Having articles for every single episode of every single tv show is a bit much, wouldn't you say?</i> No, I'd say that's exactly what I'd like. Ok, not every single TV show, since game shows, for example, would rarely qualify, or news programs, and soaps would probably be a bit overwhelming, but for the most part, yes, I would like most TV shows to have an article.

<li>Valetta is a capital and a historic city. A list of its major streets (and that list is rather short) might be a good idea to have. Other cities, tho, are less important IMO. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 02:44, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>reply</b>please elaborate. I do not understand this comment. Notability, as defined in unequivocal terms in <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, is the primary criteria for the existance of all articles on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notability is a guideline, not policy. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> are the primary criteria. Notability is a shortcut to ensure articles can be written that meet those. We're not out to write notable articles, or articles about notable things, we're out to write verifiable articles without original research that reflect a neutral, objective point of view. Limiting ourselves to things that receive a reasonable level of attention is a means to that end. "this list is not more notable..." is an absolutely absurd statment, because none of our lists are notable by our standards. The characteristic may be notable or not, but we don't have notability guidelines for features of songs, because they're not the kinds of things we use that for. Notability is not the end-all be-all too many people seem to think it is. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 18:33, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK. If notability were never included, then all sorts of information would be allowed on wikipedia, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a> says that some threshold must be established before something warrents an encyclopedia article. For example: You can verify my existance through public records (phone books, tax records, birth announcements, marriage announcements, property assessements, that sort of thing. Heck, I have even been in the paper a few times. Been on TV too!). You can write an NPOV article about the information you find there. Doing so is not original research. And yet, I AM NOT WORTHY OF A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE. Why? I have done nothing notable. Lets not bicker about the difference between "guideline" and "policy". Notability is IMPORTANT. It establishes whether an encyclopedia article should be written on a subject. This subject lacks notability. It should be deleted. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're using a really hazy and subjective sort of notability. If you've had several newspaper articles and tv news stories about you, I'd say you've probably done something worthy of note. Being on TV isn't quite same, though, if they just happen to interview you. The problem with writing an article about you would be that we wouldn't have anything verifiable to write that would be anything other than a directory entry. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 19:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> Explain the haziness and subjectiveness in these terms: NONTRIVIAL: Extensive coverage, more than just a mention, the subject in question should be one of the primary focus of the sources. MULTIPLE: Many, several, numerous. RELIABLE SOURCES: Editiorial process, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Nontrivial coverage in multiple, reliable sources. The only criterion that is worthy of defending WRT to notability. This subject does not bear out, as there is no critical review of bands just for their names. But there cannot be nontrivial coverage of what is essentially a trivial fact. Thus the list should be deleted. WRT my notability, I have not had "several articles" about me. My name has appeared in the newspaper as a graduate of highschool, college graduate, when I got married. I also had a picture published in the paper when I was a child for "Hey, look how cute this kid is" kind of article. I appeared on TV as a participant in a high school quiz show that airs on a single public television station. I am not notable. All of these instances are verifiable, but they are trivial in the sense that extensive review has NOT been done with regards to these sources. Thus, I am not notable, thus I am not worthy of an article. Lists of bands by genre of music WOULD be notable, since there is extensive coverage of bands within the context of their genre. There is nothing more than trivial coverage of bands merely because of linguistic coincidences in their names. Arguing against notability will get you no where. There is near complete consensus that notability (or lack therof) is a criteria for deletion. If you need to establish that for yourself, read through any days worth of AfDs. See which articles get deleted. See why people want them deleted. Merely because you, as a single editor, do not want notability to "count" and find it "fuzzy" does not mean that the general consensus will change to your opinion. The consensus opinion is that notability is both easily definable and understandable AND an important criteria to a subjects worthyness. This subject is not worthy, since it fails the primary notability criteria: It has no hope of ever warrenting NONTRIVIAL COVERAGE IN MULTIPLE RELIABLE SOURCES. Thus, it dies on the vine. Delete it. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:47, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But, sir, Mory's is quite famous. It is definitely not a non-notable club, and I don't say this because of any partisan issue. Mory's is a very old institution that was immortalized by Bing Crosby and Elvis himself in their songs. If you don't believe me, do some web-surfing. It means something to a few of us out there.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ckkgourmet (<a href="../../../c/k/k/User_talk%7ECkkgourmet_5642.html" title="User talk:Ckkgourmet">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckkgourmet_545d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckkgourmet">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Well, since hardly anyone can actually be a member of Mory's (I'm not--are you?), I guess I can hardly advertise the place!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, changed my stance to <b>neutral</b>. The reference I provided isn't more than a quick mention, and I can't find any sources related to the connection between the establishment and Crosby/Elvis that suffice to assert notability.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 03:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's mentioned in any number of books on the area.</p>

<p>But, sir, you don't seem to understand: they mention the "Whiffenpoof Song," an extremely well-known ballad amongst older Americans, which is all about Mory's. I think this is why you are so confused. Anyhow, your point is now moot, given the confirmation of the other responses below.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'll apply the "random bypasser" test. I'm a random bypasser (didn't go to Yale and never been to Mory's). But I've heard of Mory's. It's pretty famous - at least in some circles. I definitely think it's notable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 03:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> As a Yalie myself, I can attest that Mory's is an important institution not only on the Yale campus but also nationally. It is an institution of American culture, given the world renown of the Whiffenpoofs's "Song". And I have been there when visiting celebrities and politicians have been in attendance, including NY Gov. George Pataki, President George (HW) Bush, senators, etc. It is a venerable national institution, surely of greater importance than the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_Club_81ee.html" title="Elizabethan Club">Elizabethan Club</a>, and I strongly commend its merit in achieving a Wikipedia page. --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschon_1127.html" title="User:Rschon">User:rschon</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I should add that, as a new Wikipedian, I find it distressing that this type of contributed article is judged "Non-notable" by someone without any knowledge of the topic, so far as I can tell, and naturally enough without presenting any evidence whatsoever. --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschon_1127.html" title="User:Rschon">User:rschon</a>
<ul>
<li>I think the idea that something is self-evidently notable is more distressing. The article has (or had) no sources whatsoever. Try reading some policies before making comments, specifically <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I'll withdraw the nomination when the article backs up its claims of notability with sources. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 04:14, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1. The club/bar/restaurant is 150+ years old.</dd>

<dd>3. The club was at one point the subject of a special act of the Connecticut General Assembly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It does seem objectively notable, and worthy of inclusion. (Though I would certainly agree that it's not something everyone would have heard of or that you could easily find on a Google search - I by no means think this was a bad AFD to make (I might have made it myself if I hadn't heard of the place). I'm just strongly on the side of keep.)--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 04:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Book sources have been added to this page. By the way, this is getting completely out of hand. Clearly, notability is now obvious. User: Ckkgourmet</p>

<ul>
<li>If you google for MOSEK, MOSEK is the first hit... that's hardly surprising is it given that it is a proper name? However, what you need for notability is references from other sites or works of authority to MOSEK. I can't find much from the UK computing press. Can you sign yours edits, it's good form.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. According to the company website, net assets are in excess of $550 million USD. One of the subsidiaries, Arabian Automotive Co, sounds fairly notable as a distributor of several major car marques. Website is very out of date though, so difficult to tell if company is still notable today. Given that the company is in private ownership, it's hardly surprising there's no stock market listing; that doesn't particularly make it non-notable. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 22:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Assets is not a measure of notability. Having a stock market listing is according to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 08:19, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Point of Information</b> FYI, while net assets of a private company are not quite the same as the market cap of a publically traded company, note that a public company with less than US$2bn market cap is generally known in the finance world as a <i>small cap</i> company. Being in the $2bn to $10bn range is known as <i>mid-cap</i>. <i>Large cap</i> is &gt;$10bn<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/031703.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/031703.asp" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.This company's website says that its net asset worth is $1bn with not much debt... this most likely places it in the small cap range if it was publicly traded. Also, the UAE is a wealthy country, so it is not obvious that a &lt;$2bn company is a dominant player. Also rough estimates for self-valuation by private companies which are not required to disclose any or verify (publicly audit) any financial information to the public should probably be considered an unreliable, self-publishing source for this particular kind of information <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As anyone who regularly invests in stocks or stock mutual funds knows, publicly traded companies very frequently will have market cap values that are much higher than the companies' actual value (real assests). This is usually attributed to investor speculation. Comparing a publicly traded company's "market cap" to a privately held company's "assets" is like comparing apples to oranges. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 06:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not comparing apples to oranges, though they are different (and market cap value can be <i>lower</i> than the value of a company's "real assets"). Valuation of market cap or of assets is not primarily understood as the result of on the one hand, "speculation" or on the other, just "fire sale value" - its key that it must incorporate the expected future earnings of the combination of technical, human, and financial capital in place. A company's asset value doesn't just include the base price of tangible real assets. It's the market value of the tangible and intangible assets. Obviously if you fire the personnel, give up the goodwill, and sell off the equipment piece by piece, the "fire sale value" is going to be less than the sum of the parts. But we talking about the worth of a <i>company</i>, not a just a bunch of random stuff for sale. Anyway, my primary point was that a $1-2bn company is not that impressive. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 14:50, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comparing an unknown nonexistent "market cap" to the real "assets" of a private firm is not a correct method of gauging the scope of a company. As you said, the open market might value a company <i>lower</i> than a company's "real assets," as well has <i>higher</i> and sometimes <i>several times higher</i>. We just don't know. As this company is not publicly traded, any assumption on market cap value is guesstimation. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 20:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge or Weak Keep</b> WP:Music is not well suited to judge musical groups other than pop music and rock bands. Most brass bands or choral groups, even if they have a national reputation, do not tour or have chart-topping CDs. Their role is as a part of the cultural base of the community. This one has been in place since 1870, and has had a bandroom and bandshell since 1940. They are one of a handful of such in Canada. They receive mention in several online listings of bands and in the Encyclopedia Canada reference. Having an active website is not a requirement for having an article. If Wikipedia has an article for every bus route and subway stop in the world, perhaps there should be a place for a community band such as this.

<li><b>Comment</b> Take2: I'm no expert on sources, especially on US sources and/or graffiti art, so it would be good to hear from others about these. For me, at the moment, the two interviews do not look sufficient neither do the website references. The newspaper articles might be but they are, it looks, impossible to verify. (Anyone know otherwise?) My own feeling is that if sufficiently notable the article would have already been created and there would be no need to have created it yourself. That is the normal way of articles. It might be best to userfy the page and wait for your fame to reach others/spread further afield? I'm sure if that were to happen someone would recreate the article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 19:10, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree with the above comment that "if sufficiently notable the article would have already been created." There are many clearly notable topics which still do not have articles, for any number of reasons.

Still, I am not sure we have enough here to meet two VERY important notability criteria: MULTIPLE sources and NONTRIVIAL coverage (that is, extensive coverage within the source). The MULTIPLE and NONTRIVIAL requirements of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">the primary notability crtieria</a> to me would seem that we shouldn't need less than 5 minutes to read the entirety of the press coverage this subject has warrented.

<dd>The wording is my mistake. Still, they paint a pretty bland picture. The ADL and CDR websites -- the three two most reliable websites on search results -- refer to them only as a street gang, in reference to the Confederate Knights. The Public Eye article, also reliable, refers to their self-published notice in a Neo-Nazi zine. The remaining sources refer back to those three articles, or have nothing to do with the organization we're talking about. The last 20 search results are equal parts typos like "busine ss of america," or statements like "the Marines are the SS of America." So two minor references in lists of skinhead street gangs, a claim posted from their self-published zine, and typos. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 18:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How are lists definitely encyclopedic"? I couldn't agree less. Lists should have a place if, and only if, they are of a clearly defined finite content of things that actually belong together as a list. Examples might be 'List of countries in the European Union' or 'List of metallic elements' or 'List of best actor Oscars' (though even the last two are not necessarily worthy of their own page if they could be better included as part of articles on 'Elements' or 'Oscar winner' respectively). The list must belong together - it must have meaning AS A LIST. This list does not qualify - it must be totally impossible and certainly impractical to list EVERY Armenian given name, and even if it could be done, is it necessary?

<li><b>Not Delete</b> The article shows the fact that process and structure of organizational communications and interactions presupposes one another. No organization can reproduce a sutible superior leadership guideline (structure) without the acknowledgement of the activities of their stakeholders (process).

<p>Hi Guys: Here's the story; I appreciate your sage advice/help. Some time ago, I was alerted to a Wiki bio posted on me that was very short and almost totally in error, and what was marginally correct was 30 years old -- there was little reference to anything I had done in recent years -- in other words, an embarrassing distortion. Friends, associates were emailing me -- I host a PBS series, Closer To Truth, on the implications of frontier science, www.pbs.org/closertotruth. What to do? So I added accurate, recent material, perhaps in the Wiki Spirit too much (which I've just taken out). Furthermore, a recent posting criticized my admittedly controversial biography of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, which was the #1 best-selling nonfiction book in China in 2005 and was published worldwide by Random House / Crown, “as being propaganda and largely untrue, having been commissioned by Jiang Zemin himself”. This calumny is wholly untrue, but in the Wiki Spirit, I did not delete its false and scurrilous accusation (almost anything related to Chinese politics, I understand, can become emotional and there are diverse points of view, all of which should be heard), but rather in response I quoted myself from Foreign Affairs magazine, a most reliable source, in answering the same charge. Seeing and appreciating your comments, I’ve just tried to pare down the bio, make it more NPOV, an acronym I’ve just learned. I’m an amateur at this; I'll happily have Hands Off, if’s that’s the policy, so long as inaccuracies are not promulgated and defacing (however subtle) is not permitted. Much of this material on me can be confirmed on the Internet (though some of the bios are outdated). In conclusion, I love Wikipedia, appreciate your commitment and vigilance, want to conform, but do not want errors of any kind to remain nor inserted biased commentary to go answered. Help, my friends! Robert Lawrence Kuhn 29 October 2006.</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I just put heaps of new stuff in, somewhat removing the crystal ball element. The 2012 olympics isn't coming for another 6 years but it's still got a page. Once a product has been confirmed (which this has) any and all specualation by first party high-level employees becomes part of the consoles history.

<li><b>Comment</b> Next time, type <b>Keep</b> instead of <b>Don't Delete</b>; that sounds kinda odd&#160;:) Second, I encourage you to take a look at the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Olympics_55be.html" title="2012 Olympics">2012 Olympics</a> page. That page has a lot of facts and current developements, such as the bidding, the financing, what sports will be in it, etc. The Xbox 3 page has naming speculation, a "hint" at developement, something of a "confirmation(if you'd even call it that)" that the hint is true, and something about voice recognition. An article this is not. All this will lead to is most likely vandalism, loads of speculation, and it will become a crystal ball, which as <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> pointed out, Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> a crystal ball.</li>

<li><b>Compare</b> I notice there is a request for deletion on this page - but this is where a Grand Slam champion tennis player tuned up for an eventually succesful tilt at a Major title! It is not simply a tree-lined street. I could also add that it was the home of the Red Cross Headquarters for Eastern Melbourne during the War years, 1940-1945, and also, for Vietnam during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. Can someone explain how that is any less important than a street that has had its street-sign stolen a couple of times? Nirvana Avenue? I would argue that headquartering the Red Cross and hosting a 7 Time Grand Slam winner are greater claims to fame than a street thats simply had its sign stolen.<a href="../../../j/k/m/User%7EJkmccrann_d10b.html" title="User:Jkmccrann">jkm</a> 09:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The subject of the article has been the inspiration for at least two songs by noted bands (The Ballad Of Purple Acky by Hungy Ghosts and Ode To Purle Ackey by Zen Baseball Bat), and has as such entered the popular consciousness to some degree. Also, there is an (admittedly unconfirmed) case to be made that Clive Barker's 'Candyman' draws heavily on the mythos surounding Aki before his arrest and subsequent confirmation of his existence.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - if you live in Liverpool, St. Helens, Warrington or Widnes you will have heard of him. Try telling all of his victims he isn't notable. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenorKristobbal_a2de.html" title="User:SenorKristobbal">SenorKristobbal</a> 09:08, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do. And I would still maintain that he isn't notable. The article was also full of dubious information with nothing to back it up (e.g. "he chased a kid on to the railway lines in New Brighton and electrocuted him but was found not guilty of manslaughter"). Happily, the article has been cleaned up substantially since the AfD, but what verifiable information there is, is contained in scant few online news stories and is barely enough to make more than a stub. There are hundreds of crimes (and sex crimes) committed every day and Wikipedia doesn't carry articles on them. Equally there are dozens of Urban Legends like the story of "Purple Aki" and Wikipedia doesn't carry articles on all of those. This story is nothing special - perhaps the most notable thing about it is that he was never convicted of anything more than harrassment and intimidation; despite the legend that built up around his activites. Purple Aki is not the Yorkshire Ripper. He is not Fred West. He is barely a footnote. All IMHO. Marwood 09:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Barely enough to make more than a stub."? Are you proposing the deletion of all stub articles then? Also, you note that there are many other urban legends like that of Purple Aki, but how many of these other urban legends have been proven as being based on a real figure? It's very interesting as an example of an urban legend which many believed to be purely false until the man himself was captured.--83.216.157.38 11:19, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Fair comment. I wouldn't propose the deletion of all stubs, no. However the "stub" exists as a placeholder for a topic that needs expansion. I would contend that there isn't enough <i>verifiable</i> material to write a full article on Purple Aki - it is all rumour and hearsay. It looks like consensus is "keep" though, so I hope someone will find the time to create a good factual article on the subject. IMO, however, it can't be done.

It is two words. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> where one looks up the definitions of words. That's Wiktionary's job. Wikipedia is about subjects, the people/places/events/concepts/things that the words denote. One would come to Wikipedia to find out what the <i>concept</i> of an active couple in dancing was.
<p>The question of whether there should be an individual article is determined by whether there exists source material yielding scope for expansion beyond a perpetual "The active couple is the couple that is active at any time." stub. Saying that it "needs sources and expansion" is not good enough to counter the argument that it is an unexpandable perpetual stub. One has to actually <i>demonstrate that there are</i> sources and that scope for expansion from stub status exists. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:29, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Change name?</b> I had a look at what links here and discovered it occurred in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_country_dance.html" title="Scottish country dance">Scottish_country_dance</a> as &gt;&gt;"top couple" (or active couple)&lt;&lt; - I've never heard of active couple (I thought it was electronics) but I'm very familiar with top couple and I think it is a very useful term to put in. Now if someone could tell me what the top couple is in an eightsome real and how that relates to other forms of dances it will be interesting and warrant an entry. I've only ever heard of it as "top couple" so I suggest changing it to that. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 18:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. <i><b>Not one single source has been cited, except a Bible verse.</b></i> I have no problem with the topic choice, just with the quality of the article. In my short time on Wikipedia I have seen several really bad articles about very appropriate subjects. When they get nominated for AfD someone usually comes along and works on the articles to make them better-- improved grammar, more neutral language, some really excellent citations, etc. That hasn't happened with the poor little defenseless groin attack. This is a very readable article, but we have no way of knowing if it is just original research or worse, a copyright violation. Unless there is a real threat of deletion I doubt that anyone will come along and clean up the problems. How long has it been without a cleanup and a fixup even after it was called to everyone's attention? If no one's going to give it the much-needed improvements it shouldn't stay here. Notability isn't the only criterion. <i>I'd wager any one of the men on Wikipedia who has ever been a victim of a groin attack is going to urgently insist that it was notable</i>.<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 00:05, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> It should have been on cleanup notice, but I don't see that it has. The article is a mess. I am not the appropriate person to write for this article. It appears that no one is available to make the article suitable for keeping on Wikipedia regardless of the notability of the subject. When someone writes an article on this subject with proper research and properly cited sources, I'll be strongly in favor of keeping it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is no consensus among the Wikipedia community regarding how small a lake should be to be deleted and, even if there was, I suspect that this one would pass the test.

<li>For all those voting to keep, if we reduce this article to what is verifiable from the only source provided, we are left with the statement "Lake 13 is a lake located in Surrey township, Clare County, Michigan. The lake spans about 95 acres (384,000 m²)." None of the rest of the article is verifiable from the source provided. Further, the name is ambiguous, there are not only two other lakes named "Lake 13" in the state of Michigan, there are three others in Minnesota (as well as two others named "Thirteen Lake". I am usually extremely inclusive when it comes to geographical features, but this lake is non-notable in the extreme. And considering that the only source provided is an image from a real estate agency, I have to question whether there may be an element of self-promotion involved. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 01:37, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>(1) Following a Lexis-Nexis search, this school does not appear to be the primary subject of multiple (or any) non-trivial works which would indicate notability. For this reason, <b>delete</b>.</p>
<p>(2) Strangely enough, I can't find an inspection report on this school (I thought all UK schools had one). But even if there is one, such a report would not indicate notability. In general, the existence of non-trivial third-party sources shows that the outside world (as represented by the publisher of the source) deems the subject notable, hence we Wikipedians consider it notable enough for inclusion. But an inspection report on a school isn't published because its publisher, or anybody, deems the school notable, it's published because schools are accountable to parents. So an inspection report is not enough to show that a school is notable.</p>
<p>(3) This school even appears to fail the overly inclusive criteria of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. Now, before someone says "But WP:SCHOOL suggests merging, not deleting," note that my main reason to delete (1) does not rely on WP:SCHOOL, which anyway does not enjoy consensus approval. I mention that this school fails WP:SCHOOL only to bolster the argument for non-notability. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 12:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> Regarding inspection reports in UK schools, you need to know that each of the constituent parts of the UK has slightly different education systems. While it is true that inspection reports are published for all state schools in England and Wales (and I believe also in Scotland), I do not know that this is the case in Northern Ireland. Perhaps a Wiki user from there can let us know. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 18:22, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. It appears that this school, which has existed 40+ years is suffering from being able to establish notability. Unfortunately, that is the situation for most Northern Irish schools where, due to political sensitivities, most schools do not even have their own website to sing their praises. If it helps, here is an article from the Times Edducational Supplement about a teaching method devised by a teacher at the school, <a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2093130" class="external free" title="http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2093130" rel="nofollow">http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2093130</a> . <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 20:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Times Supplement article is <i>not</i> "on the school." The school is at least 2 degrees removed from the subject of the article, which is, to boil it down, about field trips. The "Spooker Prize" is only mentioned as an example. Further, I think that the Spooker Prize can only charitably be called a "teaching method," as you call it above. (It's taking kids to a cemetary and having them write or tell stories about it.) Neither the Spooker Prize nor its inventor, Sinead McCrystal, justifies an article about this school. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:51, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Basically, the argument has been put forward so many times on so many AfDs that it gets tedious to continually trot it out. Nominating these articles is utterly pointless and a waste of everybody's time, as even the most fanatical deletionist must have realised by now. It has got to the stage when deletionist dogma has overruled common sense, and that is not beneficial to Wikipedia in any way. We are eventually going to have to agree to disagree, since 99% of articles on secondary schools <i>will</i> be kept. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 02:22, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, so you want to argue on the basis of precedent. But you can't conclude from precedent that high schools are notable. <i>Any</i> kind of AfD precedent tells us what actually happened to articles, not whether the subjects of the articles were in fact notable. You also can't conclude from precedent that high school noms are pointless. Because, looking at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">schoolwatch</a>, I see that 4 recent high school AfD's resulted in no consensus and 1 in a merge. From my point of view, <s>folks who flood</s> flooding these AfD's with groundless keep votes <s>are those who are</s> is "not beneficial to Wikipedia." In cases where the delete voters have good arguments and the keep voters have strength in numbers, the result should be delete. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:03, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, I'm arguing on the basis of people wasting all our time by continually nominating articles that are obviously almost certainly going to be kept. The arguments for keeping high school articles been made again and again by "folks like me" and endlessly rehashing them for "folks like you" is getting tedious.

<li>Whew, where to start? (1) I don't doubt the greatness of your edit record. I doubt the benefit of voting in AfD's without giving a good reason. (2) Even though I think your vote is pointless without giving a reason, I withdrew my reference to "you" in my comment because I didn't want to get personal. You changed my comment back, and that's not cool. (3) If you have actual arguments to make as to why this school is notable, please make them even if it would be tedious to do so. I've made the arguments in my nom many times before, and yes it was a little tedious to make them yet again, but I had to do it.

<li>Right, first of all, <i>I</i> didn't change your comment at all. <i>I</i> replied to what I saw on my screen at the time and I did not get an edit conflict notice. Why on earth would I change your comment? Do I have a history of changing people's comments? Second, I shall write what I choose in an AfD. The closer will make his or her own decision as to the validity of the comments. You are entitled to your opinion, and I am entitled to mine. Yes, really; even if it conflicts with yours. You also seem to think this is a vote; it is not. AfDs don't work that way. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:38, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The school has no non-trivial sources for it under either name so it doesn't meet even the most basic notability criterion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Simply existing is not enough, contrary to what some people imply. This school has nothing remarkable, nothing that sets it apart from any and avery other school. Since I don't feel that all schools are inherently notable (why should they?), this one has no reason to have its own article anyumore than an average person has. No verifiable non-trivial coverage for the school (not some tangential coverage, directory entries, local newspapers listing some school party, or inspection reports please, I've had enoug hof those in many school articles). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:58, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Above and beyond the inherent potential notability that all secondary schools possess, this article has been greatly improved from the point at which the AfD was created (again, thanks to <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a>), and will only benefit from further improvement and expansion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:58, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The school appears to be located in an economically deprived area, and for a number of reasons it is unlikely to generate the same proportion of notable alumni as an independent or selective school. There is some risk that insisting on a rigorous proof of notability will tend to exclude schools in economically deprived areas. Such schools often serve a more ethnically diverse population. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 17:17, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

This is. There is no where on the web currently keeping an up to date list of the ICOC churches, and the last one (at icocinfo.org) shut down recently. There is no attempt made to advertise specific locations (no address, phone numbers, etc) are included, just information. RE the "linkfarm", I have advocated in the past that the links at the bottom be merged in with the list (i.e. have church name, website link in one line). It's a big job though and no one has done it yet. The links should definately be here--I mean, if someone is looking for the Toronto Church of Christ website, and they get here, why make them google it?

<dd>1. Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional). (It is NOT this. The church locations are strongly associated.)</dd>
<dd>2. Genealogical entries or phonebook entries. (It is not this. There are no addresses, no phone numbers, no contact information short of the website.</dd>
<dd>3. Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business. (Again, not this. While it might fit the definition of a "directory", the heart of this policy is to avoid people creating a business website on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>With respect to being a "repository of links", Wikipedia again says:</dd>
<dd>1. Mere collections of external links or Internet directories. (Not this. Again, the heart behind this policy is to avoid tons of external links to opinion sites, and unofficial sites. In an organization where there are many OFFICIAL sites, I believe this is totally fine. For example, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_MMORPGs_8c14.html" title="List of MMORPGs">List of MMORPGs</a>. Just a list of games, but a link to each one's wikipedia entry; one type, many different non-opinion sites. Also, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_combinatorics_topics.html" title="List of combinatorics topics">List of combinatorics topics</a>. If you want to say anything about the list in question, say we should get rid of the external links, and work on making wikipedia articles for each of the different churches, maybe with a history (planting date, growth rates, news stories about it in particular, etc) and include the website link there. Though I do think this would lead to a lot of new articles, a good number of them could include some good information for people wanting to know about the church they attend, or are thinking of attending. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertBorgersen_7f68.html" title="User:RobertBorgersen">Rob</a> 15:40, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Doesn't fit into Wikipedia. A list of info that is only helpful to a person who plays or has played Half-Life 2. Similar lists have been deleted in the past. All relevant info is found within the main article.</li>

<p>Furthermore, it is unfair to keep this entry up when other lists made for titles such as, for example, the Battlefield series and Halo are taken down on the same grounds.

<dd>Hm. Part of me wants to say "There's plenty of sites that cover the weapons in HL2", but I dunno. Maybe merge it with the HL2 article? For now I'll <b>abstain</b>.

<p><b>Keep</b> it, it's an useful reference for anyone interested in the HL2 world, compiling all known data about the weapons in one spot.

<dd>No, because various articles relating to list-based information for games have been deleted in the past. Halo was merely an example, you should know that. --Gazdakka Gizbang 02:48, 28 October 2006 (EST)
<dl>
<dd>This is not a rule, because there is no precedence laws on Wikipedia - The Half-Life 2 article covers an analysis of the weaponry, including information not found elsewhere on the web (where would you find, that Tri Nguyen designed the OSIPR basing on the MG-42?) and is useful to anybody interested in the Half-Life 2 subject, while Halo articles would appeal only to Halo fanboys&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>Seriously though, there is no basis for deleting the article, as it has existed for a long time, and has grown very large and comprehensive. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikael_GRizzly_708b.html" title="User:Mikael GRizzly">Mikael GRizzly</a> 18:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> You know, I just figured this kind of deletion spree would happen when I started to see this sort of thing crop up a few days ago. However, regardless of one's feelings about this article, or the others, I think that at least some of this information should be <b>merged</b> elsewhere. The Gravity Gun, for example, is unique enough to deserve its own article even if this is deleted, and the information about Annabell merged to <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father_Grigori_c43e.html" title="Father Grigori">Father Grigori</a>. Maybe others, I don't know.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - If we break the article down into each of the elements that indivudally seem important, i bet that those article would all pop up for deletion. Maybye the article could use some slimming down, but as mentioned, it does appear that there is some content of value. The trick is sorting it out. To reitterate what <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> said, wikipedia is not run on precedence like law. It would appear that the halo argument is not helping the overall argument at hand, but instead opening the door for more arguments that will not help solve this issue. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 17:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I certainly agree that this article is a keeper, heck, I felt the same way about the Halo, BF, and other articles, but I could tell when I first saw them that it wouldn't be worth arguing about. That said, even if we did accept that this article as a whole isn't a keeper, I do think it is obvious there are keepable elements in there.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'd like to keep this article, along with all the other ones deleted from other games, but it doesn't fit in, as stated before. If it HAS to be deleted, perhaps we should incorporate into the main article? I believe there is a weapons list in the Halo article.--Satanator 18:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The weapons in Half-Life 2 are quite significant to the game, and are very notable in their own right. For example, the crowbar and gravity gun have become synonymous with the name Half-Life. The gravity gun, in particular, has received a lot of attention due to its uniqueness and its perceived "revolutionary" it has achieved in the genre. In terms of being the best weapon ever, it was voted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxSdKF5Fd38" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxSdKF5Fd38" rel="nofollow">number one</a> by <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameTrailers_fbde.html" title="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>. However, something like weapons and vehicles in Battlefield 2 are generic and hardly specific to the game itself. It's highly unlikely that someone would get Antlion pheropods and the Combine pulse rifle confused with another game. If the article needs to be cut down, the "Deleted weapons" section can be trimmed quite heavily. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 21:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> a game guide. This most clearly and obviously is a game guide that fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Plus there are OR issues. Crowbars are not "synonymous with the name Half-Life". They are synonymous with "metal tool for opening crates". Gravity gun can be mentioned (probably already is) in the main game article. This long list of pistols and grenades and rayguns and whatnot and how to find them in the game and use them effectively is not acceptable for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The crowbar has indeed become quite synonymous with Half-Life in popular culture. This is even acknowledged in the article here on <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crowbar_%28tool%29.html" title="Crowbar (tool)">crowbars</a>. The gravity gun is only passively mentioned in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a> article. However, I'm positive that adding one big paragraph solely dedicated to the weapon will break the very fine balance of this article's current featured status. Hence, the reason why this article in question was created. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 22:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, and I'm not sure why the article on Halo 2's weapons was deleted. In fact, I'm not sure why video game articles are so frequently killed through AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think the article is a fairly useful and informative resource, though I will admit it has gotten quite bloated and contains a lot of unnecessary information. The article could definitely use some extensive scaling down and editing. If it should be deleted, then I suggest moving some of the more notable content to appropriate places, perhaps incorporate certain characters' trademark weapons into their respective pages (crowbar/gravity gun to Gordon, Alyxgun to Alyx, Annabelle to Grigori etc.). Combine weapons can be and already are incorporated into the Combine Combat Technology article, and a Rebel Combat Tech article may be a useful for categorizing the crossbow, dune buggy and airboat.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShabby_a2ea.html" title="User:Shabby">Shabby</a> 20:47, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This reads like a section from a game manual, not an encyclopedia entry. All barely relevant data is already included in the various Half Life related articles. This also seems to have a serious <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problem on top of it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a game guide</a>. With absolutely no sourcing, there looks to be a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problem, but Half-Life 2 is popular enough that there <i>might</i> be published reliable sources for significant portions of the page.

<ul>
<li><b>Strongly Keep</b> because I frequently looked at this article prior to buying Half-Life 2. I wanted to see whether the weapons remained loyal to the original and if there were and unique weapons like the egon from HL1. I also used it check whether I'd be playing half the game without a shotgun or if that gravity gun everyone was talking about was a end-of-game only weapon. This article really helped me decide whether or not to buy Half-Life 2 as opposed to something else. And you can't say that this article should be deleted because other articles were deleted. Maybe no one who had read the Halo 2 weapons article showed up to vote against its deletion. Maybe the Battlefield and Halo articles <i>shouldn't</i> have been deleted after all. I might make a case against, for example, Counter-Strike weapons, because you could make the case that articles for the real-world guns already exist. Since these weapons are all unique, information on them would be unavailable anywhere else. Plus, this is useful for anyone (like me) who like to see how much damage their weapons do so they can plan battles in advance, or want some extra information that they didn't know about their gun like the instant-kill for man-sized foe. For example, I thought that since the orbs did 100 damage and poison zombies have 150 health, that the former wouldn't kill the latter in 1 hit but the opposite is true. 68.44.212.188 22:16, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><strike>Delete</strike> Weak Delete</b> - I disagree that the article chronicles a notable individual. I personally could list as many poster/paper presentations for myself. There aren't many publications, and I couldn't find significant data about the individuals who cowrote the papers with Blake. Again I will point out that I have my name on several "publications" for doing little more than basic statistical analyses. I almost changed my mind when reading the theatre section, but I will once again point out that adapting a well known book into a play is not really notable (in wikipedia anyway) until the adaptaion becomes notable (which it has not). It seems to me that the only achievement worth mention is Blake's teen study. Since the only citation points to a poster Blake presented at a large conference, I am inclined to see this article sent to the digital garbage bin unless somebody comes along to significantly improve the article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 17:12, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am sure many of us have made posters and given presentations. I can think of 4 I did my senior year but it was in front of no more than the entire department and some other people. The posters and presentations claimed in this article, were given at some pretty notable functions it would appear, not just some guys speech for a class presentation. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Fair enough. I just get nervous that there are a lot of people with distinguished academic credentials and it is just not reasonable to give each a page on Wikipedia. I would still like to hear more about this individual before feeling satisfied with the article. In the meantime, I have upgraded from delete to weak delete. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 18:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Truly distinguished academics <i>should</i> have Wikipedia articles, but it takes quite a career to reach that point. Many articles, book chapters, and a few full books would usually be needed first. Nothing against Dr. Bowden, but there doesn't appear to be anything here that separates him from the typical Ph.D./Psy.D. Just look at any professor's vita online and you'll see what I mean. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 20:46, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The claims of academic notability come only from a dissertation and a poster presentation, neither of which have been published with peer review. His actual publications are very few and far between, and he is not first author on any of them - which would make a difficult case for tenure at many universities, much less for an encyclopedia entry. Ultimately, most of the content does not appear to be verifiable through web searches or academic databases like PsychINFO. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 20:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Very dubious notability. Mostly uncited.

<li>Please <b>delete</b>. Subject is writing now (Blake Bowden) to say (as I have before) that a member of my family has done some postings. I appreciate her enthusiasm, but have now restricted the computer access on this and other machines. Yes. It is this same machine - as well as my laptop. I am pleased about a few of her submissions, but I don't endorse this article. I have previously asked this this be removed (publicly and at 'the office') and I ask it again. PLEASE REMOVE.

<p>Keep- The man was the subject of an interview done for CNN Headline News primetime-- granted it was done in jest, but this not worthy of deletion. <b>Delete</b> Non-notable perennial candidate --LyonsTwp,IL. 16:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - He ran for governor, but most of his citations are for his website, njweedman or whatever.

<li><b>Weak Delete/Merge</b> - While I agree with Chris that 'politicians' are often notable, it is important to recognize that Forchion is not a politician. He does not run for office with the intention of winning, but rather to make a point. At best, the article should be cut down to a short paragraph and moved <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Marijuana_Party_be07.html" title="US Marijuana Party">here</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I kind of agree about the making a point comment, but nobody runs for office with out the desire to win.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I like the idea, but i am still reluctant to say i approve of the idea. I will watch the nominations play out and see where it goes. It is a good idea, but im still on the fence.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This man has appeared several times in the media, not only on local television but also on national television. Even if he is a perennial candidate with no realistic chance of winning, he is still a main figure in the U.S. Marijuana Party and rightfully deserves his place on Wikipedia.

<p><b>Self nomination</b> Fails <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>. This is a fan website, and I do not see how it is notable, yet alone even worth mentioning on Wikipedia. It is only directly related to World of Warcraft, and all other Wikipedia articles that link to this do so in their <i>External links</i> sections. It arguably could be cited as a source (within context), however it clearly doesn't need its own article. Many MMORPGs have their own unofficial fan-driven wikis (PlaneShift has like three of them, and Anarchy Online has AOWiki); yet they do not have their own Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 17:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> If I where you, I would actually do a little research before screaming <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, as this is very much notable. Also, there are no rules that go against fan sites. If it is mentioned in the EL section of those articles, they can be safely removed and added to the "See also" section of said articles. This is in fact the biggest Warcraft related Wiki, and I would encourage you to find any other Warcraft Wiki which is as big as this one, so you can prove me wrong on this. Thank you. One last thing, I feel this is a bad faith nomination as you have done little to no research on the subject matter before you placed the AfD. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 09:05, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - How would whether or not WoW players know about the wiki affect its notability? Surely that would only count <i>for</i> the article rather than against it? I would dispute that wikipedia has everything that a reasearcher would need, but if it is to then link to WoWWiki to give a researcher the information missing from here, would it not be a reasonable to have an independant article showing them what the WoWWiki is like? <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 01:54, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I feel I should mention that the wiki is <i>not</i> just about World of Warcraft, but the entire Warcraft universe - which is an awful lot larger. It's also one of the most popular Warcraft-related websites in the world - the Alexa ranking is now around 4,000 and rising. I have to ask, why do we need a third nomination about this? Are we going to keep having them until it's deleted and there's no way back? Please don't bite my head off for mentioning this, but using the medium of a google search WoWWiki gets 291,000 results for me (compared to 318,000 for <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookieepedia.html" title="Wookieepedia">Wookieepedia</a>), which seems an awful for lot for something non-notable -- <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 19:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please clarify this: <i>the Alexa ranking is now around 4,000 and rising.</i> I assume you do realize that the number getting bigger is worse. The reason this was nominated for a third time is that this non-notable, being an unofficial fan site. I didn't see my argument brought up in the previous two nominations. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 21:25, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

Several days recently the wiki has reached a rank of around 2,500 (the very, very recent dip is due a small amount of downtime). Thank you for mentioning my semantics rather than concentrating on the point, btw.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Wait a moment - are you saying you didn't actually check to see whether the site was popular (most surely an indication of notability) before nominating it on the basis of non-notability? Since when is the fact that it is "unofficial fan site" qualify it for non-notability? Does something have to be officially sanctioned to be notable? Does the fact it's not a Blizzard-run site count against it? Please explain your reasoning further. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 01:37, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> What the h3ll does <i>self nomination</i> mean? "Not notable enough" shouldn't be an acceptable argument for deletion. Some actual evidence sould be required.
<ul>
<li>WoWWiki is one of the most used sources of World of Warcraft UI modification API information. It has more info than Blizzard supplies on their sites (game site and forums).</li>
<li>The argument that WoW info on Wikipedia can replace WoWWiki is ludicrous.</li>
<li>Why don't you better spend your time nominating WikiFur for deletion. This uses 4 of 5 references from wikia.com (2 of which are self-referential to WikiFur itself) to somehow justify it's notability. Clearly there is a group of wikipedians targeting <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> and not really concerned about non-notable wikis.</li>
<li>In all honesty, I don't really care whether this article gets deleted, but if it does at least use a better argument than a weak notability argument. I expect this article to get nominated for deletion on a regular basis. Some wikipedians clearly love their bureaucracy. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFandyllic_70bf.html" title="User:Fandyllic">Fandyllic</a> 1:42 PM PDT 27 Oct 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> When I nominated this, I didn't realize there were articles on <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lostpedia.html" title="Lostpedia">Lostpedia</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookiepedia.html" title="Wookiepedia">Wookiepedia</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a>, etc. Since these are unofficial fan sites (hosted by Wikicities even), I would challenge whether they are encyclopedic enough to merit their own articles on Wikipedia. It is with much consideration that I believe such notability should be proven. For example, <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> is notable; you can clearly see this in its References section. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 20:54, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree that perhaps the first edit was a little over the line. Mostly I added it as the fact that this article keeps getting nominated is becoming somewhat of a running joke for us&#160;:) As to my comment to a fellow admin on WoWWiki - who knows more about the website than someone who has worked on it for years?

Someone might disagree with me, though. I've only heard of your site once before, and that was in a copyright problem when I noticed a group of users uploading World of Warcraft screenshots onto Wikipedia from your website, and claiming them as GFDL or PD (which in no way they are, being WoW screenshots they are fair use). <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 22:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would have seen the deletion banner for WoWWiki here eventually, but I honestly don't consider Wikipedia much of a reference to be too concerned about. I just don't want to let WoWWiki get deleted because of somebody who clearly has an agenda to do it and isn't really applying equal standards to Wikipedia articles.

<li><b>Comment</b>: actually, there is such a thing. There's probably some essay that explains it better than I can, but the purpose of strong/weak isn't to make the "vote" count more but to indicate that that user can/can't be swayed or is certain/uncertain about their choice. If an afd has multiple "weak keep"s and a handful of "strong delete"s the closing admin may well decide to delete anyway if the rationales given by the deleters, together with their certainty, result in a stronger indication of the action to take. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 02:11, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I found this very interesting comment on your talk page -- it's very relevant to your stance on this article: "I see that your opinion that notability is a silly criterion is affecting your editing style, and very much to the detriment of the encyclopedia I think. Notability is important because we exist here to serve our readers... [W]e must exercise careful and thoughtful editorial judgment, and one part of editorial judgment is an understanding that treating irrelevant data as on equal footing with the essentials, is confusing and a disservice to the reader.--<i><b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 16:32, 16 October 2006</b></i> (UTC)" --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 03:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I find the whole premiss silly because nobody can prove or disprove notability. All it takes on Wikipedia is a handful of people voting "keep" and one person voting "delete" and the article stays, same as other way around. People use notability to delete articles which are highly notable, because they themselves don't see the notability. This AfD is a good example, as the person who started it hasn't done any research on it. I stand by my annotation about V and NN, as I find them silly and in many cases counter productive to Wikipedia, as all it takes are enough people. I might want to explain that a little closer on my User Page, if you don't understand what I am saying, please ask me and I will try to explain it. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 08:52, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fully understand your position, and like Jimbo Wales, I find it to be a detriment of the encyclopedia. Notability is in the eye of the beholder, of course. That's why there are guidelines and policies that were drawn up through concensus of Wikipedia users. Your post seems to indicate unhappiness with the deletion process in addition to your (IMO) flawed opinion of notability. I also have same deep concerns about the AFD process myself: it's very arbitrary. Closing admins often treat AFDs as votes rather than the debates they are supposed to be and give un-due weight to personal opinion, but it's hard to change the process. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 20:09, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which is also why this whole AfD is - in my eyes - counterproductive to Wikipedia. As it boils down to right now is who has the most "Keep" and "Delete" votes. People should by now understand that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> are both guidelines, NOT official policy.

<ul>
<li>I know, I know... we've played the semantics game about guidelines not being offical policy, before. This is why I feel concur with Jimbo Wales about your position being a detrement to Wikipedia. Disregarding content inclusion guidelines allows for the inclusion of stuff which dilutes the value of other articles. I look at the notability guidelines as clarifications of policy, while exceptions need to occasionaly be made, and they are a pretty good standard for article inclusion. The article up for nomination does not come anywhere near to passing the very lax criteria laid out in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">the web content guidelines</a> but it gets a lot of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it votes</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Something funny about the Alexa rank. Most of its traffic comes from either Wikipedia or Digg or various blogs, unless they insert the URL manually. There are many problems with the Alexa test, see <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html#Alexa_test" title="WP:SET">WP:SET#Alexa test</a>. Its user base is very small and consists of Internet Explorer users who choose to install a spyware program/toolbar; in particular, webmasters who seek to boost their site rankings. Since there are admins from WoWWiki coming to this nomination page and citing from Alexa, this point is obviously invalid. There is a <a href="../../../1/u/p/1UP.com_c6a3.html" title="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> article that merely uses it as a reference, but that's the only context I've seen it used in. I still don't see how this is notable: I haven't seen a single independent article written about WoWWiki. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 01:46, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> My personal view on the above - grasping at straws. <i>"Webmasters who seek to boost their site rankings"</i>? Please, do not attempt defamation, we do no such thing (nor can!), and are extremely insulted by your suggestion. Why you describe it as <i>"spyware"</i> I do not know, and how exactly do you know <i>"most of its traffic comes from either Wikipedia or Digg or various blogs, unless they insert the URL manually"</i> (isn't that how the internet works?) and <i>"Its user base is very small"</i>. I am not using it to 'prove' it either way, but as context. The IE restriction has very little bearing on the matter - WoW is dual platform, so if anything would show fewer results than in an accurate survey. And I still fail to see why you're so weirdly paranoid about people who work on the website coming here to give an opinion. You sound like you wish wikipedia was some exclusive members-only club, where 'outsiders' aren't allowed! <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 19:49, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point is to more formally prove that the <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html#Alexa_test" title="WP:SET">Alexa test</a> is invalid, by example. In no way do I intend to defame WoWWiki admins, however the tone of some of these responses here, as well as their lack of factuality towards the nomination, is enough for me to argue that the converse is true. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 01:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I would contest that you have not 'formally' proved anything. I do not control the views of others, and note that I have not engaged in mudslinging here. I am here to discuss why this article is of value to wikipedia, and I really do want to have a discussion over it&#160;:) Again, no we do not engage in any underhand tactics to gain readership (nor could we, as we have no <i>direct</i> control over the wiki. None whatsoever, and it severely annoys us.). <b>We</b> do not advertise, or post links to us on forums o'er the world. Yet still we remain frequently referenced on wikipedia, and known to many many people. If you are going to accuse people of things they do not do, try and at least back up your statements rather than 'infer' something from a heated debate. It wouldn't stand up in court, it shouldn't here. It's somewhat hard to write an article about a wiki, as it has few identifyable features. No company, no employees, no 'aim', etc. Of course wikipedia has articles about itself, due to the phenomenon it has produced, but other wikis stand in its shadow and correspondingly get little written about them, whatever their notoriety or notability. I just wish to see common sense around here - talking generally, I've seen far too many edit wars over the tiniest, stupidest little thing all because someone wanted to follow a policy absolutely to the letter, to the detriment of 'the whole'. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 13:34, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel I should clarify a point. Since many, <i>many</i> wikipedia Warcraft articles reference WoWWiki (and rightly so, as WoWWiki has more info), would it not be just to have an indepedent page describing this site? If something is referenced <i>frequently</i> on wikipedia, does that not aid its notability?

<p>The article is clearly fiction, yet there is no identification of such. Instead, its reads like an actual website for the posse.</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Anybody notice the city listed isent in a wikpedia listed city in texas. I am not saying that every city liste is. Also, some of the wiki links are screwy (they go to some articles thatlook different than what youd expect). On top of that, no sources and what sounds like a load of it def a deleter.

<li><b>Delete</b> - This one might qualify for a speedy (hoax). As far as I can tell there is no Ruggsville in Texas, which is actually not even the article's biggest problem.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The previous comment was removed (and for good reason) because the editor vandalized the page, replacing all the 'deletes' with 'keep'. I have added it back to A.) Show the type of person this guy is and B.) Respond to his complaints.</li>
<li>1. The problem is NOT that its from a fictional film, but that the article has no basis in fact or citations and is entirely created by the user. The history he created for the Ruggsville Posse is not present in any of the films or backstories. My articles about the Wydell brothers, however, all pertain to the way they were in the film with no original research whatsoever.</li>
<li>2. As for "refusing" to let anyone edit articles I create...I beg to differ. I have created <i>over thirty articles</i>, many of which have had <i>hundreds</i> of contributions. My article for <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Olaf_b967.html" title="Count Olaf">Count Olaf</a> that I started for example has had hundreds of different edits. No, the problem isn't that someone else edited articles that I created...its that that someone else added false and irrevelant information to the articles I created.</li>
<li>3. As for removing his comments on my discussion page...well, I'll let his posts speak for themselves: <i>You are a cocksucking scumbag!</i> and <i>This time, don't remove my post, you malicious cocksucker!!!</i> I hope you can understand why I removed his comments.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 21:10, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> I have actually played both games and I am the author of this article. This game is truly revolutionary and has actually gone beyond much of what is considered "routine" in the flash game genre. The purpose of this article is not promotional, rather, I am trying to put an article describing a notable game. Wikipedia has articles on Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario, are these any less "particularly" notable? Exmortis is very notable: 1) It pushes the boundaries of the flash game genre. 2) The first game has been played by over 5 million people and the second game by 1.3 million. This has an impact in the gaming world. And while I understand you can get a lot of hits on the internet, for a game to be on the internet for only a month or so, and receive this much attention, is, in many ways unheard of. I have contributed a little over 20 articles to wikipedia, and I put a lot of hard work and effort into them. I do not want to see this article be abitrarily deleted, because certain individuals think it is "not particular notable." <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadb2000_f5d7.html" title="User:Ladb2000">User:Ladb2000</a></li>

<p>I think my sources are well documented, showing the creator's page, the critical reception, an interview, as well as links to the two games, so that people if they so choose, can experience for themselves what everything else is. And I beg to differ, but in this case, notability is very much about what some editors feel. I have provided adequate sources, and a well-written article to describe a game that has, in many respects, taken the flash genre by storm. If that isn't notable, then I really don't know what is. So once again, I urge you to please reconsider deleting this article. <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadb2000_f5d7.html" title="User:Ladb2000">User:Ladb2000</a></p>

While I respect the high standards you are asking for, I have to just state that if you are going to delete this article on the basis that I don't have enough sources or enough "reliable" sources (especially considering that this is a flash game, does not seem entirely fair to me. <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadb2000_f5d7.html" title="User:Ladb2000">User:Ladb2000</a></li>

<p><b>Do not delete</b>. The rules of citation in Wikipedia exist to ensure the quality and encyclopedia-worthiness of the articles. A well written article about a flash game that has been played by millions of people is clearly encyclopedia-worthy. Documentation of the type desired is not possible, because official references on this game do not exist, but because the game is significant, the spirit rather than the letter of the rules on citation should be followed in this case, and the article should be allowed to remain. <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKier07_bb3f.html" title="User:Kier07">User:Kier07</a></p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Some of the students at my college did this, and from a bit of googling I see other schools 'participate' as well.

<li>In general, that guideline makes sense - but when the person making the "I've never heard of it" comment is someone with intimate knowledge of the field in question (which as an artist, performer, and art critic in New Zealand, I do have), it makes a lot of sense to override that guideline (which, you will note is a guide, not a policy). Though I hesitate to call myself an expert in the firld, I am a published author within it with an everyday working knowledge of it. if I haven't heard of it, then it is almost certain to be at best a neologism, and at worst a hoax. And even if it were an established word usage, its place would be in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i></li>

<p>As the article defines itself at the top, it is "a partial catalog of...recurring segments, running gags, catchphrases, quotes, and other miscellany." I've had a {{<a href="../../../p/r/i/Template%7EPrimarysources_fe8b.html" title="Template:Primarysources">primarysources</a>}} tag at the top for over three weeks now, and a note on the talk page for a few days, and absolutely nothing has been done to improve this article over that period of time. To repeat what I said on the talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article is full of unsourced original research and speculation (everything colbert "seems" to be), and I doubt sources other than the show itself can be found for 90% of what's in the article, and even many of those things would count as excessively in-depth plot summary. It reminds me of the sort of excessive cataloging that occured for <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestar_runner.html" title="Homestar runner">Homestar runner</a> before we banished such research to their own wikis.

<li>The claim that you can cite a source to establish recurring themes within the source has been proven false before, as demonstrated by the deletion of the slashdot articles. Your claim that Colbert is more important than those sites, so we should relax our standards, is not true at all either. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Themes_in_Star_Wars_e18d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Themes in Star Wars">Themes in Star Wars</a> was deleted because it was a pile of original research (someone went and documented all the coincidences they saw between the movies), and star wars is more important culturally than colbert and all these others combined. I'm not deletionist, I only believe in deleting articles when they fundamentally fail policy, and this article absolutely does so by being impossible to verify without redoing all the research yourself. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 00:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>.

On top of that, including even the barebones of the information in this article in the main <i>The Colbert Report</i> article would put that article far over the limit, so merging is, I think, out of the question.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand the need of Colbert-fanbois trying to sabotage every relevant discussion about the articles that are involved with him or the show. I will not deny that he is a somewhat popular figure, but he is not a phenomenon, his show has been on the air on cable for 1 year, and there is no guarantee that he will be on more than another, possibly likely, but WP is not a crystal ball. I don’t see how he warrents as many articles as he has. Just because a small handful of editors like the show does not mean that there is a place for all these articles. WP will not make any sense in the future if all this fancruft is contained. And I don’t see where a single one of the keep votes should have any weight to them. They just say NPOV things like “He is a phenomenon, we must worship him and add every detail about his show possible.” I don’t like or dislike him, but please, let’s just keep things simple and not spread every reference or so-called facts all over. And why would SNOW apply here? That's just a really blantant comment to make, you just assume if I advertise this AFD (which is not the point, we are discussing, hopefully among editors with concerns over notability rather than if they like something) that everyone would vote keep? A lot of valid votes are made for delete, and that is just fine. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 23:34, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There are multiple places that the information could be housed - but not in a Wiki format. For example, I could easily put this information on my Stephen Colbert fan site, where according to discussion here it may be a better place for it to be, but I choose not to because I realize the benefits of having multiple editors maintain the information. Instead, I simply link to this page when using information from it. Keeping the information here on Wiki helps it to be monitored and edited more frequently and by more editors, which keeps it more accurate and relevant. Banishing the page to Wikiality.com virtually ensures its demise and its accuracy due to the fact that it will receive many less hits and will not be maintained to the accuracy level that information is maintained here on Wiki. It is hard to cite sources for information such as this television show, since the primary source is the show and since attempts to cite mainstream news articles and blogs as sources tend to be rejected by the administrators. This page gets updated on an almost daily basis due to the fact that relevant information from the show can change the status of different recurring elements so quickly. It's hard to cite sources when the information is so current that there are no sources to cite. It has been mentioned that the show is only one year old. Any books that come out within that short of a time period about virtually any pop culture phenomenon would be geared towards fans anyway, and not have much historical significance (or much documentation), and anything with true historical weight will not appear until long after the show has made its impact. I would support moving this site to be a sub-site of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Colbert_Report_3547.html" title="The Colbert Report">The Colbert Report</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Colbert_Report_episodes_65f1.html" title="List of The Colbert Report episodes">List of The Colbert Report episodes</a>, but I do think that this information is relevant to the subject of <i>The Colbert Report</i>.<a href="../../../n/o/f/User%7ENofactzone_f761.html" title="User:Nofactzone">Nofactzone</a> 18:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I agree that some of what's in the article now is problematic under NOR, but I disagree with the assessment that all of it is. According to NOR, it's acceptable to use television shows as a primary source, as long as one is only making purely descriptive claims and not including original analysis. The fact that Colbert does a word-of-the-day segment in every episode, for example, is descriptive, and not original analysis. <span style="font-family:monospace">-- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup></span> 18:39, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Better Know a District has its own article? Wow, that's news to me. But nevertheless, respectfully, I think you're oversimplifying a bit, Night. There's a lot of original analysis and speculation in that article which needs to be dealt with, but the lists of recurring segments and characters are fair. Lists of minor characters are explictly permitted by our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Minor_characters_9616.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters">deletion policy on minor characters</a>. Recurring segements, on the other hand, can form the basic anatomy of a variety/comedy show like Colbert's, particularly when these segments are specifically denoted by onscreen titles. This is still far less detail than having an article for every episode, which has been upheld in the case of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">Category:Simpsons_episodes</a>, or List of vehicles in The Simpsons, which survived three nominations for deletion, or the individual articles on every recurring sketch on Saturday Night Live (see list <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recurring_Saturday_Night_Live_characters_and_sketches_3845.html" title="Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches">here</a>). As for the examples you list above, lists of Slashdot jokes and the like are inherently different, because we allow using TV shows as a primary source but not forums and social networking websites. "Themes in Star Wars" probably should have been rebuilt from the ground up rather than entirely nuked -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/Themes_in_Blade_Runner_8147.html" title="Themes in Blade Runner">Themes in Blade Runner</a> is decently referenced, and quite a good read. Again, I suggest renaming this or possibly splitting into multiple articles in order to tighten the focus and avoid attracting cruft. <span style="font-family:monospace">-- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup></span> 20:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Precedence I have seen, such as articles related to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, is that information taken from simply watching the show is acceptable, while information from behind the scenes and out-of-universe must be sourced. The article is not analysis and speculation as claimed by the user who wishes to delete the page, but a recording of notable recurring elements, nothing more. What work could be done is specification, possibly in terms of instances a subject is mentioned, to be deemed a recurring element. Also, just because no one has attempted to improve it does not mean no one will. In the vein of Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, you cannot predict that no one will make an effort and nominate it based on that prediction. -- <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> 23:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your understanding of policy is incorrect. Transwikification can occur between <i>any</i> wikis, Wikimedia Foundation or otherwise. The relevant restriction is the <i>copyright licensing</i> of the source and target wikis. Wikitravel has a copyright licence that is incompatible with the GFDL, and <i>that</i> is what prevents transwikification to Wikitravel. (It's the same sitation as for Wikinews, whose licence is also incompatible with the GFDL.) Our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a> article does explain this. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:35, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uh, I don't see why my understanding is wrong even after your explanation. The first paragraph of the Wikipedia afd page specifically says that articles cannot be transwikied to WikiTravel. Perhaps there's something subtlety being missed here by the afd page and myself (note that I'm talking - both before and now - about what is permitted, not what can be technically carried out) - if there is, then you should modify the beginning section of the Articles for Deletion page. Quote:"<i>The page is then either kept, merged and/or redirected, transwikied (moved to another Wikimedia project, such as Wikibooks, Wikisource, Wikiquote, Wiktionary, or another language's Wikipedia—<b>please note that it cannot be transwikied to WikiTravel or Wikinews</b></i>" <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:40, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now read what you <i>added to that yourself</i>, in what you wrote above. You added "as Wikitravel is not part of Wikimedia", which is not what is written, and which is wrong, as I explained. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:09, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.No , the problem is not with the offline sources . I meant that this article provides information on web , about a company,( which has been renamed )which attracted the largest PE buy out due to the it's role in communications software , Indian outsourcing and HR practices . The buying firm KKR is known for it's large buy outs and has a successful history of last 3 decades.</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Follwing a look at Ozuras user page, I believe it is incontrevertably proven that this is an advertisement.

But seriously, you need a source for what? To prove it exists? Are you stupid or something?</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Not only is I-Mockery a notable site, but it is also quite influential. I cannot post proof of this, as I do not have the time to post the near infinite number of links pages and message board posts (on non I-Mockery message boards) which either include I-Mockery or something clearly relating to I-Mockery. Not only that, but companies such as Jones Soda and FrightCatalog.com have sent them products to review. If I-Mockery was not notable, this would not have been done. Michael Podgorski 16:32, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's one of the most popular humor sites on the web <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9805388/" class="external free" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9805388/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9805388/</a> and here are links for the webmasters articles for Cracked <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=+site:www.cracked.com+cracked+roger+barr" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=+site:www.cracked.com+cracked+roger+barr" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=+site:www.cracked.com+cracked+roger+barr</a></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm a freelance writer, with credits including National Lampoon, Cracked, and the Boston Museum of Science, in addition to I-mockery. I'm not sure what all you are looking for in terms of significance, but here's what makes it significant to me. It pays it's writers. Take a look at Writer's Market, and you'll find very, very, very few internet markets that pay at all.Amongst freelance writers, THAT's what makes something legitimate. Any site that takes it's content seriously enough to pay writers something besides the amazing pride of seeing their work on a computer screen strikes me as a serious endeavor. I strongly suggest that a Wiki editor with a background in freelancing be given a chance to review this decision.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: It's a fairly well documented site. I'm not entirely sure why this is being considered for deletion.</li>

<li>Explain what needs to be sourced and a source can be provided. It's obvious that the site exists and pulls a large amount of traffic, so verification of its very BEING obviously isn't necessary. Are you asking for sources on the history of I-Mockery? Because why would such material show up anywhere but the site itself? I'd like to speak to your <i>supervisor</i>.</li>
<li><b>Totally Totally Strong Delete!!</b>Get rid of this website now, they made fun of me one time! They have no sense of compassion and should be stopped!</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Immature rantings aside, "Can't verify information in article" is listed directly under "Problem articles where deletion may not be needed". I would suggest that some consideration be given as to the nature of the site and it's article. The article is a description of the site itself, it doesn't have any claims to be verified. Furthermore, while the sources link to the site, there are quite a few of them. True, it is hazy as to whether or not it follows guidelines, but the authors obviously made an effort to do so. It's difficult to provide ironclad third party sources for a site like I-Mockery, but those who contributed to the article did their best to back up the descriptions. Since it is obviously not some just quick self promotion for some twelve-year old's personal blog, I would argue that some leeway should be given. Beyond that, you agree that the Richmond link is reliable. The reason you gave for deletion was that "No reliable sources mentioned in the article, none found either. <b>Delete</b> unless sources are found." Well, though it is only one reliable source, isn't that enough? As previously stated, I would argue that some consideration be given.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Neutral</b> but I'd like to point out that the I-Mockery forum is asking people to come and "save the Wikipedia article". <a href="http://www.i-mockery.net/viewtopic.php?t=23993" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.i-mockery.net/viewtopic.php?t=23993" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> That might explain the rapidly growing number of votes from anonymous editors. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 03:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>How is that relevent at all?</li>
<li>What are you trying to imply? I-Mockery is a site with over 100,000 unique views daily, it's not as if a handful of people are trying to sabotage Wikipedia's system for all the <i>prestiege</i> having a Wiki supposedly confers. This page was submitted by persons not affiliated with I-Mockery or its staff and is sourced from the information available through the autobiography on the site itself and apparently some experience on the message boards. It serves as a reference for anyone interested in the history of I-Mockery, and it is undeniably a useful document for someone seeking that information; It clearly falls within the mission and purpose of Wikipedia at large. Trying to remove this information serves no purpose other than to fulfill this administrator's personal agenda, whatever it may be, and I feel he represents Wikipedia poorly in doing so.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I-Mockery is a very prominent humor site and its page on Wikipedia isn't there to merely promote it with free advertising. You might as well flag the Something Awful page for deletion too.</li>

<ul>
<li>Vandalizing userpages is <i>not</i> the way to go guys. You're only hurting your own cause. Yeah, you, [IP ADDRESS REMOVED, FOR SERIOUS]. A simple discussion is all that is required. You're welcome to nominate whatever other articles you see fit for deletion (including ones I have worked on, though they are easily sourceable/verifiable), but that is unrelated to the matter at hand. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 17:37, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Do you realize that so far, you've yet to answer any questions? It's hard to have a discussion with someone who won't comply.</p>
<ul>
<li>You still need one more reliable source. So far you have the Richmond one, which is good. But you still need a second as <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> specifies "multiple" secondary sources.

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the relevant guideline. It says in relevant part "The article itself <b>must</b> provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a 'Reference' or 'External link' section." We are often more generous at AFD and keep if the relevant proof appears here. The only <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">independent reliable source</a> produced thus far about the site is the Richmond.com source first mentioned by <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a>. The article has no References section, so it can't meet WP:WEB based on the references. I checked the external links, and none of them are independent reliable sources. I can't see any criteria of WP:WEB that the article meets, so deletion is the answer that accords with our policies and guidelines. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:30, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: WP:WEB states that the article "must" meet at least one the criteria (1 to 3) for notable content on the web. I-Mockery meets at least 1 and 3. The WP:WEB does not clearly state that an article must have more than one source - this seems to be an interpretation of it. As stated above, the policing of Wikipedia policy is extremely inconsistent. There are several other humour related websites (SA, Newgrounds, etc.) that do not meet your specific guidelines, nor do your own articles. I would like to know how to seek mediation to resolve this, as I do not believe Wickethewok is a reliable source.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I don't see how it meets criteria #1 (multiple reliable non-trivial sources) or criteria #2 (no awards) or criteria #3 (distributed via a well-known independent online newspaper or magazine). The "multiple" part comes from criteria #1. Also, just because there might be other content on Wikipedia that should be removed, doesn't necessitate this being kept either. I recommend you bring up your issues with Newgrounds and SomethingAwful on the appropriate talk pages. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 19:03, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wicketthewok, how can you call so many sources "trivial" - that sounds more like your own opinion rather than a fact. Confirmed appearances on television shows via IMDB and a video clip of one of the appearances, scanned pages from professional magazines, audio clips from professional radio show interviews, proof of work on other professional web sites such as Cracked Magazine. What more could you possibly need? The people here have gone above and beyond making a big effort to comply with Wikipedia and to make the I-Mockery entry all the better, and you're shooting each one of them down with complete disregard, even describing them as "the rest are just blogs or links to the web site" - how is an audio clip from a radio station interview a blog or a link to the web site, how is an interview on the Sacramento Bee merely a blog, etc. etc. I'm not attacking you personally, but it appears as though you are the one "hurting your own cause" when you say things like this to people who are just trying to work this situation out.</li>

<li>Most of these new links seem to be about the site's creator rather than the website. Maybe there should be an article about Barr instead and a couple sentences from this merged into that instead. The VH-1 blurb doesn't mention the website at all and the Richmond piece is more centered on him. There seems to be more on him than on the website. What do ya folks think of that idea instead of other proposals? <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:10, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Roger Barr is the owner of the site and most of the ideas for the website come directly from him, so that's a good point wikithewok. However, changing the entry to Roger Barr would be more about Roger Barr than the material on the webpage(which is what people are interested). ON top of that it's hard to have an interview with an Internet site appear in a magazine, or to have an internet site appear on live television(and keep it interesting). The site is the material Roger Barr (and others) produces, and the material is what people are interested in. Nobody cares about Roger Barr. In this sense the wikipedia details some of the available material on the website, and the referances show that material appearing on life television. I think this wikipedia entry would be worthless if it was just about Roger Barr. If you want "referances" to things about i-mockery look at the "External links" section which actually links to I-mockery and the material on the site. If there was link/referance to the "humorous articles" themselves how would that stand?</li>
<li>"Nobody cares about Roger Barr" - Apparently the above sources you mentioned do. This includes the Richmond article, of which <i>he</i> is the primary subject, not the website. The TV appearances seem to be based on the fact that he rather enjoys Boo berry, rather than runs a humor website. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:25, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>And the TV appearances also mention the fact that he runs a Boo Berry website, which is an offshoot of I-Mockery.com, which DO make it relevant to I-Mockery as well as Roger Barr.</li>
<li>It's pretty hard to interview a website. HELLO MR. WEBSITE HOW ARE YOU CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR MATERIAL MR. COMPUTER? *no response* Notice websites require some type of Human being behind them to create/manage them(kind of like this website eh), presto, Roger Barr is that person and he was the I-mockery "representative". He also wrote the material on the website, so he was on these shows representing the material on i-mockery. This is sort of like interviewing a popular musician, you don't interview their music you interview THEM, but the material of interest, that which made them popular in itself, is the music and ideas-- which they themselves are representing by being interviewed. Isn't the purpose of these referances to show that I-mockery is a popular internet attraction? Also have you read anything on I-mockery yet? You might notice that most of the articles written are written from a personal perspective, which is another reason why it was about "Him" and not the "Website", because the material on the website is often written from a personal perspective. Also, Roger Barr wouldn't be "Popular" enough to appear on television without the popularity of his website.</li>

<p>I've had some extensive discussions on the talk page about the notability and verification of this game. It sounds like a really neat game, but it's still not very well established. The game is roughly a year old and, as I mentioned on the talk page, its rules are still changing and its popularity is unclear and subjective; evidence of the game's popularity seems almost anecdotal. There haven't been any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">secondary sources published</a>- the only media coverage has been from some campus newspapers/blogs. I think the article is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">crystal balling</a> a bit because the game is so new, and as it stands, the vast majority of information is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 22:00, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree that if this were to be kept, the rules &amp; equipment sections should be pared down to a generalized paragraph or two, such that it is no longer a how-to guide. However, only two of the links at the bottom (the "references") are independent of the game: the BGSU news story concerning arrests &amp; the short Cornell piece on the game.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This bar crawl has a very long history and is well known by the 30,000 current students and hundreds of thousands of alumni of the university. New students are frequently referred to this article as the standard resource for the route and risks, the article has existed for some time already and it is kept up-to-date with current developments at all of the bars involved. However this article could feasibly be merged into <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Park_Campus_f379.html" title="University Park Campus">University Park Campus</a>. Also I believe the article is of interest to those outside the local community, especially anyone researching British drinking culture, a subject which is constantly in the media spotlight. --Danrhyn 13:24, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>I can add little to the above arguments, merely second them all.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of the most prestigous bar crawls in the UK. I had heard about it long before I came to Nottingham and have had people come down to visit with the main intention to attempt it. This article is often used to save explaining to the new nottingham freshers who are unsure on details. Since the Introduction of "the mix" cafes there has been declined interest but this is mainly due to the fact that willoughby is still undergoing refurbishment (due to be completed within the next few weeks)---[Jason Garfitt] 10:40, 31 October 2006</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The pub crawl is as revered as the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_Pub_Crawl_692c.html" title="Monopoly Pub Crawl">Monopoly Pub Crawl</a> and certainly deserves it's space here. If the powers that be decide it doesn't deserve it's own article it certainly deserves merging into another like <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Nottingham_cfa7.html" title="University of Nottingham">University of Nottingham</a> as reading about the university would not be complete without knowledge of student behaviour and legend.

<li>Where are the third-party sources describing this event? I don't doubt that this article is describing something real, but if it can only be sourced from participants and/or students at the university, then there is no evidence of impact in an encyclopedic sense, as FreplySpang describes in the nomination. So may I request that those calling for this article to be kept please provide those?--<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sean_Black_def1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sean Black">SB</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">T</a> 23:27, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>KEEP - many encyclopaedic entries are not relevant or useful to lots of people, however this one seems to me to be extremely useful for the new students of this university, provides good memories for the alumni and is a good reference for risks and routes etc for not only the students themselves but also unsuspectinf friends...I know a good many students who have consulted this site, I do not see any reason why it should be deleted.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The "no. 1" rating was on a 2003 news item on another site registered to NZPages (www.kiwipages.co.nz/default.asp?t=10), and nowhere else, after they'd just done a big push to increase their "ratings" (from 1 millionth to 29000th in the world). If you google "NZPages.co.nz", omitting self-references and the word lotto you get less than 1000 hits. Interestingly NZPages has a domain <i>mental.co.nz</i> and the creator of the page was named <i>mentaldev</i>. It is an average site that promote hard - hence the wikipedia entry. --<a href="../../../a/g/o/User%7EAGoon_ec38.html" title="User:AGoon">AGoon</a> 10:50, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I vote Yes.</b> Pages like this are completely irrelevant and utterly self-righteous. The links don't work properly and Zach Hines is not highly regarded (or high profile) in any journalistic respect. There are far better writers and editors in the world who haven't written themselves up.

<li><b>I vote no.</b> I believe the point of wikipedia is to (at least one day) be a repository of all knowledge we have, and I have found this entry useful in writing a paper about English-language journalism in the former British colony. It was useful in the respect that it helped me to at least gauge the number of active journalists there. It provided no substantial information to be sure, but it was useful in that it was included in the list of Hong Kong writers. If you delete all stubs and short articles that are included in useful lists then you are subtracting from the power of lists, which I find to be one of the most useful aspects of the entire wikipedia project. I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 61.10.12.73 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_61.10.12.73_d380.html" title="Special:Contributions/61.10.12.73">contribs</a>) 15:48, 5 November 2006.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> For whatever this is worth, the creator and main editor of the articles keeps removing the afd tags for all of them, and I have had to restore all the tags twice now. I also would hope someone can look at the rest of the roster that I have not put up for deletion, as other nn players could be there. Also look for the team <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Whalers_bda1.html" title="Plymouth Whalers">Plymouth Whalers</a> for similar cases. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 02:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The user/creator of articles, <a href="../../../k/i/v/User%7EKivpit_58f3.html" title="User:Kivpit">Kivpit</a>, is not understanding about the afd process, he put an insult to me saying "I aughta delete your shit... see how you'd like it...". The user has tried to contact the Wikiproject for Ice Hockey, trying to stop the deletion of the articles for such reasons as "no one had a problem with them before" and "I worked really hard on these articles". That doesn't matter, it's either notable or it's not. And I have found numerous other nn junior/minor league players with some browsing, so more should go for deletion based on how this discussion goes. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 02:57, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s><b>Delete all</b>, sadly.</s><b>Comment</b> I do not know much about <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hockey_League_f160.html" title="Ontario Hockey League">OHL</a> players, but one thing I would suggest if you look up other articles for future AfDs that you see if any of these players have participated in an event like the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Junior_Ice_Hockey_Championships_7a0e.html" title="World Junior Ice Hockey Championships">World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>, or were first round picks in the <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_Entry_Draft_8e00.html" title="NHL Entry Draft">NHL Entry Draft</a>. Those would be two such cases where I think a junior player would automatically qualify as notable. In the case of his removing the AfD notices, I am going to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and believe that is simply the result of his not understanding how the AfD proccess works, or <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> criteria.</p>
<p>Also, since this user has put some work into these articles, and since players on major-junior rosters may have short term notability, especially in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, would there be an objection to having these articles <b>merged</b> into something like Saginaw Spirit roster? <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 06:00, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The more I think about it, the more I think I prefer a merge into a single article for a case like this. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 06:12, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Good idea, but I can't put myself behind it. The roster on the team's page should be sufficient for such a listing, considering the notability involved here. I could have added more to this afd, but I just wanted those that did not appear to have been drafted by an NHL team for this point. If the user spent a lot of time on these articles, I am sorry, but that's not an excuse to hang on to these. It's either notable or it's not. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 08:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. I'm one of the Hockey Wikiproject regulars, and I don't care as it is for how loose WP:BIO is with respect to professional athletes. Nom's done a good job in excluding NHL draftees, who at least have a shot at notability. Those players who are left are scrubs who will never, ever play professionally and fail notability even at the major junior level. Furthermore, much as I empathize with the editor's work, we've AfDed far more intricate articles than these, because they fail consensus standards in one fashion or another. It's incumbent on new editors to learn what's acceptable and ask before editing. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 06:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Based upon my understanding of the rules for what books can have articles, the rules pretty well state that as long as it isn't self-published it can have an article. Had the book only been made available online, that would be one thing (Wiki hasn't to my knowledge reached consensus on what to do with e-books), but at the moment I'm giving it benefit of the doubt. Needs to be tagged as an upcoming book, however. I'll do that now. If kept, the article should be renamed to remove the (novel) disambiguation, unless there happens to also be a movie or something else with this exact title. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 02:41, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. I did a google search for <i>"The Morningstar Strain" "Plague of the Dead" -wikipedia</i> and found 38 hits. Doesn't seem particularly notable. Furthermore, take a look at <a href="../../../n/c/-/WP%7ENC-BK_a650.html" title="WP:NC-BK">WP:NC-BK</a>. It tells you to <i>"ask yourself if several libraries or bookshops, or a no-subscription website have a copy of the book"</i>.
