<p>Might not be bad if it's done right.

<p>Hi everybody, to the concerned person(s) above, first off, I an not a "troll" (whatever that means!) I work here at the Wiki on my own time as we all do!, I am a participant in the following group for example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit</a> and I just happen to be working on a subject in an article for Wikipedia, and yeah, while it is only a stub at this point in a few hours I hope it will be read and enjoyed by most with a smile and a wink at for my efforts at the worst. So please wont you all give me a few measurements of time to show you&#160;???? I am a serious editor here at Wikipedia! (and I care!)</p>
<p>I thank you in advance Shalom! (<a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathytreks_4d6c.html" title="User:Cathytreks">Cathytreks</a> 22:38, 24 August 2005 (UTC))</p>

<p>Is a place where people who dont dare register their IP go, and also those who fail to check their facts first before they make an edit may reside as well! Hey guys who want to delete this remember.....This article is a stub. More ..much more to come...So please stand by for...The Wikipedia Hall of Shame! which will serves as a source for humor, interest, or examples of what not to do while editing here on The Wikipedia! come back and fee free to contribute and edit edit edit..in good fun and so please feel free to share your ideas, I'll be back later with a bunch of things.

<p>Here is my view on Wikipedia from the group im in here on reform of Wiki: "I too shall be glad to assist in helping to develop a standard of thoughful concensus building which shall not impose new censorship standards on the Wikipedia, save those self imposed ones that lay within ourselves. While the concept of "decency" may be POV on its face still, there should be some basic standard of decency that a community should strive to abide by, lest we suffer that result, which would undoubtedly be ...total anarchy." from:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Move</b> since <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathytreks_4d6c.html" title="User:Cathytreks">User:Cathytreks</a>, seems to think it important, to Wikipedia: or User: namespace or BJAODN. Does not belong in main namespace at all. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 23:16:29, 2005-08-24 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, it certainly doesn't belong in the article space, and it looks like nothing but a bitch page. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 23:20, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cathy is not a troll, and edits in good faith. This should, however, be in her user space. BJAODN stands for "Bad Jokes And Other Deleted Nonsense," which is where a lot of examples of what not to do end up -- in other words, Cathy, I'm afraid someone has beat you to setting this sort of page up. If, however, you would like to keep a log of pages that serve as examples of what not to do, I'd again suggest setting that up connected to your user page.

<li>There is no existing wikipedia definition of shameworthy. This article attempts to define such a concept.

<p>Excuse me nice editors...I dont even know some/most of you people and yet you treat me as a vandal/troll!...why?..why are you to be sitting in judgement on me and saying those kinds of things, like im a bad person, give me a break, and just Who or what is a BAJOADN!? , anyway you guys arent even giving me a chance...so im going to just work on my piece and hope you will think differently when its no longer just a stub...Please give my article a chance!? I am a serious editor here and this is rediculous how rudely and wrongly I am treated by some of you. ..forshame on those who act so.&#160;:( please...and it is not original research!

<ul>
<li>I say delete. Hey, Cathy, what you are writing is not an article. This is not a bunch of community pages; this is an encyclopædia. Much as I like personal camaraderie, I cannot really define that as belonging to an encyclopædia. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 23:47, 24th August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Arrrgh, let's not drag this thru VfD. It's clearly not suitable for the article namespace. How about moving it to Wikipedia:Hall of Shame and worrying no more about it? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:59, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let's just get her to move it to her namespace, as I suspect it will be better suited there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I do not see why there should be a 'Wikipedia Hall of shame,' either in an article form, or as part of the communal community pages. Such a thing would be completely subjective, and would be both a cause of more friction than harmony, and, in a twisted way, a recognition of spammers' potency. Surely, we should not dedicate our space to those who try to bring this encyclopaedia down. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 00:12, 25th August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't believe that's remotely the intent here, but I can understand why this may be better off as a user page than anywhere else. I see no reason to continue the VfD process for this one, though. There's no way this can end up existing in the article namespace. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 00:17, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
