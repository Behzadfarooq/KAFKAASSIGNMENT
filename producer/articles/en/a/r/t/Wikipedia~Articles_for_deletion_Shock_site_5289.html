<li><b>Keep</b> While I understand the nominator's point of view, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>. I wouldn't be upset if there were more content dealing with the concept of shock sites and less simply detailing examples, however. GassyGuy 05:28, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> going through the critera for deletion, especially the core policies <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, I fail to see how this page meets any of them.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. After reviewing the reasons found here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_site#Deletion_Reccomended.21" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_site#Deletion_Reccomended.21" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as to why the article was nominated, I must disagree with the original nominator. First of all, "grotesque" is a very subjective word and open to multiple interpretations. Second, Wikipedia isn't endorsing these websites by writing an article about them anymore than they are endorsing <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> for writing an article about him. Third, we cannot rely on unreasonable hypothetical scenarios when judging the criteria for deletion. It is unreasonable to delete the article because "a hacker" might come to the page and link one of these websites to someone else's webpage. Using the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> comparison again, we would have to delete that article because it lists his address (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue) and thus someone could use that information to harm him. This deletion nomination is therefore unreasonable and should be denied. --<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemlock_Martinis_534d.html" title="User:Hemlock Martinis">Hemlock Martinis</a> 05:32, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, let me give both sets of arguments at once. My opinion is somewhat neutral, I've been involved in trying to keep this article from being a liability for some time. The reason behind the actual decision to nominate by a new user are along the lines of "this is gross, why should we cover it," but there are definitely reasons to be concerned here. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro deletion: This article is, basically, entirely made up of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Most of the article consists of the list of various shock sites, very few of which have really satisfactory source (<a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse.cx</a> does, but it has its own article anyway). Although individual sites have some references, a bigger problem is that the non-list part of the article is completely unreferenced, and probably unverifiable. A web search for the term "shock site" on google turns up around half as many hits when we exclude Wikipedia &amp; its mirrors.. and apart from Encyclopedia Dramatica and Urban Dictionary, nothing really comes close to the level of describing the use of the term or defining it; the rest are examples of use. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Con deletion: First of all, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shock_sites.html" title="List of shock sites">List of shock sites</a>, which got merged to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">Shock site</a>, was already nominated for deletion four times: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_3aa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites">1st</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28second_nom%29_6459.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (second nom)">2nd</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28third_nomination%29_e953.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (third nomination)">3rd</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28fourth_nomination%29_7730.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (fourth nomination)">4th</a>; each time, the article was kept (the first three debates had "keep" outcomes, while the 4th one was a "no consensus," with a hella lot of participation). Although the content is distasteful, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, and this is certainly a notable phenomenon. Finally, this article attracts vandalism and inappropriate edits from new users a lot... but this probably keeps those users from continually creating new articles on their favorite shock sites individually. Also, the article <i>is</i> sourced, even if the sources push the boundary of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, that may be necessary given the kind of topic this article covers. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not convinced this isn't a keep, but I do question some of the examples; do we really have any good sourcing of "penis bird" that it belongs on the list? GassyGuy 05:47, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The source for that one is an official letter from Slashdot complaining about that picture being used for trolling; they ask Rotten.com to move it to a different URL. The letter is posted on Rotten.com's page with the picture. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 14:50, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We now accept content hosted by the primary source as third party coverage? GassyGuy 16:26, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, like I said, I think the sourcing is generally sketchy, but this is <i>something.</i> Personally, Rotten.com has a reputation for posting complaint correspondence, and they have no reason to fabricate the letter. If you want to discuss individual sourcing issues, I invite you (beg you, even) to join us at <a href="../../../s/h/o/Talk%7EShock_site_56f7.html" title="Talk:Shock site">Talk:Shock site</a> where we have to constantly explain basic WP policies regarding sources and verifiability.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This article contains useless sites that can have no benefit to people at all. Maybe friends can joke eachother into going into the sites, but that's about it. These sites are grotesque and need to be removed, along with this whole article. Some of these sites contain pornography, viruses, trojans, and more horrible things. If a hacker gets on someone's site they could come to this wiki, look for one of these sites, and redirect the homepage he is hacking to the shock site. A friend could trick a gullible friend into going to the site. None of these things have any benefits to anyone at all. People don't even need to know this information because it can not benefit them in any way positive, besides for them to make a mental note to never go to that site... This topic needs to be deleted because of these reasons.Sumperson01 23:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>None of those reasons fall under any WP policies I've seen, and like I said, I have used the article in question to avoid finding out what some awful site (I'm a very curious person) by going to it. Instead I can read that it's a picture of awful thing X. So, it actually does benefit people in positive ways.<a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward_Wakelin_dd5e.html" title="User:Edward Wakelin">Edward Wakelin</a> 23:27, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously the concept itself is valid, it's an observable and reported phenomenom, and itself an outgrowth of more traditional juvenile behavior like <a href="../../../m/o/o/Mooning.html" title="Mooning">mooning</a>. It seems to me that the real problem is that this article includes links to sites that cause this sort of problem. That may be so, but itself is not a reason to remove information from Wikipedia, any more than we remove information about software emulators because people might pirate video games, or information from chemistry articles so people can't make poisons or explosives. Or heck, pick a gun based on information about firearms here. Unfortunate though those risks may be, censoring this site just to avoid a person's possible misconduct is not a viable choice. It would be equivalent to an ostrict sticking its head in the sand.

Yes, Wikipedia is not censored, but that doesn't mean that offensive things should be kept regardless of other policies, just because they're offensive.

<dd>To be fair, many of us who came in early were addressing the original nomination, which didn't really raise this point. I haven't finished sorting through the article, but so far, all of the sources appear to be primary, which is definitely a problem. However, I was thinking perhaps we could go through and purge some of the most egregious violations. First, though, I must question: has there anything been written on the concept of shock sites? If so, then I'd say keep this, as its unsourced but verifiable; if there really isn't anything reliable on the topic, then I will amend my vote accordingly as it becomes unverifiable OR.

<dd>Well, sources and NOR are valid concerns, but I don't see them as especially problematic for this article.

I suspect the best immediate source would be various tutorials on avoiding the evils of the internet, but I'm not too familiar with them myself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> It's articles like this that severely weaken and cripple Wikipedia's credibility. This is <i>supposed</i> to be an encyclopedia, not a repository of useless, senseless crap, which is what "shock sites" are. Honestly, I can't fathom how anyone who has ever listened to the vision of Wikipedia as espoused by Jimmy Wales can support the inclusion of this or any other junk article. Wikipedia is supposed to <i>add</i> to human knowledge and <i>increase</i> our understanding - <b>that is the purpose of any encyclopedia</b>. Instead, Wikipedia is gradually becoming more and more of not just a pop culture resource (with endless television episode guides and character profiles), but a resource of useless trivia. Even Jimbo has acknowledged these problems. If we want Wikipedia to be taken seriously, if we want Wikipedia to be <b>accepted as an encyclopedia</b>, then we're going to have the cut this crap out of the loop once and for all. If anyone here is interested in the true mandate of this project, which is to help build a free encyclopedia, they will vote to delete. IMHO, anyone who votes to keep this and other articles like it is not interested in this mandate, and is instead contributing to the demise of this fine resource. metaspheres 18:50, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree that the list isn't necessary and will probably just turn the article into a "post your own shock link" page. If this page has a list, it should only contain info on shock sites that are notable enough to have their own articles. I don't believe, though, that the whole article should be deleted, as shock sites are a notable internet phenominon. I also suspect that the user's personal taste may be influencing this deletion nomination. Grotesque or no, Wikipedia is not censored and content shouldn't be removed just because certain users find it offensive.--<a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERouge_Rosado_5aea.html" title="User:Rouge Rosado"><font color="Darkred"><b>Rouge Rosado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../r/o/u/User_talk%7ERouge_Rosado_223f.html" title="User talk:Rouge Rosado"><font color="red"><i>Oui?</i></font></a> 21:09, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The question should not be, <i>"Is it offensive?"</i> but rather, <i>"Is it encyclopedic?"</i> The question of offensiveness is moot. There are plenty of things in any encyclopedia - even Britannica - that one may find offensive. For instance, articles about human anatomy or sexuality. As I have stated in my comment, <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia</a>. The purpose of an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is to inform and educate. This is the goal of Wikipedia and this is why we have <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_1.0_24e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia 1.0">Wikipedia:Wikipedia 1.0</a>. Articles such as this do not conform to the mandate of Wikipedia and if this project is to ever achieve parity with "closed-source" encyclopedias (Britannica, Columbia, Encarta, etc.) these articles <i>will</i> have to eventually be phased out. If not now, then in the near future. But I can assure you that it will happen, and it's already been slowly occurring since late 2005 when it became clear that the quality of articles in the arts and humanities and culture (as opposed to science) leaves much to be desired. Let us not avoid the inevitable but quickly set things into motion. The sooner Wikipedia cleans this junk out, the sooner we will arrive at a high-quality 1.0 release, and even better releases beyond that one. metaspheres 08:29, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Metaspheres, I'm afraid I must disagree. While you may be right to have concerns over the contents of this article, as I'm sure there are folks who see this sort of thing as the place to troll, that's not a reason for deletion. It's a reason for concern, and attention, but this article is still about a real phenomenon, which is itself the outgrowth of yet nother aspect of human behavior. It probably does need some study and documentation, as it is important for the social sciences to study humans as they behave, and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good. in fact, that sort of stick your head in the sand and just believe what you want to believe mindset has been the bane of social science for a long, long time. It really needs study by clear-minded folks, and if Wikipedia wants to help with that, it won't be by deleting this article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:19, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But you see, what you have just described is original research. As far as I know, there are currently no academic works on "shock sites." If Wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">original research</a> is still in effect (last I checked, it was), then this is one for the sociologists and culture critics. Once they've come up with a thesis or two and published their findings, then more power to everyone who wants to include this junk. metaspheres 20:37, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In case you failed to notice, the article in question does cite sources in the references section. Your claim of "original research" holds no water. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarc_726b.html" title="User:Tarc">Tarc</a> 01:27, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow. Did you look at those references? Because they (1) don't back up any of the substance of the article, they're only in the list. (2) Even for the sites, some of them are kind of sketchy in backing up the inclusion of the site or its status as a shock site. (3) Not a single one of them is clearly a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 02:36, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but even if I agreed with you about anything being OR in the article, the problem of original research is not so endemic to this article that it warrants deletion. This article isn't about a theory of behavior that leads to the creation of shock sites, but describing a real and observable phenomena, that nobody is going about denying that they exist. There is a wide gap between theory and observation, that sometimes that NOR policy doesn't cover very well. And yes, there are people writing about them, here's a book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1580081371&amp;id=l17ov4anzIMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=rotten.com&amp;sig=cYhsAzKc9xm8zgGMpBVcsM3vL9E" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1580081371&amp;id=l17ov4anzIMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=rotten.com&amp;sig=cYhsAzKc9xm8zgGMpBVcsM3vL9E" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> on the subject of disgusting websites. Not serious and academic, but enough to demonstrate some interest. On TV, there's this report of a Consumer Reports article <a href="http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=3644152" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=3644152" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which indicates that this exists, not to mention this <a href="http://www.out-law.com/page-3320" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.out-law.com/page-3320" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> bit of news which uses the term to describe the actions of the German gov't.

Even though they use different terms, I think it is clear what they are talking about. Since they are a firm providing tech support services, I'm reluctant to add them to the page, but they do show that there is interest in the subject. I suspect there's more in discussions on content-filtering, protecting children, and whatnot, but I must admit, I have little familiarity with them, so I'm not even sure where to look. Still, I don't find your objections, either in terms of what Wikipedia should be, or OR, very persuasive. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think that satisfies the question of whether there is any possibility of any valid sources. I'd prefer something more substantial like this article, but this should show that it can be achieved.

<li><b>Keep</b>. metaspheres argues: "The sooner Wikipedia cleans this junk out, the sooner we will arrive at a high-quality 1.0 release...." I respond that we won't reach 1.0 by screening all 1.4 million articles and deleting those that don't belong. The more common vision of 1.0 is that it would represent a selection from among all the articles. There's a large middle ground of articles that wouldn't go in 1.0 but that shouldn't be deleted. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 09:53, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

The vision of Wikipedia, as outlined by Jimbo, is as a free encyclopedia. Which is to say, an encyclopedia along the lines of a traditional one such as Britannica or Encarta. The only difference being that it is free (obviously) and perhaps just a bit more "liberal" in it's outlook and what is included - for instance, including articles on localities, institutions, software programs, etc. that wouldn't normally be included in a traditional print encyclopedia. But, <i>not</i> so liberal as to go ahead and include articles (such as this one and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>) which literally add <i>nothing</i> to the "sum of human knowledge" (per Jimbo's original vision) but actually <i>take away</i> from it. I'm serious - articles like this one have become so numerous that like reality shows on television, Wikipedia will begin lowering one's IQ. Most visitors <i>invariably</i> will come across these articles if they spend more than a few minutes here. What you're basically saying is that Wikipedia 1.0 will be the <i>actual</i> encyclopedia and that this, the original Wikipedia, is just a "knowledge base," a repository, if you will. That's fine. Then Wikipedia should redefine itself, and Wikimedia should fork Wikipedia into two, similar to the original setup with Nupedia and Wikipedia. One, the actual encyclopedia with informative, educational articles, and the other, a repository of mostly useless pop and Internet culture references. metaspheres 16:11, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
