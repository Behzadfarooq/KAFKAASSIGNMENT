<p><b>Introduction:</b> <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> has already been the subject of three AfD discussions and I do not lightly nor frivolously bring this 4th AfD. I reviewed the previous three AfDs and feel that they were all presented on the <s>dubious</s> <i>false premise</i> argument that the article was written as an “attack piece”. The first two AfDs were brought by Ms. Schwarz herself and the third was brought by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">User:Steve Dufour</a> at the express request of Ms. Schwarz. (Please see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barbara_Schwarz_18b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz">1st</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barbara_Schwarz_%282nd_nomination%29_7c7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz (2nd nomination)">2nd</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barbara_Schwarz_%28third_nomination%29_624f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz (third nomination)">3rd</a>.) I say <s>"dubious"</s> <i>"false premise"</i> not because I am doubting the nature of the piece in its various versions but because that is a very dubious argument for deletion. An attack piece would be corrected, not deleted, and various actions in that direction have been taken. No, I am bringing this AfD because I believe, in good faith, that this article does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> standards for inclusion. I make arguments for my position below that, I think, were previously either not made or, if touched upon, overshadowed by the nature of the previous discussions; both their focus on a improper argument and the presence of Barbara herself. Prior to bringing this AfD I <s>canvassed</s> <i>queried</i> the interested editors at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html#AfD_.284th_Nomination.29" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz#AfD (4th Nomination)</a> and found more than adequate interest, in my opinion, to take this to the community for consideration. Thank you for considering my arguments.</p>
<b>Not Notable:</b> <s>Barbara Schwarz has been noted in the press but is not notable.</s> <i>Barbara Schwarz has been noted in the press to a very limited extent but is not sufficiently notable for inclusion.</i> (edited - ja) Her private search for records for her private reasons gained her mention in a couple of news outlets. That is all. Below is my comment when I solicited comments at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html#AfD_.284th_Nomination.29" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz#AfD (4th Nomination)</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry but the more I look at this article, the less it seems to belong here. Her sole "claim" to notability is that she had an article or two written about her as filler for a local paper. Sorry, but lots of people are mentioned in the papers. They are not notable. For instance, I can Google <s>"most parking tickets"</s> <i>most+"parking tickets"</i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=most+%22parking+tickets%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=most+%22parking+tickets%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and learn a lot about "McMillan Electric Co." reasons for racking up 1,497 ticket worth $74,375 in San Francisco<i>, as <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/02/24/MNGMPOAK521.DTL&amp;hw=McMillan&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=442" class="external text" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/02/24/MNGMPOAK521.DTL&amp;hw=McMillan&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=442" rel="nofollow">covered</a> in some depth by the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> (correct &amp; add - ja). Certainly that does not make the firm notable enough for an article here. I could then Google them a bit more and maybe find out that they had some <a href="../../../o/s/h/OSHA_7b95.html" title="OSHA">OSHA</a> violations or filed a lawsuit or two. Still does not make them notable. But if a few editors here had a non-notable feud and dislike against "McMillan Electric Co." then they might be able to make an article that almost (but not quite) seems like it belongs here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some claim that her Usenet activity somehow contributes to her notability. Her Usenet postings are not notable for either their volume nor their content. There are lots of heavy posters on Usenet and lots of “interesting” material posted. That is not notable in itself and adds little, if anything, to any other notability. In my opinion, the only reason her Usenet activity has any “audience” here is because her postings were in vocal opposition to a small group of “anti-Scientologists” that also happen to be editors here. In my opinion, that very small group has carried their Usenet feud to these pages.</p>
<b>Non-public figure:</b> Ms. Schwarz’ FOIA requests, the basis of any notability claim, were brought as a private person for private reasons. That she got mention in the newspaper for their volume does not automatically make her sufficiently notable for inclusion in this encyclopedia. This is clearly and, at best, a “borderline case”. And <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html#Non-public_figures" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons#Non-public figures</a> states:
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be "do no harm".</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
Ms. Schwarz clearly feels that she is harmed by the existence of this article and has asked for its removal. In a case of a non-public person such as this one, that carries weight for deletion.

<li><b>Comment on newsworthiness vs. encyclopedic-ness</b> - Being persistent in petitioning public agencies for private reasons does not a public person make, nor a particularly notable one. I am sure that most <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_education.html" title="Board of education">school boards</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condominium.html" title="Condominium">condominium boards</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_meetings.html" title="Town meetings">town meetings</a>, etc. etc. in America, for instance, have one or more people that show up to every meeting to make the same point over and over and over again. Sometimes those people are written up in the paper to fill up a slow news day. It is called a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_interest_story.html" title="Human interest story">human interest story</a>. Not encyclopedic. Not even particularly newsworthy but news outlets have to fill their papers or their <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting.html" title="Broadcasting">airtime</a>. The important thing to note is that these little human interest write-ups are <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephemera.html" title="Ephemera">ephemera</a>; if someone that knows the person sees it it is forgotten quickly. Not so an encyclopedia. Articles here should stand some "test of time". Barbara Schwarz does not meet notability standards for an encyclopedia. and she did not even meet the much lower newsworthiness standards for more that a few local outlets despite one story apparently going out on the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> (AP) wire, a cooperative tool for filling up newspapers and airtime. <i>Were she truly noteworthy, the AP story would have been picked by perhaps hundreds of member and non-member news organizations. There is no evidence that her story showed up as more than local filler in a small handful of outlets.</i> --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 02:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC) <small>(subsequent addition shown in <i>italics</i>.</small>)</li>
<li><b>Comment on the recent expansion of the article</b> - While <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmee_be9e.html" title="User:Smee">Smee's</a> efforts to improve the article are appreciated, to the degree that such improvement consists of referencing public records documenting Ms. Schwarz' private efforts to uncover information for her own private reasons; to that degree such expansion does not speak to the notability of the subject. We know that she filed lots of requests with governement agencies. Such agencies are usually required to make records of such available to the public and many agencies are making to effort to make that material available on the internet. The existence of these records says nothing about notability. And actually, IMO, they add little to the article other than to make it appear more substantial than it has any right to be. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 13:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Conflicts of interest:</b> The subject of conflict of interest (COI) has been raised at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz</a> in connection with both the existence of this article and with AfD discussion. There are, IMO, two clear instances of COI; cases where the involved parties have off-Wikipedia relationships with Barbara Schwarz that would cause them to be strongly biased one way or the other. That is <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">User:Steve Dufour</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">User:Tilman</a>. Steve has already stated that he is a friend of Barbara Schwarz and had told her that he would see about getting the article removed. Steve has admitted to his COI but has demonstrated that his clear intent is to respect the project and the process here. Tilman has a long history of acrimony with Ms. Schwarz on the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology. The case for Tilman’s COI is made <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_Archive_10_6292.html#Tilman.E2.80.94conflict_of_interest_editing_this_article.3F" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz/Archive 10">here</a>. I will not repeat it, there are links that any interested editor can check. I also point out that Tilman proposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABarbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=112127456&amp;oldid=112121555" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABarbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=112127456&amp;oldid=112121555" rel="nofollow">here</a> that I should be blocked for simply talking about another AfD which seems to be a rather extreme position that may be indicative of a COI. I propose Steve and Tilman either both vote or both limit themselves to no-vote comments. That will balance and they might as well just vote. The claim has also been made that I, as a Scientologist, have a conflict of interest in that I might think that Ms. Schwarz reflects badly on Scientology and, for that reason and that reason alone, I want the article to disappear and so I have a COI. That is wrong on all counts. I do not think that Ms. Schwarz reflects badly on Scientology for my own reasons that are not really germane here. I have <b>never</b> attempted to remove material critical of Scientology that is properly sourced and presented. I do want the article to disappear because I think that a petty, critical, and demeaning article on a non-notable non-public person who has repeatedly asked for it to be removed, should be removed. I am not going to recluse myself and I am not going to ask anyone with sympathies for or against Scientology to recluse themselves either. Besides the fact that such a request is neither proper nor enforceable, this is not about Scientology. This is simply about one article about one living person and a decision on whether it belongs in this encyclopedia. Thank you.</p>

<li><b>Comment - Notable</b> In the interest of providing both POVs, this is why I think she is notable. Her FOIA activity should not be looked upon as some sort of Guiness Book of World Records title, it is far more notable than that. Filing a FOIA request costs the government money, unlike the usual attempt to set a record. It costs even more money when the person filing asks the government to cover the costs. Moreover the the scope of her requests includes dozens of agencies. Below is a sample of references, it doesn't even scratch the surface of her activity.</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Thank you Anynobody. However, as court records and so forth these are primary sources.

<dd>Typically sources don't say "X is important". We are allowed to use primary sources as well as secondary sources as long as the article is not predominantly sourced from primary sources. When Person B is mentioned as holding the record for Y, we don't need anyone else to say "Person B is important." It's obvious to the casual reader that the world's record holder for Y is a notable person. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 18:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Court case documents are also considered primary sources (and yes, primary sources exist on every person, notable or not), as are usenet posts. The use of primary sources are generally restricted to specific situations, or to bolster a secondary source which references the primary. I'll have to take a closer look at whether or not the primary sources are being used properly. Also, the fact that this is a fourth AfD is irrelevant. Consensus changes, as does the criteria and arguments used in a nomination. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 19:01, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

It is not measured by Wikipedia editors' own subjective judgements. Notability is generally permanent." Babs has been the subject of numerous secondary sources. As for the "do no harm" clause... I think that would really be a stretch to apply it to this case. There are numerous people who have articles here that haven't been deleted for that reason.

<li><b>Keep</b> In addition to the "Keep" points outlined above, the subject remains a byword within U.S. government information circles (and in the field of information-handling more generally) in relation to the Freedom of Information Act. The aspects of the article that have proved the most contentious over time (e.g., content on her personal beliefs and her relationship to Scientology) seem to me appropriate for inclusion (provided that they are, as they seem to be currently, appropriately sourced and NPOV), if for no other reason than that they are useful in fully understanding the FOIA issues raised by her actions. The subject has chosen to become, to whatever extent, a public figure, through involvement in public official processes, the press, and the Internet; a byproduct of doing so, in this day and age, is the possibility of being the subject of a WP article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 08:25, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - Under the logic in your first point, it would then seem that every parent that sends their child to a public school is a public person? And every such child, too? After all, their schooling is "paid for by the public". And filing a lawsuit as a private person against a public agency does not, ipso facto, make the private individual a "public figure". Schwarz is a non-public figure.

<li>Yes, I'm quite clear on the concept of "fifteen minutes of fame". The problem remains though that she is well covered - but on the other hand, the synopsis makes her sound like she's a paranoid-delusional woman, or suffers from some other mental disorder. Whether this is the case is left to a psychiatrist, though. Strike that, and she's some woman who sued the CIA and made a s***load of FOIA requests. That said, in consideration of the way the article sounds (i.e., rather harmful), and that <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> makes a point on doing no harm (other comments above), I'm striking my previous vote. Yes, she's notable in being a record holder for FOIA requests, but this strikes me as a case of a woman who needs her privacy given any perceived mental disorders. <s><b>Weak delete</b></s>, per the "Do No Harm" clause in <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 23:25, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2,</a> "Do no harm" is a two way street. Barbara Schwarz is known to file frivolous and false reports to law enforcement about her perceived enemies, and spam vast amounts of defamatory libel on the Usenet about those whom she does not like which is any person who cannot accept her delusions as fact. While in Germany, her smear campaigns she ran for scientology as an operative in its notorious Guardian's Office caused much harm to the reputations of the perceived enemies of scientology. I believe this reliable, well sourced, and well enforced by community action factual biography on Wikipedia has the potential to cause her far less harm than a similar biography published on a web page or web site, which is a likely and inevitable result of being established in the wake of the vacuum left by deletion of this article.

<li><b>Comments on Orsini's arguments</b> - 1) Orsini makes some claims that not only cannot be backed up in RS but which are really off-topic to the issue of the suitability of this subject for this encyclopedia. Even if Ms. Schwarz was "mean" to some (and I by no means take <i>that</i> for granted), that is hardly a reason for this project to be "mean" to her. "Do no harm" means just that; not "figure out if the subject deserves that harm be done to her", which seems to be Orsini's premise. 2) The concept that the existence of an article here will somehow forestall more vindictive mention on web pages is just silly. I mean, it hasn't exactly helped <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, has it? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 03:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comments on Justanother's arguments</b> - (1) The claims I have made can be backed up by simple observation and searches on Google. Are RS required for comments in AfD discussions, or does AGF prevail here? The project is not being "mean" to Schwarz in any way by insisting her article has reliable and well-sourced citations; in fact, it has been far more kind to her than she has been to those whom she has defamed and smeared by spamming the libel propaganda from the scientologist's "dead agenting" website. The hate site's front man even appears on video admitting they have no obligation to correct their mistakes. Further, the suitability of this subject for Wikipedia has already been answered by results of three previous AfDs, which favored keeping the article. (2) By comparing Barbara Schwarz to Tom Cruise: is this an admission by Justanother that Barbara Schwarz is, in fact, a public figure? As <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">User:ChrisO</a> observed below, persons who wish to remain private figures <b>do not</b> publish a 90-plus part autobiography under their own name in a public medium accessible word-wide. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 04:08, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - <i>"By comparing Barbara Schwarz to Tom Cruise: is this an admission by Justanother that Barbara Schwarz is, in fact, a public figure?"</i> No, absolutely not. It is an observation that they are both figures hated by "anti-Scientologists", especially that insular group that frequents alt.religion.scientology. The only difference is that since Cruise is a public figure, there has been an incredible amount of "pile-on" criticism that is absent in the obscure Ms. Schwarz' case. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Her notability is plenty established. Former cult leader, FOIA record setter, USENET celebrity, frivolous lawsuit filer. Even the Supreme Court of the United States has considered her and made her one of the only people permanently barred from the certiorari process. She is not a private figure. She voluntarily gave up that status when she became president of Church of Scientology in Germany and then again when she volunteered to be interviewed by the Salt Lake City Tribune. Her story was put on the AP Wire and spread through newspapers across the country. People that talk to reporters knowing their story will be published in a paper do not subsequently have the right to claim the details in that story are a private affair. The FOIA requests were not "in the late 80's" as user Cman suggests above. She has been making numerous FOIA requests even in this decade. Also it is inappropriate for Cman to threaten to add articles to Wikipedia that he deems unworthy just to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 19:08, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hello Jimbo. I thought you might want to weigh in on <strong class="selflink">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz (4th nomination)</strong>. I have already invoked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=80319619&amp;oldid=80083769" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=80319619&amp;oldid=80083769" rel="nofollow">your comments</a> about newsgroup postings, OR, etc. related to your own article, but I thought you would want to comment directly.

<dd>You left off the "IMHO" from my quote. Since I had already invoked a diff of Jimbo's comments in a reply above, I thought he should be afforded the opportunity to speak directly to this situation. It was my opinion that his previous comments related directly to this article, but I didn't want to speak for him. I suspect he would agree with me, but I could be wrong. And what is wrong with getting as many opinions as possible? The outcome of this AfD does not affect me one bit, as long as the decision is made by a truly broad consensus. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 20:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't see any problem with letting Jimbo know about it.

<li><b>Keep</b> per many reasons, but I think Vivaldi summed them up for me the best. (Oh, and I came here because I saw the post on Jimbo's page, so maybe the canvassing aspect is true, but maybe it's not having the intended effect.) —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 20:01, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Jimbo is interested in BLP issues and it is appropriate that a mention be made on his talk page. I have asked Crockspot above to modify the message. Thank you for your input. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 20:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Upon further reflection, Crockspot's communication to another single editor, be it Jimbo or whomever, is his own business, and, as you say, there in no guarantee of what the net effect might be. So Crockspot, I apologize if I was meddlesome, please do as you see fit. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 20:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Disclosure</b> - I should probably disclose that before I left Jimbo a note, I also left a note on Morton Devonshire's talk page, stating specifically that I was doing so because I knew that a lot of people watch Morty's page. If you want to call that canvassing, then fair enough. I happen to think that the reason this article was kept in the previous three AfD's is because the "votes" were overwhelmed by a minority opinion specifically interested in keeping this article. More/wider opinions are better, whatever they may be. I don't see anything wrong with letting a wider audience know about an AfD, nor do I see anything wrong with including my opinion about in in user talk space. If this is a violation, please let me know and I will modify my behavior in the future. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 20:28, 11 March 2007 (UTC)<b>Clarification</b> - Just to clarify, I did not leave Jimbo the note for the same reason I left Morty one.

That would make any communication at all subject to a charge of canvassing and that is ridiculous.

<li><b>Speey Keep</b> I too came here via Jimbo's page. My main concern is that to bring fourth AfD there should be weighty and substantial reasons given. I don't see those presented here.

On a scale of media relevance, a person the subject of an AP item that wasn't picked up is more notable than someone who is not. It's also important to remember that media coverage alone does not determine notability. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Maybe it is because the subject, being a former president of scientology in Germany, attracts pro-scientology editors to delete this article. Maybe it is because as the antics of the subject, one of their former leaders, have been quite bizarre. As is well known, scientologists have a history of trying to remove or truncate any material which do not represent a pro-scientology POV, or which may be seen as unfavorable to scientology. Maybe it's for those reasons. Or maybe not. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 07:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

Wow, Orsini, that sounds like a great way for you to contribute to this project. Because with your grand total of 12 Mainspace edits in 9 months here, you certainly are overdue. Just what is your function here, Orsini? 'Cause it looks to me like it is disruption and attack. And here you are attacking me with no proof other than your dubious word against my good record here. But I am used to it. So let's just stop the attacks on me and let this AfD run its course, shall we? This is not about me.

I will limit my future responses to attacks to the simple mention that this is not about me, and not even that if possible.

<dd>Oh, I apologize, I thought you were referring to the voter in which case my comment would have been appropriate, I think. In answer to your question, "anti-Scientologists" feel that Ms. Schwarz reflects badly on Scientology (I do not feel that way for my own private reasons) so inclusion here is part of their attack on Scientology via Wikipedia that I reference in my "Reply to Orsini" above and in the COI sidebar. That they also get to strike back at their Usenet nemesis is thick icing and ice cream on the cake, IMO.

<li><b>Response</b> - <i>Her sole "claim" to notability is that she had an article or two written about her as filler for a local paper.</i> This statement has proven to be false, as an examination of the Talk page and the article itself will reveal. There are four, not "a couple," of print media articles written primarily about the subject's FOIA abuses cited; there are 2 additional <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> online newsletters; there is also a secondary mention of the subject in the print media primarily concerning <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyril_Vosper_e29f.html" title="Cyril Vosper">Cyril Vosper</a>, and these are only the English language articles. The exact number of appearances the subject made in the German print media while the subject was the president of scientology in Germany is undetermined, although the subject’s self-published autobiography on a world-wide medium under her own name – this <i>non public person</i> according to you – states media articles appeared about her there. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother,</a> this AfD is based on faulty and misleading premises, and has been brought only to remove an article unfavorable to the image of scientology.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thank you for your input. All due respect, but the grain pattern in the wood of my coffee table is interesting, too. "Interesting" is not the standard for an article in Wikipedia. I want to be sure that we are not confusing interesting with notable. I agree, there is a lot in Ms. Schwarz' story that is interesting. I could probably tell you a lot about me that would be interesting and I would be interested to know about you, too. Interesting, yes. But that is about it. But it does speak to why she got the little bit of press that she did. News outlets have to fill their papers and their airtime. So they write stories about things that they feel might be interesting. In this case a private person pursuing her private interests for private reasons with "interesting" motivation and to an "interesting" extent. A few local news outlets thought it interesting enough to spend a few paragraphs or a few minutes on. Not even 15 minutes of fame. Two minutes of limited mention, not fame, and a lifetime of exposure here. Seems a bit unbalanced, doesn't it (no pun intended)? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 15:34, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>LOL! A Scientologist pulling the "Bigotry card" when cornerned. Next I bet you'll talk about your rights to religious freedom or something of that nature. As a new user, I'm saying that all I've seen you do is delete things critical of Scientology. Am I wrong? Do you not delete items critical of Scientology? Do you delete anything in Wikipedia besides articles related to Scientology?

<dd>BTW - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, I'm curious. I said all you were here for was getting negative aspects about the "church" deleted. You said check your "edit history". Was that a bluff? I'm confused. Orsini just mentioned that you've had over 500 edits since March 5th, and to me it all looks Scientology related - nothing in favor of only delete. When I accuse you of "Justanother is only here to delete everything on Wikipedia that is remotely negative to Scientology", you shouldn't get angry. You should just nod your head and agree. It's not a big deal if you're that one sided, I think other people should just be aware of what you're main intention here is. It's the same deal with Barbara Schwarz. People need to be aware of crazy Scientologists. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulhorner_4a3d.html" title="User:Paulhorner">Paulhorner</a> 22:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hate is not about what having an article like this in Wikipedia is about. It's about public knowledge and awareness. Barbara Schwarz is currently threatening to sue me over my website religiousfreedomwatch.info and because she says I receive money from a Mr Griffin in Australia for webhosting. If I had no idea who this lady was, I would be worried. Because of this Wiki page and Google it is very easy to find out the lawsuit has no merit.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulhorner_4a3d.html" title="User:Paulhorner">Paulhorner</a> 01:21, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, I fail to see why this should be deleted. The basis for the nominator's arguments seem to center upon a faulty understanding of WP:N and that the subject of the article doesn't want to be on wikipedia. Which is certainly not a good enough reason. What if the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">Devil</a> is upset about the negative coverage we have of him here, does that mean we shouldn't have that article either? Rather than substantial weight as the nominator suggests, we should give the wishes of subject of the article very little weight <i>unless</i> what the wish is supported by the policies we follow. Either which way, at the very worst I feel this is a matter of the discussion on the talk page of the article and not for deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 09:08, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I came across this from Devonshire's talk page, and read the article. If she were successful in her litigation, or set a major legal precedent (even in a failed attempt to get information), or if she caused so much trouble that <i>major</i> reforms of the legal system were made, then there'd be a strong case for notability. As it is, however, it borders on exposing the craziness of scientology nuttiness for public ridicule. In general, don't write articles about paranoid living people unless they are truly notable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 22:08, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
