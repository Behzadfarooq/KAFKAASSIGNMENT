<li><b>Delete</b>. Not currently disambiguating anything; completely idiosyncratic non-topic as written. Don't redirect to <a href="../../../g/_/m/G_major.html" title="G major">G major</a>; that article is not about preludes in G major. What belongs here, if anything, is a musicological analysis of the Bach piece. Ikkyu2 07:35, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and turn in to a simple list of preludes in G Major by composer, by analogy with say <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._7_20a5.html" title="Symphony No. 7">Symphony_No._7</a>.

<dd>Since the name "prelude in G major" is entirely generic, I don't see anyone searching for it. And if they did, surely they'd be looking in iTunes not here?

<dd>Yes that's more or less the point. Its generic, but then so are the Symphony_No._x articles. <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfinished_symphony.html" title="Unfinished symphony">Unfinished symphony</a> is similarly generic, but nevertheless an interesting article as most people think that there is only one unfinished symphony and imagine it was <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Schubert_d1e2.html" title="Franz Schubert">Schubert</a>'s, half finished, last symphony. Nevertheless these generic articles are more or less useful guides. The Prelude In G Major article isn't particularly good at the moment, but there is no reason why it couldn't point towards the most popular G-Major Preludes that are played on their own. Bach must have written half a dozen, but only two or three seem popular. There is another G-Major by Rachmaninoff which may be as popular as his C-sharp minor prelude. And no doubt there are others.</dd>
<dd>If someone wanted to create similar Prelude in xx articles for each of the 24 keys, I don't have much of a problem with that. Nor if that were extended to other musical forms; fugue, concerto, etc - Wikipedia is not paper. If you ever listen to a classical station on the radio, you will find that they often discuss pieces using shorthand titles like 'The concerto in G', on the assumption that you would know they were meaning the Ravel they had played earlier.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, we can take the point of view that non of these list-type articles are really much help in tracking down any individual work. In which case, perhaps they should be using Google or freedb to search for them, and it would be better to just delete this article. But then should you also delete the Symphony_No._x articles? -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 09:38, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is nothing notable about a generic prelude in G-major. It's not even well-known name like the (Bach) B-minor Mass.

<li>Have you any idea how many pieces JS Bach wrote in his life? And if we do all Bach's, do we do Telemann's as well? I don't mind, but you are talking about a very large number of articles, even if the vast majority of the music is massively better (IMO) than the average song article on Wikipedia.

<dd>That is incorrect he caused changes with the entire Universities logo system, which including both the Wahine and UH Warriors logos, from the rainbow to the H logo.

<dd>Not quite. Charlie Wade wasn't the reason why the logo was changed. It was due partially to the negative connotation of the word "rainbow" held by people unfamiliar with the term's history in Hawaii, and partially due to trademark enforcement issues with the old logo. While his comments were somewhat controversial, he did not cause the entire UH system to change its logo. <a href="../../../a/o/i/User%7EAoi_f952.html" title="User:Aoi">青い(Aoi)</a> 06:18, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'd agree the page is full of irrelevancies, but that is a better argument for cleanup than for deletion. I've taked a first crack (and by no means the last that needs to be done) at editing by fixing punctuation and trying to cut the article down a bit. I think it would benefit immensely from someone with better knowlege of the subject matter than I taking all his rolls, theatre companies, and stage productions and puting them in a table. As it stands though they guy seems notable enough in theatre circles to justify the article. It just needs to be cleaned up.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:17, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Second, it violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Third, it's poorly written and already has a cleanup tag on it. Fourth, it's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">listcruft</a>; there are only seven companies on the entire list.

(This has already been proposed, but the talk page is moving so fast that the merge discussion has already been moved to an archive page and thus will probably never reach a consensus.)

<li>Tricky one, IMO this is a possibly a candidate for Speedy Delete under A6 - Attack Page as it arguably encourages people to boycott certain named entirely innocent companies. Removal of the company names would turn it back into a reasonable article with some POV issues that would be regulated by the community. On balance this is a <b>delete</b> unless the company names are removed. ++<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 03:46, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> It may be that this article is too specific and needs to be merged into <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_dcd7.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons</a>; however, I do not believe that contributors to this article were necessarily pushing an agenda, even if the existence or contents of the article are judged to violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Personally, I understand "listcruft" to be a reason for deletion only when the article <i>is</i> a list, while this article merely includes one, along with a timeline, pictures, and an introduction/overview. It also appears to me that most of this article is verifiable, if not yet verified. Deletion or merging may still be the best options, though. Participants in the boycott and the "Buy Danish" (makes me hungry) counter-boycott campaign will probably consult <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Danish_companies_94ee.html" title="List of Danish companies">List of Danish companies</a>, so this article is unnecessary and inferior from the point of view of somebody pushing an agenda regarding Denmark. In response to Deiz: I don't think it is an attack page, it does not appear to encourage the boycott, and removing relevant factual information from an article is not a good idea. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel7687_4b33.html" title="User:Joel7687">Joel7687</a> 04:08, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and delete.</b> The event is certainly notable, and one can quite easily write a well-referenced article that will meet WP articlespace policy. However, the correct page is Jyllands-Posten muhamad cartoons. Sjakkalle's suggestion is the natural one; I'm asking for a merge &amp; delete because I think this page is not a good redirect.

<li><b>Merge</b> into the article about the cartoon controversy if it's not already covered there.

<dd><i>Comment</i>. If someone reads this list and decides to boycott these companies, then we are supporting the boycott--albeit inadvertantly.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I just realized something that may prove this page to be unchangably <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">listcruftian</a> and inaccurate in its current form: The seven companies listed in the article were apparently picked at random by one or more editors, based solely on whether or not the companies' products were mentioned as examples in the news articles listed as references on the article page. But the boycott is not against these seven companies; it's against <i>all</i> Danish products. It's as if someone started a boycott against all products made in Japan, and then a WP article was created listing Sony and Toyota as the sole targets of the boycott because those were the only two companies the article's creator could think of at the time. That's simply dead wrong information. I won't vote again since I nominated the article, but this point should be taken into consideration. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 15:47, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

The mitochondrial DNA group X is quite interesting for the early population history of the United States. It has been suggested it may be linked to the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solutrean.html" title="Solutrean">Solutrean</a> culture, excavated in SW France, which may have been associated with extensive maritime activity along the fringes of the Atlantic ice-age ice sheets, similar in technology to modern-day <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a> culture. In particular, it is suggested that the Solutreans may have brought the original stone-working technology underlying the ubiquitous later <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis_point.html" title="Clovis point">Clovis point</a> to the Americas, which seems to have spread out from the <i>east</i> of the modern-day United States, in contrast to most of the paleoamerican population which is thought to have originated ultimately from Asia, and spread in from the <i>west</i>.

<dd>Curiously, haplogroup X isn't particularly associated with the Finns; it's more common around the Mediterranean, the Near East and the Caucasus.

<li><b>Comment</b> has the potential to be a good disambiguation page - refering to (a) the generic definition; (b) a popular television serial by the same name in the late 1980' on India's only national TV channel at that time (<a href="../../../d/o/o/Doordarshan.html" title="Doordarshan">Doordarshan</a>) and (c) the mailing list referred to in the article (provided its notability is established). However, I am not entirely sure if it makes sense to create a disambiguation page without having articles for any of the proposed entries. Would like to hear from other editors. Or another possibility is to convert the article to a text about the TV serial (only problem is that due to <a href="../../../f/u/t/FUTON_bias_4061.html" title="FUTON bias">FUTON bias</a>, probly very little would be available on the net about the seial (due to the fact that it is late 1980's) and hence may be deemed non-notabe). --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 15:40, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Just wanted to clarify myself, since I did not use copyright as a basis for my vote to delete (I modified my original comment a bit, since the opening wasn't particularly well-ewritten), and to provide some information. I am not a lawyer, but copyright with respect to machinima is a developing issue. I'm not sure what Disney and Squaresoft's stance on this is, but many game companies seem to be allowing, at least implicitly, non-profit machinima to thrive (see <a href="http://www.machinima.com/article.php?article=375" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.machinima.com/article.php?article=375" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> - "Machinima.com has informal agreements with quite a few games companies on distribution"). I fully understand the need to protect Wikipedia from copyvios, but, given that machinima seems to have been accepted by Bungie/Microsoft and Electronic Arts (who have both commissioned machinima videos from <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rooster_Teeth_Productions_5d51.html" title="Rooster Teeth Productions">Rooster Teeth Productions</a>, the company that produces <i>Red vs Blue</i>), among possibly a few other companies, there is a certain legitimacy to machinima nowadays. On the other hand, to my knowledge, neither Disney nor Squaresoft has ever taken a stance one way or the other, and so I could see a strong argument for assuming that there would be a copyvio problem with <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> machinima, parodies-as-fair-use notwithstanding. However, with the lack of evidence that Disney/Squaresoft disapprove, and based on the claim that <i>DH</i> is a parody anyway, I formed a rationale based solely on notability. Not saying that copyvio isn't a possible reason to delete a machinima article, but the situation in general with respect to copyrights and machinima is <i>usually</i> not clear-cut. -- <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> 02:43, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Copyvio was not the reason for my delete vote either. I'm not aware of any machinima copyright use cases ever being brought to court as most game companies do seem to allow this to happen. I'm just saying that in the absence of any settled case law pertaining to this, it may or may not fall under under fair use as parody. I voted delete on lack of notabilty. Copyright was just a passing comment.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:46, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's an incredibly funny work of comedy genuis with a large number of fans. Deleting it would be a pity.</p>
<p>Dramatic Hearts is a work of art and comedy, to remove this page would be a shame, I'm sure if any of you actually <i>watched</i> Dramatic Hearts you wouldn't delete it. Long Live DH! - Tom Seiniger</p>
<p>All of you bigots who believe Dramatic Hearts is dumb are the same people who hate the world and/or are easily offended. It uses the same sense of humor as other popular machinimas such as Red Vs. Blue... why not delete their article? You people make no sense... long live DH! - Deathspank</p>
<p>It's a work of comedy, and parody. An extremely well done one with a lot of effort put into it at that. If things like Red vs. Blue, 8-bit Theater, and PvP can all have Wiki pages, including that goofy Elemenstor saga or whatever it called, could justifably fall into the same catagory, and should be deleted as well.</p>
<p>Have any of you people even seen DH? If you have you'd know that there is no copyright infringment whatsoever.He's not selling it to anyone. It's a well done comedy series that deserves a page on Wikipedia. VIVA DH!- Joten9115</p>
<p>Dude oh my god, i love dramatic hearts. ya'll can't delete it if you watched it you would so how funny it was and how it has made me laugh time and time again. please don't take these memories and laughs away. This mini-series deserves a page on Wikipedia!!! Do not delete it would make me and many other wikipedia viewers very upset. please do not delete DH it makes the many laugh-needy people of this world not go hungry!!! Long Live DH!!! - James</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, somewhat reluctantly. Copyright is <i>often</i> not an issue with the game companies nowadays, with respect to non-commercial <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinima.html" title="Machinima">machinima</a>; most machinima productions are <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodies</a> anyway and <i>may</i> fall under fair use. However, the big difference between this and, say, <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a></i>, is that the latter has been well-covered in the media (see the References section of the <i>Red vs Blue</i> article) and has won multiple awards within the machinima community. As another example, <i><a href="../../../8/-/b/8-Bit_Theater_2a8a.html" title="8-Bit Theater">8-Bit Theater</a></i> (a webcomic, not machinima) gets about 145,000 Google hits.

The issue is not with machinima itself, but that the machinima has to be notable in some way. Personally, I would like to see an example of <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_afaf.html" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></i> machinima on Wikipedia, but there has to be some standard kept. This series has received very little mention outside of a few websites. So, unless someone can show verifiable information that this series is in fact notable in some way, I'm advocating deletion. Whether the series is actually funny or not (a subjective and POV matter, anyway) is irrelevant. -- <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> 23:14, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well language wise I've already cleaned it up a bit, to my knowledge (aside from a few words which are in character names) there are no offensive words on the page, only semi-suggestive. I would like to know why I have to "clean" up the pages when nothing is overally offensive and when Wikipedia states that it is not censored. As for popularity, what determines what makes it popular? I would consider a few thosand hits a day to make something pretty popular, to my knowledge RVB had a Wikipage far before it became as well known as it is now, before all the awards and becoming a huge hit. It's proven to be atleast semi-popular, I mean if you think it deserves deletion, well, can't stop you. I wouldn't expect a 2-3 month old series to compete with other series that have been around a good 3-5 years. MyInnerFred</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Language was never the real issue for me. In fact, when people mention "clean up", it usually refers to article structure, tone, style, etc. As for <i>Red vs Blue</i>, the <i>Red vs Blue</i> article was created on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">23 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, after the series had won three machinima awards and had been covered in <i>BBC News Online</i>, <i>Village Voice</i>, and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. But it's not about <i>RvB</i> versus other machinima series as much as it is about asserting a series' own notability. Drat had mentioned popularity as a possible guideline, and this is fine as long as the popularity is <i>verifiable</i> (i.e., mentioned and preferably quantified in a reputable news source or online site or such). It's not the only criterion, however, and I would vote to keep if there were more third-party mention of this series — at least a few hundred Google hits, at any rate. It looks like the series has been around for some time (enough for 22 episodes), but I would have expected a series of that length to have garnered enough attention for other people to have written about it. -- <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> 00:57, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah okay, well atleast we are going somewhere with this. I understand. I personally think it's pretty popular (and do note that while it has 22 episodes many were created before the actual series was produced, it's only been around for a little more then a month actually) considering the huge amount of hits on the main site. We've never really advertised but we've gotten some advertisement on other sites and hits from all over. I've never really advertised and the main reason I made this was I pretty much considered DH to have become popular enough to warrent a simple Wikipedia page. I wasn't really aware there was a need to be popular (of any kind) just figured it had to be atleast something out there, I figured 100,000 hits+ was a good start, heh-heh. The main problem with most people writting about the game is obviously that it's not out in America and many well known KH2 fan site staff members are very pro non-spoiler items. MyInnerFred</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b>. I appreciate the rationale. Popularity isn't a requirement of notability, but it generally would be sufficient if that popularity translated into other writers and sites reviewing the series, etc. I do think that the article content itself has some potential, but there simply isn't enough notability here, in my estimation. 100,000 hits (if those are total site hits in a month) isn't really that much in the grand scheme of things; sites can get a million hits and still be non-notable. -- <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> 08:37, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In the nn artical, it says something about having over 5,000 users. I have evidence of numbers over the last 12 months. SGCSim.com has 1,003 downloads. Original release on SG1files.com has 4,304 downloads, and the latest release on SG1files.com has 11,501 downloads. Thats a total of 16,808 downloads. And that is only over the last 12 months maximum. Every time the SGCSim.com website gets erased (has happened from various hosts), the number count is reset there. Last time that happened was June 2005. The counts from SG1files.com are starting from April 2005. I would safely estimate at least twice of what we have evidence for. And this doesn't include versions before v5.0.2, as there were no recorded counts for them. (v1, v2, v3, and v4.1). We should at least <b>Merge</b> the two articals. <a href="../../../t/p/g/User%7ETpg1989_4e5b.html" title="User:Tpg1989">tpg1989</a> 23:17, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The reason this article should be deleted has nothing to do with this being an article about fiction and has nothing to do with notability. It is composed almost entirely of original research by a single indivdual who has, as stated in the talk page, decided to take references to various things and events in the universe of the series and provide them with his own scientific explanations that are found nowhere in the books, the authors words elsewhere, or any published material. One user proposed that the article be merged, but as virutally every word is original research, that is not a feasible approach.

<li>OK, third attempt. And I also want to re-iterate the claim I've made on discussion page: Westeros is a continent on the larger planet in the yet larger fictional universe. This is not true of Middle-Earth, as the only account we have on it is some hobbit's diary and a book of myths published after the creator's death.oakad 07:54, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, I'm afraid the AfD tag can't be removed. The AfD process still has to be carried out. In any case, the article is still full of POV judgments and minor speculations. I'll see if I can clean it those up (as well as some grammatical problems). As for <a href="../../../a/r/d/Arda.html" title="Arda">Arda</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-Earth_4e64.html" title="Middle-Earth">Middle-Earth</a>, if those articles (which cover distinct topics) contain speculation, the solution is to remove it, not use it as precedent to keep other speculation. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with regard to Westeros and Middle-Earth, though. Could you be clearer?

<dd>Middle-Earth was used as a model in the early stage of the discussion. It is a long accepted article, and an Arda article is long accepted too (Middle-Earth is a continent in Arda). ASoIaF is however, much better developed world with lot of additional info - it's probably 4 to 6 time bigger than LoTR together with Silmarillion. Westeros itself has enormous amount of historical and political data.</dd>

<dd>I've looked at your edits:
<ul>
<li>You deleted my account on astronomical seasons - GRRM explicitly clarified that planet has both astronomical years and climatic seasons (multi-year spanning).</li>
<li>You removed references to his past works - I think its important to leave them (given the habit of GRRM to reuse his ideas).</li>
<li>What's wrong with valyrian lords? Everybody, from free cities to Lannisport distinguishes Dragonlords and plain valyrian descendants. They are also a specific sub-species of humans, having considerable magical abilities and distinguishing look.</li>
<li>Every story insider who ever speaks of Ghis considers it to be older than Valyria. Valyria influence is large in Westeros - through trade, rulers or artifacts. Valyria craft is more advanced than any other we see in the book (these are facts you removed).</li>
<li>Info that is not yet in the article. GRRM provided specific references to climate, nature and recent geological past (Dorn was connected to eastern continent by the land bridge, there is no land at the far north, climate data is available for most of the free cities). I need time to merge this in.</li>
<li>Future info. FoC has a lot of info that was not available in the first three books. However, the next book is expected to have even more and there is also a chance that GRRM will go on and explain his line of reasoning in writing of the book (like he did with Windhaven). This does not precludes us to cover already available data.</li>

<dd>Alternatives:
<ol>
<li>Why not merge with Westeros: Westeros is already heading to be a huge article (even without the rest of the world).</li>
<li>Why not merge with some book description: its beneficial to have page that describes settings, but has no spoilers.</li>
<li>Why not change the title: Precedent: Arda is considered to be both universe (artice uses term "solar system") and planet (long accepted claim on Arda page). Encapsulation: We have (or will have) some info on cosmology, more info on the planet and even more info on couple of specific places. Consider definition 1b of M-W for "universe": "the world of human experience" (in our case - story humans).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm neutral-to-merge on this (see above)--I think the topic is OK, but the title is terrible, and it should try a little harder to fit with existing <a href="../../../a/s/o/ASOIAF_0c66.html" title="ASOIAF">ASOIAF</a> material--but I have to say, Oakad, you are getting a little excited here.

<p><b>Delete</b>. Although Runescape Community seems to be a major site, it would be a bit of a stretch to include anything more than the current contents of the stub.

I'm closing this early per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Early_closings" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Early_closings</a> because it's clear that there is a consensus (I count 17 Keep, 4 Delete) to keep. Moreover, it's seems inconceivable to me that the tide could change so drastically that a consensus in the other direction could possibly evolve.

<dd>People can be vegetarians for many reasons. Some oppose killing animals for food. Some believe that grazing cattle for food is an inefficient use of natural resources. Some feel that a meatless diet is healthier. Some have discovered that vegetables are less expensive. Still, we have an article on <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism.html" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a>. This doesn't rule out the creation of subarticles to discuss the different aspects of vegetarianism—indeed, as the main article has grown, many articles describing various aspects of vegetarianism have been spun off. A similar process has taken place at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservatism</a>, with appropriate subarticles addressing the many disparate social and economic philosophies that can fall under the 'conservative' banner.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps move this stuff over to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccination_movement.html" title="Anti-vaccination movement">anti-vaccination movement</a> and parcel it up from there, but I think it's quite appropriate to have an article on this topic.

<dd>That's fine, but it is a fallacy to assume that all skepticism to thimerosal or a particular vaccination schedule, etc., is caused by individuals who are categorically against vaccinations, as the editor and title seems to suggest. <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">Vaccine controversy</a> is framed as a neutral description of the controversy with plenty of space for both sides of the issue.

<dd>It seems to me that the criteria for describing a group of people, and labeling it as such, is that one can carefully define who they are, ideally that they self-identify using a label that is similar to the title used in the article, and distinguishing them from others is meaningful.

AfD is supposed to be about more than votes; there's good information in the article; as the article stands it needs some serious refactoring and possibly renaming; the closing admin for this AfD isn't going to be able to fix everything magically at the end of the discussion period, so we're going to have to talk about this; you can take those points in any order you like. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 14:16, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Plenty of evidence, including on Wikipedia, that opponents of vaccination have organised themselves and have a collective viewpoint that can be dealt with in an encyclopedic fashion. A paper in the BMJ and numerous extant organisations most eloquently argue against Leifern's assertions. The main representatives of this movement here on Wikipedia (Ombudsman, Leifern, Whaleto, 86.10.231.219) will have various claims but none stand up to serious scrutiny. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 11:07, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>delete</b>: This article's development has been afforded a great deal of latitude, with relatively gentle suggestions to tone down the rhetoric rather than wholesale content deletions, but little has been done to deliver even a modicum of npov. With all due respect to those who have made good faith efforts to establish a viable article, the pov seems to have worsened, the discussion veers away from the anachronistic 'anti-vaccinationists' toward attacks on modern vaccine critics, and even the dispute tag keeps getting removed. Although there is a place for both 'anti-vax' and 'vax critics' articles, this particular article can be described by a singe word: unsalvageable. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 12:19, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Since all the articles John (Whaleto) has been creating about anti-vaxers have been essentially one-liners (created for the purpose of smearing the practice of vaccination) and no other bio info can be found, this article needs to incorporate all those bios.

<dd><b>Important Point - Summary</b> <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a>'s concern is valid in general regarding page hijacking:-
<dl>
<dd>This is an untrue assertion, unbacked by any indication (eg from the page history) that a page existed which I hijacked. It is probably a lie, but could in other people be a misapprehension due to not understanding how to read the history of a page (which Ombudsman has effectively pointed out, I am not perfect at, yet). I <b>started</b> the page. John has made significant additions to it which are definitely of value in teh article that is evolving. Without re-reading the history, my recollection is that Ombudsman's (a bad name offering a false impression of offical status I deprecate) contributions have been restricted to adding tags and barracking on the talk page. I assert bad faith.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>a strident pro-vaccine editor <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>, who with support from an identifiable alliance of editors, has been scurrying around Wikipedia deleting anything in sight to do with what he calls anti-vaccine information and takes over a page originally intended to set out the view of vaccine critics;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is simply a lie. I created the page de novo. Other pages have existed, one probably was created to set out hte view of a group who the author asserted were not "anti-vaccinationist" but "critics" and was deleted after WP procedure. (After several references to vaccine_critics and Ombudsman's changing the name of the existing page to vaccine_critics, I attempted to resolve this in a helpful fashion to anyone who wanted to read about vaccine critics by making a redirect to the page in question. <b>Redirects are cheap</b>. Anyone who wants to write vaccine_critics as vaccine critics and demonstrate a distinction is perfectly at liberty to actually do so, just undo the redirect.)<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 13:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>THis is discussed on the talk page, and is an asertion that could be tested by demonstration of the separate populations, which might well make a good addition to this or an article. Ombudsman asserts that he knows about this... but doesn't actually write about it or provide references. I think that it is untrue, but that it is <i>possible</i> to believe that he believes it himself <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 13:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>he then hijacks material which is not anti-vaccine but about ensuring what is in the vaccines are safe (removal of thimerosal/mercury vaccine additive), and dumps it here together with lots of other information which does not seem to naturally belong here;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That is another page. It is now two other pages. Both of them are IMHO quite good pages, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal.html" title="Thimerosal">Thimerosal</a> was poor before and is now an unremarkable page giving a good account of a chemical, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal_controversy.html" title="Thimerosal controversy">Thimerosal controversy</a> is pretty good also, and gives an account of the controversy. Leifern, whom I regard as unduly hasty, rude and insufficiently careful in rawing conclusions, as well as clearly having a deep personal feeling about THimerosal, did a good bit of page creation, which I believe he would not have done without my being<a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7Ebe_bold_3a70.html" title="WP:be bold">bold</a>. Credit me with an <i>assist</i> on that goal, and the paragraph and links the edits distilled into on the article in question is I think quite good.

<dd>I can only laugh at your characterization of my personality. You deleted an entire section of a relatively stable though highly controversial article, stuffed it into another article with a misleading title. That is far far far from the outcome. As for my feelings and motivations, I can only note that they keep being mischaracterized constantly. What I have made abundantly clear to you is that I believe the public has a right to make an informed judgment on thimerosal by understanding the full controversy. Any responsible physician would agree with me both out of moral conviction and legal necessity. It amazes me that you are indicting my motivation on that basis. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 13:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am a responsible physician. Your version of an article would be along the lines of "Thimerosal is bad and does harm in teh following ways. BTW, here is somethign abu its chemistry." We now have an article about its chemistry, which is quite good, we also have an article about the arguments over how bad it is and whether it does harm, which is an argument which has been assimilated by a population of people who wish to abolish all vaccination for a disparate overlapping collection of reasons, as well as - I think, and Leifern asserts - being used by people who are in favour of some vaccinations, or even all vaccinations, except if they contain deliberate or perhaps molecule-couting traces of Thiomersal. THe world is complex and fluffy - Lefern displays a tendency to being concrete. And should not assume that any Physician who disagrees with his ordering of data is not a responsible one. Not publicly. Not in WP. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 17:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would thank you, Migdley, not to put words in my mouth. And the controversy about Thimerosal is not about "molecule-counting." If the world is complex and fluffy (notwithstanding your baseless allegation of my "tendencies" - one of several ad hominems against me by you and others, I might add), then we owe it to our readers to present accurately the state of various controversies. Lumping all reservations against all aspects of vaccines under an article about anti-vaccinationists does not accomplish that. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 17:54, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Conclusion</b>: this page is a fraud and cannot possibly remain on Wikipedia. The anachronism of the alleged "anti-vaccinationist" movements of the 1800s have nothing to do with the concerns and criticism about the harms associated with the explosion in use of vaccines in the past 20 years for infants and under 5's. It is a gross mish-mash and babel.
<dl>
<dd>THere is a challenge and response - one can't say a dialogue - on the talk page headed "historicity". THere is a point in there. THe assertion above is not supportd by fact, and derives from the BMJ paper and other material. It would be possible, and perhaps interesting, to argue that there is a clear discontinuity - that argument has not occurred some people, having learned nothing from history, wish to condemn us to repeat it(mashing some quotations there.). <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 13:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes but this assumes that vaccine detractors only have concern for a single specific issue, rather than jumping on every possible theory (whether conventional conjecture/hypothesis or new-age alternativism) to dismiss vaccinations, micro-organisms as cause of disease etc. It also assumes that vaccines cause 'harm', something that the overwhelming majority of doctors, researchers, statisticians, epidemiologists, health policy advisors and governments across the world find no evidence for.
<dl>
<dd>- The meaning of 'harm' is here used to imply a generalised nature inherent in the procedure, rather than any specific individual's mild reaction, or very rare more serious reaction - one can reject a blanket view that 'antibiotics are harmful' (I've seen a couple of children nearly die from cellulitis due to parental disbelief of conventional medicine/antibiotics vs homeopathy) as separate from 'some people experience discrete allergic reaction to individual drugs'</dd>
<dd>- The proposition initial use of the phrase 'a group of medical contributors' might imply some equivalence in the numbers of people on each side of a debate. However anti-vaccinators are numerically a tiny minority view-point. Were it not for how vocal &amp; strident they were, nor the media's fixation with sensationalist reporting, then their views would not be notable to the vast majority and would be denied credence under WP's policy of not accepting trivial minority view-points. However this is clearly not the case and the media-sociological 'controversy' is notable and therefore should be noted within WP.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The vocal detractors do form an anti-vaccine (and anti-medicine) sentiment, even if one accepts that some only have single concerns rather than accepting entirely the general conspiracy belief. However the various web sites duplicate unverifiable, poorly cited non-evidence based references and manage to confuse journalists, and thus the public, neither of whom have a responsibility for critical-reading of pseudoscience's obscurification. Yes people are entitled to good quality information (after all it is reasonable to ask if everyone else is vaccinated what is the utility in the remaining individuals having a vaccine&#160;?) but this is what pier-reviewed journals, governments &amp; medicine generally seeks to do. With UK official estimates of over a hundred children dying as a consequence of poor uptake of Pertusis vaccine with no eventual proof found for the assertion it causes neurological damage, anti-vaccination movement is clearly real and posses a threat to societies wellbeing, however well intentioned individual anti-vaccinationists are. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 16:20, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for pointing this out, but it is a nonsense and instead of levelling accusations you should have sought explanation.</dd>
<dd>Contrary to your allegation, shooting first and then asking questions, you presume I have intentionally deleted text. If you take another look at the text you will see that there is a stub of text which would not be left by someone intentionally deleting votes:-

<dd>You will also see that I had been editing the page at the time.</dd>
<dd>I regularly copy and paste the text from the window as I edit to save it and can have several windows open at once. It is quite clear to me that a chunk of text has been deleted from a window with nothing intentional about it. Take a look elsewhere through all my edits and see if I have done anything like it. You will not find it because I have not. If I had deleted text intentionally, I would not have been banging on about my good faith.</dd>
<dd>Also, no one would deliberately delete for example <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>'s vote, the chief protagonist in the matter. That would be so obviously noticed and there were very few votes in any event and people will have pages on their watch lists.</dd>
<dd>You might like to look at this text of mine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABeddow_Bayly&amp;diff=37675714&amp;oldid=37620809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABeddow_Bayly&amp;diff=37675714&amp;oldid=37620809" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>] deleted in its entirety by <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>.

So kindly afford me the same courtesy and do not be so quick to accuse. It is done with monotonous regularity in these pages and it is so unnecessary.</dd>

<dd>I accept your explanation &amp; apology (I think) regarding the deletion, however:
<dl>
<dd>-I can't engage in dialogue if you are an anon user without their own user page/talk-page.</dd>
<dd>-WP normally posts a warning if I inadvertently engage in an edit conflict, does being anon alter how WP works for you?</dd>
<dd>-You had edited 4 times after CDN99 had pointed out the deletions without identifying your role in this and correcting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'm sure we can both accept we are never likely to agree on the topic of vaccination, but both 'sides' exist and can't in truth dismiss the existence of the other. Other topics are strongly argued over (eg Electroconvulsive therapy, but there is no denying that the detractors highlighted a very badly referenced article, and the debate improves the discussion of both sides, even if no final consensus yet reached). Is not POV/NPOV debate something for a talk page to reach a consensus (or at least agreement on where to disagree, e.g. abortion or contraception pages), rather than outright deletion? I think some of 'detractors' comments in the talk page have been very constructive, even if they clearly dislike having in principle an article that focuses on a (loose) movement. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 16:50, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>-&#160;:Comment: It is not based on a premise as given in the delete header. Leifern has not had sufficient time to read teh large collection of material already there, which probably accounts for that false meta-premise. It does assert that there is a commonlaity, a thread in history, and a collection of unifying themes whisch make this a social phenomenom of some note. It is interesting that some vry clearly identified members of the class are resisting attempts to describe the tendency they put signifciant effort into, and asserting that things are unknown or material does not exist, rather than adding or finding any. I'm impressed with Geni's demonstration fo good material in moments, if not with Leifern's apparent Google search - perhaps it was an inadvertent miskeying. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 04:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - this is a real movement (albeit perhaps loosely co-ordinated) as witnessed by any health worker who daily comes across the fear &amp; rejection of generally safe &amp; effective vaccinations by parents who are understandably reacting to the cynical nonsence targeted at them. To see the distress of a child then going through 3-months of whooping cough, or suffer perminant hearing loss that could have been prevented by MMR vaccination is an outrage, however some in alternative medicine would dispute that microorganisms cause diseases at all. Then again its only doctors/schools/health departments/researchers/government health-policy that try to be proactive and prevent this, but they are all in a financial conspiracy according to anti-vaccinationists whose concience need not be troubled by having to take responsibility.</li>

<dd>Whilst I agree that <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">vaccine controversy</a> links with this, the overall subject is too large for one article.

As will be seen in this article, the point-by-point demolishing of the anti-vaccinationists' pseudoscience requires great detail, that has been carefully collected <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECite_a996.html" title="WP:Cite">cited</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">verified</a> in this article.

<dd>I was quite surprised by finding out that there is an identifiable and articulated world view underlying what seemed to me to be total incoherent rubbish (note that this is complimentary and indicates an improvement in both understanding through researching and writing this and an increased iota of respect for the people with it). Given this underlying framework which I do not think is laid out anywhere in a form easy to understand even that it exists, it is to be presumed there is a common ancestral viewpoint back at perhaps the time of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pericles.html" title="Pericles">Pericles</a> to pick a random historical figure who might believe in spontaneous generation of life from rotting meat etc.</dd>
<dd>In order to understand the present day, and interpret the actions and beliefs of some people of a group which is definable though not crisply enough to saitisfy those here who behave as members of it, it is necessary to consider the past, in order for others later to understand it is useful to lay out a trail for them, and that looks to me like one of the better articles to come out of the one being discussed.</dd>

As <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> says, there is a group of editors (mainly Ombudsman, Whaleto, and 86.10.231.219) who concentrate strongly on adding anti-vaccination and other anti-mainstream medical material to Wikipedia. This is fine; it's a notable topic, historically and currently. What's not fine is the basis of those edits in frequent personal abuse, breach of NPOV, and openly stated bad faith assumptions about editors who disagree with them. For instance, check out the lists at <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a> and User:86.10.231.219. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 16:33, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>As a piece of logic, I would agree with you. The problem is that many (I logically can't claim all) who present as raising just a single critism have as their agenda outright banning of vaccinations, but realise that they are more likely to succeed by advancing in more reasonable-sounding small steps. Or to put it another way, for each point that one might argue against, another and then another point will be raised. Over the decades there has been concerted attacks against (?all) vaccination programmes with each 'supportive' study dismissed as being misinterpreted, biased or part of some corrupt government-medical-pharmaceutical conspiracy, and so the appearance is of a anti-vaccination agenda even if one accepts some individual detractors truely have just a single area of (reasonable) concern <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:41, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The proposition above can be improved upon. Try: " While "anti-vaccinationists" are critical to (substantially) all vaccines, not all those who are critical of some vaccines are anti-vaccinationists? " but I'd suggest inverting it - "While some people individually have criticisms of some aspects of some vaccines, vaccination in some circumstances, or aspects of vaccination policy, there have also been since 1798 and still are at the present day some people who work, commonly in concert against all vaccination with all vaccines in all circumstances. A factor frequently found among the latter is that they present their opposition as to some aspect or subset, whereas by their behaviour its scope is as described. Other common factors include the types and quality of argument advanced." I think that one is quite good, actually. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 17:37, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Be very careful about what you imply here, lest it sound like a conspiracy theory. There is no question there has been an anti-vaccination movement that categorically rejects the benefits of vaccinations.

<li>I quoted a phrase which is already in the proposition you are criticising. It is in there because when I wrote it I worked out what it needed to say.

<li>The page should be called <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_critics.html" title="Vaccine critics">Vaccine critics</a> like I suggested before you hijacked it, as anti-vaccinists (a better term, and used historically) are a subset of the larger group of vaccine critics, eg <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Yazbak_778e.html" title="Edward Yazbak">Edward Yazbak</a> is not anti-vaccine. And unless you have a page to vaccine critics there is no place for them on an anti-vaccine page. Was that your design, to eliminate 90% of vaccine critics? Also few want to be labelled "anti-vaccine" as it a label similar to "kook", so I can't imagine anyone saying they are anti-vaccine, even if they were. We can see your POV leading to that ie marginalising the radicals--- <i>"The first step in his strategy is to isolate and marginalize the radicals. They're the ones who see the inherent structural problems that need remedying if indeed a particular change is to occur. To isolate them, PR firms will try to create a perception in the public mind that people advocating fundamental solutions are terrorists, extremists, fearmongers, outsiders, communists, or whatever."</i>--John Stauber.

<dd>Your articles, John, are being attacked not because of their topic, but because they are selective and biased, and show you're making no effort to create the kind of broad-based biographies suitable for an encyclopedia. You merely pick the bits from articles favorable to your beliefs floating around on the anti-vaccination circuit, and make no effort to find other details (even simple stuff like birth and death dates that you can often find via Google) that fill out the biography in areas not related to your <i>idee fixe</i> about vaccination. If you started doing this, you'd be amazed at how rapidly the heat on you would diminish. 213.130.142.10 01:11, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If he writes about the larger group that criticise vaccination while regarding some vaccination as good, then we can see how the material sorts itself out and who remains in the smaller group who are against all vaccination and describe themselves variably as a tactic in argument. Come on John - there are two people here writing thousands of words many of which are about there being a group identifiable as vaccine critics - why not put a few on the page you say is needed? <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 23:28, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not quite convinced that the explanation of the Kano activity is actually anti-vaccinationism. It may be, but I suspect it is itself being used as a small ploy in a much wider dispute and conflict over power and influence - possibly along the lines of the West is bad: the vaccine comes from the West: therefore the vaccine is bad. To join that into a seamless whole with the current western anti-vax (if that is an uncontroversial label, of what is it a contraction?) would require exploration of the world-views - being done - and a demonstration that a substantial proportion not only retain an 18th century view of why milk goes sour and grapes become more interesting which is possible, half-asserted by John, but undemonstrated and gives me for one trouble swallowing since <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasteur.html" title="Pasteur">Pasteur</a>'s work is so easy to duplicate in the kitchen, but <i>crucially</i> have a burning and possibly "religious" desire to spread this to the rest of us.

<li>Yes, anthing except anti-vaccine, as I said above, it is just a ploy to elinminate 90% of the vaccine critics. Anti-vaccine is a kook term in general usage. If there was a page to vaccine critics or opposition to vaccination then anti-vaccine could be a sub page, but by itself it is being used to marginalise the radicals into a pen labelled <i>kook</i>, which is an old ploy. If that wasn't the game why did they change the name <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_critics.html" title="Vaccine critics">Vaccine critics</a> into this page?

<li>The viewpoint of the vast majority (medical, health policy) is of the terms anti(-)vaccination(ist)(s) (over 68,000 hits on Google.co.uk search for permutations) and my preference is for the term, in the same way one describes 'vegitarians' rather than 'opposition to meat eating', or 'pacifists' vs 'opposition to taking up arms'. The semantics are difficult here, for each choice has some POV behind it, and I am not sure are necessarily precisely the same things (eg concerns for excess red-meat eating as a risk for cancer is quite different from ethical/moral approach taken by vegitarians or vegans).<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:41, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firstly, it's a long-standing misconception that words are only valid if they appear in dictionaries (the long omission of <a href="../../../c/u/n/Cunt.html" title="Cunt">c**t</a> is a classic example). If they appear in the general corpus of written English, particular when repeatedly used in mainstream publications, they exist. As to the particular extent of "anti-vaccinationist", see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=38415619&amp;oldid=38413765" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=38415619&amp;oldid=38413765" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In the Times archive up to 1985, I find 31 hits for "anti-vaccinationist" (spread from 1833 to 1964) and 71 for "anti-vaccinationists" (1870 to 1962).

<dd>"<i>Anyone who has real trouble working out what defines an anti-vaccinationist (and why the Chief Medical Office of the UK is not an anti-vacciantionist because he thinks that we should vaccinate against Rubella, but not, routinely against Chickenpox, in 2005) then I suggest two things:-</i>
<dl>
<dd>* <i>1. Look at the tables and try to match beliefs to people;</i></dd>
<dd>* <i>2. describe a person here on the Talk: page, and we'll come to a delphic concensus on whether they are, or are not.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And by <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>'s definition of "anti-vaccinationist" The UK's Chief Medical Officer is an anti-vaccinationist because, according to this definition he objects on "<i>principled or other grounds</i>" to some vaccinations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As for the proposition <i>describe a person here on the Talk: page, and we'll come to a delphic concensus</i>? That is extraordinary. You mean it is not possible to tell from the definition? But I thought these people were identifiable and organised? And where do vaccine critics who are not anti-vaccine fit into all of this? They do not, but <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>'s definition includes them.</dd>
<dd>Further, it just will not be possible to get all relevant information onto just one page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size" rel="nofollow">Article Size</a>] but is that the idea? To restrict all further information because this is the one page for it all?</dd>
<dd>And this is not an excuse to create one page where all criticism of vaccines is to be dumped and marginalised? Difficult to agree that one.</dd>
<dd>As for accusations of "bad faith" not being a personal attack, I will bear that in mind and quote it if ever anyone accuses me of accusing them of "bad faith". However, I do not rate my chances of success too highly with that one.</dd>

<dd>Self-awareness should include understanding that when people come to conclusions, even wrong ones, there is usually some basis. I could suggest as a possibility that if someone has a hissy fit in public, issues threats and asserts another editor of a page one has a clear and declared personal interest in is a vandal, and then instantly lists for deletion a page of that editor when it is, to quote an also experienced editor above here "obviously not going to reach a consensus for deletion" that there is a risk that any or all of it may be taken as prima facie evidence of bad faith. If Leifern prints that out and hangs it on his monitor he will have a reminder of how a proportion of the human race think, and what conclusions they may draw from some possible acts. Now, as to the actual motives and degree of accuracy of the suggested deletion I think that is best left out of here, becuase it isn't relevant to the advice above. In the course of work I often find myself giving similar advice to people whose lives are less happy than many bystanders think they could be, and it is often rejected. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 18:46, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can only judge the actions that I observe on Wikipedia. Now, let's take your accusations:
<ul>
<li>Blanking entire sections of articles is listed as vandalism in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a>. There are ongoing debates as to whether it is vandalism only if there is evidence of bad faith, but I find it very hard to ascertain motivation here on this medium and in general. So I issued a warning that such behavior does amount to vandalism, and that it would be reported as such if it was repeated.</li>
<li>There is a policy in Wikipedia also against POV forks and articles with titles that beg the question. In your original version of the article, both these were fulfilled.</li>
<li>"Prima facie" means, quite literally, "on its face." In no way can my conduct be viewed as prima facie evidence. It could, I suppose, and with some imagination and ill will, be construed as "circumstancial evidence," but that is the exact opposite of prima facie.</li>
<li>I think the debate about this article has been useful and probably led to some improvements in the article itself. I don't know how many articles that are put up for deletion get deleted, but the advice of one "experienced editor" is not going to dissuade me from doing what I think is right.</li>
<li>As for what most of the human race thinks, I think our work here is to overcome prejudices and fallacies that we all succumb to every once in a while. A common one among mediocre physicians (as well as a few other exposed professions) is that they have a superior intellect to others, or that medical science has answers to most things. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:32, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, it is entirely consistent with what I have said all along. I have a son who I believe was poisoned - I don't expect everyone to agree with me, but I think parents have a right to make an informed decision based on full knowledge of the controversy. This is an entirely rational point of view. I made it clear why I thought your deletions were vandalism, and I warned you that they were. Because both you and Geni have a problem with orthography and remarkably congruent views and similar ways of expressing yourselves, I thought it best to ask. Geni has already had a (fully disclosed) sockpuppet before. Other than that, addressing me as "boy" is pretty disgusting, isn't it? --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:02, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This school *is* accredited by a Swiss Canton, which is the political unit responsible for accreditation within the federation. It is not sketchy, it's edgy - it is low profile by choice. Do you really think that the faculty who teach its seminars would teach at a scam institution? BTW, the institution was set up by Jean-Francois Lyotard. Anyway, more to the point, the U.S. gov't has also given some recognition to the EGS, and is not as sceptical as Oregon about its accreditation status: "According to Wallis (the Canton)university law, the EGS is regionally accredited by the Ministry of Education and grants recognized M.A. and Ph.D. (Doktor der Philosophie) degrees on the basis of the State Council decision by Kanton Wallis (Switzerland), from April 14, 1998. With the decision from December 12, 2000, <b>the United States Department of Education has determined that the European Graduate School satisfies the definition of an eligible institution under the Higher Education Act of 1965 and will be listed in the next edition of the Directory of Postsecondary Institutions published by the U.S. Department of Education.</b> The EGS School Code OPE ID Number is 03518300." <a href="http://www.egsuniversity.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.egsuniversity.org/" rel="nofollow">[39]</a><a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECognos_7ba4.html" title="User:Cognos">Cognos</a> 21:45, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The European Graduate School is an accredited institution. Oregon's arbitrary standards do not define what a legitimate institution is. The website itself also states, "PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WE HAVE BECOME AWARE OF SOME QUESTIONS AS TO THE ACCURACY OF THIS DATABASE. UNTIL THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED, PLEASE DO NOT RELY SOLELY ON THIS RESOURCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT AN INSTITUTION IS PROPERLY ACCREDITED." <a href="http://www.ossc.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ossc.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> And therefore cannot be used as a legitimate source of verifiable information. Even if it were verifiably accurate, Oregon's jurisdiction on its standards of accreditation do not apply anywhere else on earth, including the rest of the United States. The EGS is subject to high standards, its faculty and students illustrate this.-- jmark13</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I attend this school. I got a federal stafford loan to attend this school, because it is accredited and listed as an institution that the US gov't gives grants in order to attend. Yes, its low key and yes its out of the ordinary, but it definitely does exist and is a great school. I've also spoken to numerous people who have attended schools in Europe with a similar teching style: here are your reading assignments, see me at the end of the quarter. That's basically what this school is like, with the added benefit of having an online forum for students to converse. My class has students from San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Tel-Aviv, Vienna, Miami and lots of other places. I also know numerous professors at UCSD who have friends who teach at EGS. I also added some more links so that it has more content and is not just an ad. -- lotu5 At resist d0t ca / <a href="http://deleteTheBorder.org/lotu5" class="external free" title="http://deleteTheBorder.org/lotu5" rel="nofollow">http://deleteTheBorder.org/lotu5</a>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The school has a rather interesting concept, the professors who actually teach there (watch the videos) are beyond doubt, Switzerland has a strong reputation for providing a high quality education (not to mention the breathtaking mountains, chocolate and Swiss cheese), the school is operating successfully for several years, it is private however (which is not obvious in Europe) - and therefore it is quite clear that such a concept can be a thorn in the eye of some people. personally i doubt however, that other schools, wikipedia editors, or users will find a similar (high profile) faculty or such an innovative concept somewhere else. the article should be expanded instead - following the templates/models provided by other universities. As for the Baudrillard entry it must be said that the Baudrillard archive there is the most complete archive of Baudrillard texts i have ever seen (the other one would be the Baudrillard on the Web at www.uta.edu) deleting the link to the egs faculty page would actually violate the spirit of Wikipedia and is (at least in my eyes) a clear NPOV case. Philophob 18:26, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I also attend this school, actually i came from south america to follow the seminars with this great pool of teachers (if you happen to know anything about cinema or philosophy you will get blown with the names of people that EGS gathers) I live in Switzerland since i came to the school. I was very surprised by this topic but as someone said this is a very avantgarde model institution, inheriteing a lot from open source models of peer knowledge production so no wonder why few might get confused. Today its around 200 students. EGS is a one of a kind place and has a lot to show and develop from its potential, wikipedia is part of this peer2peer model of education and as far as i see it there shall be even more work on this pages, i will post on the student mailing list inviting them to come in and help improve the contents even with their student pages and their notes from classes as it should be keeping record from what many of what this great minds have said in our seminars and that might never get to be published anywhere else. I think there are already many other good reasons explained above so i will stop here, KEEP,&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo_a2e3.html" title="User:Alejo">Alejo</a> 14:32, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have nominated this article for deletion since it has a thesis and a theme (misconceptions about the shi'a). Essentially, it is a POV. I don't agree or disagree with it, I just don't see any reason for it to be it's own article. Hence I belive it should be merged into the shi'a article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The topic is valid, there are aboundant Misconceptions about the Shi'a, factualy verifiable.</li>

<dl>
<dd>For example, Shi'a do NOT belive Ali should have been the last prophet, BUT many people have the <b>Misconception</b> that Shi'a belive such a thing. It is perfecly NPOV to claim that people have a missconception in such a case. Another example is about people haveing the <b>Misconception</b> of Shi'a belivingtheir Imams as equals to the prophet. They do not belive that, hence it is NPOV to claim that being a Misconception.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Don't you get it? The reason for that is because this is the only article I care about. And I probably understand the site a lot better because I actually was there for about a year or so. I know what the inside things are, I know what the outside things are, and I know how to look at things without bias from there. It makes sense that this would be the only one I care about, because I was probably the most nationalistic (In terms of sites) person there, and probably will be the last one. So yes, 100% of my contibutions are there, and with reason. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.80.168.7 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.80.168.7.html" title="User talk:67.80.168.7">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.80.168.7_907d.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.80.168.7">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>"The insertion of any textual personal biographical information within an article which does not significantly add to the clarity or meaning of the article.

Like, if a person goes on, and sees a site, what would they want? What's it's purpose, how does it meet that purpose, does it have a second part to it (In this can a forum), and in this case, what has happened to that forum in the past. Maybe even what groups and clubs are on that forum.

<li>Just because it's not about you (I have no way of verifying that, BTW) doesn't mean it's not vanity. The fact that you're writing about something you're involved with is. That said, the problem here isn't mainly vanity, but the fact that the article contains massive amounts of information that is not verifiable and hence should be deleted.

<li>I have one. It's sbloemeke. I just don't use it much. And for your information, I have not been there since last May. It's not vanity to write about something there. And you know what? What is vain in that article? Anything? Give me a reference. Just because you were involved in something doesn't mean that you cannot write in a neutral unvain point of view. Reference something. Anything. Use your own logic. Oh, and if you want, why don't I just quote the number of views with the ratings of the movies/games. There's your source that they are popular.

Plus, someone might plausibly wikisearch or google Vergon 6 at some point, and in doing so should be led to the above list. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> <a href="../../../w/e/s/Image%7EWest_Virginia_state_flag.png_d884.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/1/1a/West_Virginia_state_flag.png/25px-West_Virginia_state_flag.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../w/e/s/Image%7EWest_Virginia_state_flag.png_d884.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Wales_2.svg_2e57.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/5/59/Flag_of_Wales_2.svg/25px-Flag_of_Wales_2.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Wales_2.svg_2e57.html" /></a> 17:22, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GFDL</a> requires no such thing.

If we are going to completely delete Butt Rock from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> then we must follow through with that line of thinking and delete all such references to terms not commonly recognized by the recording/music industry (including <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_Metal_e505.html" title="Glam Metal">Glam Metal</a>). Revisions to such articles where necissary (and to eliminate bias) would be a prudent course. It seams that the spirit and beauty of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is the ability to discover truth, not to be revisionist historians.

<p>Also, if we are going to eliminate terms based on derogatory nature we should review <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Sanchez_67e0.html" title="Dirty Sanchez">Dirty Sanchez</a>. Sincerely, --Radioflyr 16:53, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wow... Wikipedia seems like a great place for both of these definitions to exist. It would seem to me that some one doesn't "like" the term "Butt Rock", even though it is a commonly used term, and would seek to eliminate it. I don't like the term "middle class", but that doesn't stop it from being used and being a Wikipedia definition.</p>
<p>It is already included in the Glam Metal article, its not the fact that it is a derogatory phrase I have no problem at all with that, its the point that it isn't an actual genre of music as it is portrayed to be in the article, as mentioned it is written into the glam metal article (Along with other derogatory terms like "Hair metal" and "poodle rock"). - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 05:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And here's what you're not hearing me say (type); <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_Metal_e505.html" title="Glam Metal">Glam Metal</a> is <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_music.html" title="Metal music">metal music</a> and Butt Rock is not a synonym for <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_Metal_e505.html" title="Glam Metal">Glam Metal</a>. People refer to many bands who are NOT <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_music.html" title="Metal music">metal music</a> as Butt Rock even though many bands that ARE Butt Rock are also <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_Metal_e505.html" title="Glam Metal">Glam Metal</a>: <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_Metal_e505.html" title="Glam Metal">Glam Metal</a> has to be "metal", Butt Rock does NOT have to be metal. Nelson, Kiss, Led Zepplain and Night Ranger are just a few example s of bands that are NOT metal but ARE Butt Rock (see how creatively they avoid the term "Butt Metal""). I'm okay with merging the definition, but let's merge it with something that makes logical sense! Otherwise adapt your adendum to <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_Metal_e505.html" title="Glam Metal">Glam Metal</a> and let's move on with our lives. Moderator: I'm confident that both Deathrocker and I appreciate your time, thanks! --Radioflyr 06:02, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then show reliable links where bands such as KISS (Who have made Glam metal albums during the 80s and early 90s anyway), Led Zepplin (Who helped bring about metal), etc are considered as "Butt rock", aswell as butt rock being an actual genre.</p>
<p>The bands this article pertains to; Nelson, Poison, Warrant, Winger, Slaughter, BulletBoys, Danger Kitty (Now Metal Skool; a Glam metal parody band) are all considered to be part of "Glam Metal"... metal itself is a subgenre of hard <b>rock</b> anyway. You seem to be taking the extreme metal bands as the blueprint of what "metal" is about, when that isn't the case. - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 07:29, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1st is a random user complied list on Amazon, it isn't an offical list by the site. 2nd looks like another random blog 3rd has nothing to do with any of the bands mentioned in this article. 4th is a personal geocities site.</p>

Metal is a subcategory of Rock, therefor Rock cannot again be a subcategory of Metal (Rock/Metal/Rock?!). KFC's are a type of fast-tfood chain however not all fast food-chains are KFC's. Nelson is NOT Metal and neither is Bachman-Turner Overdrive. I would agree with you, deathrocker, that the links above are all personal opinnion however, Butt Rock is a word defined by its usage much like Glam Metal and Dirty Sanchez. Unoffical sources act to high-lite the fact that the word is commonly used by many people to include more than just Glam Metal. We should use Wikipedia to document how a new term is actually used in the English language, not to confine people to a meaning or definition that does not represent the broad usage of the word. If sources from a recording industry are what validates a term or genre then again we must remove Glam Metal from Wikipedia. I am not arguing that this is a genre, but a term in pop culture much like Glam Metal (no record producer in their right mind would ever use either to term to sell their records). --Radioflyr 06:03, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think it should be deleted on the assertion that it isn't a valid genre. It is still a term that is used to describe some bands or types of music. Maybe a statement that it isn't a genre would be in order, but having a Wikipedia article (read accurate) is very important for the term, IMHO. --Donander 06:49, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i><b>Strong keep</b>. Wikipedia has reported Current Events from the early days of its existence (that's why there's a link in the main navigation bar).

<li><b>Comment</b> - I hadn't really researched other regional current events articles, but my firm opinion is that these <b>should</b> also be deleted if they have not got anyone updating them. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a newspaper. The purpose of such articles is to put Wikipedia articles in the context of current events; but this is pointless if nobody maintains them. The uniform nature of current events pages means that it's extremely easy to recreate one if there's at least one person prepared to maintain it at intervals smaller than a month. I cannot believe that with its current world focus that <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_current_events.html" title="Chinese current events">Chinese current events</a> has not been updated since September. Even British and Irish current events have seen a story that made the first headline in <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> on February 2nd. The deletion of Current events in Cisjordan also establishes that you cannot justify this article just because others haven't been deleted yet. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 12:03, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - your comment that <i>Even British and Irish current events have seen a story that made the first headline in <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> on February 2nd</i> would appear to indicate that you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose and usage of the current events articles: there's no such thing as a 'headline' event - items are added chronologically, the more recent at the top. Regional current events pages are used for interesting news items which <b>exclusively</b> affect those areas - if they are of wider interest or ramifications they go in the global article. The items should be used to link to associated encyclopaedia articles. As I said, the arguments have not changed since the last AfD nomination, and I would commend a re-reading of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_British_and_Irish_current_events_c5de.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/British and Irish current events">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/British and Irish current events</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 13:22, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - forgive me for misunderstanding the ordering of the Current events article. It remains that one of the seven world headlines of that day was predominantly associated with the UK and no doubt has specific local consequences. It's beside the point though... the current article almost implies that Charles Kennedy is still standing for leader of the Lib Dems because of its outdatedness, and is confusing because it refers to days of the week as if it was documenting last week. I have read and re-read the previous AfD and there seem to be only two arguments justifying a keep. The first is that it will be updated; if this is the case then why has this not happened? Don't tell me that the Thames whale or the dissolution of Fathers4Justice don't fall into relevant topics for the article. The second is that the information documents past events in an encyclopedic fashion. Yes they do, but in this case they should not be labelled as current events. We should instead make <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_the_UK_b2b8.html" title="2006 in the UK">2006 in the UK</a> or a similar title, just as the Irish, for example, have done with <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_Ireland_6efb.html" title="2006 in Ireland">2006 in Ireland</a>. Take an outsider's view of the encyclopedia. This article makes it look bad. Why is it that we are so resistive to change? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 20:22, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I should also point out that the last discussion involved the statement, <i>"It will (we promise) continue to be maintained."</i>. That lasted five months. It's more important to focus on the core of the encylopedia and leave things like this to Wikinews if there isn't enough interest to keep it going. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 12:07, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Point of order</b>: I made no such promise. I offered help in keeping the page up to date. Nobody used the word promise except for Aaron. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 13:48, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - your words were "I will help to keep it up to date". That's a positive future assertion, whether or not it is to be interpreted as a commitment. I'm not criticising the fact that you haven't been able to sustain that assertion, which I understand, but that at least some people chose to support keeping the article on the grounds that they thought that you and others would. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 15:44, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am merely seeking to redress the fact that the comments in question do not support the statement you were seeking to base on the strength of them. Your latest statement, that people have voted keep in that debate on the grounds that they thought it would be maintained is somewhat misleading too. One user voted keep as long as it is maintained, but that vote made no mention of who maintains it or how often it should be maintained. The original discussion is there for all to read and draw their own conclusions from; there is no need to keep referring to facets of it. I would also hope it isn't too much to ask for some sort of apology for your interpretation of my words as implying a commitment when you agree no such commitment is inherent within them. I apologise if you feel I am taking this too personally; I merely happen to believe my words should not be presented as meaning more than they did. As I stated, <i>I offered help in keeping the page up to date</i>; your quotation of my exact words, "I will help to keep it up to date", supports that, and so I find myself unclear as to why you felt it necessary to quote my own words at me when I have already elucidated what I said, and when they are already on the record for all to see. Rather than get sidetracked into debating the merits and arguments of the previous discussion, would it not be better to allow this one to develop? My offer still stands: I am willing to help maintain the page. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 16:18, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But <i>will</i> you? Nobody makes any commitments on Wikipedia for which they can be blamed or incriminated for should they not honour them. That is the free nature of the wiki. The use of the word "promise" may in that sense be interpreted as such a commitment, and I apologise for such an ambiguity, which was made for the sake of quoting a past summary of the last consensus. It remains that "I will" instigates much more optimism than "I am willing". We are now in the position to look back at our decision, see that in spite of good intentions it has not proved practicable, stop trying to maintain that the content of the article is current and refocus our efforts on content that does not expire. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 16:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I appreciate your apology; as to anyone maintaining the article is current, I'm not sure anyone is. The page however, cannot be archived since we can't move it whilst it is up for afd. I'm also unclear as to how to split the page history into four pages, so that those users who contributed can be credited at <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2005_in_Britain_and_Ireland_4a55.html" title="October 2005 in Britain and Ireland">October 2005 in Britain and Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2005_in_Britain_and_Ireland_d754.html" title="November 2005 in Britain and Ireland">November 2005 in Britain and Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2005_in_Britain_and_Ireland_2c81.html" title="December 2005 in Britain and Ireland">December 2005 in Britain and Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2006_in_Britain_and_Ireland_f909.html" title="January 2006 in Britain and Ireland">January 2006 in Britain and Ireland</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 17:07, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article was created not as a serious reference article, but as a test of how quickly wikipedia's editting community would find and correct a non-noteworthy article being posted. The page was not meant to be referenced (hence no external links were given). It was not created by the subject (Mr. Lundquist), in fact it was done without his express knowledge, and was neither an attempt at notability nor an exercise in vain self-promotion. Now that it has been found and corrected, we consider our test complete and I the author am deleting it. <b>Delete</b> User:bfegan 15:55, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But shouldn't we just leave the up until the website fails? I mean, Haru-Sari is one of the more proffesional works out there. The artist is actually an artist by profession (she pencils and inks a published manga) and is planning to release a published edition of the comic soon.

<li>It would be a good idea to add that to the article then, since that is a case for real world notability. However, the link you have provided is a little ambiguous (and is from the micronation's own web site). It says "Awdal Roads Company is a completely separate entity from the Principality of Freedonia." and "A recent trip to Awdal by Jim Davidson and Michael VanNotten, of Awdal Roads Co., ended up involving Freedonia in a negative way. Some violence resulted, and many things in Awdal have been called into question." --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 01:47, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>P.S.

<dd>My understanding is that consensus of independent observers is that it wasn't Freedonia's fault, but that they were the triggering event.

The same editor was the author of the band members and Prays albums wikipedia pages also up for deletion. As stated on the "singer's" page (Adam Woeger-- up for deletion), he is using the internet as a promotional tool. Well, it looks as if Wikipedia is a part of it. A google search of "Adam Woeger" brings up less than 900 hits (including internet newsgroups and chatting). The other band member Paul Guffey (up for deletion) is even less notable. The page forks to promote individual albums In The Garden (Prays), Where He Leads Me, Living For Jesus, Very Christmas, Only Believe, Spontaneous Worship, In Your Presence, and Worship sampler (all up for deletion). Every single edit that adds information is the same person on every page linked here. Even the Category "Prays albums" is created by that person. This is pure vanity and self-promotion. A google search ("Adam Woeger" prays) brings up 150 hits. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 21:56, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Copied from Talk:Dante Ceccon:</i> This should not be deleted because Dante Ceccon has written and exposed many celebrities in a way that has not been done before. He asks many questions in articles which give readers a chance to think. For a junior writer he has contributed alot to the what I think Australian media by writing in such newspapers as The Courier Mail and Herald Sun. He also is passionate about humanity and should therefor be noted in this encyclopedia. He is no average joe but a great juior writer in Australia.</dd>

<li>Interestingly artsearchengine.com, while registered in the US, <i>is</i> registered to someone called Singh (KC Singh, not Amarjit) who gives a UK mobile phone (cellphone) number as a contact number.

<li><i>Needs</i> to be? I strongly dispute that. I see little if any encyclopaedic merit in lists of names of people who lacked the talent to be selected for a show which is, in the end, just a talent show anyway. In ten years time if the winners have made a name for themselves they can have an article. Why this pressing need to document every details of every TV show as it happens?

Dr. Weber my not be noteworthy enough yet I know; however, his continuing contribution to the sacred music major (i.e., making it a recognizable field) and his well known and award winning compositions, make his an influential musician in the church music of today.User:WeberC, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, a small wave of these AFDs against micronations, starting with the one <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">User:Gene Poole</a> founded and right after his apparently controversial Request for Adminship? There are only about six dots here to draw the lines between, and the pattern is sort of obvious.

<dd>The Irony here is that you two have started out by (<b>assume good faith</b>) accidentally hitting a bunch of the more notable and well known micronational pages, and Gene's; Gene has also been fairly active in trying to keep truly not-notable micronations (that truly are nothing more than just a web presence, etc) from getting pages or excess coverage in the main <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">Micronation</a> article.</dd>

<dd>I am not a micronation enthusiast; I don't belong to any and merely find it an interesting subject, combining aspects of small group and volunteer group dynamics with geopolitics and the evolving definitions of what soverignty means in the modern world. I have no problem with the premise that there are internet-only and non-notable micronations not worthy of WP entries. I believe that Gene would agree with that premise as well, and I think he's been actively working within the micronation article spaces to try and accomplish that, though from the standpoint of a micronation member/founder/enthusiast. Though personally involved, his NPOV seems to stay in good shape.</dd>

<dd>If this is indeed a serious interest in cleaning up the micronations section of WP, I submit to you that a bunch of AFDs are the wrong approach. I also submit to you that given the AFDs so far, there is an issue with identifying the level of notability of various articles. Purely in-wikipedia and google search sources aren't necessarily good enough. I suggest that engaging on say <a href="../../../m/i/c/Talk%7EMicronation_432b.html" title="Talk:Micronation">Talk:Micronation</a> to identify consistent and community agreeable notability standards is a good course, rather than continuing to AFD things. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:54, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The number of articles about it specifically and the number of articles that mention it while covering the overall phenomenon suggest sufficient notability.

This article (and the arguments given about its notability) seems a textbook example of why the Google test does not always reliably work to judge notability. I'm at a loss as to some of these nominations. However, suggesting that there's a vendetta brewing against micronations does seem to be stretching the point a bit, lets assume good faith. <small>Lar is saying "Keep" even though this <b>isn't a vote</b> because sometimes he fears his opinion isn't clear!</small> ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 05:35, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delete. This appears to be a vanity page for an unpublished (and generally, that should mean <i>not</i> notable) novella written by Christopher Levy (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigGuy219_ebf7.html" title="User:BigGuy219">User:BigGuy219</a>). This book could not be found on Amazon.com as a published work, and the article appears to have been created and largely edited by one anonymous IP. The writer has also done some edits on the page. Might be a great novel, mind you, but if everyone published a summary of their unpublished Great American (or Russian, or British or what have you) Novel, Wikipedia would be filled to the brim.</p>
<p>Additionally, a page called "doughboys" would more appropriately be used as a explanation of the WWI term for soldiers. The 1930 Buster Keaton film is also in wide circulation. Westwinds 23:43, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Whatever happens, I shall probably unilaterally replace it with a merge and redirect unless the article improves. It's an interesting conundrum really, because on the one hand we have this AFD debate, on the other hand we have a clear precedent that merge and redirect is appropriate for very small articles which are closely related to another subject and which have little chance of being reasonably expanded. Of course, I won't revert any such change if it's undone with a good reason stated in the edit summary. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 01:01, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If the consensus, as viewed by the closing admin, is <i>keep</i>, it would be inappropriate to unilaterally M&amp;R. The best bet, if the result is keep, would be to slap an expansion tag on the article to ensure that it is improved and expanded. If the final tally indicates no consensus, however, it would be entirely acceptable to M&amp;R and slap an expansion tag on the talk page, letting those that like the show know about the attention needed for the article.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>.

I'm shocked at the lengths some people will go to to claim neutrality while obviously consipiring to go on a highly-charged AFD rampage, as part of what seems to be some sort of wider vendetta. Perhaps <i>you</i> should show <i>me</i> where the record of the first failed deletion nomination was, seeing as you seem to know all about the fact that it was 6 months ago. As you well know, my link points to the second nomination, in January 2006, which is a good deal less than 6 months ago. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 01:48, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure that's a useful comment. I have found JzG to be a very thoughtful and hardworking contributor. He may tend to be a bit more deletionist than I am, but his nominations are always done in good faith (to assume otherwise is to in itself act in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a>, in my view) and are worthy of serious consideration, because he does not make them lightly, IMHO. Deleting truly <b>bad</b> articles is part of what makes Wikipedia <b>better</b>, even hardcore inclusionists like myself know that. (I already suggested keep on this one, after all) I believe this opinion of JzG and his actions is not just mine, because he recently was made an admin with over 100 supporting voices and little dissent. Sometimes his comebacks may be a bit acerbic if you bait him, but I expect he's a bit frustrated at how people have piled on him and <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">User:kingboyk</a> about the spate of nominations. Remember, people nominate things as they become aware of them, so there need not be a nefarious <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">plot</a> here, merely a raising in awareness. JzG reviewed the category and a number of related articles to thus get nominated. Perfectly natural, and quite useful, IMHO.
