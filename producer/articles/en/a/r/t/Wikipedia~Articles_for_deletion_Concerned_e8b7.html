<dd>Good Lord, man. <i>At most this article has to be modified, but certainly not deleted.</i> A really simple search on the Net from the comfort of your own computer chair will show <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a>'s high Alexa rating, and the print publications in which it's been featured. Not that the Alexa rating is all-telling in itself, but given the number of times I've seen it used as proof of a site's non-notability recently, I think it's worth mentioning. If you want to show notability, <i>first say the article needs it, but don't assume it's non-notable simply because you haven't heard of it personally and the evidence isn't immediately apparent on the single page you're reading.</i></dd>
<dd>Can you please stop calling for an article's deletion before you've done basic research on it? Can anyone reading this with more Wikipedia experience than myself tell me if there's any way I can highlight this user's behavior on this front, as a warning to other AfDs in which he is involved?</dd>
<dd><b>Comment to future admin</b>: due to the site's popularity, I fear an influx of just the sort of bad "keep" votes one usually gets for a popular website. I assure you this web site has been featured in worthy independent sources, which I (or others) will provide in short order. I just want to put this right up front so it doesn't get lost. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 21:09, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The articles referenced above are all print and therefore unlinkable (though I have physical copies and scans of all -- I still don't know the protocol for referencing print articles that don't otherwise exist on the internet). PCGamer UK - March '06 issue, 3/4 page article, Computer Gaming World -- January '06 Issue, 3/4 Page Article, PCZone - January '06 Issue, sidebar. Other possible reasons for considering Concerned notable -- it's the first and only, to my knowledge, Garry's Mod-created comic to reach and surpass 100 comics. Though, I imagine it's really a matter of opinion whether that is truly notable.--<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmydesk_b639.html" title="User:Notmydesk">Notmydesk</a> 22:51, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Whups, sorry, forgot some details. The article in CGW included two three-panel Concerned comics made exclusively for the magazine, and included the first sixty comics on their coverdisc for the January issue. The coverdisc for the March Issue of PCGamer UK included the first 100 Concerned comics.</dd>

<li><b>Improve Notability or Delete.</b> I'm looking around for some measure of notability. I found one: <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/profile.php?order=ranking" class="external text" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/profile.php?order=ranking" rel="nofollow">thewebcomiclist</a> has a viewership ranking, and Concerned ranks 258th. Seems NN to me. Since Concerned is primarily a webcomic, comparing it to something like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boondocks_9b6d.html" title="The Boondocks">The Boondocks</a> (which ranks 168th on this list) would be irrelevant as Boondocks is paper-based, and only recently adapted to the web. On the other hand, I think this article would be a great addition to <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia</a>. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 23:49, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Out of 5752 comics, I'd say that 258th is a respectable ranking, especially for a strip less than a year old. I can't find the methodology used to generate that list, though. <a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">Zompist</a> 23:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The measurement used by that site is a measurement of how many people click through to the comic in question via that particular web page. I don't think it has any more significance than those "Top 100 Sites" pages that people nominate themselves to and have a click war. At any rate, it's immaterial. The site clearly qualifies under criterion 1 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Lore Sjoberg 00:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You may be right, on the other hand, we would benefit from having something more tangible. All in all, aside from the hlcomics forums, you'd be hard-pressed to find information on this comic. Read my last suggestion from my previous post and tell me why you think it doesn't make sense.<a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 00:10, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't understand the significance. Why would whether an article would be good for Comixpedia affect whether a site is notable? Penny Arcade would make a good subject for a Comixpedia article, as well, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have a Wikipedia entry. Lore Sjoberg 00:17, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't. I made the suggestion so that it would be absolutely clear where I feel this article (which I had previously argued would be unsuitable for wikipedia) should eventually go. I appreciate you helping me try to understand the rationale behind a keep vote, but the question of notability still lingers. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 00:22, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Further up on this page, you can see the cites for at least two 3/4 page articles. 3/4 page is non-trivial Lore Sjoberg 00:31, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I saw that prior to writing the response. I'm not convinced that two 3/4 page articles and a sidebar are non-trivial. There is no language in the WP policy that is any more specific than that, so it really becomes a matter of personal interpretation of what triviality is. The argument has thus reached a moot point, and I stand by my vote. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 00:40, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It might not be well known in the Webcomic community, but it definitely is well known in the gaming community. Note that being 258th on the webcomiclist does not infer notability as someone suggested up above, all toplists are absolute junk, less reliable than Alexa. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 16:39, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A well known (for only a year of running) webcomic that is definately the best of all the current crop of Gmod comics. I wouldn't trust the Webcomics list ratings for viewership completely myself as a guide to how popular a comic or website is, considering that 'Weebls-stuff' appears low down in the top 100. - <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoyinabox_5ca5.html" title="User:Boyinabox">Boyinabox</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As mentioned, the web comic has been covered and has been (partially) included in several notable PC gaming publications, furfiling criterion #1 in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability</a>.
