<dd><b>Comment</b>: POV FORK page states that:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"POV forks usually arise when two or more contributors disagree about the content of an article or other page, and instead of resolving that disagreement, someone creates another version of the article (or another article on the same subject) to be developed according to their personal views rather than according to consensus."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is not POV forking about <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, since the article <b>was not created based in a disagreement in that article</b>. As a fact, the article North America has no debate going on. This article <b>was created to provide a link for the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Template%7ERegions_of_the_world_5158.html" title="Template:Regions of the world">Template:Regions of the world</a></b> that had a link to North America (as a continent). North America (continent) and North America as a region/subcontinent are two different concepts. North America as a region/subcontinent is a valid term used in Latin America, parts of Europe (including Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain) and Asia, under the single American continent geographical model.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This page should not be deleted because it deserves an article on its own, just as <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_America_%28Americas%29_6b83.html" title="Middle America (Americas)">Middle America (Americas)</a>, another region of NORTH AMERICA has its own. Middle America/North America are also regions within the Americas and both in the North American continent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the sources, this is <b>a new article (just 2 days old)</b> and I was working on it, <b>it was not completed yet</b>. I have added more sources now, as the AfD tag indicates I can improve the article. If this was the case for nomination, then you should have asked for more sources, not nominate it for AfD. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 18:22, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As stated above and below: of course it's a fork (regardless of recent additions), and the decision to nominate it well considered and not at all hasty. Nor was this article based on a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a>, since the North America article (as you put it) has 'no debate going on' -- so it isn't based on any agreements, either. While definitions of this and that may vary, I did not agree to the creation of <i>this</i> article. I defer to other comments herein. Corticopia 18:15, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I repeat, this article was not created because of a disagreement with the current article North America, so it is not POV forking according to its definition, nor it was based in "personal views" since the souces provided clearly indicate the existence of North America as a region. There is a WP policy called <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">Be bold</a>, so I created this article based in that and most importantly, to provide a link in the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Template%7ERegions_of_the_world_5158.html" title="Template:Regions of the world">Template:Regions of the world</a> that had no link to North America as a region, but a link to North America as a continent.

</dd>
<dd>With your phrase "I did not agree to the creation of this article", you want to give the feeling/impression that we were having a disagreement about North America, which is false and very low from you. We never had a disagreement about this theme. In fact, when we were discussing "Middle America (Americas)" and I conceded, we both agreed that there are several geographical models applied to the Americas.<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 18:33, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is your opinion -- what else would you call this but a disagreement? Read the very content you added about forking above. <b>There may be other models, but that doesn't mean creating a fork is at all a way to deal with the topic.</b> I may believe that North America is part of the American continent (particularly if you heed the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympics.html" title="Olympics">Olympics</a>), <b>but <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> should be updated instead.</b> Middle America is well-sourced (hell, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Middle%20America" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Middle%20America" rel="nofollow">pull out a dictionary</a>) and different. I will not respond to other notions in your prior comment. Corticopia 18:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As well, AC's recent source additions do not validate the article. In the <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reportinfo.asp?report_id=224821&amp;t=e&amp;cat_id=" class="external text" title="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reportinfo.asp?report_id=224821&amp;t=e&amp;cat_id=" rel="nofollow">Broadband reference (emphasis mine)</a>, for example, it notes "considerable variation [in networks] between the three <i>major</i> countries comprising North America: Canada, Mexico, and the USA." Read: <i>major</i> (in population, area, economy), while not discussing the minor ones that are also part of the continent. Corticopia 18:53, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When NA is defined as a region, it sometimes includes St. Pierre and Bermuda, as clearly indicated in this article. However, it is very important to note that the title of the study mention REGIONAL and it only comprises US, Can and Mex, proving that NA is also a region. However, there are more important references listed! <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 19:02, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This proves nothing: the title notes both 'regional' and 'country' and, as above, the content notes the continent. And you still have not reputably sourced when it <i>IS</i> defined specifically as a region -- if it is as you say, it shouldn't be difficult to cite. And this can still be incorporated into the bona fide article Again, straw man arguments don't justify this fork. Corticopia 19:37, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, as nominator. Corticopia 10:41, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Unnecessary duplication of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> article. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 12:47, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is enough evidence about the existing North American region/subcontinent in the geographic model that divides the Americas in North, Central, Caribbean and South.

<li><i>Comment:</i> so basicly I think you were hasty by nominating this article for deletion, since, according to you, it only "lacks references" but this doesn't "deny other continental models" (North America as a region is part of a model).

<dd>The real problem here is that <i>America Central</i> is not part of <i>Nortamerica</i> while <i>Central America</i> is part of <i>North America</i> and this a very subtle nuance of translations that gets missed by editors not paying attention to the details. So there's a lot of fighting going on across a few geography articles. Plus, for some reason there's a few <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> editors who really like <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifest_Destiny_e614.html" title="Manifest Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> so they go across articles changing the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a> to <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> and insisting they're <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">American</a>. Which pisses off that <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hoser.html" title="Hoser">hoser</a> crowd that's actually proud of our national identity eh? So emotions are high and there's one or two shit disturbers about.</dd>
<dd>Ultimately, encyclopaedias are bad sources. But not unusable ones.</dd>
<dd>So what we have here is a fork from a <b>very</b> similar but not quite identical article. Does this deserve a split? I have no idea.\</dd>
<dd>I hate the title - it sucks the sweat off monkeys' balls. But that's not an issue for AfD.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I honestly think what makes this not a POV fork is that the article was not created to split <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> or because of a disagreement with other editors in the article <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>.

I understand the issue of there being a geographical entity, the continent North America, and then a distinct geopolitical entity, the region North America (particularly in the context of Latin American politics). However I think the existence of a seperate article lends a lot of confusion to the issue, and it would best be served by some discussion in the main article rather than creating an inherently POV fork. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:13, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How can you outright dismiss concerns regarding confusion? The article itself states <i>Using this geographical model ...</i> with absolutely no attempt to explain <i>which</i> geographical model "this" refers to. The overwhelming consensus in the world is that the term North America refers to a continent as described in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> article. The issue of there existing an alternative, minority definiton of the term warrants inclusion in the North America article, but not a standalone entry of its own. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:30, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that North America is a subcontinent of America, the same as Central and South America. In my opinion, the word <i>Americas</i> is kind of confusing and does not reflect what everyone knows about the existence of only five continents in the world (without considering Antartica). History facts reveal the discovery of one sole continent, America. Besides, that happened in La Espaniola, Dominican Republic. We have also been informed of a most archaic term for America; the West Indies (or <i>Indias Occidentales</i> in Spanish). This applies to everyone and most importantly, everywhere. Cultural differences, however, have contributed to the separation of the continent once known as America. For instance, when most of southern United States was under Spanish and Mexican power and control, America still remained being the common usage among the people of this present area. We also make differences between Latin and Anglo-Saxon America, but, we must keep in mind that those terms comprehend a cultural ending, not geographical. Americas, in this sense, refers only to those regions of America that are separated by different types of things, such as language, economic development, culture, traditions, races, and society. In conclusion, I agree that North America should not be mistaken for a continent, when <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_of_America_5fed.html" title="Discovery of America">history</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> do not do so. The same happens when we separate Europe into Western and Eastern Europe, which does not mean that they ought to be considered as two separate continents, for the same reasons explained above. Nevertheless, my advice is to correct the already existent article, by putting subcontinemt instead of continent, and delete the present one or, ultimately, join both articles and make one out of them. --<a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGustavo86_a547.html" title="User:Gustavo86"><i>Gustave</i></a> - <a href="../../../g/u/s/User_talk%7EGustavo86_294a.html" title="User talk:Gustavo86"><i><b>May I help you?</b></i></a> 23:11, 2 March 2007 (UTC) PS: I'll copy and paste this message in North America article.</li>

<dd>Clearly the article is not clear enough on what you're talking about. If it were, it wouldn't be up for deletion. It's <i>very</i> confusing, and took me about ten minutes to figure out what the difference is. It's also poorly titled, as I stated a few lines above. It makes it seem as if you're referring to the North America in the Americas as opposed to the North America in Eurasia. The problem is that the article is <i>very</i> short, and needs to be beefed up. It makes sense that there are two main regions of North America: Central America and Mexico-north. So an article on North America (Region) is expected. Unfortunately, you can't put a lot of information in NA(A) that isn't already in NA, as that would make it seem <i>more</i> of a fork. Unlike Central America or Western Europe, which all have significant regional histories and specific qualities, NA(A) doesn't have anything that isn't already added into NA or the country articles. If there is something that truly makes NA(A) stand out from North America, add it to the article and prove me wrong. <b>--<a href="../../../m/p/d/User%7EMPD01605_77c2.html" title="User:MPD01605"><font style="color: #000099">M</font><font style="color: #FF0000">PD</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/p/d/User_talk%7EMPD01605_0e7e.html" title="User talk:MPD01605">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPD01605_89a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPD01605">C</a></sup></b> 02:31, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: there is a difference between a place's geography (countries, continental plates, etc.) and its social sciences aspect. i.e. what makes it a region such as interconnected economies, histories, cultures, etc. by virtue of its geography, not the physical geography itself.

It is a little light on information right now, but as already noted in another comment, the article is quite new.

In a way, that debate has spilled out into this. I have to say that this page, although perhaps unintentionally so, functions as a POV Fork, as it is based on general disagreements about the handling of pages on multinational regions with complex definitions. I think it's clear that North America is one concept, one idea, one article, with multiple definitions that must be resolved within a single article. To do otherwise would be confusing and a disservice to anyone trying to use either article for research. Who, after all, thinks of North America in two separate ways? Who says, "no, I meant North America the continent, not the region." It's one thing to be thorough, but it's another to overcomplicate a subject to the point of confusing readers. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 16:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>:You're wrong. The debate in Central America was not the inclusion of Mexico in the region (we know that physiographically/geollogically a southeastern portion of Mexico is in CA), but the inclusion of all the definitions in a very NPOV wording. That debate ended days (if not weeks) ago, and the result was the inclusion of all the terms in the usage section.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - <i>Language matters.</i> The other regions of North America have <i>different names.</i> It would be one thing to have an article called Northern North America, if people used that term, but no one does. The difference between North America (as a region consisting of the US, Canada, and Mexico) and Central America/Middle America is that the latter two aren't also the names of something else. What you're saying is that there should be a page for North America, as defined as a region of North America. Wouldn't it just be easier for there to be one page that states that "North America" is a term used to mean both a continent and a region consisting of the vast majority of that continent? If there is in total too much content for one page, then I could see a case for separate pages, but it would be easy to <b>merge</b> in all of the unique content of this article. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 22:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If you reach North America (the continent article) when you clicked on a link to a region, the continent page should definitely explain the use of the term as both a region and a continent, but I'm fine with that explanation, rather than an article that says "North America is a region of the continent North America." <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 23:32, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge/Delete</b>: I don’t think that there should be a North America (Region) article because I don't Think that there should be and article about Countries That Have Green In Their Flags. There should not be articles about arbitrary regions that incluse arbitrary countries with no similarities. And Mexico have little to do with US, beside its borders. There was an <i>old</i> division of the American continent that was thought in Brazilian schools with North America as Canada, Mexico and US. But nobody see this division been used anymore. The problem that I saw here is that people think that North America is the parallel to Latin America. The most <i>correct</i> way to divide America is the cultural division and <i>should</i> be Latin America (countries with Latin traditions or more specific <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_Peninsula_03ea.html" title="Iberian Peninsula">iberic</a> traditions) and Anglo-Saxonic America (countries with British traditions). The other way to split America is (or better saying, used to be) South America (with everything below Panama), North America (Canada, US and Mexico), Central America (with everything between Panama, including, and Mexico, excluding) and Caribbean (with every isle in the Mexico Gulf that does not belong to another country). The current concept of North America (as a synonym to Anglo-Saxonic America) came to simplify the term and with a discordance of Canada, that would prefer that it was called, Franco-Anglo-Saxonic America (and making this tradition interesting because France is also a Latin country), and making things even harder. So to make things easier to say, they call the Angle-Saxonic America, North America. The fact is that nowadays the world recognize two Americas, Latin America, including all countries of Spanish or Portuguese traditions (know to be a poorer America), and North America, that include Canada and US (marked by well developed countries). Truth is that Mexico have more to do with their Latin countries than with US. The entire Nafta concept is pointless in this discussion since it was created to flood Mexico with American products, increase the American influence in Mexico (collaterally sinking Mexico in deeper poverty) and have no cultural support. I think there could be a topic on the North America article about the old (geographic) division, like in a history topic, but creating a new article about it, is an overshot for a term that is no longer used. I think that there might be a national interest in Mexico to be seen closer to US, but political issues should not reflect in the Wikipedia content, by giving more importance to a subject than it should. <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvaroludolf_6389.html" title="User:Alvaroludolf">Alvaroludolf</a> 12:34, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I suggest that you read the references in this article. The argument that America as a single continent "was" a model not currently in use is false. It is currently still being taught (Latin America, some parts of Europe and Asia). Also there are several ways of dividing the Americas, geographic terms, geophysical terms, geopolitical terms and cultural terms. North America as a region/subcontinent is part of the single American continent, a valid and current term. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias">AlexCovarrubias</a><a href="../../../b/l/a/Image%7EBlack_ribbon.png_3e6f.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/3/3e/Black_ribbon.png/12px-Black_ribbon.png" alt="" width="12" height="18" longdesc="../../../b/l/a/Image%7EBlack_ribbon.png_3e6f.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="black">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 15:53, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I live in Brazil. No geographical division here are thought on geography classes (beside a quick note on the history of america, maybe), people on the streets might still talk about the old way but the press, new books and quality materials all talk about latin america because it makes more sense to divide Ameria this way. I still think that the old geographical division are in use in Mexico only to force a detachment to the rest of the Latin America.

<li><b>Delete</b> - no offence to the editors, but the article does in part read like a fork.

<li><b>Merge</b> I find it usefull. And... I see a bit of heat in some of the comments written so far. We should be discussing here with facts and proven issues, not opinions. The thing is this: The Spanish speakers (or as t has become custom to call us: "<b><a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">latin</a></b>os") have always been told that geographically, Mexico is part of <b>North America</b>. (Please... look at a map). No only us Spanish speakers in Latin America, but non Spanish speakers in Europe, Asian... Wow... now that I think about it, <b>its probably just the USA (and possibly Canada) the only countries stating that Mexico isn't part of North America geographically speaking</b>! We as Mexicans (I am a Mexican) do not <b>eagerly await</b> to detach ourselves from Latin America. The thing is... Latin America is a <b><a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic.html" title="Linguistic">linguistic</a></b> division, not a <b><a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographical.html" title="Geographical">geographical</a></b> division.

Therefore, by looking at a map, you might see that if you cut in half the entire continent of America, you might see that Mexico ends up in the same half as the USA and Canada. As wikipedians it is our duty to discuss matters not from points of view, but from stated facts. Really. We ought to stand higher than this. I say: use what's relevant and usefull from both articles and make a really good article about North America (including the fact that most of the world thinks Mexico is part of it). --<a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValdezlopez_f8bd.html" title="User:Valdezlopez">Valdezlopez</a> 02:55, 8 March 2007 (UTC)Valdez Lopez</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> The more I read this article, the more I find that it is a contradiction in terms. In <b>one sense</b>, it argues that North America is a region consisting of the US, Canada, and Mexico. In <b>another sense</b>, it suggests that some people consider Mexico not to be part of the region. This definition I find dubious and in need of a source. Furthermore, <i>if</i> the US and Canada are to be described as a region, then <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a> suffices for this purpose. Finally, in a <b>third and even more confusing sense</b> than the others, this article contends that North America is a <b>region</b> that includes Greenland and Bermuda. I find it hard to believe that anyone thinks of either of those when discussing North America as a region. They're much more in line with the idea of NA as a <b>continent</b> (they sit on the NA tectonic plate). Greenland and Bermuda seem to have been trotted out to justify the article itself, somewhat reminiscent of the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_of_the_willing.html" title="Coalition of the willing">coalition of the willing</a> ("You forgot Poland!"). So aside from POV problems, this article is flawed in its failure to clear up the distinction between NA as a region and as a continent. If this article can state that there are multiple ways of looking at North America, why can't the original North America article be tailored to do so? <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 16:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The issue, of course is that <i>when</i> Canada and America are described as a region, <i>North America</i> is the term used, in real life. Realistically, North America the continent is well defined, except around the fringes (for example, whether it includes all of Panada, or just until the canal). North America (the cultural region) really <b>is</b> more poorly defined, so you should expect any article that is free from original research to reflect this confusion. North America the cultural region includes:</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>America (always)</li>
<li>Canada (almost always)</li>
<li>Bermuda (Rarely explicitly, but usually)</li>
<li>St. Pierre and Mickey (As Bermuda)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Look at the article for <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a>.
