<p><b>Delete</b>: I am proposing <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basin_Groups_dc13.html" title="Basin Groups">Basin Groups</a> for deletion because it is not a geologic era of the Moon that is recognized by experts who work in this field. The geological timescale that is currently in use is discussed at <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_geologic_timescale.html" title="Lunar geologic timescale">lunar geologic timescale</a>, where there is no refernce to a "Basin Groups". The two external links for <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_geologic_timescale.html" title="Lunar geologic timescale">lunar geologic timescale</a> do not have any reference to this era either. Wilhelms' book (which is considered a major repsected work by the lunar community) does not discuss this era (it is not in the index terms), nor does the popular article (written by a lunar scientist) of Linda Martel. On the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basin_Groups_dc13.html" title="Basin Groups">Basin Groups</a> article, there are two external links that have been used to support the case for such a group, but neither are reputable nor verifiable. One page says that information will be uploaded later, whereas the other is a wiki, and I have removed the offending material! As someone who works with the Moon on a daily basis, I could add a number of primary and secondary references supporting my assertions here, though I think that the Wilhelms and Martel articles should suffice. I would be happy to add additional refernces if asked. It is quite possible that Basin Groups was at one time used as an informal term (though I have never encountered it), and if this were the case, we could discuss this at <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_geologic_timescale.html" title="Lunar geologic timescale">lunar geologic timescale</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 10:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

It would appear that the Basin Groups Stage is not in conflict with the existing <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_geologic_timescale.html" title="Lunar geologic timescale">lunar geologic timescale</a> as discussed in the Wikipedia. The Basin Groups appears as a refinement, namely a subdivision of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Nectarian_51c5.html" title="Pre-Nectarian">Pre-Nectarian</a> time, equivalent to Late Pre-Nectarian. As the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Nectarian_51c5.html" title="Pre-Nectarian">Pre-Nectarian</a> article indicates this was a time of basin formation on Luna. I note that the Wikipedia <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_geologic_timescale.html" title="Lunar geologic timescale">lunar geologic timescale</a> article also does not reflect the Cryptic Stage, <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptic_era.html" title="Cryptic era">Cryptic era</a>, that covers the earlier portion of Pre-Nectarian time.

<dd>GeoWhen is not a reputable source. It is self-published. This is clear on the introduction of the web site, which says "Welcome to the GeoWhen Database, an attempt to sort out the mess that man has made of the geologic timescale. This project aims to reconcile the international stratigraphic standards with many of the regional and archaic naming schemes that appear in the literature." <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 10:32, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Concerning the Harland book, I will look this up in my library asap, as the online version of the book is only partial, and says nothing about the rationale for using these eras. In any case, none of my geology or planetary geology textbooks use these eras, and I can not find reference to this in my file cabinet of scientific articles or pdfs either. As an active scientist in this domain, I can honestly say that these eras are not used by even a minority of the terrestrial and planetary communities. (Again, if you want a list of books and reveiw articles, tell me.) I also point out that it is scientifically unsound to "paste" geologic eras from the Moon (or any other celestial body) into the Earth's geologic history. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 11:02, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

If it is in that timescale, then it is worthy of mention. There is nothing wrong with saying that the terminology is uncommon or archaic in the article, and it certainly isn't part of the current ICS timescale, but those things by themselves do not justify simply pretending the terminology never existed.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-mainstream concept. WP:FRINGE appears to discourage this type of article. If this term exists due to an actual controversy in the field that could be carefully documented, it might be worth keeping on that basis.

Whether GeoWhen is reputable or not is irrelevant for the "reputability" of <i>Basin Groups</i>. Whether Basin Groups is an official selenochron (or "reputable") is irrelevant. If it is a scientific term used sometimes, the article should be kept. If it's not a geochron, it should not be used in geochron templates, but the article can be kept. If it's not a selenochron it should not be used in selenochron templates, but the article can be kept. It's a very very <b>odd</b> conclusion, that since it's not an official part of this-or-that time sequence, it can be removed - it can most definitely <b>not</b> be removed, whether we like to use it or not. It would be a <b>very bad thing</b> if it be removed. The term is used, and therefore it should be kept. Regarding one of the "reputable" sources mentioned as not mentioning <i>basin groups</i> – Geologic History of the Moon, Don Wilhelms – it mentions <i>basin groups</i> at <a href="http://ser.sese.asu.edu/GHM/ghm_platesx.pdf" class="external text" title="http://ser.sese.asu.edu/GHM/ghm_platesx.pdf" rel="nofollow">Plate 6A</a> (page 11 in a PDF viewer), bottom of the page – not as selenochrons, but as deposit layers.

<p><b>Amendment to AfD nomination: Figure of Harland et al. is inconsistent with their discussion in text.</b> I have just read the Harland et al. book and have discovered the following: In the text, they advocate using the lunar geologic time scale for the Hadean which includes the Imbrian, Nectarian, and Pre-Nectarian. Then they cite Wilhemls (1987) to subdivide the Pre-Nectarian into Cryptic, Basin Group 1, and Basin Groups 2-9. However, in their figure, they do not include the Pre-Nectarian epoch, but instead only include the subdivisions. Based on their text, I can only conclude that this is a <b>typo</b> in their manuscript. Anyone who has cited their typo (fortunately, there are very few!) have simply propogated a typographical error.</p>
<p>Concerning the subdividing the Pre-Nectarian into "Basin Groups", it appears that Wilhelms did indeed suggest this. However, this is only informal, and none of the USGS geologic maps of the Moon use this notation. Indeed, from Wilhelms (1987,p. 145) he states: "This volume divides 30 pre-Necarian basins into 9 age groups (table 8.2). Each group is headed by one basin whose relative age seems to be well established by crater densities or superpositional relations. Additional basins are tentatively placed in the groups on weaker grounds."</p>
<p>I continue to support the nomination for deletion on the grouds that "Basin Groups 1-9 and Cryptic" should be replaced by "Pre-Necarian" based on the Harland et al.'s own words. The fact that these subdivisions were used instead of Pre-Nectarian appears to be a typo. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 17:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Withdrawl of AfD nomination:</b> After talking to a few terrestrial geologists offline, I am going to withdraw my nomination for deleting "Basin Groups" for the following reasons: First, it appears that the Harland et al. book is so respected, that even if they did make a typo in their summary plot, or even if they did not understand the lunar geologic time scale and made an serious error in representing it, it doesn't matter, and its too late. Second, I consider the inclusion of this period in the terrestrial geologic time scale to be a case of bad science, and wikipedia can play a role in correcting this by presenting the mainstream view among terrestrial and planetary scientists for why this period should be abandonned. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 15:23, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
