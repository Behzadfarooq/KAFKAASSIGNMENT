<p>--Cantor Victor Beck 02:39, 25 May 2005 (UTC)===Discussion=== Let's set the record straight shall we? 1) This is not a vanity article. I didn't even know that it existed till someone sent me the url to see it. 2) I've just opened an account here for the first time a few minutes ago. 3) If you really intend to do research, then you need to expand your horizons beyond the confines of Google. For example, you might try checking with the U.S. Library of Congress. There you would find copies of all the original music that I have written, plus all of my recordings. You would also find Airchecks (recordings) of all the "ASK THE RABBI" radio shows. All of this material was submitted to the Library of Congress for Copywrite protection. The Library of Congress accepted, and Copywrites were issued for all of the materials I submitted. You could also check the archives of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for my song "NEVER FORGET ME". You will find not only the music, but my recording done with a 40 piece orchestra, as well as the story of how the song came to be written. I am afraid that if you validate the world around you only by what you can find on Google, then you are doing yourself a great dis-service.</p>

<p>As I recall, Reverend Cantor Victor I. Beck voted "Keep" in the same hysterical manner as all the other sockpuppets in the Very Reverend Cantor Lawrence Eliezer Képecs VfD. Was that a different Reverend Cantor? Was he lying when he signed as you, O Most Highly Notable Very Good Singer Reverend Cantor Victor I. Beck? Or are you lying now when you say that you "just opened an account here for the first time a few minutes ago"? As I recall, I went to the Very Reverend Cantor Beck's website and got his email address and phone number, which I posted in the VfD discussion there. It should be a very small matter to go get that information once again, and this time to actually call the Most Highly Reverend Cantor and see what he has to say about this whole thing in person. I'm disgusted and appalled at the level of chutzpa you exhibit, O Dear High and Mighty Sockpuppet Maestro, and I suspect he would be as well. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 00:16, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's again set the record straight and this is the final time that I will demean myself to stoop to your level. 1) I DO NOT LIE. NOT FOR YOU OR FOR ANYONE ELSE, AND CONSIDERING THAT YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT ME YOU HAVE INCREADABLE GAUL TO MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION 2) You demonstrate the level of your ability and the value of your judgement regarding being an editor by the way that you attack and threaten me with your personal attacks on my privacy. You dare to blackmail me by threatening to publish my home contact information? If this is the kind of action that is condoned on Wikipedia then I think the world should be so informed of the lack of integrity in this online publication and it's editors. You are a disgrace to the publication and any honest people who may be involved. I can also assure you that I do not take kindly to threats and any actions will be dealt with in a definitive, strong, and forthright manner. Now would be the appropriate time for you to try and prove that you are not a sniveling coward hiding behind your screen image and offer a proper apology. --Cantor Victor Beck 02:39, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently, Dear Reverend Cantor, you fail to realize that if the VfU on Lawrence Eliezer Képecs is successful, this PUBLIC DOMAIN INFORMATION, which you erroneously believe to be "private", <i>will also once again become public</i>. If you'd read more carefully, you'd notice, I've ALREADY published this information, which I got DIRECTLY off the REAL Cantor Beck's (horribly designed) website, as I explicitly stated when I posted it the first time (along with citations). Your flailing attempts to impugn my character do <i>nothing</i> to establish your credibility, nor that of your master, Merlin. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:34, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh...and I think you're looking for "incredible gall", not "increadible gaul" (ink-readible french perhaps?). (Why you wouldn't just use a perfectly good word like "chutzpa" is beyond me, unless as some have surmised previously, you're not even Jewish...) "It's" is a contraction for "it is" or "it has", the possessive form of "it" is simply "its". Demeaning yourself and stooping to my level, even if it were somehow possible to "stoop" up to my elevated level, are the same thing. Nothing is served by repetitive tautological redundancy. Publishing public-domain information in public hardly qualifies as "blackmail", look it up <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackmail.html" title="Blackmail">here</a>. Wikipedia is not a publication as such, and even if it were, you, as a purported editor do far more to lower its standards than I have ever done, even at my drunken worst. I have not threatened you, nor am I interested in leveling threats against you. As a sockpuppet, you don't have a leg to stand on, and so you're clearly at a disadvantage, since I have two. Not to mention two hands and a functioning washing-machine. (AND SOAP!) As I have no screen image, I don't see how I can be charged with hiding behind it, but I sincerely think perhaps you should consider the wikipedia policy <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> before you call me a "sniveling coward". Until such time as I do something requiring an apology, however, I recommend you not hold your breath, as none will be forthcoming. As for your apparent illiteracy, as I recommended in the Képecs VfD discussion, you might do well to get a different box of crackerjacks. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:54, May 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just in case you really are interested the radio show "Ask The Rabbi" was heard in 17 broadcast markets around the country every Sunday morning by approximately 3/4 of a million listeners. Among those markets was New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Boston, Orlando, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Seattle. We were also heard by approximately 28,000 listeners on the internet. At that time internet broadcasting was a brand new technology. I do not need to validate my life to anyone. I am quite comfortable knowing the work that I have accomplished, and that I have been priviledged to have had the opportunity to have a profoundly positive effect on the lives of a great many people. If I were to accomplish nothing else of note the rest of my life I can be content with what I have done.--Cantor Victor Beck 04:38, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a singer myself who helped contribute to this article, though I admit my voice is not as good as these three cantors. What does it hurt you so much to keep it? I liked Kepecs' article and Krupp's equally as much. It shows what professional cantors are really involved with, besides being "prayer leaders". They are typically involved with community events, charitable causes, helping others, teachers, and trying to help the world reach a higher spiritual level at the same time. The whole purpose of the trip to Rome was to build bridges between many fighting factions. The orthodox condemn the conservatives and reform in Judaism, and vice versa, and in the past there was not such a good relationship with the Vatican, as there is now. This trip brought everyone together for a common cause. It was so powerful an event. Cantor Beck, Cantor Kepecs, Gary Krupp, and Cantor Barnoy were essential figures in trying to bring about world peace. Do you know what that is?? It's a noble cause, and should not be condemned, but rewarded. I wish we had more people in this world like these three superior cantors and the Commandatore who "make good things happen" in the world we live in. And I am not a sockpuppet. You apparently have an article about him so I guess he is more notable in your book than any of the aforementioned cantors. Ask yourselves, do you want the world to be a better place, or a worse place. --Rigoletto1 12:04, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>You apparently fail to grasp what is going on here. Wikipedia is not a biographical catalog of everyone who has ever tried to do anything any- and everywhere. <i>Nobody</i> is either condemning nor demeaning these men's trip to the Vatican, nor is <i>anyone</i> saying that they shouldn't be rewarded. A vanity article in WP, however, is <i>not</i> a reward, it's a violation of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia's biographical articles policy</a>. As for the orthodox condemning the conservative and reform and vice versa, not only is this a caricature, but <i>utterly irrelevant to either this discussion or to the article</i>. BTW...I don't think the world is going to be "a worse place" if this article is deleted, and I think if you think about it for a split second, neither do you. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 14:55, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I am a student at the seminary where Cantor Beck and Cantor Kepecs are teachers and on the Board of Directors. The seminary is in New York - and yes, it is the same Cantor Beck who has a place of residence in Arizona - and yes, is possible for someone to have 2 residences. I am not sure why there is any confusion as to if it is the same Cantor Victor Beck. I am a bit confused as to why anyone would mention that the article on him violates any rules of this site as when I went to examine the rules of biographies it clearly states that biographies can be included if they meet the criteria of: "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia's biographical articles policy</a> Cantor Beck is a person who achieved renown and notoriety for his involvement in the seminary, his trip to Rome, MOST OF ALL - his outstanding and remarkable career. He is also recognized as an exceptional Cantor who will most certainly become a part of the enduring history of his field. The same can be said of Cantor Kepecs whose artwork is respected and appreciated. As far as the trip to Rome, I don't understand why the urge to delete this "newsworthy" event. It was reported on CNN, NBC, CBS, Newsday, The New York Times, and the official Vatican Website - just to name a few. I don't think that any of these media sources would carry anything un-newsworthy. On another note - the IP addresses can be similar if they are set up to the same modem. As this is a school, we are all connected to the same network.--Rabbi2b 15:32, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
