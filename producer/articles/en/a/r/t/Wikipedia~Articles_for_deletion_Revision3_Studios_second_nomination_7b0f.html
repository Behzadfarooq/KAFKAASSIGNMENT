If you came to this page because <a href="http://www.digg.com/technology/Revision3_Wiki_Entry_Tagged_for_DELETION_" class="external text" title="http://www.digg.com/technology/Revision3_Wiki_Entry_Tagged_for_DELETION_" rel="nofollow">this posting on digg.com</a> told you to come and "tell this idiot off" and to vandalize the nominator's user page, please <i>don't</i>. Despite what you may have been told, it is <b>not true</b> that everyone who shows up to a deletion discussion gets an automatic vote just for showing up. The deletion process is designed to determine the consensus of opinion of Wikipedia editors; for this reason comments from users whose histories do not show experience with or any contributions to the project, including those who sign up for accounts after the discussion started, and especially those whose only contributions are vandalism, are traditionally given less weight and may be discounted entirely. You are not barred from participating in the discussion, no matter how new you may be, and we welcome reasoned opinions and rational discussion based upon our policies and guidelines. However, ballot stuffing is pointless. There is no ballot to stuff. This is not a vote, and decisions are not made purely upon weight of numbers.</div>

Revision3 now has Jay Adelson as a CEO (Apparently Fouder and Chief Technology Officer of Equinix, Inc. according to <a href="http://krose.typepad.com/kevinrose/2005/05/revision3_systm.html" class="external free" title="http://krose.typepad.com/kevinrose/2005/05/revision3_systm.html" rel="nofollow">http://krose.typepad.com/kevinrose/2005/05/revision3_systm.html</a>).

<dd>To add to that, a google search for Revision3 should be for the keyword "Revision3". It is not fair to google search for "Revision3 Studios" when it is not the commonly used form. A search for "Microsoft Corporation" brings up 10% of the results that "Microsoft" does, for example.</dd>

<li><b>Evidence</b>. For those of you people who don't have a clue as to the popularity of Revision3 Studios....

<li>Diggnation (one of their weekly podcasts) is currently #12 on iTunes - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Itunes_screen_digg.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Itunes_screen_digg.jpg" rel="nofollow">screenshot</a></li>
<li>Now as I have stated before, it is often difficult to state exact figures on the number of downloads per podcast, as often these are distributed via bittorrent (which is very difficult to track) and the podcasts end up all over the net with various other sources distributing it.</li>
<li>As I have said, also, the host/s of this show have featured on <a href="../../../t/w/i/TWiT_94b2.html" title="TWiT">TWiT</a> at least once (and in most cases more). TWiT is the number one podcast on the internet and has been at the top of the iTunes charts for a long time. They are a technology podcast and only feature people who are interesting and are well-known (i.e. this podcasts' host). That in itself should be enough to justify its popularity.</li>
<li>Another thing I'll post is a link to a post on <a href="http://www.digg.com" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com</a> (a social bookmarking site). Basically the number of 'diggs' is how many people have clicked to 'digg' it and is an indication of its popularity. See an example of a digg article posted for this podcast here: <a href="http://www.digg.com/links/Diggnation_Episode_12_-_September_15,_2005" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com/links/Diggnation_Episode_12_-_September_15,_2005" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com/links/Diggnation_Episode_12_-_September_15,_2005</a></li>

<li>People Think that if an article survived VFD it Stays for Good and can't be nominated again but still any article could be nominated again if the user thinks it should be.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I presume you're talking about me. I'm fine with re-AfDing an article, but not without a reason to do so.

<li>There was no evidence it was encyclopedic then, there does not seem to be any now. It's not a vote, it's a discussion.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. I have yet to see good evidence of notability posted here. Diggs.com "diggs" should be discounted here <s>as it is Revision3's site</s> and can't be taken as impartial. The fact that some of the principles on this site have been featured on <a href="../../../t/w/i/TWiT_94b2.html" title="TWiT">TWiT</a> is totally irrelevant. Looking at the google hits, by and large the results returned are either mentions on sites owned and run by Revision3 or various blogs and message boards. A mention of an ABC news story on a website run by a Revision3 affiliated person isn't very compelling evidence either. I listened to a whole segment about <a href="../../../4/1/9/419eater.com.html" title="419eater.com">419eater.com</a> on <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPR_8c1a.html" title="NPR">NPR</a> one morning but I don't see anyone citing that as a reason for them to have their own wiki article. Kevin Roses' blog entry is just that... a blog entry. Not good evidence of notability. The CNET article is the only piece of decent evidence that has been provided showing anyone in technology is independently writing about this company... but one article does not establish notability. Diggnation seems to have a moderate level of popularity, but are you trying to argue that the notability of the product confers notability back on the company, everyone involved, and the company's other auxillary products? I think that is a rather tenuous argument and that doesn't support inclusion of 90% of the material in the article, even if one accepts it. Looking back at the previous AfD, it appears there were quite a few first time voters who have not been very active outside of that vote. Rather than vote on this based on the previous AfD, I'd ask editors to look at this AfD based on the merits of the arguments and evidence for and against deletion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:19, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should be noted that digg.com is not a Revision3 site, although to make it clear, Kevin Rose is a common party involved in both some running of the digg website as well as some running of Revision3. He is not a whole part of either. "Diggs" are an indicator of popularity voted by internet users, rather than the people who run the site.</li>
<li>Mentions on 'various blogs and noticeboards' immediately serve to show the popularity of the company in the eyes of the internet public, which is what is being measured here.</li>
<li>Diggnation, Systm and thebroken all have a large amount of popularity. If they are all produced by the same group of people under the same umbrella, it makes sense to post them under the one umbrella on wikipedia rather than clutter the namespace unnecessarily. --<a href="../../../k/y/e/User%7EKyelewis_5db9.html" title="User:Kyelewis">Kyelewis</a> 07:22, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Digg.com isn't owned by Revision3, so I've stricken that part of my statement above. It still can't be seen as totally impartial though as KR is involved in both. I understand that how the voting works, but there is an obvious potential for conflict of interest via cross promotion, vote stuffing, etc. I'm not saying these things have happened, but the potential is there and it is enough that I'd discount this as a piece of evidence.</li>

<dd>I don't accept your argument that mentions on various blogs and notice boards serve to show the popularity of the company in the eyes of the internet public. It simply shows the popularity among a subset of people that frequent these particular message boards and blogs. Scanning through google hits it appeared that where the result was relevent to this actual company, many entries were repeats of threads from the same message board. There are lots of topics that get this sort of chatter among a subset of the internet, but that doesn't make them notable to the general public or even to the larger subculture.</dd>
<dd>Finally, are you suggesting then that the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebroken.html" title="Thebroken">thebroken</a> article should be deleted and replaced with a redirect to the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revision3.html" title="Revision3">Revision3</a> article so it appears under the same umbrella? I would disagree with that. In fact, I would argue that <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebroken.html" title="Thebroken">thebroken</a> is the only article that should stay (as it is the only product that appears to have a true level of notability and Revision3 should be contained to a one sentence mention in that article as the producing company.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:30, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Which is interesting, because I would probably see thebroken as the least notable of the Revision3 in terms of overall internet popularity, given it's limited run of 3 episodes and slightly more niche programming content. I'm going to have to leave my argument there, because I unfortunately don't have time to continue to find more evidence and arguments. At one point, people didn't think of "Revision3" or "Rev3", they instead thought about the specific content, "Systm", "thebroken" and later "diggnation". It probably was not until Revision3 started taking major sponsors and memberships that people were thinking about the company name itself. You can't buy a "systm" or "thebroken" membership, you buy a "Revision3" membership to see early content. Obviously, I have no numbers to confirm quite how many people have done so. In this way, I would see Revision3 as popular for systm and thebroken in the same way I would see <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rooster_Teeth_Productions_5d51.html" title="Rooster Teeth Productions">Rooster Teeth Productions</a> as popular for <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red Vs Blue</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Strangerhood_5c4e.html" title="The Strangerhood">The Strangerhood</a> --<a href="../../../k/y/e/User%7EKyelewis_5db9.html" title="User:Kyelewis">Kyelewis</a> 20:44, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In order to verify the iTunes ranking you'll have to see it for yourself in the iTunes program. There doesn't appear to be an offical apple listing of podcast rankings. However, some more popular podcast sites rate diggnation as <a href="http://odeo.com/listen/top-40" class="external text" title="http://odeo.com/listen/top-40" rel="nofollow">#2 on Odeo</a> and <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com/top_podcasts.php?num=50" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastalley.com/top_podcasts.php?num=50" rel="nofollow">#19 on podcastalley</a>. Sure these aren't official and they are likely always changing, but thats as best as I can verify it without using iTunes. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">Malo</a> 23:53, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
