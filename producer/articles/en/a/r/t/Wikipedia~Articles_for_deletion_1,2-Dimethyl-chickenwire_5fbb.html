<li>It's a joke. I've <i>made</i> this joke. (Well, mine was <i>tri</i>methyl-chickenwire, but let's not quibble.) It's an old joke, too. I made this joke when I <i>last</i> went by this pseudonym, some ... er ... several years ago, and even that wasn't the first time. Nor am I the origin of the joke. Much as I enjoyed this particular instantiation (including the molecular mass!) I regretfully say <b>Delete</b>. This is not quite <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiotimoline.html" title="Thiotimoline">thiotimoline</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:35, 2005 Jan 25 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> When I first heard this joke, Kennedy was president. (Of course, <b>I</b> heard it as "dibromo-trichloro-chickenwire." Along with benzene rings with "MD" radicals attached to it for "ortho-docs," "para-docs," and "meta-physics." And periodic acid, don't forget periodic acid (sinusoidally oscillating pH). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:25, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I like it, though. I looked for a while on the web for sites that one could upload a chemistry joke without a) it getting mixed in with other jokes and b) where you don't have to pass it through someone's email account .. in other words you can add it without adulteration. The only one I've found so far is at <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/10429/gather/jokes.htm" class="external free" title="http://library.thinkquest.org/10429/gather/jokes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/10429/gather/jokes.htm</a> . Unfortunately, no images allowed here. Perhaps you can convince Dr. Helmenstine to add the joke to her <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/cs/weirdscience/a/blmolecules.htm" class="external text" title="http://chemistry.about.com/cs/weirdscience/a/blmolecules.htm" rel="nofollow">Molecules with Strange Names</a> page on About.com. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 2005-01-31</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, 1. Google is not the appropriate place to search for this compound, but gave at least three hits for me (e.g. for 2,3-dimethyl-chickenwire, but this is probably just an alternative numbering scheme). 2. There seem to be indeed some "obscure" molecules in that article, but 1,2-dimethyl-chickenwire is obviously one of the real ones. 3. Professor Nick D. Kim, <b>does</b> have a publication on it, it's linked to in the external link section. It was published under his pseudonym ("Nick"). 4. All chemical data given for this particular compound is correct, I have double-checked it. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacycle_6f2f.html" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> 23:19, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep somehow</b> Yes it is a joke but maybe a significant historial joke. I heard Prof. Woodward, the organic chemist, make it 40 years ago. He was refering, ironically, to a chemical synthesis involving a multiplicity of aromatic rings. In a way it perfectly describes a whole category of multicyclic molecules and as such is a valid simile.

<ul>
<li>It turns out that this kind of compound made it in a chemistry <a href="http://chemmovies.unl.edu/chem_source_pdf/organic_chem.pdf" class="external text" title="http://chemmovies.unl.edu/chem_source_pdf/organic_chem.pdf" rel="nofollow">textbook</a>, p.28 (ethylmethyl chicken wire; together with <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes_Benz_58af.html" title="Mercedes Benz">Mercedes Benzene</a>). Hence the votes based on "nonnotability" are moot. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 07:40, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Er, what votes would they be, then? The only vote that mentions notability at all is GRider's Keep vote. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:50, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, my search revealed the mainstream usage of the "chickenwire" term in chemistry and <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanotechnology.html" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>. Hence the joke has serious connotations, confirming its notability. I guess most voters should have taken a refresher course in organic chemistry. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 07:40, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Many of the voters appear to know more about organic chemistry than you think. They know enough to immediately recognize a long-standing organic chemistry joke (one of several) when they see it. Here's a refresher course: Repeat "Chemists have senses of humour, too." to yourself several hundred times. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:50, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That I've already learned while surfing the web. Therefore I am baffled by the vote. A long-stading joke deserves some respect. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 15:23, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We aren't discussing whether it deserves respect. We are discussing <i>whether it deserves an encyclopaedia entry</i>. And, as always, that involves answering the two questions whether the encyclopaedia needs an article by this name and whether the encyclopaedia needs this actual article itself. The joke clearly doesn't deserve the encyclopaedia article that it has here. Even if one doesn't read the deletion policy, one just has to look at BJAODN to deduce that Wikipedia has a pretty evident <i>long</i>-standing policy of not including hoax articles. That answers the second question. It's also inappropriate for the encyclopaedia to have an article (other than perhaps a redirect) by this name, which should be clear from the fact that three different people <i>here alone</i> know the joke by three different names (and there is a potentially infinite number of variations on the joke â€” such as 1,1,1729-trimethyl-chickenwire for example). That answers the first. What people have proposed now is, essentially, creating a <i>wholly new article</i> under a <i>wholly new name</i>. And as long as <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a>'s concerns about not simply re-creating <i>this</i> joke article again are addressed, that seems like a reasonable course of action. But that doesn't change the fact that <i>this article</i> by <i>this name</i> should be deleted. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:45, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC)

<li>In fact, this page points at a deficiency of the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">Joke</a> article, It is full of silly jokes, but lacks professional jokes (I am speaking not about profession-targeting jokes). This chickenwire may be a seed of it. I am surprized that people are happy with <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit_happens.html" title="Shit happens">shit happens</a>, but uprize against an elegant, professional, but clear to everyone joke.

<li>Yes, I have already collected all Google-indexed webpages that mention chickenwire in a chemical context and will make an Chicken_wire_(chemistry) article that will be about the joke as well as of the use of the term in at least two other chemical contexts. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacycle_6f2f.html" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> 09:51, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
