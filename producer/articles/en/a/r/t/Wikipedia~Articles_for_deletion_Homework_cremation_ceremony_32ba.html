<li><b>Keep</b> - this event is being extended into further schools and a DVD is being produced this year to help gain recognition of the event. However, the school does not endorse this activty yet for obvious reasons. *Note* the DVD this year is being produced on a larger scale (50+ copies) and word of mouth will help it gain in significance. Also, have some levity with this; if the page is kept, it will become a common meeting place for kids interested by the idea. Also, contrary to popular belief, we do not burn important documents - only busy work. <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwirk88_dc0a.html" title="User:Twirk88">Robbie</a> 22:12, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> - I don't think this event is exclusive to the Spanish River High School in Florida, since I've heard of other schools doing it in my area (Puerto Rico). Hell, I used to do it with some friends back in my school days. That aside, I doubt a subject like this deserves an article, and a single event in one school doesn't meet the notability standards. I mean, what next? Should I create an article of how a few schools in my area celebrate their last school day? And I'm not even mentioning that this article doesn't have any references or sources...&#160;;-) If this information is deemed keepable, then consider merging it with <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_River_Community_High_School_30e4.html" title="Spanish River Community High School">Spanish River Community High School</a> -<a href="../../../m/t/m/User%7EMtmelendez_3e38.html" title="User:Mtmelendez">Mtmelendez</a> 22:00, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable, made-up holiday. Also, imho, the students should be forced to attend school during the summer to totally rewrite (NEATLY and CAREFULLY) all the homeworks they burned and if they won't do that, or if the redone homeworks earn a lower grade than first time round, they get held back a year. Perhaps then they will understand the importance of respecting homework - yes, that's right, even so-called "busywork". just my two cents. actually, why don't I write a strongly-worded letter to the Spanish River High School board of governors right now. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

Mtmelendez the article doesn't have references or sources, because it was started today and is still being written. It is a blatant <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignorance.html" title="Ignorance">ignorance</a> not to check the history page and vote per your IMHO that the students should rewrite their homework. This user is a newbie (check his contributions), <b>dont bite</b> by deleting the article he started.

<li><b>Comment</b> Blatant ignorance? Right, OK. In fact, the more I read the article, specially after some expansions made by the creator, the more I stand by my argument. I strongly agree with <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> (see below) that this is a classic textbook example of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">WP is not for things made up in school one day</a>. Maybe instead of keeping this article just to make a "newbie" happy we should just talk to the new user about the WP guidlines for creating articles and coach him/her into making better ones. I think THAT's the best way to improve wikipedia. But I don't know, I guess I'm just a blatant ignorant. <a href="../../../m/t/m/User%7EMtmelendez_3e38.html" title="User:Mtmelendez">Mtmelendez</a> 14:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or merge</b> - Non-notable, original research, vanity page. I know things like this are common, but this single event by itself is not notable or encyclopedic at the moment. In addition, wikipedia is not the place for original research or publication. Perhaps if it were referenced from a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> source then there might be something here. Otherwise, if there is an existing article on similar event trends, it could be merged. Also, Ackoz- do not cross out other people votes, they are votes and you should not retract them because you think their points are not valid. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFallsend_7484.html" title="User:Fallsend">Falls End</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFallsend_4192.html" title="User talk:Fallsend">T</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fallsend_ce7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fallsend">C</a>) 22:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is clear that these arguments are not valid, stating that in your humble whatever the students should spend the holiday writing is not an argument about the article. I crossed out the votes because the editor of the article is new, instead of welcoming him to wikipedia and educating him on the <i>rules</i> about notability, these fellow editors just <b>bite</b> and add stupid comments about students to their arguments, presuming that the editor is a student himself. I concluded, that it will better serve wikipedia, if I cross out those votes and welcome Robbie on WP than anything else.I acted according to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. <a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckoz_4ac0.html" title="User:Ackoz">ackoz</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" /></a> 23:01, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Great, another brilliant person waving <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> around as if its an all-powerful excuse for anarchy which justifies whatever the person wants to do regardless of the wikipedia community. Ackoz, please re-read <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> carefully and note especially the part about <b>improving and maintaining the quality of Wikipedia</b> (i.e. as an encyclopedia, since that is wikipedia's crucial purpose) - this of course includes the correct functioning of the afd nomination process. So by crossing out votes, Ackoz is not acting according even to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, but he's crossing over into vandalism <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> despite ackoz's insistent dissent, there is no notability asserted, and the facts asserted are not verified or sources provided. How can a 50+ only production run of DVDs raise the profile of this event sufficiently for it to deserve its own page? If and when this does happen, it can be recreated. As at the moment, this is a localised and non-notable school ritual that does not belong here. More people got on my train this morning than have attended this event in its existence by the admission of the editors, but I don't create the page Travelling from Nerang to Robina Station on QR CityTrain service UG06 every morning, do I? For it is as equally a non-notable event. I earnestly wish you every success in promoting your event, but come back when you have succeeded.
