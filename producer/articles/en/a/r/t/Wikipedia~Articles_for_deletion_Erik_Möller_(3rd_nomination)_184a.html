<p>The secretary of a charitable not-for-profit company, who once self-published his own non-notable book. Of course, expect a wave of 'keep' votes as this is the exec secretary of the Wikimedia Foundation! If Moeller were on the board of trustees of any other NPC, the article would have been deleted within five minutes of creation. We should be striving to <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">avoid self reference</a>, not ignore our own policy because the NPC this guy is secretary for happens to be the one that is behind Wikipedia. If anything, we should have higher standards. Please, look beyond the fact that this man is an editor of Wikipedia, and consider that whether or not you believe the assertions of notability - secretary for a charitable not-for-profit company, and a book that appears nowhere except for buried in a website for the German National Library (not bookstores, <s>not amazon</s>, nothing). <small>note, it's on amazon.de</small> The article has been deleted in a previously AFD found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Erik_Moeller_207a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erik Moeller">here</a>, but was recreated after Moeller attained the secretary post, and despite being tempted (as it's not significantly different from before) to delete it under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">CSD G4</a>, I brought it here instead.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikimedia is not "any other NPC", but a fairly significant one.

<li>Although my feelings here are quite mixed, I think it ought to observed (which observation Bramlet himself probably makes) that the proposition of Proto that <i>this article would exist if Moeller were secretary of any group other than Wikipedia</i> and that of Bramlet that <i>any secretary of a similarly significant NPC should be kept as well</i> need not to be understood as contradistinct; it is quite possible that the Möller article exists principally because of our knowledge of and familiarity with him but that an article about any similarly-situated secretary/board member ought to exist as well. I wonder whether it might be useful to remember the oft-repeated injunction of <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> that the absence of articles apropos of a given topic ought not to be construed as evidence of the non-notability of such topic (I recognize, though, that Proto doesn't make such argument here, but others may). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The Executive Secretary role is largely irrelevant in practice; it's the Board member role which I spend most of my volunteer time on. By now we have 7 Board members and we'll probably have 9 soon, so being a Board member of the Wikimedia Foundation is no longer as significant as it used to be e.g. when Angela and Florence were elected to the Board. NB: This is all volunteer work. And yeah, my book is available in stores of course, but its total print run so far (two editions) is only 4,000 copies.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 09:30, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nope, the criteria requires coverage <i>about</i> the subject for a reason. The article is supposed to be about the subject, and coverage about the subject lets us write an article about them. (I'm sure this is discussed somewhere in the archived history of WP:BIO's talk pages, but WP:BIO was established before I became an editor. It is also visible in essays like Uncle G's one on notability and <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a>.) A publication where they are a source lets write an article about whatever they are talking about, assuming that they are a decent source.

While the book and articles don't appear to meet <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> for academic notability, they are enough, IMHO, to make your notability broader than just the Board membership and thus worth more than a redirect. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 13:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I also thought I should mention that the book is held by three college libraries in addition to the German National Library<a href="http://worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/61219000" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/61219000" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Certainly its obscure but not quite as obscure as implied by the nomination. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 13:50, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the decision makers at the world's most important source of information. That alone is sufficient, but there are also enough press mentions and personal accomplishments to justify an article. It would be nice if we had bios on the board members of every corporation/public organization worldwide. That will take time, but for now there is nothing in WP:ASR that precludes this type of article. Wikipedia has nothing to be afraid of. Our standards are fine, the problem is getting people to write/edit articles (as opposed to longwinded AFD nominations + comments and other assorted blah blah). --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:54, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> as per arguments above. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 01:27, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
