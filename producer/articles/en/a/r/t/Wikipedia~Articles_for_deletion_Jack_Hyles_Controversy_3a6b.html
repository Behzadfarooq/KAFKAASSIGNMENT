<li><b>Comment</b>, looking over the main <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Hyles_12fe.html" title="Jack Hyles">Jack Hyles</a> page, it appears this POV fork is the result of edit wars there. <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a> is only appropriate in reference to large articles that will benefit from branching off. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Hyles_12fe.html" title="Jack Hyles">Jack Hyles</a> is barely a stub and this fork appears to be an "out of sight, out of mind" attempt to avoid confrontation.

<li><b>Keep As-Is</b>, The <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Hyles_12fe.html" title="Jack Hyles">Jack Hyles</a> Wiki was originally hijacked by a small and dedicated group of anti-Hyles persons who want everyone to think that their accusations are "significant to this man's ministry" and that they are "well sourced and referenced". Their constant vandalism of the main Jack Hyles Wiki caused a wiki-war. A consensus solution was reached whereby this fork article was created. This solution is consistant with Wiki guidelines on article forking (POV fork) which states, "<i>As Wikipedia articles grow, they often need to be segmented, or branched, into manageable parts. This is an accepted premise for forking an article, and the nature of that split more often depends upon consensus — e.g. a "Criticism of" article may be justified if there is enough (or going to be enough) material to justify a separate article...</i>" Go ahead and delete this article and merge these outrageous accusations into the main Jack Hyles Wiki, but you will surely enter right back into the wiki war again, which no one wants. - GeorgeS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, again... this seems to be a fork that is there strictly to create an "out of sight out of mind" scenario. The main article has not grown enough to merit a fork. To quote POV fork: <i>"The generally accepted policy is that all facts and majority Point of Views on a certain subject are treated in one article. As Wikipedia does not view article forking as an acceptable solution to disagreements between contributors, such forks may be nominated for deletion."</i> As I said above, if the criticisms of Mr. Hyles are If these claims are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and can be legitimately sourced without being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, they should stay in the article and anyone who initiates an edit war by repeatedly deleting material should be warned and then banned if they continue. Conversely, if the criticisms are not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> then they do not belong on Wikipedia at all and anyone who repeatedly adds this information should be warned and then banned if they continue. Forking just to keep 2 opposing sides from having to work together is, in my opinion, not a supported reason for a fork and is bad precedent. You kids will have to learn to play nicely together.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:57, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply to Comment</b>, The point is that we came to a consensus solution here and most seemed to be happy with it, and most thought it was an equitable solution and it ended the wiki-war, or at least it was a temporary "cease-fire". The truth is that there is equal Wikipedia guidelines for BOTH positions (deletion vs. forking). The forking solution will work; deleting this fork will only add fuel to the fire on both sides of this issue. From the last wiki-war, it's apparent that banning IP addresses is not the solution, since both parties seem to have an abundance of methodologies at their disposal for avoiding such control schemes. Please allow me to ask for YOUR solution to this problem-- allowing the anti-Hyles people to place their extremely biased and unproven pet theories and character assassinations on the main Jack Hyles Wiki is NOT a solution that will work without major challenges. The majority of the anti-Hyles editors have proven time and time again that they CANNOT write in a Neutral Point of View on this subject. -GeorgeS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Wikipedia doesn't allow POV forks, you should familiarize yourself with the resource. If something is sourced and murder allegations are part of his past it should be included on the main article. Just because his supporters disagree that doesn't give them the right to take it off the page as it never happened. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 04:13, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Arbustoo, perhaps YOU should familiarize yourself with the resource. A fork is clearly acceptible when there is enough material to support it. (Try reading the comments above and checking out the Wikipedia guidelines on forking) AND WHAT THE HECK is this stuff about "MURDER ACCUSATIONS"?? See folks, this crowd just keeps piling on false accusation on false accusation, tell a lie long enough and eventually it makes it into the Wiki. That's crap, sir. - GeorgeS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>There is not enough material to support a fork in this case, neither article is anything like big enough for that. Addition of rubbish is not a reason for forking (otherwise we'd have hundreds of articles on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W_Bush_83e6.html" title="George W Bush">old smirky</a> by now) - and addition of verifiable material offensive to fans of the subject is equally not grounds for forking. Merge what is verifiable, and if necessary apply protection to prevent addition of unsubstantiated allegations. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span></a> 00:37, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<p><s>*<b>Keep it here</b> Well, all I can say is that if you rabid Hyles-haters don't abide by Wikipedia's rule of Neutral Point of View, you're edits will be deleted asap; and placing your own personal web site as a "source" is not valid, neither is an obscure rant from a lunatic's blog a valid "source"... if you have valid sources from accepted media or news outlets, that is what makes a solid Wiki. Personally, I think it's a waste of your time, since most of you have proven that you are incapable of writing in NPV style and all the time you spend posting obviously biased trash will be deleted in time due to your non-compliance with Wikipedia policy. -GeorgeS</s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small></p>
