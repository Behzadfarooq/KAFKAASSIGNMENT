My previous statement, though, still stands - a link to the articles, if you can find one offsite (i.e., not so COI-ish), will do wonders for the references.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is merely a <i><b>proposed</b></i> guideline.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Nobody is trying to force the deletion here. This should be quite evident from the discussion that is taking place since this AfD was closed with a <b>Delete</b> consensus. Just because <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is not policy yet does not preclude it from being used as notability criteria. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyluke_155b.html" title="User:Luckyluke">Luke!</a> 07:00, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> Two sources have been provided (I won't restart the discussion of whether two sources counts as "multiple") but they need to be checked for validity first. I am very concerned by the small number of Google hits for something that you'd expect would be overrepresented online. Also, not all sources are equal -- without seeing the sources, I would be willing to guess that these are tiny blurbs in a "News of the Weird" section or something like that. I agree with this quote, from the deletion review: "Is there no end to the overweening vanity of these "seduction community" people? The whole business is vanity built on vanity built on vanity." --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:34, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Instead of guessing, why not look up the sources and actually find out? (See list of sources below.) Is it so much to ask that people review the sources before voting in an AfD instead of just following their preconceptions? With Google hits, I am getting <b>22,600</b>; maybe that's small to you, but it isn't to me. As for the subject of vanity, I've already acknowledged in the earlier AFD above that "Part of the problem is that people affiliated with the company have often engaged in vanity-type whitewashing of the article." Yet disruption from those people doesn't mean that a balanced article cannot be written on the subject. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 02:22, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> I have looked up the sources. The two sources provided are copied (probably illegally, but that's not the point) to the RSD website and seem only to be available there. I agree that they don't appear to be "News of the Weird" items, but since the context is gone I can't be sure. Incidentally, simply searching "real social dynamics" may return extraneous sources; I searched it with names of the founders and found very few hits. And the comment on "vanity" was not meant to be a valid argument for deletion anyway, though the possibility of a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> has not been ruled out. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 02:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Thank you for reviewing the sources. The Edge Magazine article isn't only available from the RSD website; there is a link in my previous comment and on the talk page of this discussion. You say that the "context is gone."

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would like to review the sources for this article so we can all be on the same page in this discussion. Some of the editors above either haven't reviewed the sources, or aren't addressing all of them. They might have just missed my comments on the talk page, and on the talk page of the closing admin. Here are the prospective sources for the article:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-1766167_3,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-1766167_3,00.html" rel="nofollow">Times</a> article</li>

<li>The Men's Health article (not linked to, though the text is available from the publication section of <a href="http://www.realsocialdynamics.com/news.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.realsocialdynamics.com/news.asp" rel="nofollow">RSD's website</a>)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.mensmagazineonline.com/mastering_the_game.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.mensmagazineonline.com/mastering_the_game.asp" rel="nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> article (here's a link to a website that archives the magazine since it is now out-of-print)</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Magazine_f460.html" title="San Francisco Magazine">San Francisco Magazine</a> article<a href="http://www.sanfran.com/content_areas/home/view_printable.php?story_id=1306" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sanfran.com/content_areas/home/view_printable.php?story_id=1306" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>; it's only a paragraph, but I think this is nontrivial coverage, because it discusses the appearances of instructors for the company and it characterizes their methods:</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">But then, eerily, I run into two guys from Real Social Dynamics, another local pickup group that hosts trainings every weekend. I watch as the short, unshaven guy with an annoying accent and his friend sporting black nail polish and lots of jewelry—classic peacocking—approach two Scandinavian-looking girls who have already been hit on by PickUp 101 guys. I’m with Daniel, one of Mason’s assistants, and he explains how their techniques differ, as if they’re from a rival kung fu school. “We don’t try to entertain the girl as much. They’re acting like it’s a club in the middle of Union Square.”</td>

<dd>The Times article doesn't mention RSD by name (it mentions Tyler Durden running a seminar, which can only be RSD), so let's throw it out for sake of argument. I agree with with an above comment that not all sources are equal, so let's say that <i>The Game</i> and the San Francisco Magazine article together are worth about one source (<i>The Game</i> is good for notability but not for verifiable information on the subject; the San Francicso Magazine coverage is non-trivial but admittedly small). Still, there are two other sources for the page: The Men's Health article, and the Edge Magazine article. The burden is on voters for deletion to explain how these sources are inadequate. None of the voters so far have done so. <a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">User:N Shar</a> above "guesses" that they are "tiny blurbs in a 'News of the Weird' section," but admits not having read them. Yet if you read them you will see that they are both men's magazine articles (<i>not</i> "news of the weird") which both have RSD as the main subject.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> How could I have reviewed the sources? They weren't linked to. As for their reliability/applicability, the two cited on RSD's site seem good, though the context is now unavailable. The other sources have been critiqued by other users, and in general do not satisfy the criteria because they do not feature RSD as their subject. As I've said above, not all sources are equal. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 02:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> What I objected to was the way you seemed to have judged the sources as inadequate prior to reviewing them.

<li><b>Delete</b>, on account that the article seems rather spammy. If it can be rewritten and the sources (above) included (are they <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> and establish <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>?), I'll likely change my mind. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 05:57, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I'd advise all editors to check what version of the article they are reading. Because various editors are constantly editing it, either massively cutting it down and in the proccess removing claims of notability and sources etc... Or adding large quantities of unsourced text about their methods. These combined forces lead to a very unstable article. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup></li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> The notability of this article is not questionable, because <i>The Game</i> is usable as a source to establish notability (it just isn't a good source for facts on the company).

<p><b>Comment.</b>I've added an "Ideology" section. It took me a few hours to write it up, and it keeps getting deleted. After reading this whole thread of debate on the spammish tone of the article, I took it upon myself to offer some tangible content. When I first wrote it the entire article had been deleted, so I offered this content as the start of a new article. If you wish to revert the article back to it's previous state that's fine, but please leave up the "Ideology" section which I have spent my time to contribute. Thanks very much.</p>

There are two more sources I mentioned about that have the company as their subject, the Men's Health article and the Edge Magazine article. There is also a third that I didn't mention, an article in the Sunday Telegraph (text is available at the bottom of RSD's <a href="http://www.realsocialdynamics.com/news.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.realsocialdynamics.com/news.asp" rel="nofollow">news page</a>).

<dd>Please stop with the accusations. Stating that I'm merely ignoring them does <i>absolutely, positively nothing</i> to prove your point to me, and is, quite frankly, offensive. For the links to MH and Sunday Telegraph, you might want to provide links to the websites that the articles actually originated from - hanging these on the website in question raises eyebrows, and tends to speak strongly of conflict of interest. Finally, I should point out that the book you site - The Game, &amp;c - is itself lacking in resources to tout its notability. My vote, currently, stands, with my commentary above. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 03:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Earlier in the discussion, I made repeated requests that people voting for deletion address all the sources involved, not just one or two of the weak ones. Your above comment failed to address the relevant sources (though I guess I shouldn't speculate about whether you were ignoring them, or simply missing them, or... actually, I can't think of any other reasons why you didn't address them). I can see why you object to my tone, but it comes out of frustration due to my perception that many voters for deletion either aren't reading this discussion, or aren't participating honestly by addressing the proposed sources. As for links, the Men's Health and Sunday Telegraph articles are not available on their websites (at least for non-subscribers). It's unfortunate the RSD's website is the only place those articles can be found, but nowhere does wikipedia require that sources be linked to on the websites they originated from. The <a href="http://www.mensmagazineonline.com/mastering_the_game.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.mensmagazineonline.com/mastering_the_game.asp" rel="nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> article is available online, and its text appears to agree with the text on RSD's website. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 05:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>Stop removing the "Ideology" section. It's all common knowledge from the RSD community. If you like, I will email the RSD staff personally and ask if they ratify the ideology section as being, in fact, a synopsis of RSD ideology. If you want to delete it again, let me know what would be a satisfactory "sourcing" so that you would stop coming on here day in and day out and removing the section. The Mystery Method page has Mystery Method ideology on it and it has not been deleted. Shall we delete all ideology out of every seduction community based page? Why the double standard? Keep it neutral. Thanks.</li>

Your preceding comments show that you inherently have a bias towards keeping this article.

<dd>I always try to assume good faith. What I meant with my statement is that after previously taking a look at your userpage, the reader can gather the impression that you may lean towards keeping/creating articles relating to the seduction community. However, it is also noted on there that reliable sources are needed to support articles - of which I and most (arguably) editors believe this is one of the main issues surrounding this AfD debate.

<dd>Perhaps merging to the article about "<i>Owen "Tyler Durden" Cook</i>"? Though really that isn't so much merging as renaming. I'd disagree greatly with your claim that they have not made "any great contribution to the art thereof". Plus having made "great contributions" is not part of what is required by wikipedia under <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. For the very good reason that what is a "great contribution" can be highly subjective.

<dd>A peculiar implication, and one that assume bad faith against all the evidence.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Secondsights argument about the sources is compelling, but the article still reads very much like an advertisement.

<p><b>Comment</b> Twenty pages of talking for a THREE page article? Is this a hobby or something? I understand that you want to be as accurate and neutral as possible. It's a valid concern.
