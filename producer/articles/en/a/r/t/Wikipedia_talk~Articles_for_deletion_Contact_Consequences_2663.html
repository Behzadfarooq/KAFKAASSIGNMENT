<li><b>Sorry, no hoax</b> This article is intended to address the concearns that people may have, should NASA find something, say on Mars or Europa, aliens find this planet. It depicts both any positive and negative effects of alien contact, such as aliens helping Earth's doctors eradicating Cancer, AIDS,Bird Flu and/or aliens having humanity over for mealtimes - <i>their mealtimes</i> , meaning we're their food source, just as plants and animals are our food sources.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 04:56, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How many people remember the media mess caused by the fossilized alien organisims found in a meteorite that was determined to have originated on Mars&#160;?<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 06:19, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, User:70.27.59.200 Its no hoax, nor fallacy,etc. the article only addresses what could happen should NASA,ESA find something, aliens find this planet. Imagine that SOMETHING had been found by one of the space probes on Mars, or that you turn on the TV, go on the 'net and see aliens all over the place, and this is'nt a movie.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 06:31, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The discovery of the fossilized organisims in a meteorite is certainly one reason to <b>NOT delete</b> this article.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 06:44, 9 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, the incident you're thinking of did <i>not</i> include any fossilized organisms, just some mineral structures for which the only <i>known</i> cause is a side effect of microbial life. This is not proof that there's any relevance to your postulares. Second, if any of that line of microbes still exist, is it 100 percent certain that "This planet is destroyed from a high orbit, just like in the Star Wars movies...", as listed in the article? It's not valid justification to keep this speculation in an encyclopedia. Third, I misread earlier when I thought one of your "too many sources" was a UFO-fanatic website frequented only by a few cranks with no scientific validity. It turns out that you used <b>no sources at all</b>, just links to other pages of this same tertiary source, because you have no reputable verifiable sources, just empty speculation lifted from decades of science fiction. I've read on this topic for decades, and there's plenty of nuttery out there which you could have used for sources... but it still wouldn't make this content even remotely encyclopedic. I've met people with views such as you describe, and their opinions are sufficiently described in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unidentified_flying_object.html" title="Unidentified flying object">Unidentified flying object</a> article, and their existence still doesn't make this content encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:44, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I Don't Know</b>. Its a terrible article. But the concept of contact consequences ought to rate an article. Its been discussed widely in fiction, philosophy, and probably somewhere deep in the NSA. But I guess "contact consequences" is not the right title? If it is the right title, maybe make it a 1-sentence stub for later? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:48, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know if it rates it's own article. The jury is still out on the probablility of contact with another form of intelligence. Who knows? We may be the advanced aliens who contact a primative civilization? Anyway, if we wanted to do a section on the possible consequences of alien contact and add it to an article on the search for extraterrestial life, that would be a good compromise. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">Kerowyn</a> 08:52, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>the article is intended for the common man, not just the science community, since it is the common man who may either revolt, due to religious reasons, and/or to vindicate himself/herself for being ridiculed as persuant to recomendations made long ago in the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robertson_Panel_866f.html" title="Robertson Panel">Robertson Panel</a>. It is the "Joe Sixpacks" and the "Soccer Moms" that have to deal with other people that may go crazy and cause trouble. This is about your next door neighbor who might kill you, for being a govt. agent, harboring demons, having a alien encounter, or you doing likewise, or you and this neighbor may accept alien dominion, should aliens find this planet, alien life is found.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 20:34, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Martial Law, I suggest you stop digging, the hole is quite deep enough already. That it is "only a matter of time" is ludicrous hyperbole. The fantastic mathematical improbability of alien contact during the brief lifetime of any civilisation is extensively covered in the literature, both fact and fiction. There is a broad consensus that, while there is a chance it <i>could</i> happen, the chance is infinitessimally small. The subject of religious belief and alien invasion was also covered extremely well by Mr Wells - and it was original research in his case, too. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 14:17, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>When I had referred to "transmissions", I'm referring to when radio was invented, first used. Proxima Centauri is about 4 light years away from us.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article has now been extensively rewritten, removing much of the POV - but the subject as rewritten is already covered in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">Science fiction</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_contact_%28science_fiction%29.html" title="First contact (science fiction)">First contact (science fiction)</a> and particularly <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_invasion.html" title="Alien invasion">Alien invasion</a>, and I see no reason for an additional article. In fact, I will probably look at merging the First Contact and Alien Invasion articles, since both are fairly short and the one is a subgenre of the other.

<li><b>comment</b> The rewrite addresses some of the most egregious problems with formatting, etc., but the fact remains that this is a speculative article whose sources are science fiction novels. (See <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">User:Martial Law</a>'s posts here for evidence of what he thinks this article's purpose is.) As a catalogue of what has happened in notable fiction, with citations, this could be an okay (but perhaps redundant) article. As it is, it's unencyclopedic crystal balling. Thus I also keep my delete vote. <font size="-2">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 16:00, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for all who have helped the article along. What it needs most is sources. Personal essays are not allowed, we must simply summarize verifiable sources. Rather than debating issues here, interested editors might better spend their time improving the article. Even if it's merged elsewhere, the information can accrete.
