<p>The result was <b>speedy delete</b>, per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A3. Article consists entirely of a rephrasing of the title, and a link elsewhere. The editors below who want various different things to exist here (including, bizarrely, a <i>"Soft redirect using {{<a href="../../../w/_/_/Template%7EW_472f.html" title="Template:W">w</a>}} to wiktionary"</i> - {{<a href="../../../w/_/_/Template%7EW_472f.html" title="Template:W">w</a>}} is a navigation template for articles relating to a Japanese girl band who wear silly dresses) are, of course, free to do so as AfD does not make binding decisions on what content a page should contain.</p>
<p>Note, however, that an article consisting solely of a soft redirect to Wiktionary would also be speediable under the same criterion (link elsewhere). <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a> and other projectspace soft redirects, which the editors supporting that may have been thinking of, are not covered by that CSD, which is for articles only. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, bit of an unusual AfD here. This article has been getting created, deleted, altered, moved and so on for about 2 months. Basically some people want it to be a cross-namespace redirect, others don't, some want it now to define notability in a non-Wikipedia-centric way... which seems like a dicdef to me. Anyway, no vote on my part yet, I'd just like to see a more definitive resolution reached through consensus. Thanks. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:00, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As it stands now, the article is two sentences: one is a dicdef and the other is POV.

<li><strike><b>Redirect</b> to <i><b>???</b></i>. I am torn. Something just cries out to me about this term needing as page. I realize we need to avoid dictionary definitions (and I must also point out that using the term you are the defining in the definition is a major thing to avoid). I definitely see the point of avoiding cross-space redirects in this case. But there may be a same-space redirect that could be used.

<dd>I'm afraid that might not work. People will just replace the Soft redirect to Wiktionary with a cross-name space redirect.

<dd>Re. "if it is recreated": the article was re-created after each of the 10 deletions in the last year. 4 of these re-creations took place in the last week <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Notability" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Notability" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - that's why W.marsh initiated this vote I suppose. So the "if recreated" is definitely a <i>yes</i>, and mere "deletion" has proven to be ineffective. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 07:31, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>"Disambiguate" doesn't make any sense</b> - It doesn't make sense to disambiguate between Wiktionary and the project page because none of them in their own right is a valid target. When there is a valid target it's okay to put a little self-ref hatnote at the top or a link to Wiktionary box, but when there are no valid encyclopedic targets the redirect/disambig page shouldn't exist at all. "Disambiguating" between two non-encyclopedic targets, a sister project and project space on Wikipedia, is unacceptable. <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 07:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> or <b>Delete and Fully Protect</b>, at least to prevent redirect creation. Work and try to find at least some material to make it a stub. What <b>not to do</b> is redirecting it to our <s>guideline</s> essay - it's exactly a kind of misleading and <b>particularly harmful</b> redirect. Notability&#160;!= Wikipedia notability. And article space should never lead to <b>essays</b>, because it, practically, <s>allows to create</s> creates articles <s>allowed to violate</s> <b>violating all policies</b>. Completely unsourced, non-verifiable, not neutral, fully original research essay. And this redirect practically places this essay in the <b>article</b> namespace, misleading readers.

<li><b>Comment</b> And a general reader, after typing a common word, will read some essay about what some people consider good to include in Wikipedia. XNR from mainspace are very restricted, and XNR mainspace-&gt;userspace are strictly forbidden. Essay, effectively, is the same as userspace. What would you say if I added a link to my userpage from CP/M article? And here we make it a redirect, so reader gets it straight. Namespaces are here for a good reason, and XNR require really both compelling reasons to exist, and no objections, specifically no or negligible chance that a reader seeks for that term in the real life, usually when it doesn't exist outside wiki (ex.:Wikiproject). Even "Recent Changes" or "No Personal Attacks" redirects have been deleted.
