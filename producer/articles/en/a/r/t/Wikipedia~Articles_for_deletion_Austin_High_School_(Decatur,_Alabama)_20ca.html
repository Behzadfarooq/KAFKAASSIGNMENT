<li><b>Keep</b>. I fall heavily on the side of inclusionism, and don't see how keeping this article around until it can be expanded hurts Wikipedia; Wikipedia is not paper; obscure content isn't harmful; all schools are notable, et cetera; all the usual arguments — I won't waste your time with that. This is my alma mater, and though I haven't edited the article, I would hate to see it deleted. But I'm very busy and don't have a lot of time to expand it at present, and as it's been almost a decade since I graduated, I feel I lack the perspective to give it a fresh and current treatment.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As to its notability, AHS does produce a lot of National Merit Scholars (I was one) and does excel in test scores. It offers many advanced classes and programs (it was recently accredited with an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Baccalaureate_b6c1.html" title="International Baccalaureate">International Baccalaureate</a> <a href="../../../i/b/_/IB_Diploma_Programme_9f29.html" title="IB Diploma Programme">Diploma Programme</a>). Its sports teams have at times won statewide acclaim. But about the most notable thing about it from my perspective is its excellent band program, which involves an astounding portion of the student body (about a quarter of it in my day), many of whom are also the academic leaders of the school (most of the National Honor Society is in band). The concert bands have the longest string of consecutive superior ratings at state contest in Alabama (at forty years), and the marching band routinely excels in competitions in the highly competitive arenas of Tennessee and Georgia. The bands have performed for governors and presidents. If anyone else thinks this is notable, I would be glad to write it up and add it to the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think this article is a lost cause. Austin High School is at least as notable as any other high school that's been allowed an article on Wikipedia (though I realize this is a contentious issue). It's one of only two major public high schools in operation in Decatur, Alabama, and has involved thousands of Decatur residents in its over forty years of operation. I think there's a good bit to say about this school, and its article could be helped a great deal by some love and care by a more recent graduate. If no such person comes along, I will do some research as soon as I'm able and expand it myself. —<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> 16:16, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How is nominating a high school a disruption of Wikipedia? There is no consesus on whether high schools are notable or not, so an AFD nom is not unreasonable.

<dd>It is disruptive in my opinion as well. No verifiable high school article has been deleted for almost two years now. Two years.

<dd>I'd like to remind Golfcam to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, and I'd especially like to remind Silensor to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">avoid personal attacks</a>. If Icewolf34 feels the school is non-notable, it is completely within his right to nominate it for deletion (just as it is right for you to argue against deletion). Icewolf is <i>absolutely</i> trying to help Wikipedia, and your condescension is much, much more of a hindrance to WP than his AfD nomination. (Note that I'm voting keep on this article, so my above statements are in defense of the nominator and of WP's core policies, not in defense of an opinion.) -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please quote precisely where <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> made a "personal attack", I do not see such an attack on anyone, and I would suggest you take your own suggestion and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> when reading <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a>'s response. I think it is rather hard to suggest that saying "Get over it" is somehow a "personal attack". If so, I submit that you claiming that Silensor was engaged in "condescension" is in itself a personal attack. Your argument that the nominator is "within his right to nominate" is specious. As I have noted in months long since gone by, notability or the lack thereof is <b>not</b>, and never has been a valid criterion for the deletion of a high school article. Articles_for_deletion#Before_nominating_an_AfD clearly states: <i>Read and understand the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a>, which explains valid grounds for deletion.</i> <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> <b>nowhere</b> states or indicates that "non-notability" or "importance" is a "valid grounds for deletion" of a high school (or similar) article. If one reads the <b>policy</b> in the light of the <b>fact</b> that not a single, verifiable high school article has been deleted via the AfD/VfD processes in the course of the past 2 years worth of "discussions", I would humbly submit that nominating high school articles for deletion on the grounds that they are "non-notable" comes very, very, very close to a violation of standing policy - if not indeed constituting a violation of said policy. Might I suggest that if you are going to speak out "in defense of core policies" that a more precise reading of them be made before wildly suggesting that any and all nominations are somehow "rightful".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 02:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>I really do not understand why this article should be deleted. Austin High School and Decatur High School, are considered to of the best High Schools in the state of Alabama. To say that Austin is not notable is crazy.
<dl>
<dd>Austin's band program is outstanding. Not as outstanding as Decatur High School's, but second in the state, only behind Decatur High. I attend Decatur High School, and I believe that it should be kept. Our current band director, who has never gotten anything less than a superior rating at State attended Austin High. As <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> has said, Austin competes well with bands from Tennessee and Georgia. I am in Decatur's marching band and I have seen Austin in action. The Tennessee school practice marching band year round, and Austin beat one of them out in the Grissom Band Competition in 2005.</dd>
<dd>Also, one of the best sax players in the state just graduated from Austin. Both Decatur City High Schools ARE considered notable by any standards, and should both be considered great. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaGuy2007_e71a.html" title="User:AlabamaGuy2007">AlaGuy</a> 19:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Look, although I don't feel that being an IB school or having a good band program really merits inclusion in Wikipedia, that information certainly pushes the article in that direction. Why don't you add these things to the page, with citations, instead of just bringing them up in the AfD? The nomination was due to "no evidence of notability," not an argument that high school absolutely isn't notable. And yes, the IB information was added after the initial nomination. And no, that doesn't change my mind, although it's a step in the right direction. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcewolf34_9af8.html" title="User:Icewolf34">Icewolf34</a> 21:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
