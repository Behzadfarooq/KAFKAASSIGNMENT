<p>The <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">Aladin</a> article was nominated for <i><b><a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion</a></b></i> on 01/01/06 and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_11.html" title="January 11">January 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. The result of the discussions were <b>keep</b> and <b>No consensus</b>, respectively. An archived record of these discussions can be found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_5963.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_%282nd_nomination%29_55d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin (2nd nomination)">here</a>.</p>
<p>The first "keep" vote was based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aladin_%28magician%29&amp;oldid=33491529" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aladin_%28magician%29&amp;oldid=33491529" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of the article, which turned out to be full of nonverifiable facts (a wikipedically correct way to say it was full of lies).</p>
<p>After the artcle was stripped down to what is verifiable, the second "no consensus" vote was the result of some people thinking it would be smart not to delete the article, but make it into a redirect to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladdin.html" title="Aladdin">Aladdin</a>. Since I am insisting on a <b>real</b> deletion of the article , after a small revert war and an exchange of insults (I am sorry I got myself dragged into it) I moved <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">aladin</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin_%28magician%29.html" title="Aladin (magician)">aladin (magician)</a> and now initiating a new vote.</p>

<li>That is a misleading comment. Be careful what you call original research. Original research is information that is not gather from a reputable source. Are you honestly calling The Times supplement magazine, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a>, British government press releases in the cause of the London mayoral team as not from a reputable source? <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 18:48, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is a corect comment. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">Primary sources</a> are not appropriate to wikipedia. Primary source are for experts. Wikipedia is based on <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a>, i.e., on opinions of proven experts, who can evaluate corrrectness and validity of primary sources. An interview, even in most reputable newspaper is not a critical material. A newspaper bears no responsibility for what aladin may bable about himself. Government press releases say <b>nothing</b> about the importance of this person. Your opinion about matters nothing. it is your <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> of small shreds of information. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 20:19, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>As a very new user <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a>, I would strongly suggest that you cease making these types of unfounded accusations and familiarise yourself with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and other policies.

<li>As a very old used JJay, I would strongly suggest to refresh your knowledge of many ither rules. Foe exmple <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a>. I fail to understand how a person can be notable, if nearly all information about him is what he says about him. The <b>only</b> independent source is a line in the list of London city hall staff. It is not a big deal to find info about a person on 'net. Pray tell me what text from his article stub says that this person is notable? For example, care to explain me what this 'alkhemi' is? How many persons? What projects? What did he intersesting do as Vice-Chair? You intentionally dodging the question of his <b>notability</b>. Instead, you twisting the issue as if it is a problem to prove that he <b>exisits</b>. Of course, he does exist! but he is a <b>nobody</b>. To prove otherwise would be <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> I am talking about. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 04:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>After 3 AfDs and endless talk page discussions I am aware of your opinion. Please maintain your opinion (which to use your own words above, "<i>matters nothing</i>"). However, your refusal to accept any published sources, such as the Times article, is a violation of policy ("<i>Verifiability, not truth</i>"). Many experienced editors have pointed out that your statements regarding primary sources and continued willfull distortion of the meaning of original research are further violations. As you do not understand policy here regarding verification, sources or original research- and seem bent on creating your own- we have nothing to discuss. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 09:55, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Times" article is aladin's word of mouth. It is not a critical essay of a profesional magician. Two questions to you. (1) What exactly is written in Times article? Why I have an impresion that <b>nobody</b> read it? (2) Times article spells his name as "Aladdin" (capital 'a', etc. ) I find it suspicious that at his website aladin convenienly clipped out the name from the quotation. Are we speaking about the same person? What the heck is this alkemi? Does it exist anywhere but the brain of ladin? <b>That</b> is <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. You conveniently ignore all raised doubts. If you are going to blindly copy in wikipeida everything you read in newspapers, yuo are in <b>big</b> trouble, my naive friend. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:46, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>YOu are dodging my direct doubts and delve into policies and accusations that I am new (and hence stupid). OK. Fine. Her is your policy: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>: the most relevant entry is "Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers". The next one is "Major local political figures who receive significant press coverage". The current article does not show fitness to any of these. To claim that aladin is "widely recognized" or "significant pres coverage" is a theory <b>not</b> supported neither primary nor secondary sources, hence <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> (with the possible exception of aladin himself, who is <b>not</b> reputable source). <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 17:48, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep,</b>During the first deletion I seemed fairly sure of his notability but for the second one I was less sure. However, I have thought about it logically and I present to you the evidence:
<ul>
<li><b>Fact-</b> There was a 4-page supplement in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> regarding aladin. People outside the UK will claim this is journalistic and from an unreliable source. However, The Times takes steps to ensure that the information contained in their newspapers is correct and they very rarely (if ever) fail for hoaxes.</li>
<li><b>Fact-</b> This is the most certain of the facts. Aladin was vice chair for <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Livingstone_67ff.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a>’s Cultural Strategy in the mayoral assembly. He is described in the press released as <i>“a magician and live artist”</i> <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=604" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=604" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Several of the users who are against aladin have described this as unreliable. However, vigerous checks are made by the Mayor’s office. They have access to previous work information and other databases. They have to check them vigerously as if they are found to be fruedalant the bad publicity would be tremendous. They also have check all officials due to the threat of terroism.</li>
<li><b>Fact-</b> Aladin’s daughter appeared on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a>. The summary of the documentry includes</li>
<li><i>“Aladin is a London-based magician of international acclaim, who was brought to that city as a child”</i><a href="http://nationalgeographic.com.au/front_new/watch/default.asp?mode=program&amp;tdatetime=12%2F23%2F2004+6%3A30%3A00+AM" class="external autonumber" title="http://nationalgeographic.com.au/front_new/watch/default.asp?mode=program&amp;tdatetime=12%2F23%2F2004+6%3A30%3A00+AM" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Although the documentry concentrates on his daughter, it also features aladin himself. Some might say that the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> is unreliable. Let me assure you this, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> is a worldwide channel and also checks the content it provides.</li>
<li>Thus, the above three sources are extremely reliable and checks will have been made for the conent that derives for them as any bad publicity received could ruin their reputation. All three assures it’s customers that the conent it provides is accurate. I have no reason to doubt this. If you have doubts e-mail them and find out.</li>
<li><b>Fact-</b> Aladin is also featured in the <a href="http://www.bookofcool.com/html/Profile_Casino_and_Cards.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.bookofcool.com/html/Profile_Casino_and_Cards.asp" rel="nofollow">“Book of Cool”</a> demonstrating how to pull off card tricks. This is an actual book and can be verified and bought. Aladin is in it. No question about it. Furthermore, Aladin was interview for the Family Tech Show in regards to this book. <a href="http://www.familytechshow.com/archives/000146.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.familytechshow.com/archives/000146.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>Thus, my vote is a Strong Keep as I have done my research. I have discounted all information that I see as unreliable and I have seen a magician notable enough for his inclusion in wikipedia. The only reason why I can see that the notability of aladin is still debated is due to the original article that completely over hyped him. aladin may not be a Darren Brown but he is certainly a magician with a colourful culture who has a cult status, especially in Bangledesh and India.</li>

<li><b>re:Fact</b>: in 1998 Times (which was not <b>The</b> Times, but its saturday entertaniment supplement <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saturday_Times_Magazine_4fb4.html" title="The Saturday Times Magazine">the Saturday Times Magazine</a>, with less rigorous jurnalism, see aladin's own website for details) the person "Aladdin" is described, not "aladin"; you have yet to prove this is the same person. And I don't see his fame increased since 1998. (and I see it quite suspicious that aladin conveniently clipped out the name from the quotation shown at his website.)</li>
<li><b>re:Fact</b>: There were hundreds of thousands of people sitting in city hall offices around the globe. What exactly notable he did in this position?</li>

<li><b>re:Fact</b>: what is the notability of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Cool_295a.html" title="Book of Cool">Book of Cool</a> itself? Any public library has hundreds of hokus-pokus books.</li>

<li><b>1</b> The Saturday Times Magazine is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>' supplement as you said but it's still written and belongs to The Times and is checked in exactly the same way. If the Saturday Times Magazine has false info then it rubs off on the newspaper, which creates bad publicity, thus the same checks have to be made.</li>
<li><b>2</b> He played an important role in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Livingstone_67ff.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a>'s campaign for London mayor, that's what makes him different. Plus, he is described as a notable magician in the press release. Every claim they make gets scutanised especially by those running against Ken Lingstone for mayor. Thus, they can't afford to make mistakes.</li>
<li><b>3</b> The very fact that the National Geographic Channel describes him as a notable magician is important as they have to research their claims and subjects. Yes as I said, checks are made by the above three.</li>
<li><b>4</b> It's a book that features notable people in their fields. For example, the pool section is by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorsten_Hohmann_3fa9.html" title="Thorsten Hohmann">Thorsten Hohmann</a>European Straight Pool champion and German 9-ball champion and the Rugby section is by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Spencer_8baa.html" title="Carlos Spencer">Carlos Spencer</a>, New Zealand's 4th test points top scorer. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 21:19, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd like to raise a full-blown sockpuppet alarm here: Grandwazir has a editing pattern that is very similar to the already proven sockpuppets "Tiksustoo, Autumnleaf, Robsmommy, Grroin, Aloodum, and Aboutoxfordstudent": Few edits, and while the range of articles is diverse, it correlates very closely to those other UIDs.

<li>Actually, the first vote got a "keep" vote because people assumed that all those false references where true. And also because Aladin voted at least 4 times.

<li>Please leave your mentoring tone to your sons, stop twisting my words. I am not denying that this person <b>exists</b>. (By the way, it was me who first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aladin_%28magician%29&amp;diff=33899334&amp;oldid=33891791" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aladin_%28magician%29&amp;diff=33899334&amp;oldid=33891791" rel="nofollow">added his real name</a> and defended his existence, despite multiple hints that I have something personal against him). So far all your efforts did not prove that he is worth inclusion into wikipedia, ie, his <b>notability</b>. There are tens of millions of people you may find mentioned in newspapers and over internet. Your <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> is your theory that he did something notable so that he is worth inclusion in wikipedia. (By the way, what exactly did he do notable, please?) And read my question carefully: I am asking what <b>he did</b>, not what <b>he was</b>.<a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 06:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Isn't original research something which hasn't been cited by a reputable source, a reputable source being the Times, NGC and the book thereafter mentioned above? Basically anything cited by reputable sources is therefore not original research, correct? Therefore there's no real need to throw the "original research" tag around here when it's NOT. Although I do understand you're asking what he did so fair comment. --<a href="../../../r/b/l/User%7ERBlowes_9ca1.html" title="User:RBlowes">RBlowes</a> 18:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, in response to a question to Meir Yedid they said: "There was a reference to him in a Feb. 2004 issue when he was featured in an Oxford Student article by Tamara Cohen (Feb. 19). Do not know anything else about him." I'd have to read the article to see how important the mention is, but the fact Meir Yedid knows about it means he's not entirely non-notable as a magician. <b><a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:39, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</b>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It's a stub, but seems to be a stub about a notable magician. The references look like enough to assert notability to me. Original Research would be if the wikipedia doing the editing himself called up this guy personally and asked him questions, which he then published only on wikipedia. Now, if that same wikipedian performed this interview, published that interview in, say, The Times, or National Geographic, and then cited that as a source, it would NOT constitute as Original Research. If the external articles in question weren't written by wikipedians at all, then that's even another step removed.
<p>If this Aladin guy were to write an autobiography, you know, about himself, consisting only of information he knows about his own life, and publishes that autobiography, and a wikipedian then goes and references that autobiography, that is also <i>not Original Research</i>. I know that's not the case here, but the person advocating the deletion of this article seems to be of the opinion that just because these articles being referenced quote the man directly, use information that came from the man himself, that this is a case of Original Research. This is not the case. That's simply not what Original Research is! <a href="../../../f/i/e/User%7EFieari_a4ce.html" title="User:Fieari">Fieari</a> 04:09, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>weak conditional keep</b> WP:V version of this article reads "Aladin is a magician. From 2000 to 2004, aladin served on the Mayor of London's Cultural Strategy Group for London." That is what my keep vote is designed to keep. Any additional information added about the hoax firm "alkhemi" or the individuals birth location, or the contentes of any puff-piece single-sourced article (most of which appear to be totally innacurate) would cause me to vote "delete" to an article that is commercial spam and damaging the encyclopedia. This keep is also a vote only to keep "aladin (magician)" "aladin" will be a redirect to a disambig page. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 15:46, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>May I respectfully ask you how does your vote agree with <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>?

<li>It does not. As a die-hard inclusionist, I find the notability requirements excessive and I do not vote in line with them.
