<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Someone seems to have a grudge against Family Guy&#160;;-) Seriously, they are episode pages like those of any other series. There is no original research in them. As for "cite", the episode which is summerised is a valid source. The person who made these accusations should back them up, as they seem pretty random and unfounded to me. And while he's at it, he should justify why he's going after Family Guy episodes only. Is it more researched or sourced to describe an episode of another series? Or is he planning to mass-delete all episode pages of all series? Until we get some kind of explaination on why these episodes in particular should be deleted, I'm strongly for keeping them. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 21:52, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The "debate" was when the page was porrly written, not when it was uncited. It is original research; the authors are getting their info from their knowledge of the episode. If they got the info from a summary then wheres the citation? And I do intend on proding all uncited summaries. -- <a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_5c31.html" title="User:Ccool2ax"><font color="blue">Chris</font></a> <a href="../../../c/c/o/User_talk%7ECcool2ax_7ce5.html" title="User talk:Ccool2ax"><font color="green" size="1">Ccool2ax</font></a> <font color="gray" size="1"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ccool2ax_93c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ccool2ax">contrib.</a></font> 21:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So by your judgement, any movie/book/tv show page that has a summary of the work is "uncited original research"? That's nonesense. It is cited, and the source is the movie/book/tv show being summarised. And if that's "original research", then every page where something's expressed in the writer's words instead of being copy-pasted from a book or encyclopedia - which is to say, every single page in wikipedia - is guilty of original research. And since we cannot copy-paste articles from encyclopedias (you know, with those pesky copyright laws and all), then we might as well shut down wikipedia right now and save you the trouble of listing every last page. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22:02, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Wikipedia is a ternary source, so it shoud get information from secondary sources. The user's interpretation of the show via watching it once is original research since they are only using the subject as a source. It's the reason interviews can't be added directly to Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_5c31.html" title="User:Ccool2ax"><font color="blue">Chris</font></a> <a href="../../../c/c/o/User_talk%7ECcool2ax_7ce5.html" title="User talk:Ccool2ax"><font color="green" size="1">Ccool2ax</font></a> <font color="gray" size="1"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ccool2ax_93c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ccool2ax">contrib.</a></font> 22:05, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is not an <i>interpretation</i>, it is a <i>summary</i>. It is a factual description of what happens in the episode. "Peter gets trapped on a desert island. He comes back after several months, and finds Brian has married Lois. He wins Lois over again." There is no original research in there. If the text were to read, say, "In a very unoriginal plot twist, Peter gets trapped on a desert island. But the Robinson story was better. Lois married Brian -- ewww gross, bestiality is wrong! But Peter wins Lois over again, yay Peter! He's so great, I love him so much!" then that would be a fan interpretation of the show, and you'd have a case. But there is nothing in wikipedia policy against putting factual information in - in fact, that's what wikipedia in for.</dd>
<dd>And another thing, did you actually read the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a> page? I'd like you to find me a part of it that can says, or even that can be loosely interpreted as saying, that a factual NPOV movie/book/tv show summary constitutes original research. That's kinda important for your case, since you're aiming to delete most of wikipedia based on that argument. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22:16, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's nice, except for the fact that no one is analysing or interpreting the episode, so your argument doesn't hold up. A factual, NPOV summary of an episode is neither an interpretation nor an analysis.

<li>I'm all for compromise, but I'm not sure I follow your logic here in asserting that the articles are uncited. It seems to me that if an article is about a TV show, the <i>show</i> is the citation... the citation is implied and should be obvious. Same goes if I am writing an article for a film; the plot summary, cast, etc are technically "uncited" in that I have not made a citation, but the <i>film</i> is the citation. Now if I write something about the critical reception, that requires a citation. So, what exactly are you suggesting? Are you saying that one can't write an article about a television show unless a secondary source has summarized its plot, therefore providing one with a citation? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 23:03, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with this compromise. I disagree with the statement that the film, plot summary, cast etc are uncited as that may be how some film articles are but not how they should be as they can be sourced from IMDb and elsewhere.

<li>Yes it does, but the problem with it is that <i>Family Guy</i> is so symbiotically connected into American pop culture that Wikipedia is better able to put it all into context. In this way it is very different from another TV show that has its own Wiki, <i>Star Trek</i>. In some ways, the <i>Star Trek</i> universe is highly self-contained, it could exist in the absence of 20th Century American pop culture. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromulent_Kwyjibo_1af7.html" title="User:Cromulent Kwyjibo">Cromulent Kwyjibo</a> 20:44, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I have found these guides to be incredibly useful, especially when attempting to decipher the many vague (I was born in '90) cultural references made on Family Guy. The guides are really just factually summaries; the WP policy isn't holy writ, and I believe that quite reasonably, we can bend the rules a bit. And yes, if you did delete this extensive amount of work, you would have to do so for just about every uncited TV show entry out there and minor article stub. If you must, put that uncited banner above the article.

<li>I certainly wish we could bend the rules here (seriously), but with editors treating even short essays as concrete, unbreakable rules (notability), I don't expect to see rule-bending here. It's either accept the rules or, when a deletionist is losing a battle, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">flat-out ignore</a> them. At this point, <b>I am not trying to delete all this work.</b> I realize that they are great articles as far as quality of writing is. I just wish that the rules would stop being bent for TV shows and someone could introduce citations. If an article is uncited, it's original research, which is no-exceptions banned on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_5c31.html" title="User:Ccool2ax"><font color="blue">Chris</font></a> <a href="../../../c/c/o/User_talk%7ECcool2ax_7ce5.html" title="User talk:Ccool2ax"><font color="green" size="1">Ccool2ax</font></a> <font color="gray" size="1"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ccool2ax_93c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ccool2ax">contrib.</a></font> 03:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It would be absurd to delete virtually every TV show and movie page on Wikipedia, but almost all were written by a viewer based on what they saw rather than by citing a third party summary.

<li>This is getting nonsensical in my opinion. Research on any topic is at some point original. Can a shared experience i.e watching a tv programme be considered research? Research suggests pursuing something to an end no-one has reached before. There is nothing on any of the Family Guy pages that anyone couldn't find out through seeing the relevent shows. It's a matter of knowledge rather than research. As a British person watching Family Guy I don't get all of the cultural references.

I just wish people would look at the other <i>Family Guy</i> episode articles before starting new ones. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShutterBugTrekker_03a7.html" title="User:ShutterBugTrekker">ShutterBugTrekker</a> 21:49, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> These pages I find are pretty valuable. While I do get 95% of the jokes on the show, there is the occasional one that slips by the mind. And sure enough, someone on wikipedia will have it in the cultural references page, and you can understand the joke better.</li>
