<p>This list is simply a list of films and film industry people who have won awards for the same year. It appears to be nothing but an indiscriminate collection of data. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlavlin_78b5.html" title="User:Slavlin">Slavlin</a> 02:01, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Is "Road to the 76th Academy Awards" some sort of official list of awards shows, or is it just a title and compilation random Wikipedians came up with? If it's the latter, probably we should delete this for various obvious reasons. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are MANY other Road to the... that I would nominate if my fingers could take it, but I cannot see how the list of awards won in the same year as the Academy Award is a useful or encyclopedic article. At best, the info should be included on each movie/director/actor page. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlavlin_78b5.html" title="User:Slavlin">Slavlin</a> 02:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Not sure.</b> Normally when I'm not sure I don't comment, but this time I really see both sides of the argument. I would imagine that these records matter to film junkies the way that regular-season standings matter to baseball fans. We do have articles on regular-season standings, but I don't know enough about film to judge the true relevance of these data. Without solid ground for deletion, I would submit a vote to keep by default. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 02:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>: The above is a poor analogy, actually. Sports regular seasons have occurrences and information in of themselves. This, however, is a compilation of awards won elsewhere. Like others, I question the rationale for including some of those awards. They're potentially useful and informative lists, as such things go, but without some acceptable criteria for deciding which awards to include, this is a <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violation. Beyond that, what's this "Road to the Xth Academy Awards" nonsense? Is there a particular source for that term, or any reason to believe that the worldwide perception of each and every one of these awards is as minor-league trophies en route to the Oscars? I'd think much kindlier on List of 2006 major film awards etc. "These award presentations all lead to the 79th Academy Awards ceremony on February 25, 2007." Says who, exactly? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:26, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete all</b>. This is not an official compilation; there is no consensus among film fans about which critics' awards are worth paying attention to and which are not. I understand what the article creators meant by "Road to the ... Awards" but that is not a commonly used name for what this is about. I could understand listing awards won under the film or person's entry, or listing the winners given for a particular year in the article about the particular award, but this article is <a href="../../../i/i/n/WP%7EIINFO_2579.html" title="WP:IINFO">indiscriminate information</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Rename</b> if this is a list of <i>every</i> significant film awards from each year. But I'm not sure what the criteria is for these awards to be listed here, so if it's not based on anything other than the editor's choice, then delete. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 05:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> as a list of data not really suited to an encyclopedia. Information should be split and put on the relevant talk page of the movie/directors/actors/other relevant pages. Also, there's no way to make sure data should/shouldn't be put on the page- authors choice, as Croxley said? Or another sort of criteria? Really, it could be anything- <b><a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattleGirl_9ae1.html" title="User:CattleGirl"><font color="blue">Cat</font><font color="darkblue">tleG</font><font color="black">irl</font></a></b> <sup><i><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECattleGirl_3ed2.html" title="User talk:CattleGirl">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattleGirl_Autograph_Book_3a2e.html" title="User:CattleGirl/Autograph Book">sign!</a></i></sup> 08:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b>. This is already covered in each of the movie's page. <a href="../../../d/a/2E/User%7EDa.Tomato.Dude_23a5.html" title="User:Da.Tomato.Dude"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" color="red">DTD</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/2E/User_talk%7EDa.Tomato.Dude_477e.html" title="User talk:Da.Tomato.Dude"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" color="green"><sub>(speak)</sub></font></a></li>
<li><b>Delete all</b>, totally unnecessary. If this kind of series articles continues, Wikipedia will be overloaded with a bunch of "Road to..." ones. <b><a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppleworm_070b.html" title="User:Appleworm"><font color="red">Apple</font></a><a href="../../../a/p/p/User_talk%7EAppleworm_94df.html" title="User talk:Appleworm"><i><font color="green">•<big><sub>•w•</sub></big>•o•<big><sub>•r•</sub></big>•m•<big><sub>•</sub></big></font></i></a></b> 17:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b>. This appears to be nothing more than a compilation of awards with similar names given out by otherwise unrelated entities. The title is also somewhat misleading as the claim that various and sundry filmography awards handed out during the year constitue a "path" to the Academy Awards is POV. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
