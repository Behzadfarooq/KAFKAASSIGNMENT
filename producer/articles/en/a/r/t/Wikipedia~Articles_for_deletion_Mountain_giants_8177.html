<li><b>Keep</b>I don't believe this is original research. Who ever the author is, they did a good job in rembering the sections of giants in the Simillarion and Unfinished Tales. I read down farther between a discussion of the author and the guy above me and yes there is a book that Tolkien originally wrote called Guide to Middle Earth. The only thing wrong with this page is the name, it should be Stone Giants not Mountain Giants.

<dd>It's not that it's about a Tolkien creature, but that practically nothing in it has anything to do with what Tolkien wrote. He mentions them exactly once, and all he says is that they were large and were throwing rocks at each other.

<li><b>Keep</b> and leave the same. Hey, I created this page and I studied for months and worked hard to get it done. I am Durin's Bane and I found all of this information from the internet, in tolkiens personal writings, from the Hobbit, Simillarion, Lord of the Rings, Unfinished tales and much more. I worked hard on this and it should not be deleted. Most of my information came from Tolkien's Guide to Middle Earth, it is a book that describes every living thing or race or character. He mentioned them much more than once, and it cannot be put all into two sentences, mainly because of the fact that nothing in Tolkien's world could be described in two sentences. Like I was saying in the section of stone giants it specificly states what I have written. The information came from what Bilbo had written in The Red Book of Westmarch. This is all accurate and correct. Even the information of the giants in the Battle for Middle Earth 2 game. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Durin's Bane (<a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurin%27s_Bane_c33b.html" title="User talk:Durin's Bane">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Durin%27s_Bane_9c68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Durin's Bane">contribs</a>).</small>
<dl>
<dd>Unless you found it in something written by Tolkien, you can't just say it as if he invented it that way. He never wrote a "Guide to Middle Earth". If you found anything about "mountain giants" in <i>The Silmarillion</i> you were seeing things. I recall nothing about them in <i>Unfinished Tales</i>. He mentioned them once or twice in <i>Letters</i> as anomalies that don't fit well into the rest of his mythology, IIRC. And in any event, I believe he called them by no other name than "stone giants"; "mountain giants" must come from somewhere else. I would guess that and everything else here was either made up by the author of the Guide, or is from some game or other. Either way, you should say so and provide references. Do that and I'll ask for this AfD to be withdrawn. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 04:36, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What are YOU talking about. Tolkien did write giants in the Similarion he wrote them possibly being the ones who created Helm's Deep. And yes he did write a Guide to Middle Earth book. It was edited by his son, I have the book. I don't know how to site sources but I'll try, and if this is demolished I will write it all again! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 199.44.18.70 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_199.44.18.70_a8a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/199.44.18.70">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>The bit about Helm's Deep was mentioned as a legend and not a fact. It was actually built by the Númenoreans early in Gondor's history.

<p>But these do!</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> this is almost entirely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and much longer than the entry in the only cited source. <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">Notability</a> is also a concern since they have such minor apperences in Tolkien's works. Unlike <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobbit.html" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a> say, I'd argue that these creatures don't deserve an article of their own, even if it's cleaned up and properly sourced. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 11:58, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
