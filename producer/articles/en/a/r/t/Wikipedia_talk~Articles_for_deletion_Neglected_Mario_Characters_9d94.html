<li>Spite, or Internet rivalry, is not sufficient reason to create a Wikipedia article. I couldn't care less about Bob and George, (personally, I hate it) but I think an article in Wired magazine, several hundred thousand Google hits, and an Alexa score of 33,455 makes it notable. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 18:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, it is notable enough for <s>someone</s>(actually many users collaborated on both pages) to have put hours into writing not only the article but also a list of culture references from the comic. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 03:03, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Effort put into something, while noble, doesn't nessecitate notability. If you wanted me to, I could put hours into writing an article on my artist/musician friend who I think is a fucking genius, but it still wouldn't be encyclopedic. The fact that multiple users collaborated gives the article more credit, as it's not just vanity. But the fact of the matter is, I don't think it's notable, and the Wikipedia's guide to website notability seems to agree with me.-<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 03:10, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, you are arguing on whether or not NC is a notable website. NC is NOT on wikipedia because it's a website, it's on wikipedia because it is the first known webcomic. Just becuase NC isn't known to the mainstream doesn't mean it shouldn't be on wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a> 03:18, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's a difference between not-mainstream and not-notable. <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_Oz._Mouse_4e11.html" title="12 Oz. Mouse">12 Oz. Mouse</a> isn't mainstream. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masonna.html" title="Masonna">Masonna</a> isn't mainstream. <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_circumcision.html" title="Female circumcision">Female circumcision</a> isn't mainstream. A sprite comic that has 700 Google hits and has to have at the most, two or three dozen regular readers, is not notable. And if it is notable, it shouldn't have two articles on Wikipedia dedicated to discussing it, one of which that is almost as long as the article on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> and has 29 pictures, an article in Wikiquote, and a brief stub-article about the otherwise completely-non-notable (but brilliant, and, on a personal note, a nice guy in my experience) author.<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 03:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b> I didn't vote, I only left a comment. That's because I know that effort doesn't equal notability, though it does show a perception of notability that exists primarily within the subjects intrested party. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 03:38, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Understood. However, I must note that subsequently after nominating this article for deletion, I discovered that the creator of this article, <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a>, is <a href="http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:viiLG4LSkPEJ:www.smbhq.com/faq.htm++%22Sean+Kelly%22+site:http://www.smbhq.com/faq.htm&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:viiLG4LSkPEJ:www.smbhq.com/faq.htm++%22Sean+Kelly%22+site:http://www.smbhq.com/faq.htm&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">a staff-member at the site that hosts this comic</a>, and that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jay_Resop&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jay_Resop&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">The author of the comic has frequently edited it as well</a>. Not only making this not-notable, but a possible (if not blatant) vanity article. I wouldn't say that many people have edited it, and if they have, it's not out of enthusiasm for the comic, but, and I don't mean to sound rude, enthusiasm for the poor quality of the article. (Ever since the beginning of the creation of the article, edit summaries have been critical; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neglected_Mario_Characters&amp;diff=14611886&amp;oldid=14577760" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neglected_Mario_Characters&amp;diff=14611886&amp;oldid=14577760" rel="nofollow">"(Fixing the typo in the FIRST WORD of the article.)"</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neglected_Mario_Characters&amp;diff=14653671&amp;oldid=14637396" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neglected_Mario_Characters&amp;diff=14653671&amp;oldid=14637396" rel="nofollow">"(removed comentary)"</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neglected_Mario_Characters&amp;diff=18643109&amp;oldid=18335748" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neglected_Mario_Characters&amp;diff=18643109&amp;oldid=18335748" rel="nofollow">"(Cleanup on aisle 4, cleanup on aisle 4...)"</a>) The comic is not notable and this is a vanity article. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 03:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Uh, hi there. I just wanted to add a couple of cents. Mainly just to say that you can say what you want about NC and this article in Wikipedia, but it is not a vanity article. I have done very little to edit this page, and have not "frequently edited it" as you say I have. I have only made a few small edits, mainly to just correct typos or fix vandalism. I think I have edited it a total of three times. But I have done nothing to add to this article, and have not made frequent edits. I had no part in the creation of this article, and I have not promoted this article on my site at all. I do not see how this would be "vanity". While I can't speak for SPKx, I would guess that he made this article simply as a fan of NC. On discovering of this article's existence, I was touched and humbled that so many people would come together and create a small tribute to my site. And their work means a lot to me, since it shows that maybe my hard work at NC hasn't been for nothing, and some people actually enjoy my work. It's a nice feeling to be given a little credit for your work. Personally, I believe that as the first sprite comic, this fact gives it some notability, and NC deserves a little respect. But as I said in the other article, the "List of References" one, I am not a person who wants to impose myself onto other people. If you all at Wikipedia decide to delete this article, then I will have no complaints and I will not have a fuss. This is a public website, afterall. If this article is deleted, I would be interested in putting this material onto my site, since it would be a shame to waste the efforts of everyone involved here. So yeah, that's all I wanted to say for now. Whatever you all decide is cool with me. I think Wikipedia is a great reference, and I am not going to fight it. All I will say is that, personally, I think the article should stay up. If other sprite comics have their articles, then I don't see why the first sprite comic shouldn't. But that's just my opinion. If your main complaint is that it is too large, and there are too many articles devoted to NC, then why not simply scale it down? Simply leave a small article, recognizing NC for what it's worth and giving it the credit it deserves. Just a suggestion. And like I said, this is not vanity. I have done little to create and promote this article. And whatever you decide to do, it is fine with me. Thanks.-jayJay Resop 06:03, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for your reply. Let's see it from my point of view. I have a friend. He is a painter, a musician, and the dishwasher at the place I hang out often. We have another friend, who thinks this guy's really cool, and he's done a lot for this guy; created him a website, motivated him to go out and play in various venues, and started a band together with him. Now, what if my second friend created a Wikipedia article about my first friend? What if it was dozens of paragraphs long and had dozens of pictures? And then what if both the second friend and myself continuously edited it, and the first friend occasionally edited it as well? What if when the notability of our friend was brought up, we claimed he was the originator of some popular musical innovation without offering any proof to back up our claim? <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 18:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OK, who died and made you king of wikipedia? You are not a wiki administrator? The NC article has been a work in progress. It definitely not vanity. Sprite comics like <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a> and <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-Bit_Theatre_311f.html" title="8-Bit Theatre">8-Bit Theatre</a> have wiki pages and there is no reason why NC shouldn't be allowed to have a page, especially since it's the first one! Why don't you stop your complaining and leave us in peace!!!! - <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a> 04:17, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It seems you don't know that this is what we as Wikipedia users can do. It doesn't take a mod to SUGGEST deletion nor does it take one to argue for its deletion. This is vanity and it's not notable and thus that means it should be deleted. It's not a personal attack on you. Pandaman87 04:26, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am not a Wikipedia administrator, I'm not even a veteran of Wikipedia, but Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia that anyone can edit and voice their peace on, and I am perfectly free to cite numerous official Wikipedia guidelines that basically say that this article is not Wikipedia quality and deserves deletion, or at least significiant cleanup. "8-Bit Theater" has 196,000 Google hits. "Bob and George" has 93,500. "Neglected Mario Characters" has 764. Neglected Mario Characters is allegedly the first sprite comic, so it may be notable in the history of webcomics, but not notable enough to merit two massive articles, an article about the author, 20-something uploaded pictures, and a Wikiquotes article. It's not a matter of "leav[ing] [you] alone", since Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.html" title="Geocities">Geocities</a>, it's a public encyclopedia that has an official, well fleshed-out, well agreed-upon (and relatively pendantic) official policy. I also would like to argue that your tone is highly uncivil, and thus you are not an authority on Wikipedia ettiquite. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 04:27, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Two or three dozen? Where did you get those numbers mister? For your information SMBHQ gets, on average, 3,509 visits and 17,722 page views a day! And since NC is one of the top sections at SMBhq, I'm sure a good chunk of those hits go there. - <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a> 03:48, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I apologize for being hyperbolic. However, a couple thousand visits a day is actually not that large in terms of websites, and the website, nor the webcomic, is notable in termsd of Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 03:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>If it's truly not that large, why don't you try creating a website and see if you can get that many hits in a YEAR. - <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a> 04:05, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Relax. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. I was not insulting or attacking your website or your ability to create a website, nor defending my hypothetical website or website-creation-skills. I am merely arguing that according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia guidelines</a>, your website and your webcomic are not notable, and the fact that you, a SMBHQ.com staffer, authored this article and the <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Resop_e7d4.html" title="Jay Resop">Jay Resop</a> article, makes this vanity/boarderline <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a>. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 04:16, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, let me get this straight. Just because the NC article was created by the people involved with it and not some Joe Blow off the street makes the article vanity? What kind of garbage is that? You can't take away the fact that there were no known sprite comics before NC, as such NC should get some credit on wikipedia. - <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a> 04:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Some credit, yes. Not a gigantic several page article. Sorry. Pandaman87 04:27, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"What kind of garbage is that?" <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Official Wikipedia policy</a>. The driving ethos behind Wikipedia is that it is an encyclopedia written by millions of "Joe Blow[s]". <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> didn't write the article on Jesus Christ. <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> didn't write the article on Adolf Hitler. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> didn't write the article on The Beatles, and you shouldn't write an article advertizing your website, anymore than I should write an article (or use a comment in the talk section of an AfD discussion) to advertize <a href="http://www.littlegrillcollective.com/turtle/" class="external text" title="http://www.littlegrillcollective.com/turtle/" rel="nofollow">my friend's artistic career</a>. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 04:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>NC isn't his website. Sure, he writes for NC, but as a fan of the comic. He's not an "official staff member" of NC, Jay is the only one who is. He is webmaster of SMBHQ, which is merely the host of NC, and his site is SMBHQ Mysteries. And yes, he created the article, but many of the major edits were done by fans such as myself. Therefore, vanity is limited.
<ul>
<li>You think that if the maintainer of a website that hosts a comic creates a Wikipedia article about the comic, it's only limited vanity? I disagree. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 18:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're preaching to the choir regarding bias against Internet culture in the notability guidelines of Wikipedia. This awkwardness is what resulted in the creation of Encyclopedia Dramatica. Until someone, possibly you, authors a brilliant, more-egalitarian guideline for Wikipedia regarding what Internet culture is notable, and has it sucessfully proposed and agreed upon, every two-bit website will have to remain in the B-list. However, even in the world of webcomics, yours isn't very notable, in my opinion.
<ul>
<li>"Penny Arcade", a universally known webcomic in the world of webcomics, has about 6,570,000 google hits.</li>
<li>"Sinfest", a pretty popular webcomic, has 1,090,000 Google hits.</li>
<li>"Achewood", a somewhat well-known one, has 429,000.</li>
<li>"Cat and Girl", "Jerkcity", and "Perry Bible Fellowship", three relatively obscure webcomics that have moderately-devout cult followings, have about 300,000 each</li>
<li>"Bob and George" and "Elftor", two webcomics that are pushing the envelope on webcomic obscurity, but are still notable enough to merit Wikipedia articles, both have about 100,000 each.</li>
<li>"Neglected Mario Characters" has 764</li>

<li>If you knew how Google truly worked (like I do), you wouldn't be so egotistical. Google finds the keywords you enter and matches it to links to the site. Sure the words "Bob and George" may give you 100,000 hits, but only 564 sites actually link to the webcomic, which is roughly the same number of sites that link to SMBhq (though admittedly NC is linked by only 46 sites). - <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a> 05:29, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

It is next to impossible to prove that NC was the first sprite comic, other than it came before the other, more notable, comics. I admit, I knew next to nothing about wikipedia when I created the article 9 months ago, and I actually had to use the Bob and George article as a template. Back then I didn't know the guidelines and such. Would I have created the page if I knew the guidelines? Probably not. You guys are so concerned about "reference this" and "prove that" that you don't realize that there are many people who have enjoyed NC. Sure, some major publication may not have written about it (the 1up article is actually the first known major reference). Sure, NC may or may not have inspired other sprite comics (the wired article says the guy from Bob and George got the sprites idea on his own). But, NC is still a prized part of SMBHQ. Go ahead and delete it, what do I care? To you, I'm just some crazed prejudiced fanboy that has no idea what he's talking about.

<li>If Wired News delves into the art of sprite comics and the popularity of Bob and George without mentioning Neglected Character Comics in passing, I think that alone not only is not sufficient evidence to prove that this comic has a claim to fame of being the originator of sprite comics, but sufficient evidence that it doesn't. "Many people" may have enjoyed this comic, (I myself was one of them) but that does not negate the fact that it is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">not notable</a>. Wikipedia contributors are concerned with "reference this" and "prove that" for a reason, we are trying to create a credible encyclopedia. I know that NC is a prized part of SMBHQ. My feet are a prized part of my anatomy, that doesn't mean they deserve an article either. If you are really apathetic to whether or not this article is deleted, I suggest we go ahead and delete it. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 18:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Now you're just being unreasonable. Wikipedia should be a place for people to read about things that aren't notable to the outside world. Yeah, I could come here to read about a bigshot celebrity, politician, game, or movie, but I could also read Sports Illustrated, go to the IMDB, or watch MSNBC for the same information that's here. Wikipedia should go above and beyond this, and stick up for the little guys. And he WAS joking. He's just really passionate about NC, as I and many others are. What you are saying, to me, at least, is that Wikipedia shoud just go ahead and claim that Bob and George was the first sprite comic. Anyone who says this needs to get their facts straight. We're not saying NC was first, either. It was, as far as we know, the first known major sprite comic. And what are we do do with our hard work after this is deleted? Consider this a warning: if this gets deleted, I will reccomend it be undeleted in Deletion Review IMMEDIATELY. The article needs a fresh start, if anything. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman">Crazyswordsman</a> 19:08, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Wikipedia should be a place for people to read about things that aren't notable to the outside world". To an extent, yes, I agree. That's the charm of Wikipedia; the arcane knowledge. But there has to be a line drawn. Wikipedia's agreed-upon notability guidelines do a good job at drawing the line. To have <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">every Joe's garage band</a>, or <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">every Tom's autobiography</a> on Wikipedia would be lame. I think that a Wiki dedicated to freely cataloguing every piece of creative expression ever, no matter how unnotable, could possibly be a good idea, but that's not Wikipedia's goal. There are plenty of places on this wonderufl Internet for people to freely express themselves; <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeviantArt_94f5.html" title="DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/GeoCities_d428.html" title="GeoCities">GeoCities</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a>, so on and so on, it's almost silly to expend so much energy pushing to keep this in Wikipedia. You folks obviously resent this Bob and George comic, and I think that's what's motivating you. However, I must note that
<ul>
<li>A) you haven't proven that this comic predated Bob and George or any other sprite comic, despite numerous requests to do so.</li>
<li>B) You yet to realize that even if this article is deleted, it will still be fully credited as the first sprite comic in <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_comic.html" title="Sprite comic">the article on sprite comics</a> until someone changes it. It's never fun to lose hard work, but this article is fully replicated on the webcomic wiki, and Jay Resop has offered to host it on your website. You could register 50 LJ accounts and post it 50 times on each one if you wanted to. Is this an issue of hard work and dedication to creating encyclopedic knowledge, or an issue of wanting your friend to be recognized as a talent? I understand you fully if it's the latter. I have myriad friends whose artistic genius is unrecognized by the ignorant masses, but Wikipedia is not the place to fight these kind of battles. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 03:44, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
