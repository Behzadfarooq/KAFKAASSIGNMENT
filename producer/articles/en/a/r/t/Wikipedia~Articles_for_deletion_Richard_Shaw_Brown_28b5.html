<p>Work through this with me and let's see if we can figure this one out. Here we have a person with two careers, neither of which seem notable enough for an article. First, some metainfo:</p>
<ul>
<li>An article on this subject was speedied as nonnotable bio, recreated, speedied as repost (which was wrong, repost only applies to AfD-deleted articles), recreated. So clearly deletion of this article via speedy is contested, thus we are here.</li>
<li>It appears that the subject of the article is also the author of the article, for whatever that's worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on the content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brown was the singer/songwriter for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Misunderstood_b390.html" title="The Misunderstood">The Misunderstood</a>, who have an article, and per <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll" rel="nofollow">their entry in allmusic.com</a> certainly should, notwithstanding that Brown appears to be a major contributor and perhaps creator of the article.
<ul>
<li>But, are The Misunderstood notable enough so that any of the members deserve their own articles? They are not really a <i>very</i> notable band, so I do not think that they are. There is nothing useful in Brown's article that isn't in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Misunderstood_b390.html" title="The Misunderstood">The Misunderstood</a> article. <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Saxon_bc24.html" title="Sky Saxon">Sky Saxon</a> has an article (which I personally think he shouldn't), but then <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Seeds_1508.html" title="The Seeds">The Seeds</a> are a <i>lot</i> more notable than The Misunderstood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, there is material on Brown's later career, as a jewelry maker.
<ul>
<li>It seems clear that this material is vanity/spam, which doesn't <i>prove</i> that Brown is not notable, but is seldom a good sign. We have <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Sirikit_Navaratna_9f4e.html" title="Queen Sirikit Navaratna">this article</a> on a piece of jewelry he made (same author), and we have this: Planetary Gemologist (same author). It is as a Planetry Gemologist that Brown claims notability - but he himself wrote the Planetary Gemologist article, and recently too.</li>
<li>But then, on <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/main.html" class="external text" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">his website</a>, he claims several books (but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Astral-Gemstone-Talismans-VOOM-Designs/dp/9740716334/sr=1-1/qid=1169713247/ref=sr_1_1/105-4108581-1264432?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Astral-Gemstone-Talismans-VOOM-Designs/dp/9740716334/sr=1-1/qid=1169713247/ref=sr_1_1/105-4108581-1264432?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">the only one on Amazon</a> is listed as "self-published", and at least some of <a href="http://www.agt-gems.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=41" class="external text" title="http://www.agt-gems.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=41" rel="nofollow">the others</a> appear to be just catalogs of his jewelry) and several <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-tv.html" class="external text" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-tv.html" rel="nofollow">interviews etc. on Thai television</a>, which ought to count for something, I suppose.</li>
<li>And as an aside, <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-schools.html" class="external text" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-schools.html" rel="nofollow">claims to have founded several <i>schools</i></a>, which if true would in my opinion be the main thread on which to hang his notability - but no information beyond the bare name of the schools are given, which seems odd. Certainly founding several schools would get a bigger place in his CV, you'd think.</li>
<li>And this is all on <i>his website</i>. I didn't find any useful third-party material, although I could have missed it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It all seems a bit fishy to me. I do not think this person is notable, what do you think? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 08:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, there is hardly a quarrel with notability, certainly though with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Unless somebody cleans it up by end of this AfD it should be deleted <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 15:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: I do not find anything notable in a member of a minor band turned artisan. He is surely great at doing what he does, but so are billions of people. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 18:04, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete if not cleaned</b> - I have been in comms. with <a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">User:Rsbj66</a> (A.k.a. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Shaw_Brown_310c.html" title="Richard Shaw Brown">Richard Shaw Brown</a>) for a few weeks and either he does not understand what is stated on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or is ignoring my suggestions/warnings. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Misunderstood_b390.html" title="The Misunderstood">The Misunderstood</a> is notable enough of a band for draft-dodgers during the Vietnam War, and several articles about them have been published by third party sources. They even appear in one book titled "100 Greatest Psychedellic Bands", but the selection process for this list is unclear. Since RSB is the center of the draft-doging history of the band, RSB on this subject alone, is <b>notable</b>. The fact that RSB escaped to India, like many other hippies, is part of his notability, and being baptized a Hindu is very important to his character - <b>but his notability stops there</b>. His later life as a "gemologist", a spiritual profession, is worth only a blurb in his biography. Readers, may they be fans of the band or not, would probably find the story more fantastic if he doesn't bring himself down to earth with awards and accomplishments. As for the other articles of his, I have also tagged them for speedy deletion, as it only adds fluff to his own self. Rsbj66 has no need to infect Wikipedia when he has so many of his own sites at his disposal. -- <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmana_7e3b.html" title="User:Emana">Emana</a> 19:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This seems to be well referenced and I'm not seeing a lot of promotional hype etc. The award is not prominent in the article and demonstrates that he has minor notability beyond the music. I think that there is more interesting information here than can be practically merged to the article about the band. An autobio is not prohibited, although it should be a red-flag for closer scrutiny --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 21:14, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with those references are that they are mostly original research by Brown himself. Also, they lack information on how to get a hold of the source material (URL, publisher, ISBN, etc.). I know they are not there, because I asked Rsbj66 for the info when I was reformatting the page. It could be all made up. Just listing names of books don't mean that the article is well sourced and well cited. I agree that Brown does have an interesting story to tell, and doing so without following good Wikipedian practices does himself a disservice. -- <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmana_7e3b.html" title="User:Emana">Emana</a> 21:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>What award? The only awards I see are <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-awards.html" class="external text" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-awards.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and these are the kind of awards anyone should be able to pick up in return for a ride to the airport. Finalist (not winner) in one small category, by a marketing association that only <i>exists</i> to give out awards and do other marketing-type stuff, I assume. Who doesn't have a plaque like this in their cubicle? And that's the best one. Unless I'm missing a more notable award? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:57, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi friends, The International Herald Tribune article was in "TasteMakers" ("An occasional series about people for whom style is a way of life") by Andrew Ranard On Oct 31, 1995.

<li>The Misunderstood are extremely significant historically. Their single, "I Can Take You To The Sun", was released at the beginning of December 1966 by Philips/Fontana Records in England.. It is considered one of the first authentically "psychedelic" records, predating the first releases by Pibk Floyd and Jimi Hendrix. Legendary BBC DJ John Peel referred to it on many occasions as one of "the best records ever made." In fact, he kept a copy in a special box of records, see this article in The Times of London online: <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14932-1836864,00.html" class="external free" title="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14932-1836864,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14932-1836864,00.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In Rolling Stone (Sept 2, 2004) David Fricke wrote: "Two weeks after that September '66 session, Jimi Hendrix arrived in the UK and became all the rage, the immigrant acid king. But the Misunderstood got there first. Hear the proof." <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikestax_3a06.html" title="User:Mikestax">Mikestax</a> 18:04, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The group's entry in the All Music Guide was not written by Richard Brown, but by Richie Unterberger.

<dd>Mikestax, thanks for the references, but nobody is thinking about deleting the article about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Misunderstood_b390.html" title="The Misunderstood">The Misunderstood</a>. The issue at stake here is whether or not Richard Brown in himself, and his activities during and after his association with the Misunderstood, are notable enough to deserve an independent article. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 18:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, to help establish post-music notability I have listed 11. published books with ISBN, plus links to 200 articles published, and 30 TV appearences, which is a large amount of exposure for any expat in Thailand in history.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is all very good and interesting, but not quite relevant with respect to notability as meant <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">in Wikipedia</a>. For instance, in WP, "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and <b>independent of the subject itself</b> and each other" (my emphasis). So, one tries to understand if the person/event/thing has attracted external attention from magazines, book, web sites, independently from the work by the subject himself. If you list your work, it might be useful for people interested in your work, but as for notability it just amounts to "I did lot of stuff". Everybody here has done lot of stuff (books, children, pies, travels...). It remains to be seen whether the person doing this stuff is notable or not. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 14:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, You wrote, "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and <b>independent of the subject itself</b> and each other" &lt;---More than 200 magazines and newspapers have written news and praise about us, such as feature news articles in International Herald Tribune, Singapore Business Times, Asia Magazine, National Jeweler (USA), Jewelers Circular Keystone, and a list of others. We have all these published articles. Mainly, no Westerner has ever gotten so much coverage in Thai history. You ask for only a few, so in the article I list two references to international articles on our notability. So according to what you stated I DO qualify for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I see your other pages, such as by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Giuliano_c42c.html" title="Geoffrey Giuliano">Geoffrey Giuliano</a> that are 100% original research without a single reference but his one-sided self-plaise page is on Wikipedia!?&lt;---it is VERY misleading. At least everything I have written is "true" and my notability is "respectable." Please take another look at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Shaw_Brown_310c.html" title="Richard Shaw Brown">Richard Shaw Brown</a> and I give over 15 references on the page now. And it's all true and notable. Best wishes--<a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">Rsbj66</a> 15:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Richard, thanks for signalling the Giuliano article, which has been immediately tagged as possible original research, and perhaps will be proposed for deletion. You could have done so yourself! In fact, it is perhaps better for you to edit articles not directly pertaining you or your activity. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> himself has been frowned upon for having edited the article about himself. So, thanks for the material you provided. But apart from it, of course you cannot judge yourself its notability or relevance.</dd>
<dd>It seems that the general consensus is not against you. So what I suggest is, leave things alone, let people consider your article for its merits and, if you like, you are welcome to contribute to other articles! --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 16:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Goochelaar, thanks for the good advice. I'll follow that. Best wishes--<a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">Rsbj66</a> 21:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, who is <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikestax_3a06.html" title="User:Mikestax">User:Mikestax</a>? His name sounds awfully familar. Oh, yes, he's the guy from UT magazine. -- <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmana_7e3b.html" title="User:Emana">Emana</a> 21:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>---Mike Stax is also owner of UT Records as well as his magazine. He did a multi issue story on The Misunderstood in his Ugly Things Music Magazine, prior to which he did 4 years of research on the band, tracking down all the members and really getting the facts straight. His study is considered the full story, and may be expanded into another book on the subject. He has also written a 550 pages double screen play for a motion picture on the band and my aftermath.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to consider in my case is that during the time I played a major role in building 2 schools in India and One school in Nepal (all still running) during that time I was a fugitive from the Vietnam massacre and in India under an assumed (different) name. So it's a really strange situation where I built 3 schools but can't find credit for it in my real name. An example story of how one of the schools was built is at <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/mysticarticles/nandagram.html" class="external free" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/mysticarticles/nandagram.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.richardshawbrown.com/mysticarticles/nandagram.html</a> and I think you might find it interesting as an adventure, worlds apart from the USA. Remember, apart from being a war objector fugative, I was a sudden Rock Star with ego, turned into a pennyless egoless monk in a stone age ashram with no electricity or running water. It was cave man style, where humility way MOST highly respected, and I was only Westerner. So it is quite a contrast from lead singer to nobody outcast. But the Point is I cannot take credit for building 3 schools because of different name and primative conditions. This was back in 1971, long before the PC, and WAY long before the WWW.--<a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">Rsbj66</a> 22:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you have done other notable work, put it in the article, with a 3rd party source, and then perhaps draw it to our attention here. Regardless of prior history of the article, if all of it has solid sources it may well survive.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mike Stax is an open reference who has researched and published articles on Rick Brown and his band in his magazine. His magazine is one of the references given. He lives in California. I live in Thailand. I have no control over his mail or input. I did mention to him to see this talk page and give any reference if possible. He has written his own thing.--<a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">Rsbj66</a> 19:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
