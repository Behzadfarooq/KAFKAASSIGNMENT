<p>Fictional character from TV cartoon show. Article is all original research, has been here for over a year and has no references, and I could not find independent reliable and verifiable sources where this cartoon character was a principal subject as required by <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. A mention in the article about the show should suffice. Appears to lack reliable independent sources adequate to support a stand-alone article. Liking the show or character does not confer notability, and does not justify creating a spew of articles sourced only to the show itself or to the producer's website or fansites and blogs. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiaolin_Showdown_9cb1.html" title="Xiaolin Showdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a>. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines suggest that there shouldn't be an article purely on this character, particularly if it's entirely in-universe. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:09, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm, in light of below a redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Xiaolin_Showdown_characters_802f.html" title="List of Xiaolin Showdown characters">List of Xiaolin Showdown characters</a> would be better, and if there's already information there, then you can't merge. Given my lack of familiarity with the character's importance in the show, I'm not going to express strong views, but in general I don't think we need long in-universe articles on single characters. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 23:29, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do not merge article</b>. Frankly, I don't care if you keep this article or delete it, but as its creator I must insist that you do not merge this article with any others. All this information used to belong on the <i><a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiaolin_Showdown_9cb1.html" title="Xiaolin Showdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></i> article, but because it got so big, I moved it to the <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Xiaolin_Showdown_characters_802f.html" title="List of Xiaolin Showdown characters">List of Xiaolin Showdown characters</a></i> article. In the end it became too big even for that and needed to be separated from the list. Either keep the article or delete it all. Do not merge. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf_ODonnell_36b5.html" title="User:Wolf ODonnell">Wolf ODonnell</a> 21:53, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or at least merge to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Xiaolin_Showdown_characters_802f.html" title="List of Xiaolin Showdown characters">List of Xiaolin Showdown characters</a>. Sure, the article could stand to be rewritten and copy-edited, but this is one of the major heroes of the show, and as such, I'd say an article would be appropriate for him. If not, then given that there is an article on the characters in this show, he should at least be there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:03, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>BTW, since there are at least 6 other articles on characters in this show, you really should mention what you want done about them. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:04, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> If the other characters have good sources they should stay, and if thay are pure unsourced original research they should go. I have not looked at them. If each character had a paragraph or so with an illustration in the article for the show, that might be all the coverage justified until a character has reliable independent coverage. The same standards should apply as for anything else. Notability is not a matter of whether something is interesting to someone, it is a matter of whether it has been noted.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:54, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The quality of the article in this case is not related to the reason for keeping. As a major character in a notable television show (being broadcast on a major nationwide television network), I'd say Wikipedia should have some information on him. Is this article the best way to do that? No, I wouldn't say that, as it needs a bit of work. However, I don't know that I object to an individual article on him, or any of the other major characters of the show.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and Wolf ODonnell.

<p>Keep but rewrite. If you Delate Omi, You must Deleate the others's pages.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> if only because this is the main character of a very popular television show. If you are upset that the content is not up to stuff, then edit the article. Deletion is not a solution for articles that need improvement. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 23:10, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Comment</b> as nominator. If there are no independent reliable sources, there can never be a stand alone article, and improvement cannot be achieved. . "ILIKEIT" is not a basis for notability. Saying it is popular does not prove notability. If he is a character in a popular show, then have a paragraph about him in an article about the show. An article based only on one's viewing the show is original research and should be deleted. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 04:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You know, you already nominated it, you don't need to weigh in again with the same argument. If you want to respond to people, respond to them, don't just repeat yourself. It might appear misleading to an administrator. As it stands, I would say that the problem with the article is more a clean-up issue, and less a notability one. There is no argument that Wikipedia should have an article on Xiaolin Showdown, and that this character will be covered in it. I'd be satisfied with a redirect myself, leaving the further expansion of the article to some future need should it arise. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is a certain part of the writing about fiction guidelines being completely ignored here. "Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article." Both the main article and the list of characters are quite long. This seems to call only for clean up and rewriting, not deletion. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 21:52, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> But the length of the material cannot justify a stand alone article if it is all original research. No sources are provided. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:35, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Tag any particular statement you feel is original research with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} and I'll remove any statements of fan opinion and cite any direct fact to the appropriate episode, some things were explicitly stated but may seem to be an opinion. It'll take a lot more work to make a "Concept and creation" section, but deleting the article won't inspire people to do any research. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 01:09, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
