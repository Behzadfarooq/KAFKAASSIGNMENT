<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s>. The first problem I have with this here is that it's been covered (at least, so says the article), but there's nothing to back it up. The second part I have is that it's also rather opinionated - as it comes from a Libertarian POV, it is going to be easy to violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> here. I think, though, that if the first problem is taken care of, eventually the second problem will take care of itself.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, let me say that the index itself (and <b>not the article</b>) is quite POV (see <a href="http://www.stateofworldliberty.org/report/methodology.html" class="external text" title="http://www.stateofworldliberty.org/report/methodology.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for methodology).

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems to have a strong POV to capitalist based western living, in that its point bases is based on people being able to do capitalist things such as personally buying land, that simply don't apply in other ecenomic based counteries. It seems to be a private (and poor) attempt at measuring living standards by captialist freedom. Reguardless of that, the web site itself does not pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and the index itself is not notable (mainly due to no one using it as per the above POV issues it has).--155.144.251.120 03:09, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks quite interesting to me. But include a table, with flags, wiklinks, etc., to make the whole thing more visual, and easier to follow. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 03:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this article in order to allow Wikipedia readers to access information which I feel is valuable and interesting. Furthermore, the information presented is verifiable (by looking at the project webpage and looking at secondary sources, which can be found with a Google search). Regarding the POV comments, please note Black Falcon's statement above that the Index is POV, not the article (just like an article about the <a href="../../../k/l/u/Klu_Klux_Klan_07cc.html" title="Klu Klux Klan">Klu Klux Klan</a>, for example). Also, the objections explicitly raised in the nomination are invalid:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The Index webpage is linked to multiple times in the article text and as an E.L... a pretty valid source when the question at hand is the content of the Index. (<i>contra</i>: "Has no reliable sources or references to the 'index'.")</li>
<li>The article certainly does not fail <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> -- it is mentioned and cited by numerous sources.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>However, an implicit objection was made which might be valid: non-notability. ("Appears to have been made up by one person". Note, however, that the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_relativity.html" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_%28novel%29.html" title="Ulysses (novel)">Ulysses</a> were made up by one person.) I don't know on what criteria "notability" ought to be evaluated in this case, but I invite those editors who have not yet done so to read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_Arguments_e228.html#Arguments_against_deleting_articles_for_non-notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments">Arguments against deleting articles for non-notability</a> before voting against the article on that basis (and also to perform a Google search and note the numerous references to the Index). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 04:00, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Note also that Notability is not a specified requirement for Wikipedia articles. Articles are only required to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, avoid being <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, and this article meets all of those qualifications. The "Notability" criterion which is often brought up in deletion discussions is done so (legitimately) usually because of concerns relating to the Verifiability requirement, but since the article only attempts to report on the contents of the Index (and these can be easily verified at the project webpage, which is linked from the article), such a non-notability criticism is not legitimate in this context. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 04:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> this article badly fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> currently due to the "Libretarian Philosophy" section. Also, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger">Dave_Runger</a>, please be aware that your arguments on the inclusion criteria are somewhat suspect. First of all, while <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> is not in itself an ABSOLUTE requirement for inclusion in Wikipedia, it is an ABSOLUTELY valid reason for deletion as well as a guideline accepted by the majority of Wikipedia editors for both purposes. Further, google hits are not an accurate gauge of notability, they should only be used as anecdotal evidence in concert with other sources of information. Also note that <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> explains that "valuable and interesting" (as you and another have described the article in this discussion) are not themselves valid reasons for inclusion in Wikipedia. Even if we momentarily accept the premise of your argument, this article still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Sources must be from reliable, third-party <i>published</i> sources, especially in a case like this in which the subject matter concerns a global review and is based on other, similar lists (which do, by the way, satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). If sources are included, such as printed newspaper, magazine, and/or journal articles, and the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issue is addressed, I see no reason why this article needs to be deleted. However as it stands right now, I have to say delete. I can very easily create an index of similar sorts, that measures some arbitrary concept, find real research to back up my rankings, and calculate the index based on that evidence. Then I could just as easily plant this information online, maybe spread it around a bit, have it cited by some blogs, create a wikipedia entry for it, and maybe submit it to Digg or Fark. Even if I do all of these things, it would still not fit into an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 23:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>How is the "Libertarian Philosophy" section POV? The index website <i>itself</i> says that it is libertarian-oriented. The index was created by "Nick Wilson, an activist and co-founder of the Libertarian Reform Caucus, an organization working to turn the United States Libertarian Party into a viable political party". That section is not stating anything that the website itself does not admit to. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:26, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The section has a point of view. It is not saying that the founder is Libretarian, or that the index is Libretarian, it is saying a combination of those things intended to put forth a point of view. Wikipedia is not a soapbox. Even if this were not the case, I believe the article has further problems, thank you for only addressing one of them and ignoring the rest. --<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 07:27, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>There's no need for sarcasm. I still don't see how the section is POV. "Pro-individual freedom, pro-economic freedom and pro-limited government stance" are, in fact, the very tenets of libertarianism. If it quacks, walks, and looks like a duck, it's not POV to call it a duck. However, to satisfy the concerns you've raised, I will replace it with a more neutral and better-sourced section tomorrow. Also, I did not "ignore the rest", but rather focused on what I perceived to be the most important. So, to reply to the other points you've raised:</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> is a guideline which I belive should be followed (my agreement with <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger">User:Dave Runger</a> above was about the frequent conflation of notability and verifiability. However, this index is noted in a number of sources, which I will add to the article (again, tomorrow). However, as a Google search will show, the index and its rankings are discussed by a number of sources (in my opinion unforunately as I believe the index to be a terrible cross-national indicator of "liberty").</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. I'm not sure to whom you were referring, but I personally don't like the index. In any case, this is a a criticism of "keep" votes rather than a reason to delete (and I think you have appropriately used it as the former).</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is about "verifiability" rather than being "verified". Most of the information in the article is in fact already verified, and that which is not is certainly verifiable.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In all fairness, you did state that "If sources are included, such as printed newspaper, magazine, and/or journal articles, and the WP:NPOV issue is addressed, I see no reason why this article needs to be deleted." My comment was not intended to dismiss your arguments, but rather to try to understand why you perceived that section to be POV. I hope you will take a look at the revised version of the article and re-evaluate your position in light of its new state.

This article only represents the <i>subjective evaluation</i> of the State of World Liberty Project's founder. Therefore, his published views on the internet and citations of the Index by other sources is quite enough to establish <i>verifiably</i> that the Wikipedia article is, in fact, accurate in the claims it makes. The Wikipedia article is written in a NPOV, even if the index is not. Furthermore, the Wikipedia article is not a piece of original research. (The article merely reports on research/analysis done by the State of World Liberty Project, which in turn is based on the work of reputable organizations such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Heritage_Foundation_4ef6.html" title="The Heritage Foundation">The Heritage Foundation</a>/<a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_House_082a.html" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a><a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporters_Without_Borders_f790.html" title="Reporters Without Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>, etc.).

Deletion votes seem to be based either on the erroneous belief that notability is a necessary quality of Wikipedia articles (though the Index might be "notable" anyhow) and a misunderstanding that a NPOV policy means that the subjects described in articles must have a NPOV. This is utterly false; the articles themselves are, however, required to be written with no POV. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 09:52, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Could you please clarify, I'm <i>very</i> confused. I'm working on trying to improve the article and just can't see where the hell the POV in the article is. The first paragraph is this:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The State of World Liberty Index is a ranking of countries according to the degree of economic and personal freedoms which their citizens enjoy; each country is given a score between 0 and 100. The Index defines freedom as "the ability for the individual to live their lives as they choose, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others to do the same." Only one report (the 2006 State of World Liberty Index, released 12 August 2006) has yet been produced by the State of World Liberty Project, but the organization has stated that it will continue to release updated reports annually.[1] 159 countries were ranked in the 2006 report.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Where is the POV? It is a ranking of countries according to freedom. Maybe it's not a good ranking, but it's a ranking nonetheless. The definition of "freedom" is a quote. And only one report has been produced--that's a fact as well. I'm not sure where you see it as presented "as if it were objective and factual". I do not think this is a good index, but I can't see what problem people are having with the article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:44, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
