<p>It's a mess. OK, here we go. There are 3 related articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a>, small Greek town; (dab notice put on top)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>, French village (dab notice now put on top by myself);</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> etc. It turned out that "Servia" is an archaic (pre-1920s) English term for Serbia (found in e.g. Catholic Encyclopedia and 1911 Britannica etc.). See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Serbia#The_Inclusion_of_the_name_.22Servia.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Serbia#The_Inclusion_of_the_name_.22Servia.22" rel="nofollow">related talk</a> on Talk:Serbia. Now, <a href="../../../r/9/t/User%7ER9tgokunks_6dd1.html" title="User:R9tgokunks">R9tgokunks</a> (<a href="../../../r/9/t/User_talk%7ER9tgokunks_17b3.html" title="User talk:R9tgokunks">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_R9tgokunks_659c.html" title="Special:Contributions/R9tgokunks">contribs</a>) has unilaterally moved things around quite a bit, which I attempted to fix by reverting and putting dab-notices at top of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, that fixes the issues, and this article has turned out as unnecessary and orphan. Now, I didn't want to stretch <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> G6 (housekeeping), as the article was subject to a <a href="../../../h/i/s/Special%7EHistory_Servian_%28disambiguation%29_8fcc.html" title="Special:History/Servian (disambiguation)">revert war</a>. (Plus, there are potential COI issues of mine: the attempts to use term "Servia" in Serbia-related articles were taken as trolling rightly or wrongly). <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 09:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>What am I missing here? It looks like a valid disambig, but you're right, it's terribly ugly. What do you propose? We delete it, then start from scratch? It would be fine with me. I'm going to try to refactor it now; <a href="../../../i/f/f/Iff.html" title="Iff">iff</a> he doesn't revert though, then I say <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 09:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Like I tried to say, it's complicated. The original layout of articles was as it is now, minus this dab page. Then R9tgokunks moved the French commune to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian_%28commune%29.html" title="Servian (commune)">Servian (commune)</a>, and made a redirect from <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a> to Servian (disambiguation). Instead, I tried to overcome the problem by ensuring that top-page dabs are at <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>. This dab page is now simply... unnecessary. Nothing points to it, no one will arrive at it, and it basically contains only two items, which are already cross-linked. I don't see a point in keeping it. Like I said, I didn't want to stretch CSD G6 and delete it myself. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 10:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe go <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, request a move from the commune back to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">servian</a>, and place a dab header at the top (though it looks like we're already de facto at that point with the redirect going to the commune now). <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 10:27, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Uh-oh. It seems we still misunderstand each other: at the moment, there aren't <i>any</i> redirects involved. I <i>am</i> an admin, therefore I technically had the tools to sort things out, and I used them to an extent to revert the things to the previous state (i.e. moved <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian_%28commune%29.html" title="Servian (commune)">Servian (commune)</a> back to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>), and decided to let the community sort this mess out via this AfD (which also has the capacity of renaming/merging). <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> is the hard and unreliable way (trust me, I closed many with 3 votes). I could have just <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignored all rules</a> and sort things out as I thought it was best, but I wanted to hear some outside opinions. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 10:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Gasp! You deleted used the tools to remove to a bad redirect?! <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">How dare you?</a> Well, according to the talk page Servia is an old name for Serbia, so I say, <b>keep</b>, as it's notable. Unless you can convince me otherwise before I get off, which is in like two minutes. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 10:46, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Erm, yes. I didn't say that "Servia" wasn't a notable term for Serbia (although it's <b>very</b> outfashioned); just, it's supposed to be sorted out via top-page dabs at <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a> (and a notice to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> should be added, like I said on Talk:Serbia) rendering this page useless. How can anyone arrive to this page when it's orphaned? (except for this AfD). If anyone suggests a better organization of things, I'm all ear. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 10:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It <i>is</i> a little confusing to have a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a> and a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>. I wouldn't personally mind having a top edit dab at both pages linking to each other, but it seems easier to just have a top edit dab at every page linking to Servian (disambiguation). No? Considering it is a notable term, I think it's worth being noted on WP. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 11:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Suggestion</b>. Leave the commune at <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian_%28commune%29.html" title="Servian (commune)">Servian (commune)</a>. Move the Greek town to Servia (Greek town) (or something). Leave <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> right where it is. Move the disambiguation page to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a>. Redirect <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a> to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a>. Delete the Servian (disambiguation) page as redundant and an unlikely search term.

<li>I think that since it refers to "Servian", 1st point Servia should be scrapped from this, and 3rd point turned into an earlier form of "Serbian" i.e. "Servian". Otherwise it's not making much sense. --Abu-Bakr69 13:53, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
