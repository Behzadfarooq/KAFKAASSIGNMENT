<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. As it can be seen below, the debate was not primarily focused on the noteworthiness of the subject of the article but a lot of the keep recommendations were " <i>per Rebecca</i> ", and indeed, JzG also implied that he would have suggested a delete under more peaceful circumstances. For the record CSD G4 does not hold, as you can see by reading the restored deleted versions from October 2005 that at that stage the subject was only a university leader, but now she is a nationwide leader of NUS - G4 applies to things recreated with similar (or worse) content than when it was previously deleted. Perhaps a proper debate at a later time when we are all focussed on content would be prudent. Feel free to inquire about my decision.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> as bad-faith nomination. This is the second article I've edited recently that appears to have been AfDd by this guy today as <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> retaliation for having voted to delete <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Battaglia_18ae.html" title="Stephen Battaglia">Stephen Battaglia</a> and Zazz, both of which were authored by the nominator. As to Jackson's notability, she is the current president of a major national union, something which is clearly evident in the article. The "tags" referred to were bogus verifiability tags that kept being re-added despite requests to explain what, if anything, was actually disputed. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 07:41, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For the record, an old version of this article was successfully AfDd last October, but that version was a) before Jackson reached her current office and was still non-notable, and b) an attack article. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 08:00, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article had been put up for AFD and was deleted before. It's not in bad faith as Rebecca is trying to twist, Many people voted in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Battaglia_18ae.html" title="Stephen Battaglia">Stephen Battaglia</a> and Zazz and i have nominated 2 out of how many users and article, The student union which she is president has 2 other past presidents that have there own page, 1 is now a politician but the other has the same ammount of info as Rose. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Office_Bearers_of_the_National_Union_of_Students_of_Australia_a343.html" title="List of Office Bearers of the National Union of Students of Australia">List of Office Bearers of the National Union of Students of Australia</a> is also up for AFD. Feedyourfeet 08:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The AfD'd article was substantially different. It was deleted without prejudice, as I understand it. Also, the article does make an assertion of notability; "vandalism" isn't a reason to delete an article and what you allege wasn't vandalism anyway. The prod tag says, "<b>You may remove this message if you</b> improve the article, or if you otherwise <b>object to deletion of the article for any reason</b>." The person who removed the prod provided references on the talk page. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 08:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It was not the prod tag i was refering to. Feedyourfeet 08:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, if it was the verify and importance tags, CHANLORD made an assertion of importance and 4 references on the talk page. And even if it was "vandalism," that isn't a reason to delete the article. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 08:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would advocate deletion - student leaders change annually and usually go on to obscurity - but the fact that this is self-evidently a bad-faith nomination indicates a speedy close. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:35, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>This makes no sense, as there is absolutely no way the (relatively strict) G4 criteria can be attached to this article. An attack article was created in October 2005 about Jackson, who was then president of the student union at the University of Sydney. It was, entirely justifiably, deleted. In the meantime, Jackson has become president of the National Union of Students, which has put her on the national stage, and a neutral, verifiable article has been written about her. This is not a situation covered in any way, shape or form, by G4. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 09:01, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Being student politician certainly isn't notable, and president of the NUS would only very slightly increase her notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> I thought the previous AfD version was better, certainly more interesting and noteworthy. Oh, and I think you may be overstating the importance of the NUS as "a major union" <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Er, it was also utterly defamatory and completely unsourced. Please don't confuse the matter of whether you <i>like</i> the subject with their <i>notability</i>. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 09:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not confused. I [edit: could probably] agree that the office is notable. The subject is not notable, not yet, anyway. Those two are quite distinct, just like separate legal identity of a company and its members. My reference to the relative importance of the NUS is that Australian student politics is a subset of (&gt;)Australian politics&gt;Australian people&gt;Australia&gt;Southern Hemisphere&gt;the world, and it's important to keep that in perspective. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> with a <b>comment</b>. Since there is an article on the student union in question, perhaps a section of that article should be devoted to a list of officers past and present.
