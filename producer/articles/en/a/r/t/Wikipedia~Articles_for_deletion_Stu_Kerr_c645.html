I was going to vote keep but our article on <a href="../../../b/o/z/Bozo_the_Clown_0be1.html" title="Bozo the Clown">Bozo the Clown</a> said it was a franchised show with each area having its own Bozo. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willard_Scott_9dc4.html" title="Willard Scott">Willard Scott</a> was arguably the most notable. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 07:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think the assumption (especially as it is laid out in the nomination) that because a news personality didn't do network then they don't have talent is uncivil and unfair to the subject. There are many reasons for declining a national network job (relocating family, change in lifestyle, etc) that keep alot of very talented broadcasters in their local market. In regards to Bozo, yes there were several local Bozos but that still doesn't decline the notability of that particular local Bozos. Many, many children who grew up in Baltimore area (and DC too) who want to look up info on their Bozo are not going to want to read about Willard Scott. They're going to want to read about Stu Kerr. I also think we're not giving enough credit for his service to children's television including his role in shaping Kevin Clash's career--without whom we would have never had the Elmo phenomenon. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 16:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Comment: Nominations like this are a bit insulting, and it would be much better if we avoiding trying to insult our subjects. Ill will is bred that way. Even if the authors are well-known for their obsessiveness with inappropriate content (the Philadelphia news watcher has been around for a long time, and he or she keeps churning these things out), we have no need to be insulting. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- he was on Kaptain Kangeroo, and that only <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> above so far gave a non-ridiculous sounding (implied) reason for delete.

<li><b>Keep" - Not sure if my last edit went through. Stu Kerr was an integral part of early television in Baltimore. I had the honor of meeting Stu while a broadcasting student and he shared that "The Early Riser" (where he did his janitor character) was a staple of early television because a good part of the show was improvised. Stu was also the host of the popular "Dialing for Dollars" for several years on WMAR TV. Deleting Stu's contributions would be a major loss because media students would be unable to read about one of the pioneers of childrens' shows and the days of early television.
