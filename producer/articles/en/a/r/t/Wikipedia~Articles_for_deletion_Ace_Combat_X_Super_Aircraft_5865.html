<li><b>Keep</b> Gone from a merge to a delete eh? You guys just don't quit do you? As I recall, there was once a proposal to delete an article regarding another super plane from Ace Combat 4, the <a href="../../../x/-/0/X-02_Wyvern_925e.html" title="X-02 Wyvern">X-02</a> Many things were proposed including adding it to a list of all Ace Combat fictional aircraft, merging it with AC4, and just Keeping it. The result was a "Keep, no consensus".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now perhaps you people don't care but I know when I was a new fan I looked everywhere for information regarding this Fictional plane becasue I thought it was real and wanted to learn more about it, and I know I'm not the only one, had there been a Wikipedia article about it at the time it would have made things a LOT easier. They used to have indevidual articles for these aircraft but people argued there wasnt enough info to make one article so they combined them all into one, the one that is now being proposed to be deleted entirely.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Oh, and The Kinslayer "some people involved with the articles" dislike it when other people who know absolutely nothing about the subject make massive deleations to them. <a href="../../../c/b/a/User%7ECbale2000_6999.html" title="User:Cbale2000">Cbale2000</a> 17:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Articles with this outcome are often re-nominated (usually after a month's waiting period) to help find a concensus.

<dd>It doesn't matter if we own the game or not. We're discussing the article about the game and not the game itself. Some have suggested that this article goes into so much minute detail that it violates core <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia content policies</a>. Since you asked: "Fancruft is a term sometimes used in Wikipedia to imply that a selection of content is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question. While "fancruft" is often a succinct and frank description of such accumulations, it also implies that the content is unimportant and the contributor's judgement of notability is lacking." (See:<a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFANCRUFT_101a.html" title="WP:FANCRUFT">WP:FANCRUFT</a> for more info. There are several guidelines and policies which relate to the term. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">General Notability</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">Fiction Notability</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">Writing about fiction</a>. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 00:54, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> to Ace Combat X Super Aircraft per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> for now. (If the entire series or articles on fictional airplanes was put up for deletion, I'd vote <b>transwiki/delete</b> because of the previously mentioned precendent. One by one AFDs often lead to confusing and uneven enforcement of policy.) The target article is very light on substance. (It has one large table a few paragraphs of text.) <a href="../../../x/-/0/X-02_Wyvern_925e.html" title="X-02 Wyvern">X-02 Wyvern</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/f/ADF-01_Falken_0f27.html" title="ADF-01 Falken">ADF-01 Falken</a>, and <a href="../../../x/f/a/XFA-27_5b76.html" title="XFA-27">XFA-27</a> should be summarized on the page. <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenrir_%28Ace_Combat%29_edc3.html" title="Fenrir (Ace Combat)">Fenrir (Ace Combat)</a> should be merged to the page.

<dd>AGH WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE NOT GET!!! it is not fancruft, and don't give me policies I've already read over and over, and you still have yet to give me any examples as to what you mean, most of the unlocking parts have been taken out. And Fenrir is a super weapon, not a part of a damn main article plus if we were to merge it, it would look like the most freakin long and retarded looking article I've ever written and I've written some pretty long articles.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 03:08, 23 December 2006 (UTC) A true Hrebro</dd>

<dd>Have any of your "pretty long articles" gone over the <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">size limits?</a> The merge point article that I suggested is rather small in size. There is no reason not to merge it per the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">Fiction guidelines</a>. In fact, those guidelines say that an article on this should not be split up unless an <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">encyclopedic</a> treatment of the article is made. That means citing sources outside of the primary.</dd>
<dd>Anyway: <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">In-universe statement</a>: "It is believed that the XR-45 Cariburn may be a very early prototype of what will one day evolve into Neucom Inc's Radical- series aircraft, the R-101, R-102, and R-103." <i>It is believed</i> is a weasel statement. Just who believes this? Why do we care jets follow its design path? What impact does it have outside of the plotline of the game? This is very much like "cruft" ... it's the gunk that builds up in atticles. It's very much centered to fans of the game. People who don't know what the game is should be able to read the sentece and understand the context and the reasoning for things.</dd>
<dd>"The materials which it is created out of and how it is structured make it very cost effective, reliable and easy to maintain on the frontlines." Why do we care that it is cost effective and easy to maintain? Is it part of the game play? You walk a fine line here, though... you could easily go into gameplay.</dd>
<dd>"The YR-302 is the first aircraft of it's size to use a <b>pheonominal</b> four jet engine system, rather than the typical one or two. The Fregata is the <b>first</b> Fighter <b>jet in history</b> to use this four engine system. It's role is said to be ground attack, though it is capable of operating at ultra-high altitudes." Again, this is totally in-universe. It's got a lot of <b><a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a></b> in it too. Who says its role is in ground attack? Actually, the more I analyze these, the more I lean toward outright deletion. It seems to be entirely in-universe. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 06:38, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No offense, but it <b>is</b> all in the game if you would have the game you would know that but since you don't have the game I guess you wouldn't know that. And the design concept is plot related showing that each of the games interlink within each other to make a story line. I have no clue how <b>pheonominal</b> got in there but it will be removed. And the rest is in the games and is plot related. I rest my case.
