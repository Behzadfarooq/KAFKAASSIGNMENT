<p>There are a couple of thousand ethnicities in the world, and we can guess mostly every one of them has some animosities towards any two or three of its neighbours. So, let's have a bunch of 10,000 or so new articles of the format "Anti-X'ism by Y", listing all the world's complaints and injured prides, from unjust conquests a thousand years ago to unfair football fans and world-domination conspiracies today. I'll gladly make a start with "<a href="../../../w/%C3%BC/r/W%C3%BCrttemberg.html" title="Württemberg">Anti-Württembergism</a> <a href="../../../b/a/d/Baden.html" title="Baden">by Badenese</a>", taking the abovementioned <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">essay</a> as a model, as it is meticulously sourced, highly original and <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">refreshingly frank</a> in the way it spins all those disparate yarns into a coherent <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">new synthesis</a> of ethnic animosity. <b>Not.</b> -- <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 08:28, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Anti-Persianism" gets 10 hits on Google. I'd agree that there has been animosity between Persians and Arabs in the past (under the <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umayyads.html" title="Umayyads">Umayyads</a> -- the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasids.html" title="Abbasids">Abbasids</a>, who overthrew them, were allied with Persians) and recently (state-formation in Iraq, Iran-Iraq War, hostility between Sunni and Shi'a revived), but the article conflates past and present in a historically illegitimate way. It ignores twelve centuries of minimal or no friction between Arabs and Persians. IMHO, the section of older history is also grotesquely slanted and inaccurate. See the talk pages of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamicization_in_post-conquest_Iran_e6f2.html" title="Islamicization in post-conquest Iran">Islamicization in post-conquest Iran</a> for discussion of Umayyad language policies, etc. Material on oppression of Shi'a and Iraqis of Iranian background under Saddam is interesting (and depressing), but belongs in modern history of Iraq articles. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:53, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If articles like <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> are okay then the topic is fair game as long as it is sourced. Term "Anti-Persianism" gets exactly <b>506</b> hits on Google and "Anti-Persian" gets 655. Maybe it could be renamed "<b>Anti-Persian racism</b>" which gets 453,000 hits on Google.

<li><b>Delete</b> It is worthwhile looking at the reasons why this article was created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Arabism#POV_POV_POV" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Arabism#POV_POV_POV" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and also how widely the term "anti-Persianism" is used <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Dpersianism%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Dpersianism%22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - the only evidence for the use of this term is once in one article <a href="http://www.venusproject.com/ecs/aFarrokhArab.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.venusproject.com/ecs/aFarrokhArab.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, but some of the material in this opinion piece has been copied and pasted into the "anti-Persianism" article, as I pointed out here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Persianism_by_Arabs&amp;diff=55464473&amp;oldid=55446879" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Persianism_by_Arabs&amp;diff=55464473&amp;oldid=55446879" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Out of 12 hits on Google, three are related to this article, indicating that this is original research. The chief problem I have is that this article interprets many actions against Iran as anti-Persian racism, when in fact only 50% of the population of Iran is ethnically Persian and these actions have political motives rather than racial ones. Criticism or actions against the Iranian state by Arab governments appear to be deemed anti-Persianism in this article. I suspect that the reason why "anti-Iranian" and "anti-Persian" are conflated is precisely because there is little evidence to support this polemic. There is more evidence to support an article on "anti-Iranianism" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Diranian%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Diranian%22" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, although it would have to be broader than just sentiments expressed in the Arab world. At present, the article seems like nationalist posturing.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 10:55, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I disagree with deleting all anti-X-ism articles.</li>
<li>However, I am against the creation of articles based on an -ism that does not appear to exist outside Wikipedia</li>
<li>I am in favour of an article on anti-Iranian sentiment, as I believe that this prejudice does exist</li>
<li>However, I am against an article that focuses just on the prejudices of some Arabs and that there is a large amount of prejudice against Iranians elsewhere in the world</li>
<li>So, I propose that this article be renamed Anti-Iranian prejudice or Anti-Iranian sentiment, be widened to include the hatred or fear of Iranians <i>wherever</i> it occurs (not just Arabs) and the matters relating to POV and copyright violations in the article are cleared up. If this is agreed, then I would vote to <i>keep</i> the article.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 22:52, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Zereshk has since renamed the article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persian_sentiments_28a8.html" title="Anti-Persian sentiments">Anti-Persian sentiments</a>, which is a positive development. I have made a proposal for a separate Anti-Iranian prejudice that would clear my remaining objections (along with the misgivings of other editors) and would establish the difference between racism against ethnic Persians (who form 50% of the Iranian population) and hatred of Iran as a nation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Persian_sentiments#Proposal" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Persian_sentiments#Proposal" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. At the moment, I feel the article is confusing anti-national and racist sentiments which are not one and the same. If this proposal or something similar is accepted, then I will drop my support for deletion.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 12:02, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't like the idea of "Anti-Iranianism" because then there is more than just a single ethnic group. There is definitely racism against Persians so I think renaming the article is a good idea, but it should stay focused on anti-Persian ideas. Problem with "Anti-Iranianism" is also that "Iranian" in this way only means citizens of the country of Iran, and not any ethnic groups. There might be some hatred because of that, being citizen of Iran, but the hatred is more directed against Persians, and not so much against other groups. So the aim of the article is valid since widespread racism exists in the Arab world - and especially Saudi Arabia, UAE, Yemen, Bahrain - against Persians and anyone seen as being "Persian" or "Persian-like". <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 11:44, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>... I am a little bothered by having <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a> and not this... not sure why (I don't know the subject well at all... just that there is mutual animosity that pops up from time to time)... It does get more google hits but... it is possible that the terminology is not as singular as with anti-Arabism... are there many different terms, maybe? I do think the article is not very good. It conflates anecdotal evidence into a tale.... I mean... quoting traditions like this does is quite dangerous... we need to be quoting secondary scholarship not trying to make our own (and if anti-Arabism suffers from the same problems they should be fixed as well). Are there any academic (relatively) non-partisan works on this? The only ones this seems to cite are related to Iran and not Persians in general... I don't vote delete because I don't know if there is scholarship on this... but, this article is dangerous because it masquerades as being fact when... well, it's just not. And sadly, I think non-neutral articles are looking more sophisticated and escaping scrutiny. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 11:41, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> The reason why I got involved in editing the Iranian anti-Arabism section (a mere section, not a bloated article like this nominated one) was because anti-Arab Iranians were using that section to make racist statements against Arabs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;oldid=41183865" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;oldid=41183865" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;oldid=38077383#Anti-Arabism_in_Iran" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;oldid=38077383#Anti-Arabism_in_Iran" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> I was new when I started to correct this section, and so I had little knowledge of what is considered acceptable, so I sought the advice of an admin and another user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Inahet/Archive1#Anti_Arabism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Inahet/Archive1#Anti_Arabism" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. I was advised to find reliable sources otherwise the information I had added would be considered original research. So I removed the information I had added to comply with Wiki policies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;diff=43951805&amp;oldid=43374956" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;diff=43951805&amp;oldid=43374956" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. ZereshK, the sole writer of the <i>Anti-Persianism by Arabs</i> article, did not attempt to comply with Wikipedia policies (including NOR and NPOV), despite the fact he has been actively editing for a much longer time that I have. BTW, Zereshk writes politically charged, and what some might consider controversial articles for Iranian.com. I have nothing against him editing Wikipedia articles, but he should not enforce his own opinions at Wikipedia. And Sina, you can't tell me that I can't vote; where in Wikipedia guidelines do you base your claim? --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 01:10, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why just anti-Iranian sentiments by Arabs? As one editor stated on the talk page said "sentiments against IRAN and/or its inhabitants can have many causes and have been ubiquitously prevalent at different points in time, during the last two and a half millennia. Be it Babylon or Egypt or Greece in Antiquity, or the Arab Caliphates, as well as India, Afghanistan and the Ottoman Empire in more recent times." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Persianism_by_Arabs&amp;diff=55742335&amp;oldid=55689471" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Persianism_by_Arabs&amp;diff=55742335&amp;oldid=55689471" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> I don't understand why this is being protrayed as some kind of civilisational conflict between Persians and Arabs when Iran is an ethnically diverse country and there are many other disputes concerning Iranians and non-Arab countries.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 17:47, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you that there are tensions and in some cases animosity and racism towards Iranians by Arabs, but my point is that the article conflates <i>Iranian</i> as a nationality and <i>Persian</i> as an ethnic group that comprises 50% of the Iranian nation. "Anti-Persianism" or "Anti-Persian" are terms that have been virtually invented by the article author, whereas Anti-Iranian sentiment is widely written about.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Diranian%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Diranian%22" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> How can one realistically argue that anti-Iranian attitudes expressed by Arab football supporters during a soccer match is evidence of hatred against the Persian people rather than Iran as a country? My other point is that anti-Iranian attitudes are not only evident among Arabs but other ethnic groups and countries. Why are Arabs singled out and anti-Iranian sentiments among Americans not dealt with? I have no objection to an article on Anti-Iranian prejudice, which is something I originally suggested on the Anti-Arabism talk page, covering all aspects of the issue and not just Arab-versus-Persian.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 18:07, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article contains notable and factual information that is not present in any other articles. The phrasing and title of the idea conveyed "anti-persianism by arabs" is irrelevant. All previous arguments presented against this article seem to either quibble about the title of the article or bemoan the "irreparable" state of the organization and tone. Unless it is original research, the premise of the article, not content, should dictate its fate. I find the cumbersome title and POV style to be irrelevant in the discussion. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 17:50, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but the "premise" is exactly it. The premise of this article is that "Anti-Persianism" (or whatever you call it) is a unified phenomenon across the eras, providing a single interpretative framework for each and every real or perceived grievance Persians have against Arabs, from mistreatments during and after the Islamic conquest, to the behaviour of football fans today. And this idea, I believe, is indeed irreparably original research and tendentious, no matter how well the details are sourced. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 18:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think that the difficulty of the task (studying the animosity towards persians across time and in different contexts) warrants the deletion of the article. What is needed is good, hard work on the part of a scholar. Anti-persianism is one consistent entity across time, only manifesting itself in different ways, thus flustering the inability of some to view abstractions and concepts.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 18:43, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>In response to the allegations of <i>votestacking</i>, I would like to remind voters to <b>read the article</b> and read the arguments against it, most notably the concern that it is and inherently flawed idea, and "Anti-persianism" is too broad and vague to warrant an article.

<dd>Mani1, I humbly submit the fact that I am acting as mediator in this exchange, and I was merely summarizing some of the previous contentions of other voters. If you had <b>read</b> the rest of the discussion, which was the point of my last message, you would realize that I voted to keep the article. Thank you, but please read all the information available to you before making a decision. Also, this statement: "[anti-Persianism by Arabs is] felt, discussed, studied and researched by millions of Iranians around the world" is a contentious point because many are saying there are no scholary sources to support this.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 22:54, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mani, we've had these arguments at other articles. Those books do not prove what you think they prove. The early Arab conquerors did not consider themselves superior just to Persians -- they considered themselves superior to everyone. North Africans, Egyptians, Syrians, Sindhis ... if they weren't Arabs, they were second-class citizens to the later Rashidun and the Umayyads. They were dhimmis, they paid jizya, they had to wear distinctive garments ... none of this was directed at Persians qua Persians. The Arabs did NOT force their subjects to learn Arabic; in fact, they would have preferred it if they didn't learn Arabic. Arabic was the official language of government and religion, which is not the same thing as enforcing it as the language of everyday life. The Islamic conquest section of the Anti-Persianism article is a biased and historically inaccurate polemic, which says a lot more about the mindset of Iranian nationalism than it does about history. As someone who CARES about historical accuracy, I must protest your characterization of that section of the article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> Note that all the other articles about "anti" this or that don't point fingers. "Anti-Semitism" is allowable; "Anti-Semitism by U.S. citizens" is an accusation. I'd be fine with an "Anti-Iranian sentiments" article.</p>
<p>Also, as others have pointed out, the proponents of this article can't decide whether it's about Iranians or Persians. Citizens of Iran are of many ethnicities, speak many languages, and follow various religions. Sometimes the term "Persian" seems to be used of all of them; sometimes it is used only for the 50% of Iranians who are "ethnically" Persian (which is itself a devil to define and a subject of controversy). Now just "WHO" is this supposed prejudice directed against? I have the impression that current political tensions can lead to animosity towards Iranians in general, whatever their background (animosity not necessarily Arab -- the Bushistas seem to be trying to whip up the same thing in the US). The same way that "Americans" can be hated in some countries whether they're black or white, of Slovak or Mexican stock.</p>
<p>This kind of thing rises and falls according to the political weather. During World War II the U.S. and Russia were allies, and the brave Russian soldier was the U.S.'s friend. Then the Cold War and the same Russian soldier was an evil fiend who wanted to invade and oppress the U.S. (<i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dawn_afbf.html" title="Red Dawn">Red Dawn</a></i>). After the Iranian Revolution, Iranians became dangerous wild-eyed zealots. In another fifty years ... who knows? Perhaps they'll be the brave allies of the Euro-US Federation in the fight against Uzbeki imperialism. Framing current trands as evidence of a deep-laid plot going back millenia is ... absurd. It doesn't belong in an encyclopedia, UNLESS Zereshk and his friends can come up with cites showing that many Iranians believe it -- in which case it belongs in an article on Iranian politics, or the politics of the Iranian diaspora. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Iran and Persia ARE used interchangeably often enough and prejudice toward Iran can not be considered unrelated to Persian identity of Iran. When Saddam Hussain attacked Iran, it was all of Iran that was attacked but he did use the Persian vs Arab argument. More importantly, history of Iran is that of Persia since the country was called Persia in the outside world. When we talk about historical stuff we have to use PERSIAN since all Iranians were labeled as such. some people are trying to imply Iran has nothing to do wiht Persia and dislike of Iranians has nothing to do with Persians!! <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGol_cff6.html" title="User:Gol">Gol</a> 10:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have read the article and this discussion, and am familiar with other ethnic articles on Wikipedia. This article is typical in content to already listed "Anti-Foo" articles. Though I personally question the entire series, there is no reason to single out this one for deletion. The article is well-sourced, reasonably NPOV (like many articles there is room for improvement), sticks to its subject, and modestly calls the subject a "phenomenon" rather than movement or ideology. The new title is better. NOR should be a concern, but I don't see many conclusions or editorials in the text, rather it seems mostly to summarize the sources, as it should. The problems with this article can be solved through the normal editing process. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 07:19, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Delete - I am familiar with the ethnic issues of the Meddle East region and can confidently say this is a constructed hate page which has no real base. Through out the Arab world there are millions of Shiat Arabs who see Iranians as their “brothers” and defenders of their faith. Please note that the supposed names in the fist line of the articles (عجم ستیزی) also (ایرانی ستیزی) are both in Farsi/Persian words and not Arabic, in effect the writer(s) of the article could not come up with any Arabic word or name for this so cold phenomenon.</p>

<b>Comment</b>: Users not only should look for the term anti-Persianism on the web but also for its more widly used synonymous anti-Persian. If some of the users do not find the term anti-Presianism such a current term we can change the title to "anti-Persian sentiments among Arabs" or similar ones.

<p>Mehrdad should change his name, since <i>Mehrdad</i> (Given by the Sun) is a <b>Persian</b> name. He is an Azeri nationalist and seems to hate Persians.

<dd>Khorshid, I have no hathred for Persians/Fars people at all. In fact I am partly Fars and I have Kermani ansestors, as well as Hamedani as well as Tabrizi so I am Iranian with any definition as well as being Azeri. I belive this ultra nationalistic idealogy of small group of people so called "Roshan Fekran e Fars" (Fars Luminaries) who do not respect the basic rights of other other people in Iran, including the Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Turkmens and Baluch. <a href="../../../m/e/h/User%7EMehrdadd_0feb.html" title="User:Mehrdadd">Mehrdad</a> 15:38, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a non-Persian Iranian, I have to say that unforunately both Anti-arabism and Anti-Persianism do really exist and have already had many political implications and induced wars. Therefore I think there is no question about the existence of these phenomena. There is no question about the important consequences of them either. Ajam-Arab story is a long one.
