<li><b>Weak keep</b> There's a long, sad story here. The main author of the article, <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymouser_8295.html" title="User:Anonymouser">Anonymouser</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymouser_738f.html" title="User talk:Anonymouser">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anonymouser_d4fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anonymouser">contribs</a>), is believed to be a sockpuppet of Carl Hewitt, who is referenced in the article. Hewitt was a major figure in the logic-based end of artificial intelligence back in the 1970s. This is widely believed to be a dead end today, and Hewitt is one of the few people still trying to make it work. The general idea here is to develop "weak logics" which have more tolerance for ambiguity and contradiction than classic logic, which is very brittle. John McCarthy developed "circumscription" as an early effort in this direction, and there have been other variations on this theme. None of them are really all that useful. Bayesian inference seems to work better. What we're seeing here is something that, for now, seems to be a theoretical dead end. That happens in mathematics. The article does cite published papers, though, and I'm inclined to keep it in. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 18:09, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> The logic-based approach to AI has been revived the last few years in the forms of agents (similar to Hewitt's actors) and they may indeed have a future (my CS department is gambling on it) but this is of little significance. The article is based on two conference papers by Hewitt which do not seem to have been published in a peer-reviewed journal making this original research. (And even if they <i>were</i> published in a peer-reviewed journal there should be at least few other authors writing about or refering to Hewitt's direct logic to make this verifialbe and notable enough for inclusion.) —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The author cites <i>his own</i> "published" (but not generally available) papers. Even if they are generally available papers in a peer-reviewed journal, they still violate his RfA, as noted above. See Hewitt (2006a) and (2006b) — both seem to be invited, but not peer-reviewed, papers. As (2006a) is referenced in the lead, the entire article is suspect.

<li><b>Keep</b> The grounds originally cited for deletion are not valid. The article reports on a publication by a noted academic. The results of the publication have been presented in seminars at Stanford and SRI. So it is difficult to argue that it is not notable. The field is divided into camps that radically disagree with each other. Consequently the ultimate value of the research is a matter of great controversy. However, the problem addressed in the motivation section of the article is of the highest importance in computer science: What is the field going to do about the pervasive contradictions among documentation and code of large software systems (think Windows!)? Also there do not appear to be any glaring errors in the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.254.59.254 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.254.59.254_cafd.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.254.59.254">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>As in my comment above, Carl Hewitt <i>may be</i> "a noted academic", but papers (2006a) and (2006b) are from conference proceedings, in which it appears <b>he</b> was invited, but the papers were <b>not</b> peer-reviewed. (And it's still fringe mathematics, rather than dead-end mathematics, even with the 20-year history. CS people, when trying to do mathematics, sometimes get confused.)

<li>So, it is original research - which has no place in a Wikipedia.
