<p>I am correcting a malformatted afd. I vote <b>speedy keep</b> as a bad faith renomination of a page that has passed an afd process already. <a href="../../../u/s/r/User%7EUsrnme_h8er_fa7c.html" title="User:Usrnme h8er">Usrnme h8er</a> 09:41, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Previously this article was also nominated for removal, which was saved by the MuggleNet fans themselves by voting in favour of keeping the article. Apparantly MuggleNet had posted this link to vote in their favour on CoS forum [MuggleNet's official Forum]. This was a serious bias decision as majority of voters were MuggleNet fans redirected from the Forums and they had no idea what they were voting for or What Wiki is really about. The previous Nomination for Deletion page can be found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_MuggleNet_8d58.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MuggleNet">here</a>.</p>
<p>An Excerpt from previous nomination which proves MN's intentions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As harry potter fandom is one of the biggest in the world and mugglenet is the most popular fansite within it, Mugglenet should be kept but definitely expanded. It has a rich history in the fandom and <b>it's inclusion in this article would greatly expand it</b> &lt;--- See! They want MuggleNet to expand by including it on Wiki. Now tell me, is it ok for sites to make pages of their own to gain hits for their sites? Isn't this Vandalism?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's not. To be <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>, it has to make a "deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia". If it's simply promotional, it's wrong. But not vandalism.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 14:14, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also MuggleNet is really cautious of not letting this article to be deleted. If MuggleNet is notable enough and worthy enough to be included in Wiki, why is MuggleNet trying so hard to save this article from deletion? Why are majority of voters from MuggleNet who vote in favour of keeping MuggleNet on Wiki? It is time that this has to stop! And the time is now. Lets make Wiki the best encyclopedia in the world, not a advertising campaign/dictionary.</p>
<p>And now, speaking of whats left of that big article now is this: Emerson made this site [it was a different layout not the current one] when he was 12. So what? There are loads of people who make sites at the age of 12. How will this information justify its existence in an Encyclopedia? Ask majority of the people in the world, take a survey. Do they know MuggleNet? I agreee they know JK Rowling and Harry Potter, but MuggleNet? What is MuggleNet?</p>
<p>2nd point: He met JK Rowling once. So? Many fans met JK Rowling. Its not like they are having telephone conversations everyday. And even if he knows JK Rowling like a friend, so what? If you say include this article because he know JK Rowling then I suggest you also put up articles on JK Rowlings husband, her family, her friends, her children. Is this justified. Surely not. --<a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajdumbledore_a3e2.html" title="User:Rajdumbledore">Raj Dumbledore</a> 05:10, 05 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It was AfD before and survived. I notice too that Rajdumbledore has made multiple (all this morning), and what looks as if they could be questionable, edits to <a href="../../../m/u/g/MuggleNet_e305.html" title="MuggleNet">MuggleNet</a> all of which are listed as minor. It's hard to understand how a AfD notice, his last edit, can be minor. Also I notice that on <a href="../../../r/a/j/User_talk%7ERajdumbledore_d209.html" title="User talk:Rajdumbledore">User talk:Rajdumbledore</a> he has created his own Harry Potter sites and that makes it appear as if he has some other motive than a legitimate AfD. In one point he is correct I had not heard of MuggleNet, nor his own sites, however just because I have not heard of a site does not qualify it for obscurity. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> 12:26, 5 October 2005 (UTC) --- Your reply has made me again enforce one point. Someone had HACKED in my Wiki account. I had no control over it. I just got back the access yesterday. 2nd thing. I have nothing against MuggleNet. I think its good site too. But its inclusion in Wiki is not called for in my opinion. Lets not make this personal war. I am not Anti-Mugglenet activist for God's sake.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Abstain</b></s>, but consider this. Deletions must be based on the here-and-now, not the past. What is MuggleNet's status <b>right at this moment</b>, never mind the past AFDs? Is it, in fact, an inherently notable site on its own merits (number of users, importance to the fandom, etc). I'd go as far as to suggest that those who voted for and against in the previous AFD abstain from vothing this time, since this sort of thing is biased. Actually, I'm going to go <b>Delete</b> on this out of non-notability. --<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgamemnon2_ee6b.html" title="User:Agamemnon2">Agamemnon2</a> 10:30, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I must disagree as to deleting an article just because it's no longer notable.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>: this is really unclear, and the lengthy spiel above is badly formatted and almost illegible, but it would appear that this is a bad faith nomination by the creator of one or more rival Harry Potter fan-sites: the fact that the nominator has made so many confusing edits to the article, all marked as "minor" but removing apparently-siginificant information, does not help matters. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_MuggleNet_8d58.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MuggleNet">previous nomination</a> resulted in a resounding <b>keep</b> despite being formatted almost to death.<br />
Mugglenet is one of the very few Harry Potter websites granted an award by <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._K._Rowling_604a.html" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> herself, and as such is highly notable. The author was one of two people granted an exclusive joint interview with Rowling at the time that <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i> was released: this would not have happened had the website not been so prominent in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_fandom_6451.html" title="Harry Potter fandom">Harry Potter fandom</a>. —<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 11:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a remarkably notable site. I've never read any of the books, but even I have heard of it. I heard an interview with Rowling once where she said that she used Mugglenet regularly to check her own continuity. If that isn't notibility, I'm not sure what is. Also, in response to this: "<i>Ask majority of the people in the world, take a survey. Do they know MuggleNet?</i>", if that was the standard for deletion, Wikipedia would be very small, not to mention useless. -- <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlutor_2e6a.html" title="User:Plutor">Plutor</a> 17:22, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, I am fed up of these constant votes for deletion, and this is actually the 3rd not the 2nd. Please can the people take a hint that it should NOT be dleeted? It is worthy of the Wiki article because it is an essential part of Harry Potter fandom. (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamandell_%28d69%29_207e.html" title="User:Jamandell (d69)">Jamandell (d69)</a> 18:23, 7 October 2005 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> An essential part of Harry Potter fandom? As decided by who and what? The guidelines for Wikipedia, which tend towards the non-notiable classification, or the people who frequent Mugglenet...who have already established a bias towards keeping it even if nobody but their rather small community considers it worthwhile. Wikipedia is not supposed to be about personal biases, that's why their are guidelines and classifications for what does and does not go here. Now, I'm not saying that my recommendation of <b>Delete</b> is automatically correct, or that all others MUST vote for <b>Delete</b> as well. All I ask is that people look through the guidelines for content and make their own decisions rather than be swayed by situations like the LAST time, where Mugglenet forum members swarmed over here to vote for <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 20:32, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While this forum may not be "essential" to anything, it has enough of a fanbase and outreach to make it noteworthy. If this is up for deletion than we should put <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.html" title="Fark">Fark</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> up with it. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragoonmac_a999.html" title="User:Dragoonmac">Makenji-san</a> 22:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per CambridgeBayWeather and Jamandell's comments --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresnell_cc17.html" title="User:Presnell">Presnell</a> 00:15, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. (If Speedy Keep fails.) Esp. if they get the 6 million hits a month they claim. Even if not, it's clearly legit, I checked Rowling's official site, and mugglenet is the 2nd of 4 or 5 fansites listed, and she has this to say: "It's high time I paid homage to the mighty MuggleNet. Where to start? I love the design, (I currently favour the 'Dementor' layout), the polls (I actually voted in the 'Who's the Half-Blood Prince?' one) the pretty-much-exhaustive information on all books and films, the wonderful editorials (more insight there than in several companion volumes I shall not name), 101 Ways to Annoy Lord Voldemort (made me laugh aloud) &lt;snip&gt;". Not that Rowling's praise makes it notable, but it does prove its a well-recognized fansite of an <i>enormously</i> popular series. And no, I'm not a sockpuppet, I've not read a word of those books. &lt;smile&gt; <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 14:14, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is the top website for Harry Potter fans throughout the world.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I know enough people from a diverse social situations who know about Mugglenet. Just the other night Mugglenet came up in a non-Harry Potter related meeting I was at. Oh - and the majority of people in the world don't know about the vast majority of things on Wikipedia. And if you look at the people voting keep on this page, you'll see we aren't just "fans of the site".

<dd>One thought: isn't it the purpose of an encyclopedia to inform you of things that you <i>don't</i> know about? If all the information on Wikipedia was stuff we knew about, then what would be the point? I run across obscure words, references and URLs all the time.

<dd>But I didn't know about Mugglenet until I saw the AfD. An encyclopedia can't guess what everybody knows. It has to include as much as it can. Insofar as it's of some importance.
