<p>Lack of notability; vanity article <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemike_a411.html" title="User:Orangemike"><font color="darkorange">Orange Mike</font></a> 23:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would assume that you promote the deletion of every other page that is a page about any specific school? As for lack of notability, it would seem to me that they list a lot of note worth things on the page. I would propose clean up rather than deletion. What makes the page for UMW so mush better than this? If pages can be created for any/all universities without reprocutions like this, why can't this stay? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemonOWA_fb01.html" title="User:DemonOWA">DemonOWA</a> 00:10, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>UMW? I don't see what the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Mine_Workers_b5de.html" title="United Mine Workers">United Mine Workers</a> has to do with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mush.html" title="Mush">mush</a>, or with any of this. If the school has particular notability on a national level for scholastic achievement, or a history of notable alumni, or high standards, then it would be appropriate; but most elementary and secondary schools don't fit those criteria. "Mr. Ney likes steak" is not encyclopedic data.

<dl>
<dd>Also According to the proposed WP:SCHOOLS guidelines, it is ok so have a page about a school if: "The school is distinctive in any one of the following areas, or in any other areas for which it has received press or other coverage." Recently there was quite a lot of coverage relating to the Alpine Robotics Team, which is affiliated with the school. Also in numerous national competitions Poudre High school, and it's affiliated programs have been recognized.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also in the notes section of the WP:SCHOOLS guidelines it states that: "Newspaper coverage includes regular coverage in local media (such as complete stories about a school's athletic program)." Which Poudre High School has been. Orangemike cannot be the judge of this because is not from an area where he has access to local news.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On to note 4 in WP:SCHOOLS guidelines. Although Poudre High School is one of but a few schools in the district, it's academic acheivement is often noted amongst schools in the entire state, and regularly does better than them in many nationally recognized and acclaimed sources such as Newsweek.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also if you had read anything i had said in the discussion portion of the page you would realise that i did not support the addition of "Mr. Ney Likes steak," and in fact, openly contested it.</dd>

<li><b>Keep <s><i>if verified</i></s></b> The various high national placements in various competitions would assert sufficient notability, but currently, there's only a link to the robotics team.

<dd>Universities by definition are more notable than high schools, just as high schools are more likely to be notable than elementary schools or pre-schools.

<dd>So you admit to seeing that Poudre High School is noteworthy in our local, and state area, and if that is the case then it under the noteworthy section of WP:SCHOOLS <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemonOWA_fb01.html" title="User:DemonOWA">DemonOWA</a> 01:07, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: This is a reasonable subject for an article, although I am not sure about including 100% of the content. Note to Orangemike and DemonOWA: personal gibes between real-world acquaintances, whether intended seriously or (as I hope) as just friendly teasing, don't really belong here. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:47, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree that none of the claims were cited originally and that is completely inappropriate to make unsubstantiated claims. DemonOWA and myself have added citations to reputable third party confirmation of the many of the claims and will continue to do so. To the best of my knowledge the information listed on the page is correct. Variable Z 02:28, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per commenters above. Any school that has IB is notable, but isn't it a waste of time to search for EVERY high school article and nominate it for deletion just for notability?
