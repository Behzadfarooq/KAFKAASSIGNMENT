<p>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminant collection of information -- specifically a <b>directory</b> or a <i>TV/Radio Guide</i> (these articles are one, or both) -- despite the level of utility of the articles, they are not within the guidelines of what should be included in Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Articles are all grouped together due to content and style. If not a "guide", then definitely a simple <i>directory</i> -- either way, violates inclusion policy. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 14:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As an aside (and for full disclosure), <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_MyNetworkTV_affiliates_a04e.html" title="List of MyNetworkTV affiliates">List of MyNetworkTV affiliates</a> was nominated for deletion on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_myNetworkTV_affiliates_3e55.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of myNetworkTV affiliates">19/8/2006</a>, with a result of <b>Speedy Keep</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I would argue that the articles in question are not indiscriminate <i>directories</i> in that they only provide a list of what networks, content, or stations are included (not unlike <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_newspapers.html" title="List of newspapers">List of newspapers</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_television_stations_in_North_America_by_media_market_c587.html" title="List of television stations in North America by media market">List of television stations in North America by media market</a>; or outside of the media arena with entries like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airlines.html" title="List of airlines">List of airlines</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_auxiliary_Interstate_Highways_6717.html" title="List of auxiliary Interstate Highways">List of auxiliary Interstate Highways</a>). This information initially was contained within the <a href="../../../d/i/r/DirecTV_598e.html" title="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> article, and was broken out once it was realized how unwieldy the information is within the bounds of that single article. If this article was a full-fledged TV guide, I would agree with you completely, but given that this is completely outside of that realm, and more of an encyclopaedic list of what is included within the service, I have to strongly disagree with you, in that they do not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 15:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It certainly is not a guide, but rather a list. I see nothing wrong with it being there, and don't think it violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in any way.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm not trying to be difficult, but why are people using reasoning such as "well, if we delete X then we'll have to delete all these other articles too"&#160;? Regardless of an article's usefullness, or how many other articles violate the same policy, if it violates a policy, it needs to go. "But Johnny did it too" never worked when trying to justify my actions to my mom... why is wikipedia any different? Wikipedia seems full of reasons for why it's okay to break policy on a per-case basis, but doesn't this trump the purpose of having a policy at all? Just because it's useful, or because it's done in other places, doesn't negate the issue at hand... or so I think.&#160;;-) /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 18:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is an all too common argument nowadays. Justifying bad behavior (or in this case articles) by pointing to other bad behavior. It's childish, and illogical. It also paralyzes progress because at the end of the day, nothing can get done because there is always something or someone else mimicking the improper behavior.

Believe me, look at the chaos of what happened at <a href="../../../s/r/n/WP%7ESRNC_8601.html" title="WP:SRNC">WP:SRNC</a>. Article standards were scattered because there was no cohesive policy across <a href="../../../u/s/r/WP%7EUSRD_286b.html" title="WP:USRD">WP:USRD</a>, and hence there was complete chaos. The arguments over this even fall under <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a>. That's why I cited these other articles.

I've used those articles before in order to do research for my own purposes; hence the reason why I became involved in editing those pages. So, that was my point of bringing up those articles.

<dd>You misunderstand my point. It is childish because seeking to have one bad article stand out becaust there are five other bad articles is what a child does to stop a punishment from coming down.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think "TV/Radio Guides" may be misinterpreted by those in favor of deletion. A TV guide lists upcoming programming, which isn't the case here.
