<li>I've added in the Carter Poland one. Can you find verifiable links for the others? BTW it is very hard to find Democratic POTUS gaffes apart from Carter's! I've tried to find any. It seems that recent Republican presidents where gaffoholics, whereas the Democrats don't seem to be. (Clinton's "I did not have sex . . . " was neither a gaffe nor a faux pas but a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-denial_denial.html" title="Non-denial denial">Non-denial denial</a> so is irrelevant here (Its on the NDD page.) It would be interesting to compare the educational standards of recent Republican versus Democratic presidents. Looking at Kennedy, Carter and Clinton all three, in terms of academic attainment or measurable intellectual ability were better than either of the Bushes, Reagan or Nixon. That doesn't mean better presidents, but intellectually more able, which may explain their lack of a gaffe-history. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 05:07, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As per my remarks below, I have to disagree. Most of the list contents are taken widely out of context , framed to mislead, or sarcastically misconstrue the meaning of gaffe (sickness, as pointed out by <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a>, is not a gaffe even if it causes a diplomatic incident). Few have gone down in history as such, because they mostly relate to Bush, and history has yet to render judgement. They also betray a severe lack of knowledge of Presidential history. Harrison, the oldest President until Reagan, delivered his inaugural address on a cool March day without an overcoat (like many Presidents before and since).[<a href="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/chronology/whharrison1841.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/chronology/whharrison1841.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] News reports at the time described the weather as mild, not requiring an overcoat, and did not consider Harrison’s removal of coat and hat to be a gaffe. Cause and effect with his death can not be established, although Harrison could be accused of bad judgement given his age. Kennedy, the youngest elected President, famously delivered his inaugural without an overcoat on a bitterly cold day in February.[<a href="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/chronology/jfkennedy1961.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/chronology/jfkennedy1961.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] This was also not considered a faux pas. Instead, by the logic of this list, Kennedy’s major gaffe did not come until Nov 22, 1963, when he ruined his wife’s dress by spraying brain matter on it. By the same token, Lincoln committed an unforgivable faux pas, when he spoiled the performance of <i><a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_American_Cousin_1e1c.html" title="Our American Cousin">Our American Cousin</a></i> at the Ford Theatre, due to his urgent need to die across the street. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:51, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> perfectly valid article on a real topic, which was outrageously deleted without a vote first time around. It just needs clear definition. It should cover gaffes, as in unintentional comments or actions which caused embarrassment or defence. Clinton's denial of having sex "with that woman", for example, was not a gaffe. (It was a <i>Non-denial denial</i> which we already cover on WP.) It was deliberate. Carter's slip up with names, Bush's verbal slip-ups, etc do qualify as gaffes (unintentional and caused embarrassment). The mistranslation of Carter's comments when visiting Poland, though hilarous, does not belong here, as he was the not the author of the gaffe. It belongs in a page about translation gaffes. Or a page about gaffes made <i>about</i> the presidency rather than <i>by</i> presidents. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 21:48, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I've mentioned how one GWB gaffe hit the US economy and Wall Street when the ejjit replaced a bit of carefully worded Greenspan spin by another homespun Texan term that <i>he</i> may have thought was the same but actually meant the exact opposite to what Greenspan was suggesting. No wonder Greenspan was said to be on the warpath afterwards (Greenspan suggested a slight soft spot, Bush suggested, inadvertently a rough and bumpy road ahead!).

Suggest that <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> do some research as <i>soft patch</i> and <i>bumping along</i> are both commonly used in the financial press and mean largely the same thing. Bush's comments date from Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2002, at which point the Dow was down roughly 17% YTD. It rose in the next three sessions, ending with a near 200 point gain on the week, and closed out the year down an insignificant 30 points from the date of Bush's remark. The dow then went on to gain 25% in 2003.[<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=%5EDJI&amp;a=00&amp;b=01&amp;c=2002&amp;d=11&amp;e=31&amp;f=2003&amp;g=m" class="external autonumber" title="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=%5EDJI&amp;a=00&amp;b=01&amp;c=2002&amp;d=11&amp;e=31&amp;f=2003&amp;g=m" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]. It could thus be argued that Bush's "bumping along" gained trillions for the US economy, but in fact there was no real impact, as the markets, unlike blogs, do not react hysterically to non-gaffes. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 09:43, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a>'s comment regarding the markets and <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a>'s rebuttal sum up very nicely what this page, if it is kept, will become. A collection of non-incidents being blown up by one side and the listing ad infinitum of anything the anti-(fill-in-name-of-prez-past-present-or-future here) crowd will use to jump on to make a point, especially the presentday Bush-Bashing crowd. Who really cares whether Bush sr. puked on a PM or Carter wants to have intimate relations with the entire?!? Polish people except anti Bush or anti Carter people? If there's a really noteworthy gaffe then include it in said president's article. If it is just a partisan thing then spend your time more useful and write an article worthy of an encyclopedia. Do we want to set the precedent and create articles regarding gaffes by other professions. An article about gaffes by Hollywood people perhaps? Not that many of the same people who like this list would want to create thát list I suspect.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 17:33, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. We shouldn't be lured into thinking that NPOV requires that we have as many Democrat gaffes as Republican gaffes, despite the US's status as a 50-50 tribal partisan country. If Republicans are unhappy with how many Republican gaffes are on there, then they should try to add Democrat gaffes rather than complain about the existing ones (unless they're somehow false). As for Bush, I don't think there's a Bush fixation - obviously there will always be systemic bias towards the current president, but the fact is the man has said a lot of very stupid things. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 09:24, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: admirable as the desire for "neutrality" might be, it does not mean the suppression of all criticism of anybody featured in a given article. As for the tone, some of the arguments above seem to be bordering on the hysterical at the thought that the supposed gravity of Wikipedia might be dented by the inclusion of a humorous article about humorous events. If the stuff actually happened, and the documentation is available to prove it, it's a candidate for inclusion in Wikipedia. Otherwise we risk our reputation being damaged by the obvious <b>omission</b> of perfectly good information.
