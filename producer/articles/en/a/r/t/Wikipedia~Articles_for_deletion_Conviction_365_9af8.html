<dd>The site does exist, both blogs are there, the fact the site needs work isn't a fact anyone is trying to hide, both the author of the wikipedia article and "Rise and Fall" admit that they're still working on the site. I agree with you in that some of the stuff "Rise and Fall" have written is kind of rude, but as I said earlier, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Ouzounian_8cd6.html" title="George Ouzounian">George Ouzounian</a> has said some pretty offensive things in his blog thing too, but he's still notable.

<dd>Maddox is an internet celebrity, and The Best Page in the Universe is an extremely famous website.

<dd>I voted once and wrote the last comment. I want to preserve my work, that's all. Since, evidentally, you're looking up IPs anyway, why don't you look up the one for this "*<b>Keep</b> It's a decent article, keep it 09:36, 2 December 2005 (UTC)" That wasn't me and there's no username on it either, I've voted once, according to policy.
