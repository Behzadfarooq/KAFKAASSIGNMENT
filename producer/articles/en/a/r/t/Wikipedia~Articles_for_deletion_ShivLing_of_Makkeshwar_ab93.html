<dd><b>Comment:</b> Then the article should qualify that questionable sources say that the Shivalingam is just that. Since a claim has been made (by P.N Oak, a questionable "scholar" I'll admit) to that effect, the article should be kept, but qualified that there is no objective proof that the Shivalingam is a Shivalingam. Bear in mind that certain fanatic elements here are interested in keeping the "purity" of their race/religion from "Kaffirism" and, in the interests of that goal, would cheerily staunch the reporting of any issue, however controvertial it may be, that even suggests that there may have been a proto-Hindu connection with pre-Islamic Arabia (after all, similar elements wiped out a lot of the knowledge of pre-Islamic Arabia for precisely the same reason).<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">Netaji</a> 04:09, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b>Being an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church_1c2e.html" title="Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Christian</a>, I can assure you I have no ulterior motives for deleting this article. The fact is, that if the theory is only proposed by a few fringe authors, then it's probably not worthy of inclusion unless that fringe theory becomes a popular fringe theory (which its google hits don't show) or accepted by the mainstream. Unfortunately Rumsfeld's rhetoric isn't going to help you out. Just because there's an absence of evidence doesn't mean evidence of absence, but until there's evidence of "a proto-Hindu connection with pre-Islamic Arabia" proposed/verified by a <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiable source</a>, there's no need for an article on this on wikipedia. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 04:27, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Keep this OUT of Black Stone, if you please. It's starting to come into focus for me. The people advancing this theory belong to a particular faction in Indian politics, the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> folk. This is the faction behind the destruction of the Babri Mosque, at Ayodhya -- the mosque was destroyed by people claiming that it had been built on the site of a Hindu temple. Any claim that the Kaaba is built over a Hindu temple is a threat, it seems to me, a threat that the Kaaba could be torn down too. I see no reason to let this sort of political posturing into an encyclopedia article, particularly as the claim doesn't seem to be held by more than a tiny fraction of the Hindutavadis. (At first I thought it was just a lone kook -- the political implications weren't in focus; now I think it's perhaps one anti-Muslim fantasist and followers who would be prepared to support anything that offended Muslims.) If it belongs anywhere, it belongs in the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 17:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please avoid touching the comments of other users terry. And my point is that just as we mention Gautam Buddha to be an Islamic Prophet on the basis of lone assertion of an unknown scholar on wikipedia, so a similar assertion for shivling is also possible. (This is not an OR). We are not passing any judgements here. This can be as untrue as for Buddha being an Islamic prophet.<a href="../../../n/i/d/User%7ENidhishsinghal_5350.html" title="User:Nidhishsinghal">nids</a> 10:16, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Secondly, if that speculation is there - there is a basis in Muslim scriptures? Thirdly it relates to identifying a person not his property or relics in countries where Buddhism is spread and where Islam was never present as Muslim.Lastly, Muslims do not recognise Buddha as a Muslim prophet that speculation apart.Muslims don't go on to call Buddhists as Buddhist Muslims on the basis of such percieved speculation as Hindutva literature proposes to call Indian Muslims as Muhammadi Hindus, Sikhs as Sikh Hindus,Buddhists as Boddha Hindus.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a></li>

<li>The article mentions it as a <b>speculation</b> on the identity of Dhul Kifl in the paras related to Buddhism in other religions of the world.Muslim holy book Quran mentions that all people and races of the world were sent messengers from the same God and Prophet Muhammed is the last prophet in that series.It mentions Jesus and Moses,Adam, Noah and other bibilical stories too...In a similar way some theologians have tried to speculate the identity of Zulqarnain in the holy book based on his description, who some say was Alexander the great.Most Islamic scholars disapprove of such speculations though and accept the identified prophets like Jesus,Moses etc..who also came thousands of years before Prophet Muhammed.Also such speculators have as far as I know refrained from laying claim to their statues, monuments,lands or other relics, physical or temporal properties, having relegated their interest to identifying the person mentioned in the book rather <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a></li>

<dd><b>comment</b>I'm not saying that the actual stone is a shivaling, I'm saying there is a lingam inside the stone. Pre-Islamic Arabians were pagans and housed their idols in the Kaaba. Since there were probably a good amount of Indians trading at the time, its entirely possible that a lingam was placed with the pagan idols.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 14:00, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
