<p>"Andrew David Harrison" returns 48 hits on Google - that alone would recommend him as non-notable. He has no hits for scientific publications or journal submissions. It is implied by the article that he has not completed any graduate work or degrees. Just another academic.

<li><b>Delete</b> He needs to invent something before we bother to give him a page. In a certain light, I've done a lot, too, if you allow me a moment to write out the proper words.

<li>I don't agree with you that you must have prior knowledge of every single notable individual in Wikipedia. If you did, there wouldn't be a point to creating biographies, would there? (unsigned comment by 129.219.6.5)
<ul>
<li>I agree, and I admit that there is a lot of merit in learning about that which had previously fallen outside one's scope of knowledge. However, one of the strengths of a VfD is that it allows people who <i>do</i> know about a subject, or can do research on the subject to verify and validate its status as a Wikipedia entry, can comment and tell other users why the entry should stay. By you saying "I do not know this Andrew Harrison," it implies to me that you don't know him in any sense, and therefore cannot judge whether or not he is subject to inclusion according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 04:12, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You don't make any sense with your rebuttal. Based on your analysis, you just eliminated yourself from authority to pass judgement.

<li>It is the author's and supporters' burden of proof to demonstrate that the entry is worthy of inclusion.

<li>Is that so?

<p><b>Keep</b>. PER Wikipedia instructions on the handling of vanity pages, "An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous." (Wikipedia vanity definition page) This means that being non-notable is not a basis for deletion. Further, this article includes pertinent accoplishments by the individual, and does not list irrelevant information such as hobbies, or aspirations. An official Wikipedia definition of unimportance includes: <b>1</b>. Patent nonsense, <b>2</b>. Original research, <b>3</b>. Unverifiability, <b>4</b>. Unexpandability, <b>5</b>. Small number of contributors, <b>6</b>. Does not belong in Wikipedia. This article satisfies none of these conditions except possibly (but far too early to say) 4 and 5. Wikipedia policy specifically states: "An article important according to the above guidelines should not be deleted on the basis of it being <b>1</b>. Insufficiently important famous or relevant, or <b>2</b>. currently small or a stub." Additionaly, a google search I performed returned many hits relating to this individual's academic career. Therefore, an article this new does not fall under the grounds for deletion. All information included in this article should be considered encyclopedic for inclusion. Postpone deletion until sufficient time has passed in order to establish unexpandability and a small number of contributors, and at that time we can determine whether we shall declare it unimportant. --CatTracker 22:28, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b>: This is CatTracker's first and only edit or comment. Also, "being non-notable is not a basis for deletion" is just plain wrong - being non-<i>famous</i> is not a basis for saying an article is <i>vanity</i>. Being notable is one criterion for being included in an encyclopaedic listing. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 22:36, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b>: Jglc, I just read the vanity page and the concepts of <i>fame</i> and <i>notability</i> are used interchangeably. That means that either being not-famous or non-notable are not reasons to delete an article.</p>
