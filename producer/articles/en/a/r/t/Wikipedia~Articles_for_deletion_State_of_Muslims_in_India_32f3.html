<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b> and Merge into the section "Muslims in Modern India" in the article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a>. There's really nothing wrong with the article, but:</p>
<ol>
<li>A good part of the article is redundant with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims_in_Parliament_of_India_7059.html" title="Muslims in Parliament of India">Muslims in Parliament of India</a>. Generally, there should not be identical lists in two places, especially when the list is subject to change. This is a maintenance issue.</li>
<li>Once that list is removed, the article is short. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html#Muslims_in_Modern_India" title="Islam in India">Islam in India#Muslims in Modern India</a> is tagged as needing expansion, so it makes sense to expand it by merging what is left of the article into that section.</li>
</ol>
<p>This doesn't mean that, in future, if editors want to add more material into <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html#Muslims_in_Modern_India" title="Islam in India">Islam in India#Muslims in Modern India</a> than will comfortably fit, a new article could not be created. Perhaps that article should be named "Muslims in modern India" rather than "State of Muslims in India". <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 08:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>BAsed on Single source and essentially an attempt to create a POV fork of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a>. Allegations of lack of Muslim representation are largely partisan (and made by leftist - based partisan media hype, bearing in mind that president of India is a Muslim). Data from Sachar report may be incorporated into <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a> and this article deleted please. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 19:47, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Such bullying tactics will not work with me. I never said that the information be removed. Merely that it be placed in the appropriate article. muslims in India cannot be compared to articles on ethnic groups like African Americans since Muslims are not an ethnicity but adherents of a religion. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 21:36, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a> is a very long article and is related to religion in general.

<li>Comment - The only way by which Muslims are defined is through Islam. Muslims are neither a race or creed. They are the adherents of Islam and thus any information on Muslims (particularly ones this little) can be merged with the Islam in India article.<a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 21:36, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I read Timesofinda <i>every</i> day and also some others. Few day ago I had read that India PM said giving Muslims equal chances. Similarly President of India had said something similar about Muslims-In-Indian-Army few months ago because there are very less Muslim in Army. It was a long debate on it. It is a fact that Indian Muslims are much backward as compare to Hindus. One can find references from India's press. Similarly when I was in USA working on H1B visa then there was many Hindus on H1B visa (in <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, CA) but Muslims of India was verrrry less. Hence I think a very good quality article can be created based on many references easily. I will try to contribute too on this one. Quick google seach gives me these references <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/782393.cms" class="external autonumber" title="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/782393.cms" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://indianmuslims.in/sky-has-fallen-muslim-in-army-asked/" class="external text" title="http://indianmuslims.in/sky-has-fallen-muslim-in-army-asked/" rel="nofollow">sky-has-fallen-muslim-in-army-asked</a> <a href="http://www.hvk.org/articles/0106/118.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hvk.org/articles/0106/118.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/19517.html" class="external text" title="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/19517.html" rel="nofollow">Untouchability like apartheid, says PM, pushes Muslim equity</a> --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 23:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do not disagree, but why is that a valid argument for a separate article? Why not include all this data in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a>. I can equally argue that I should write a State of Hindus in India article and write about attack on Akshardham temple and Indian Parliament by Muslims and increasing Islamic terrorism and how it's affected Hindus. I can write about votebank politics in favor of Muslims and CPM,s support for radical Islamism etc. etc. I am sure that such an article would be AfD'ed in a second and scores of people rush in to vote "delete-delete". <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 23:16, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Reply: It depends on two things <b>1)</b> Importance of topic and <b>2)</b> amount of material available on it. If topic is not much important and if there is NOT much material available. Then a section in existing article is good. However, in this case the topic is very important because Muslims are lot in number and the issue is hot enough in press (see <b><a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/19517.html" class="external text" title="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/19517.html" rel="nofollow">December 27th Report</a></b>). Hence for me it is justified to have a seperate article on it. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 23:50, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Reply Same thing with Hindus as well. here are some articles on the situation with the marginalization of Hindus in Bangladesh, for instance <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/aug/09bang.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/aug/09bang.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.hinduhumanrights.org/Bangladesh/bnpandbangladesh.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hinduhumanrights.org/Bangladesh/bnpandbangladesh.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.hinduamericanfoundation.org/media_press_release_pallone-bangladesh.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hinduamericanfoundation.org/media_press_release_pallone-bangladesh.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/02aziz.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/02aziz.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA130062001!Open" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA130062001!Open" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020527/baldwin20020517" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020527/baldwin20020517" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/un_hrc/bangladesh.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amnesty.org/un_hrc/bangladesh.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<li>I would like to support State of Hindus in Bangladesh however above mentioned sources are not neutral. You are giving me Indian News paper to show Hindus status in Bangladesh. Those News papers are of other Hindu country hence might be biased. Unlike this I am giving you Hindu News papers of the same country to present situation of Muslim.

<li>comment - There are no "Hindu newspapers". Please read about India before you make ignorant generalizations. India is a secular country, unlike other more backward countries in the area. The word "Hindu" in "The Hindu" does not mean it is a "Hindu" newspaper but "Hindu" in that context means India. In fact, "The Hindu" is a leftist biased newspaper that frequently makes hatred against Hindus in favor of radical leftist and Islamist groups (which explains their obsession with this subject).Regarding my argument above,I think you have misunderstood my position. My point of the above statement was that none of those articles cited is justification for a separate article on this problem but is a justification for including information in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism_in_Bangladesh_341d.html" title="Hinduism in Bangladesh">Hinduism in Bangladesh</a>. To create a separate article is a POV fork. In the same vein, all this information about reports of Muslims is not enough for a separate article but inclusion into the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a> article where it belongs.<a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 02:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> with islam in india. Various articles dealing with American demographics exist as well.<a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERiseRobotRise_c242.html" title="User:RiseRobotRise">RiseRobotRise</a> 17:57, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>- An unjustifiable comparison. There are no articles on the demographics of religions in America (other than the articles on the religions in USA themselves like <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_the_United_States_39d6.html" title="Islam in the United States">Islam in the United States</a>, no state of Muslims in the United States). There is already an <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a> so this content can be put there. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 08:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as separate article as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a> is more suitable as a History related page and this article discusses the current scenario and this is one of the main topics being debated in India (Media, Parliament etc).

<li><b>Comment</b> - That creates way too many POV forks and, given the tendency for Indian Islamic and Hindu Fundamentalist editors, as well as the comrades from the far left, to troll in these types of articles it is better to keep them all in one place to avoid further disruption of wikipedia (by now, I'm sure everybody is aware of the argumentative shenanigans of some South Asian editors on wikipedia). <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 08:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
