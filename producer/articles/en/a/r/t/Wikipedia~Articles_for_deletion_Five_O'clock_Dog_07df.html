<p><b>All of the "Delete" users have violated many of the conditions for deletion.</b> They are all recomending "delete" without a legal foundation, they have not contacted the Wikipedia foundation to ask for guidance from the designated/official Wikipedia IP attorney prior to recomending deletion. This is a childrens book stub. Everything on the Five O'clock Dog website is part of the story in the book and is relevent material. Are all childrens book stubs ruthless self promotion . .&#160;?, is an admin or editors bio on their main user page "ruthless self-promotion" as they look for a higher paying job? or ask others to check out what great acomplishments they have made in their lives, hey just check out my bio on Wikipedia (Its not ruthless self-promotion - I promise). Are all the porno links and pics on Wikipedia ruthless self-promotion? The official rules of deletion ( if an article is repeatedly nominated for deletion, this is not in and of itself evidence that it should be deleted.) In some cases, repeated attempts to have an article deleted may even be considered <i>disruptive.</i> If in doubt, don't delete.) Did any "delete" folks follow this procedure. NO. Is there anyone else who wants to risk their Wikipedia credibility and just jump on the "delete" side without a Specific legal or factual reason for deletion. If all the "delete" folks want to invite a million people to talk about a children’s book stub, we are hereby not liable for any enticement of defamation or slander. We are also not reponsible for increased or decreased sales because of it. - The Publisher of Five O'clock Dog -20 january 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.174.32.71 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.174.32.71.html" title="User talk:67.174.32.71">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.174.32.71_6ec3.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.174.32.71">contribs</a>)  05:08, 21 January 2006.</small></p>

<ul>
<li>Qualification Statement:</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon further investigation we have come to realize that there is a very large amount of commercial fee based porn sites and other commercial services listed on Wikipedia. These pages inside Wikipedia were created and are maintained by Wikipedians as an advertisement that have direct links to the “pay a fee – buy some porn access or DVD’s - join here ” porn industry websites. (To many easy to find examples to list here)</p>
<ul>
<li>Further Qualification:</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Position from the beginning has been:</p>
<p>These aforementioned web sites are selling commercial products. The Wikipedia page for them is an informational advertisement. Large numbers of the pages contain trademarks as a site designation and heading. Many digital images on the Wikipedia website contain the ® after the Trademark. (This is just one example of many - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Intel-logo.svg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Intel-logo.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Intel-logo.svg</a>)</p>
<p>We are Neutral regarding all maters related to this. We are not singling out one industry, only using the above as a typical example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary:</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedians are in the process of deleting a children’s book page. (Stub) We assumed that since we did not see an 18 or over sign on the Wikipedia front page that Wikipedia is for all ages.</p>
<p>At last check there was 100% voting in favor of deleting the Five O’clock Dog Book stub page. (Article) (18 Wikipedians )</p>
<p>We feel that we have been singled out in a very discriminatory fashion. Further, we feel that deleting the Five O’clock Dog book stub is hypocritical.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As soon as the book is actually published by a reputable publishing house (read, not vanity press) and sells more than 5,000 copies, we will be quite happy to have an article about it, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. We will not put a link to purchase the book on Amazon, nor will we put "this name is a registered trademark" all over the article. Wikipedia is not a place to advertise things. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 21:56, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per above --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 22:02, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per above. I very rarely vote to delete, but the publisher's comments here are simply unacceptable. I suggest they not attempt legal threats while not understanding that Wikipedia is no more obligated to carry their content than bookstores are to carry their book. Deletion is not "discriminatory", and the publisher should understand that even if Wikipedia were to be massively, unfairly discriminatory in its deletion policies, there would still be no grounds for any legal action. That said, I urge people nominating and voting on AFD to be carefully uninsulting to the subjects and authors of articles up until the point where they say things like what this publisher has said above. -- <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake_Nelson_33c5.html" title="User:Jake Nelson">Jake</a> 23:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very strong delete</b> because of bad faith - the user that originally posted this article today sent me a rather long email that attacked my personal character rather than my actions as an administrator: I was the first person on Wikipedia to question this user over the content of this article. Nothing in their actions convinces me that this is nothing more than ruthless self promotion by a non-notable individual: if they were genuine I am sure their actions towards me and other users would have been much more above reproach. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">2000</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 01:09, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I also received a very large email. It was rather non-sequitor. It seemed it was a response to what someone else had said. —<a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrathchild-K_cab0.html" title="User:Wrathchild-K">Wrathchild</a> <sup><small>(<a href="../../../w/r/a/User_talk%7EWrathchild-K_6125.html" title="User talk:Wrathchild-K">talk</a>)</small></sup> 01:41, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's probably the same as the one I received, though mine had additions to the end that were little more than personal attacks against me as a person. I believe the person quoted may have been Jimbo, I have sent a copy of the email to him and asked him to confirm. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">2000</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 01:46, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
