<p>This page describes (in great detail) a bill introduced to the U.S. Congress by Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul that would have repealed sections of the Patriot Act. Not only did the bill die without action last year, there are literally thousands and thousands of bills that get introduced during a session of Congress, about 7 percent of which actually get enacted. I'm sure the bill was a fine one, but a) it went nowhere, and b) it never had a chance to go anywhere, which to me makes this not notable and thus not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia, despite the controversial nature of the Patriot Act. (There have been fistfuls of bills introduced trying to do various things to the Patriot Act, and this one is not particularly special in that group. I am a Capitol Hill reporter, so unfortunately I am all too familiar with this topic.) <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 20:56, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just a quick explanatory note: It will never pass. It in fact has now ceased to exist. It was introduced in the 108th Congress. It is now the 109th Congress. When Congress enters into a new congressional session, all bills are considered dead. They can be re-introduced (with new numbers), but for all intents and purposes they no longer exist. So far this has not been re-introduced, and probably won't be. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 17:15, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>At least <b>merge</b> some of this to <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act_9b8d.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a> or to the article on Kucinich, but I think it is more significant than much of the above suggests. This was more a protest action and a critique of the USA PATRIOT Act than it was ever really intended to pass into law. Think of it as a political demonstration by two House members whose politics are, in most respects, quite different from one another: Kucinich on the left edge of the Democratic Party and Ron Paul a right-libertarian Republican. I'm not sure if the detailing of its provisions is the right article to have, but I'd vote <b>keep</b> for rewriting this as a window into the strange bedfellows that have arisen from civil libertarian opposition to the USA PATRIOT Act. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:58, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Agree with Jmabel's analysis, but unless he's prepared to do such an encyclopedic edit, we should leave it to short notes in those articles, since I also agree with Katefan0 that there were many such bills introduced.

<ul>
<li>Members of Congress introduce/sponsor legislation ALL THE TIME. I looked it up, and Kuchinich is listed as sponsor of 19 bills and Paul of 62. Listing all of them would be pointless, and since the one we're discussing sank without a trace, why give it special prominence?

<li><b>Keep</b> Opposition to the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_Act_2eb5.html" title="Patriot Act">Patriot Act</a> is notable. As a part of that opposition, at the federal legislative level, pushes its notability above the <i>"literally thousands and thousands of bills that get introduced".</i> Passage is not required for notability. Added notability comes from its sponsorship by a <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004_3ccd.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2004">2004 presidential</a> candidate. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<ul>
<li>Opposition to the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_Act_2eb5.html" title="Patriot Act">Patriot Act</a> is no more notable than opposition to any other policy of the Bush administration: war in Iraq, defense policy, energy policy, Social Security privatization, tax cuts, education, you name it. Dozens of federal bills are introduced/sponsored every session by former presidential candidates: John Kerry, who actually polled above single digits, has 29 with his name on them from the 108th Congress.

<li>The term for keeping this article is "POV", and talk about "notability" is mere hand-waving. The bill was introduced, sank without leaving any real ripples, and is now officially dead: any "notability" is among those committed to those opposing the USA PATRIOT Act, not the world at large. This bill, is, at best, a historical footnote not deserving of a full article -- certainly not in the eye-glazing detail this one has -- and the purpose of keeping it is for consciousness-raising (or, to be blunt, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>) purposes. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 01:46, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I respectfully disagree with you, Keith. The fact that this bill was introduced in opposition to the Patriot Act does not inherently make it notable. I also disagree that it gains added notability because it was introduced by Kucinich. He was a presidential candidate, but only barely -- like this bill, his candidacy was futile from the start. Does this also mean that failed Democratic contender Carol Moseley Braun's bills are also inherently more notable? (No.) <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 20:58, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Even if "This bill, is, at best, a historical footnote..." then what is a comprehensive encyclopaedia like this for if it is not allowed to contain what could hardly be considered an excessively long piece on a historical footnote. Its existence cannot be propaganda unless you argue that an articles existence constitutes implied notability and hence validity. So then edit the page to accurately portray its actual significance, so people can decide for themselves.
