<p>I have several reasons for nominating this.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, most Harry Potter books have articles in many other wikis, so the titles of the books in other languages can be obtained there.</li>
<li>Second, I don't think Wikipedia should be in the business of having articles like this -- WP isn't babelfish.com and it isn't a dictionary either; I think this is unencyclopedic... I know Harry Potter is popular, but if we keep this it's a slippery slope. Occasionally, the translation of a book title is interesting, for instance, the German title of "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is translated as "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Fear", but (1) the article isn't about the interesting alternate titles, and (2) in any case, we have a good article on the translation of Harry Potter: <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_in_translation_3067.html" title="Harry Potter in translation">Harry Potter in translation</a>.</li>
<li>Third, this article suffers from a complete lack of sources; it's been a month since I added the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tag, and 3 since the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_titles_of_Harry_Potter_books_in_other_languages_7ff1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of titles of Harry Potter books in other languages">first nomination</a>, and no referencing has happened, nor any cleaning up.</li>
<li>Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, if the article <i>were</i> properly sourced, it would look suspiciously like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, I think: unless someone ELSE has ever written an article or book about the translation of Harry Potter, we're going to be using entirely primary sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>For all these reasons, <b>delete.</b> <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:31, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, there is nothing against creating an article based on primary sources <i>per se</i>. What it talks about that's not allowed is a Wikipedia article actually <i>being</i> a primary source. Of course, creating an article based <i>entirely</i> on primary sources causes some OR problems with some people. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 04:35, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This is true, and a good point. WP:OR says that in the case of an article that makes only descriptive claims that can be easily verified by any adult without specialist knowledge, an article <i>can</i> be based only on primary sources, implying that otherwise, articles should not be based only on primary sources. I think the other-language titles are probably okay, but most of the interest in the article is the translation back to English, and I certainly don't think, for instance, that someone could verify the back-translation of, say, a Chinese book title without knowing at least some Chinese. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. It's obivious a strong effort went into this, but this does not creat instant notability/worthiness of an article. It seems a little ridiculous, unnecessary, and excessive to have a list like this. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 04:41, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe"><small><b>'</b></small></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/p/o/User_talk%7EApostrophe_d228.html" title="User talk:Apostrophe">Feeling chatty?</a> ) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Apostrophe_7a7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Apostrophe">Edits!</a>)</sup> 04:43, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't like to call into play the "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" clause, but it might apply here. Perhaps it could be merged to the Harry Potter page? I doubt it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 05:17, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why dump a ugly list onto a decent article? <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe"><small><b>'</b></small></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/p/o/User_talk%7EApostrophe_d228.html" title="User talk:Apostrophe">Feeling chatty?</a> ) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Apostrophe_7a7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Apostrophe">Edits!</a>)</sup> 05:21, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Although I argued for keeping the list of names of Disney characters, I think this one should go. This functions much more as a dictionary entry (not encyclopedia) and, as pointed out above, the titles are readily available by clicking on the side bar. It's not as important or as interesting as the names of the Disney characters (which, I admit is still too list-like but is considerably better than this pure list). <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 05:44, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm inclined to follow Interlingua's argument here too, but it turns out that there isn't a Greek entry for the first book, whatever it's called, and if there were I take it there wouldn't be a Latin transliteration of the title. So this does seem to contain some additional information. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:12, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Isn't really notable and seems like an unnecessary. I don't really see any of the information contained in the article to be of worth elsewhere so I'm not inclined to recommmend a merge.--<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAuger_Martel_3d86.html" title="User:Auger Martel">Auger Martel</a> 07:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, there might be reasons for mentioning some translated names of Harry Potter characters (on the HP article), such as any that caused particular problems in certain languages. This, however, is cross-Wiki-language list-cruft with severe verifiabilty and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problems. It does not justify its own article. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 10:39, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
