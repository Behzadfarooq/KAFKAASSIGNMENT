<p>Keep - Had not heard of Tilly Smith prior to seeing her listed in Wikipedia. Suggest you keep the article and include a link to the National Geographic article <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0118_050118_tsunami_geography_lesson_2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0118_050118_tsunami_geography_lesson_2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Teachers looking to see how they can have a positive effect on students may benefit. In my opinion, this is valuable and relevant information for social, psychological, humanitarian and educational reasons. Tilly Smith saved 100 lives. Who writing here has saved one? The act itself deserves an entry. Clyo Beck December 16, 2005</p>

<li><i>just a girl credited with saving nearly a hundred foreign tourists</i>? Man, even if I hated tourists that much, I would not confess it on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> for those voting to keep everythig verifiable - It's not like the section on alter-egos in the Calvin and Hobbes article is swelling to the point of bursting or something, why have redundant information? You have a point about Wikipedia's potential purview, which I don't disrespect, whether or not I agree, but in this case, you're overextending, IMO. The first article to bud off of the Calvin and Hobbes article would have to be the entire alter-egos section, and then, when each section of that grows big enough, it could be split. That's when Tracer Bullet gets his own article.

<li><s><b>Strong keep</b>.

It's a dry analysis of Iraqi law and recent history as it affects gay rights. It certainly doesn't attack the United States. If it does have POV problems (which I don't see), then the proper procedure is to give it an NPOV flag and leave comments on the talk page or better yet to correct the text.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm at a loss to see what <i>POV issues</i> to fix. The only specific examples in this discussion come from people who appear not to have read the article. It attacks no country or culture. It does not advocate homosexuality. <a href="../../../g/a/y/Category%7EGay_rights_by_country_6550.html" title="Category:Gay rights by country">Category:Gay rights by country</a> has 35 other entries. I say this with caution since such things should not be suggested lightly, but perhaps the intersection of <i>gay</i> + <i>Iraq</i> pushes buttons for some people. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 03:52, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobody is talking of censure simply because of nomination of an article we wish kept. It's the *expressed* motive of the deletion that's the problem, and the means of promoting the deletion. We must <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, but the nominator has made clear through their own words and actions; that they're seeking the deletion of articles based on religious/moral grounds, and are trying to gather a coalition of like-minded voters along sectarian lines to accomplish this. That's what's truly unacceptable here. As an anology, if somebody nominated a Christian rights in Iraq article because they personally opposed Christianity, and solicited votes principally from people they thought shared their religious views (based on religious affiliation), then that would also be unacceptable. We don't want any religious block to start dictating content at Wikipedia. If you don't like the article title, then please go to the talk page, and suggest an alternate name, and try and gain a consensus for a better one. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:51, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article is full of factual errors and outlandish claims, which extracted would leave the article nil. If needed I could elaborate</li>
<li>The intention of the article is, as the last line shows, intentionally derogatory (and perhaps slanderous) of, at least,one political party and a well known journalist</li>
<li>The appearance of a genocide denial accusation makes the derogatory intentionality even more evident. I know of no person who has denied that during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, crimes than in a broad sense could be called genocide happened in both parties. What there is, ever since the start of the war, is discussion about the causes, ways and numerical volume of it.</li>
<li>Discussion of the war at a whole, and many other historically related issuess has recently flourished again in Spain (it's true partly on /around political issues), but the so termed <i>revisionists</i>,mainly keep their research within scholary acceptable standards, Their conclusions may be controversial in relationship to current mainstream perceptions or affront some political groups, and even might be false -the race is still open-. But that's just the normal play.</li>
<li>I think, as the so called <i>revisionist</i> school has very few things in common, specific problems are better suited in the articles which touch the matter. <a href="../../../w/l/l/User%7EWllacer_d023.html" title="User:Wllacer">Wllacer</a> 00:48, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I've been researching a little more on the topic.

<li>Nominator is improperly conflating a discussion of what they perceive as POV issues in the article, with the issue of whether the article should be deleted or merged. That is wrong. All discussion of POV issuss should have been left on the article's talk page.</li>
<li>The original author of this article clearly isn't a native speaker of English. But it looks like they tried to confine themself to a neutral point of view. As to nominator's assertion that the title is a neologism? I strongly suspect the original author made their best effort to translate a real term, in Cataln, into English. I think it is unfortunate that the nominator didn't assume good faith, and suggest the actual translation for the Catalan term.</li>
<li>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Catalan_negationism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31045957" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Catalan_negationism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31045957" rel="nofollow">the suggestion</a> that the article more properly belonged under a name like Historical revisionism (Catalunya). Nominator has not assumed good faith, and is implying that the creation of an article duplicate content is an attempt to end run policy, rather than considering that it is a shocked newbies attempt to conform with policy. I think these two nominations highlight the importance for nominators to comply with policy and leave their concerns over POV issues on the articles talk page.</li>
<li>This nomination gives the appearance that the nominator is trying to use wikipedia policies to win the upper hand in a POV dispute. I had a wikipedia contributor, who thought my contributions showed a biased POV. When I asked them to explain how they thought I was showing a bias, they couldn't or wouldn't explain themselves. Instead of engaging in a civil dialogue they started nominating the articles I created for deletion. It was a highly disturbing attack on the wikipedia community, in general. Having gone through this, I urge all wikipedians to make the effort to show good faith, follow the policy, and not let their POV concerns leak into {afd} discussions. And I urge all wikipedians who follow {afd} discussions to be on the lookout for nominators who, consciously or unconsciously, slip POV issues into their nominations. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 14:46, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nope, they don't spring up overnight. And they don't spring up overmonth or even overyear. I challenge you to go look at school articles over a year old, and see for yourself how few get much past the stage they originally appeared at.

<li>My, you're good at setting up straw men. But I will take one of your wheat guys and say yes to no stubs for non-notable schools. West Armpit High School will be a one-sentence stub for as many decades as you care to wait, because quite frankly, Jjay, no one gives a beaver's backside about this school except a few of its former students, who probably aren't even aware of Wikipedia's existence, or if they are, couldn't be bothered to improve the article. I am willing to accept school articles which present well as articles, but I have no patience for articles which are half-baked placeholders for maybe maybe something happening down the road. Maybe.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<dd>At the time of my original vote, I was unaware that speedy deletion was mandated for articles not asserting the importance of an individual. I'm not happy with this policy, frankly, and I don't think it actually has consensus at this point (it only ever passed with 74% support, less than that required to make someone an admin), but I recognize that we can't very well allow individual editors to question policy because <i>they</i> don't think it has consensus (<a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> aside).</dd>
<dd>So let me change my reasoning in this case: Dr. Evans appears to have some hundreds of Google hits (some of the 1,150 appear to be talking about another Myron Evans but most seem to be referring hto the man in question), he has 59 <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Myron+Evans%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Myron+Evans%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a> hits.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Certainly, Evans is a classic crackpot. (Einstein and Cartan are rolling in their graves.) <i>But is he even notable?</i> The Harrison Memorial Prize and apparently indistinguishable Mendola Memorial Prize are awarded annually "to a British Chemist who is under 30 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry", according to <a href="http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/AwardsAndFunding/Meldola/index.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/AwardsAndFunding/Meldola/index.asp" rel="nofollow">Royal Society of Chemistry list of prizes</a>. Is this really a sufficiently notable prize? RSC lists a very long list of prizes at their website, check it out. <s>As for a scholarship, I dare say most commentators have recieved one of <i>those</i> at one time or another.</s> I have been utterly unable to verify the claims about affiliation with Cornell Theory Center, etc., although this is mentioned at a large number of websites like <a href="http://www.americanantigravity.com" class="external text" title="http://www.americanantigravity.com" rel="nofollow">American Antigravity</a>, <a href="http://www.freeenergynews.com" class="external text" title="http://www.freeenergynews.com" rel="nofollow">Free Energy News</a> whose reliability is... suspect&#160;:-) I did find however that Myron Evans is one of these charming fellows who likes to take legal action to discourage debunkers. Check this out: <a href="http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/Beware/MyronEvansCensorship/Rebuttal/index.html" class="external text" title="http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/Beware/MyronEvansCensorship/Rebuttal/index.html" rel="nofollow">Myron Evans Censorship Rebuttal</a>. The "AIAS" which Evans mentions is something called the <a href="http://www.aias.us" class="external text" title="http://www.aias.us" rel="nofollow">Alpha Institute of Advanced Studies</a>, an organization directed by himself. At least some of the prizes he claims on his C.V. appear to have been awarded by... AIAS! Hence the need for <i>independent</i> verification of alleged notability. The UW library does have three monographs coauthored by Myron Wyn Evans. All in all, it seems very clear that if we decide that Evans' contributions to chemistry are notable (I'd guess they are not, unless we want to have a biography of everyone who has coauthored a technical book, but I'm not a chemist), then the article needs to be rewritten to clarify the dubious nature of Evans's crackpot claims about free-energy and his so-called "theory".---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 23:12, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Colin, we might be getting off the track, but did you notice that your Google Scholar search includes papers from Evans own site which apparently have not been published? So evidently you must be cautious in using Google Scholar to verify claims in suspect WP articles: there is certainly no guarantee that what you turn up there is even referreed, much less appeared in a respectable research journal. (Even then, of course, as the Bogdanov affair shows, problems can arise.) Also, AFAIK there is no "Evans lemma in gtr" except in his mind, and I think I know the gtr literature pretty well. What are your standards for notability? Simply having published a scholarly book or some papers? I think we need to maintain a higher standard than that, while perhaps not setting the bar as high as Brittanica. Still, I don't think you've answered the question: I see evidence for the dirty bathwater, but where's the baby?---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 00:57, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Some of those books and papers are self-published and/or self-referential, but others are legitimate (like <a href="http://product.half.ebay.com/Modern-Non-Linear-Optics_W0QQtgZinfoQQprZ780514" class="external text" title="http://product.half.ebay.com/Modern-Non-Linear-Optics_W0QQtgZinfoQQprZ780514" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, for example). The question is whether there are enough legitimate accomplishments remaining after a thorough sort to make Mr. Evans notable. I personally believe that there are, but of course you're free to differ. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 19:32, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, I'd like to see a higher standard of notability, but recognize that many do not agree. I can suggest a <i>compromise solution for what to do with this article</i>, although I hesitate to suggest it because I've had a bad experience in a similar context.</dd>
<dd>Question for all participants in this discussion: would you find it acceptable if some user were to rewrite the article to describe Evan's work in <i>chemistry</i>, which appears to be "mainstream" (it would be best if whoever does this were a chemist! or at least checks with a knowledgeable chemist), plus the Harrison Prize, followed by a <i>brief</i> <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> description of what I would call his "cranky" claims? It should be possible to briefly describe those claims in NPOV fashion, adding a dry disclaimer such as: <i>this "theory" appears to be little known in physics, and is apparently regarded as cranky by those physicists who do know about it.</i> (Whoever did this would probably want to omit the "scare quotes", but I can't bring myself to apply the word "theory" to these particular claims without qualification!) Keep the external links so that readers easily find both Evan's writings and critiques of his writings.</dd>
<dd>Assuming there is a consensus that this would be a reasonable compromise, someone could volunteer to make the changes. But probably only an admin should volunteer for this kind of content cleanup job!---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 22:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe. First, I would want to know if Evans is actually notable <i>as a chemist</i>. If not, he may still be a notable crackpot, but in that case the article would have to focus on his theories, his efforts to promote them, and the scientific community's view of his work. In other words, if he is notable, the article should focus on discussing whatever it is that makes him notable.</dd>

<dd>I agree with this comment. If he is notable - for whatever reason, including being a notable crackpot or controversial theorist - he deserves an article. The quality of the article is not really relevant; there is sufficent content and AfD is not cleanup. I simply don't see enough to convince me that he is notable. His tendency to self publish and self award actually works against him here, because it makes it difficult to separate out his actual accomplishments. The Harrison Memorial award seems to be significant, but it isn't clear to me that it is important enough by itself to justify an article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 20:53, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that's why I suggested obtaining confirmation from a neutral chemist that Evans could reasonably be considered notable for his chemistry work. Again tending to want to set the notability bar higher than some, I doubt Evans should be notable purely as a <i>crank</i>, since the only references I could find to his "theory" were on crank websites, which I suspect are very little known except to the tiny tiny minority of freelunchers. However, I am searching for a compromise with Colin, so while I myself would not include a biography of Evans, including one emphasizing his mainstream(?) work at the expense of his obscure crackpottery still seems to me an acceptable compromise.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 12:52, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax, possibly meriting a speedy. Zero relevant Google hits for "'Ben Rowan' Australia."

<li>I wouldn't consider DeviantART much of a source when it comes to verifying the facts or existance of someone. Anyone can set up an account in seconds and write pretty much anything. I'm listed as <a href="http://thecharmedmuse.deviantart.com/" class="external text" title="http://thecharmedmuse.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">someone's favourite photographer</a> there too, but that doesn't mean I'm really recognised as a photography professional.

<li>Double check those four hits at Deviant Art. They don't refer to an artist by this name. They're just incidental occurrences of <i>Ben</i> and <i>Rowan</i> in the same work.

Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article.

<li>Wikipedia is <i>not</i> consistant. Arguments of "We have articles on those insignificant things, so we must have an article on <i>this</i> insignificant thing" are very wrong in my opinion.

<li>If being a candidate in any location is the same, then candidates in any location should actually be treated the same when their articles show up on Wikipedia. But they're not. Unelected Canadian candidates get AFD'd; unelected American candidates get kept. "We have articles on those insignificant things, so we must have an article on <i>this</i> insignificant thing" is a blatant mischaracterization of the real issue; it's more accurately described as <b>"these two things of precisely <i>equal</i> significance to each other are being treated <i>differently</i> from each other based on some criterion not communicated in Wikipedia guidelines"</b>. It's <i>entirely</i> understandable in such circumstances that some people might suspect the mystery criterion to be "American vs. not-American". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:53, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> First off, not all candidates are equal. As a denizen, I can elucidate that running for the NDP means the candidate has no chance whatsoever to get anywhere close to being elected. The NDP prides itself (and why not) on running candidates in every national riding, but frequently must resort to nn students and the like, since in no-hope ridings like, oh say, every single riding in Quebec, few else can be bothered. Some seem to be putting the cart before the horse with respect to the notabilty of these candidates. Running for election because an individual has achieved notability is one thing, and certainly a number of candidates who lose are, in other respects, notable. But running for office, in and of itself, is not grounds for establishing notability. Finally, <b>shame</b> on any Canadians who hide behind systematic bias as a basis for inclusion. That is unworthy. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 17:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The "merged candidate list" solution creates problems of its own, but to date it's the only workable solution anybody has found to balance some people's concerns about the notability of unelected candidates against other people's equally strong concerns that selective inclusion constitutes a political bias.

<li>Why would redirect to multiple pages be necessary?

There doesn't seem to be a problem of them popping up between elections. As for the internal wikilinks, they would need to be made in context of the discussion, to not wikilink to a redirect.

<p>Originally tagged as CSD A1 as this was a blank article. However, checking the history revealed that the content had been blanked, and not by the original author. The claims to notability are weak, but are there none the less, so I don't think it's a CSD A7 article and I can't prove it's vanity either. However, I suspect it is vanity and the weak notability claim ("some believe his work... has been called by many..."} don't wash with me. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 10:07, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think their might be merit in keeping this article but little of it is substantial as it stands. One thing I am clear of is that any Irish Free State/Ireland (Eire)/Republic should only be merged in so far as it is benificial in improving <i>quality</i>, and any other material should be retained in the context of it being background material with a similar benificial/quality requirement. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 19:10, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The historical coinage of the island is not the coinage of one part of it. It seems to me that <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coins_of_Ireland_3861.html" title="Coins of Ireland">Coins of Ireland</a> <i>(without the full stop)</i> should cover coins from historical times until 1921, and then stop. <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coinage_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland_362a.html" title="Coinage of the Republic of Ireland">Coinage of the Republic of Ireland</a> can commence from 1921, albeit that it includes the Free State and Ireland/Éire phases. "Coinage of Ulster" is a nonsense - either they are pre-partition "Coinage of Ireland" or post partition "Coinage of the Republic of Ireland" and "Coin <i>(sic)</i> of Northern Ireland" (the only coin is one version of the £1 coin, I think). --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a> 00:13, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I am not sure how this one got nominated, but there we go.

It is solely made to document why Chris Beasley feels that Daniel Brandt was wrong to criticise him and wrong to criticise google. It is not a web site - it is an article. It has been in existence for what 2 years now and has not ever gone beyond being 1 single solitary page, whose sole aim is to counter a criticism made by Brandt against Beasley. Indeed, not only should this article be deleted off Wikipedia, but I really don't see the point in google-watch-watch even existing as a domain name. What a waste of $10/year domain name fees!

<li><b>Comment</b>: there are one or two references to Celtic dragons involving "the original Gaelic", which suggest Wales (which doesn't speak Gaelic) does not have the monopoly on Celticism: <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/catalog/data/071031/0710310862.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/catalog/data/071031/0710310862.HTM" rel="nofollow">example here</a> -- this one is an academic publisher clearly referring to Scotland. This is why in my original nomination I argued against the redirect to a page about the Welsh one and why I'm still against a misleading redirect and in favour of just deleting it. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> 16:06, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>It seems to be a common term, even if it's mostly used incorrectly, and would be a shame to delete and leave nothing there. If you understand what the topic well enough to write a 1 sentence stub, just one that says it a design related to, distinct from, but often confused for the <a href="../../../y/_/d/Y_Ddraig_Goch_9023.html" title="Y Ddraig Goch">Y Ddraig Goch</a>, that would be spectacular. Otherwise, I too prefer deletion to redirect. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 21:09, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If I may say, you did set this page up in order to put a link on your homepage saying "There is a Wikipedia article about me!", and you were deliberately misleading as to your achievements in an attempt at self-promotion. You then spuriously linked yourself to all sorts of pages which have little to do with you - for example are you REALLY a "famous resident" of your home county or town? And does the entry for the leader of the opposition in the UK REALLY need a link to you just because you once worked for him when he was a less important MP? And does the entry on "Abdication" REALLY need a link to you just because you have written a book with the word "abdication" in the title? I could go on - you contrived to post at least 15 links to yourself. This isn't really what Wikipedia is about - it is called vanity Alex and you should be ashamed. --213.121.207.34 09:42, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Lengthy article about some "online comic made with the Half-Life 2 engine". The only people apparently interested in writing the article haven't touched it in 5+ months, and in that time, the site hosting the comic, as well as the apparent fansite and archive, seem to have shut down permanently. I can't find anywhere else where this thing is hosted. So basically, this is an abandoned article about an abandoned webcomic. <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 21:23, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is not an article about a phrase at all. It's an article about the relative merits of the various branches of the U.S. military. Such an article probably could be written.

<p>I have nominated this entry for deletion since it is IMHO a vanity page. Thatte is a surname in India. While there have been, I am sure, notable Thattes, none of them are mentioned and there is nothing particularly compelling about this family/surname as compared with the thousands and millions throughout the world. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 17:01, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like this page to remain as it is through this page that I came to know about the website on my family. I wish more people reach this page by chance and get to know about their family. Well as far as achievements of Thattes, there are many if proper research is done.

<li>A group of university students has made up a dance. The article is wholly unverifiable, there being no sources to document the purported dance's existence either cited in the article or otherwise locatable. (I note with amusement that using "shit of a lifetime" as a search phrase makes research very easy.)

<li><b>Keep</b> but find a better name if possible. There's no denying that African-Americans have been a significant bloc within liberal politics. Designation for this ethnic group is not arbitrary, given historical and cultural conditions within the United States. An article identifying these people is a research tool.

<li>It's a better name than <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_leftism.html" title="Black leftism">Black leftism</a> in my opinion because it's less ambiguous about regions.

I think "leftism" is more specific. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <i>(<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">talk</a>)</i> 00:03, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I know that liberalism means different things in different parts of the world, but this is an article about African <i>American</i> liberals. Thus using liberalism in the American sense is fine. <b>Move</b> to African American liberalism, and if there isn't a companion article on African American conservatism, make one. "Leftist" is a snarl-term for many in the US. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 04:58, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Leftist is a serious term for anyone on the left. I oppose a move to African American liberalism for the reason that Angela Davis and others on the list are more to the left than many "liberals". --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <i>(<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">talk</a>)</i> 05:48, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Durova/Revolución, the meaning of "liberalism" depends on where you live and whether youre talking about social or economic matters. "Leftist" has connotations of "hard left" for me.

This person seems to be a national success in his area of music, and has some following internationally abroad (though restricted to his ethnic group). Also, admittedly the article was (and still is) very poorly worded, but that can be addressed. I could understand the nomination, if the nominator indicated they looked at all this information, and felt he still failed <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (reasonable people can differ on that, as measuring success in a small country is trickier than measuring it for the US), but the nomination seems to be utterly oblivious to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> which is what we should be discussing.

<li>I disagree. If somebody knowledgable/interested (e.g. familiar with this music scene) doesn't clean it up properly, then anybody can simply replace it quickly with a a 2-3 line stub, leaving behind the links, stub tag, and category.

<p>The only information that checks out about this alleged hip hop artist (albeit only according to Google) is that someone named "Omega Redd" exists (see quote below). None of the other information I checked - about the robbery of Allen Strong, his radio singles, etc. - come up. His alleged altercation with high-profile hip hop artist Jay-Z is particularly suspect, as it would have appeared in the media.</p>
<p>The overall tone of this article is in equal parts self-laudatory and absurd. This article was first posted anonymously, and it's earliest versions are even more fraught with "gangster" mythology - Omega Redd's arrests for violent crime, penning lyrics while in prison, an arrest for murder and subsequent (short) bid in prison, release from prison and recording an album, arrest for grand larceny, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, the only on-line description I could find of Omega Redd, from norecordlabel.com <a href="http://norecordlabel.com/biopageframe.php?b_id=5133" class="external autonumber" title="http://norecordlabel.com/biopageframe.php?b_id=5133" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>:<i>Omega Redd and Rebelz Of Treble Recordz hail the grimey streets of Buffalo New York. A young cat with unmatchable flavor first set out at the early age of 9 to become an essential asset to the rap game. 7 years later, with his skill level highly developed, he takes on and tackles all forms of rap, from gangsta to battle, and crushes the competition. With enough said, let the music speak for itself.</i> <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanspalding_ced1.html" title="User:Danspalding">Danspalding</a> 23:12, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>this page is <b>redundant</b> with respect to a recently created, more detailed page on <b><a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimmer%27s_itch.html" title="Swimmer's itch">swimmer's itch</a></b>. Moreover, in its original form it erroneously stated that cercarial dermatitis to be a mild form of schistosomiasis. While, technically, "cercarial dermatitis" may refer to both the mild dermatological symptoms of an otherwise serious disease caused by parasites of humans (<i>Schistosoma</i>) and the benign, short-lived symptoms caused by other schistosomes that do not successfully infect humans, it is useful to reserve the term for only one of the conditions, which have distinct etiologies.

<p>Absolutely untrue! Veracity was one of the most noteworthy up-and-coming New England bands over the past five years. They were featured in <i>The Stamford Advocate</i> newspaper and various other publications. More importantly, its members have gone on to even bigger and more famous projects (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pizza_War_83f6.html" title="The Pizza War">The Pizza War</a>, currently being made into a movie!) KeithAllen 20:32, 16 December 2005</p>
<p>Veracity is awesome, here at fordham they are HUGE! - Michael Riordan, Fordham</p>
<p>I know this band and they meet the requirements!!! Wilson and Petrower were featured on MUG Radio, the national radio station for GarageBand and iCompositions. - KeithPetrower, www.icompositions.com</p>

<p>Do what you will, Wikipedia, and I'll live with it. But in my opinion your "Music notability standers" hinder the very goal of this great site. Just because a band didn't appear on MTV, does that mean they didn't exist and have a legacy and impact in the music world? I think that is a very naive way to judge artists and it detracts from what this site could offer to the music community. -Keith</p>

<li>That works for me; I think that was the recommendation of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_September_11%2C_researchers_0575.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/September 11, researchers">Previous AfD</a>. The content then at <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_researchers.html" title="September 11, researchers">September 11, researchers</a> was to be merged into <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. That never happened, and the articles developed for a while as different versions of the same topic. I found it a few weeks ago and finished the merge, but there is a question now whether <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_researchers.html" title="September 11 researchers">September 11 researchers</a> should be kept, since it has developed independently since the last AfD. That's not my view, so I would prefer someone else present that case.

<li><b>Delete</b>, because the merge recommended by the previous deletion has been completed. I think I need to make some things clear as well, since Durin and Tom are obviously unaware of some things that I did:
<ul>
<li>In response to the consensus favouring a merge after the last discussion, I tagged <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_researchers.html" title="September 11 researchers">September 11 researchers</a> for a merge with <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>.</li>

I said it was Saddam Hussein from the moment the planes flew in, and I don't get why people think its so hard to believe. The 9/11 one mentions it, whilst this other one doesn't. That theory should be expanded a fair bit though. Oh, also, I saw no mention of anti-globalisation terrorist group S11 being a theory. They were widely blamed, and the group was totally destroyed as a result. Oh and don't forget China. China had a motive to do it, so as to destroy the American economy to precipitate an invasion at a later date. After all, China was very annoyed at America then after they had shot down one of China's spy planes, and China is America's biggest challenge to world dominance, and the most likely country to take over control. These 2 theories do need to be mentioned. But since I personally believe the Saddam Hussein theory, I think that that needs to be explored an awful lot more than it is.<a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 22:07, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Censorship based on a desire to let one's eight-year old run wild and free on a free-edit site on the internet does not hold water. This entry is useful though perhaps revolting (as are most medical journals) and there is absolutely no reason to remove it. Attempting to impose your personal moral standards on the content of Wikipedia is in direct conflict with any sort of impartiality. As an aside, it is noteworthy that Wikipedia's ability to include even lowbrow slang terms amongst its entries may be an asset rather than a liability in its competition against more restricted encyclopediae (Britannica was mentioned).Epicurus13 20:48, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm a somewhat surprising person <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng">Howcheng</a>, my esteemed <i>deletionist</i> colleague. You may not believe this, but the mental wellbeing of children and young Wikipedia editors is one of the key factors that guides my voting. One glance at this excretory ode told me that delete was the only sensible response. Could I sleep at night knowing I was contributing to the future psychological trauma of legions of 8 year olds across the English speaking world? I think not. My conscience salved, I will now proceed in my tireless but lonely rearguard struggle for the Wikipedia rights of high schools, Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and Lists of fictional Elvis Imposters. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:48, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>MUST KEEP:</b> Slang is an integral part of our lexicon. It fosters the evolution of our language. Without a recorded record of word explications and samples of usage, the word (expression) would cease to be used meaningfully and therefore corrupt the use of the English language into dialects meaningless, in this case, outside of Cinncinati.</li>

<li>Obscenity is <i>NOT</i> a criterion for deletion. Verifiability is. So the real question is whether this is a <i>real</i> term, or a hoax made up out of whole cloth.

<li><s><b>Strong Delete</b></s> Wikipedia needs to enforce community standards on its site so as not to become a cesspool of obscenity and filth like much of the rest of the internet.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - Dado nominated the article for deletion because "the side who started this article has not presented valid claims and/or answered the issues raised on the discussion page". However, he doesn't state what are the issues. Claim that serbophobia can not be characterized as psychological disorder (phobia) is answered by the fact that the article does not characterise it that way (see <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbophobia_bbf8.html#Disputed" title="Talk:Serbophobia">Talk:Serbophobia#Disputed</a>). Claim that the term is not notable is answered by presenting some 1500 Google hits in various languages, and showing that, comparatively, it is used as much as <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russophobia.html" title="Russophobia">russophobia</a> (see <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbophobia_bbf8.html#Not_Notable_.2F_Neologism" title="Talk:Serbophobia">Talk:Serbophobia#Not Notable / Neologism</a>). Claim that there is no definition was answered by providing a source with a definition (see <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbophobia_bbf8.html#Sources" title="Talk:Serbophobia">Talk:Serbophobia#Sources</a>; definition referred to can be found f.e. in <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/malic/m040501.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antiwar.com/malic/m040501.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>).

I have raised several issues and no one has responded to those issue. In fact few have outright ignored them by reverting suggested edits. In addition to my comments on the talk page, the claim "Serbian Writers Association also organized a meeting on February 28, 1989 with the theme of "Serbophobia" that discussed Croatian genocide of Serbs" fails to note that around same time Serbian nationalism (as other nationalisms) in the Balkans was on the rise and portraying Serbs as victims of phobia was one of the tools to raly Serbian nation into Yugoslav Wars that followed. In fact the article as it currently read does a very similar thing. Ironicaly, most victims of Serbophobia in last 20 years were non-Serbs. I don't see this article being able to overcome these problems while it is obvious that its purpose is to continue the politics of spreading fear among Serbian people and non-Serbs as a reflex to former, and as such presents an article of no value or even damaging to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 05:53, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This word does not deserve an article of its own, it’s a term devised for explicitly political purposes during the late 80s and early 90s. It can not be compared to "Russophobia" or "Islamophobia" because both of these deal with prevalent general social attitudes against ethnic and religious groups based on their culture and heritage. The term Serbophobia, on the other hand, is used virtually exclusively in a political context, in either an accusatory manner or as a justification. To say that it is "comparatively" as common as the term "Russophobia" is ridiculous, and based on some shady calculation certain users made involving army size and GDP. A simple Google search shows that the term "Russophobia" is far, far more common than "Serbophobia". Of the results that do show up on Google, I think they adequately manifest the nature of this term and exactly why it does not belong on Wikipedia. Of the initial 10 results that come up on the first page:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The #1 result is the respective Wikipedia article</dd>
<dd>2 come from a radical right political site</dd>
<dd>6 of them come from the same two Serbian political writers and analysts.</dd>
<dd>1 comes from a book on Serbian propaganda efforts during the late 80s and early 90s</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this all wasn't enough, the single legitimate source provided has been completely misinterpreted. The quote reads as follows: "Furthering this incipient nation-fever was the extraordinary memorandum issued to the public in 1986 by the prestigious Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences, condemning the perceived presence of <b>"Serbophobia"</b> in the central government of Yugoslavia." The use of this as a reference for some traditional use of the term would be fine and dandy if the word wasn’t placed in quotes; but it is. This is because the author views the term with skepticism and questions its validity, implying (just as Dado mentioned) that the word was used by Serb officials to drum up support amongst the populace for their nationalist policies. I challenge any neutral observer to read the context of the word, notice the tone of the passage, read the preceding paragraphs, and not reach the same conclusion as I did<a href="http://print.google.com/print?id=be2UW6NyposC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=serbophobia&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3Dserbophobia%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&amp;sig=bDNV8ev7gaG8ugflcWk5U2Emwiw&amp;auth=DQAAAHAAAAAktZCq-3ZfkRqCnubp4FnSrgsYSU-5isjUsRSBiTae3HOp-DT96fi8pdhDcWkw4XM5cjejdv3-uKflMJnYMWFK1UGTWMWcY09UpVKyF1R94F29JmQCOAEmwjyzwxL-2jpFb2D6P2haOAQR6ubU4IOl" class="external autonumber" title="http://print.google.com/print?id=be2UW6NyposC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=serbophobia&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3Dserbophobia%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&amp;sig=bDNV8ev7gaG8ugflcWk5U2Emwiw&amp;auth=DQAAAHAAAAAktZCq-3ZfkRqCnubp4FnSrgsYSU-5isjUsRSBiTae3HOp-DT96fi8pdhDcWkw4XM5cjejdv3-uKflMJnYMWFK1UGTWMWcY09UpVKyF1R94F29JmQCOAEmwjyzwxL-2jpFb2D6P2haOAQR6ubU4IOl" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 06:53, 17 December 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<li>Asim, you are trying to mislead people. The quote was given as evidence that the word was used in 1986 and so is not a neologism, not as evidence that it is valid.</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. I think, this is a pathetic "article" based on well-known Serb nationalistic propaganda.

<li>Could you point to a quote by any of them where they do so? Regardless, why would such use of the word justify deletion of the article from Wikipedia?

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - this is pure politically-motivated absurdity; the term is not in current usage anywhere, including Serbia. Instead it emanated from Serbian propagandists atempting to cover up the Serbian poitical establishment's disregard for international law, human rights and human dignity. The simpple test is: do the authors really believe that people would go out of their way to criticise or oppose Serbian politics if it did not engage in genocide, ethnic cleansing and racism? I think not. This kind of article represents a mis-use of wikipedia as it has no practical informational or educational benefit.

<li>(The copyvio comment was in particular motivated by the image showing Ratko Mladić in Srebrenica, which was uploaded by user Edvin with no source information at all and who could never be bothered to answer my question about the source so that I could perhaps use the image on Serbian wiki.) As there is another user voting for deletion in the same status as me, I think we can close this discussion about voting rights as irrelevant. Please continue to contribute to the English and other Wikipedias as the active netizens of these respective projects see fit and worthy of their praise.--<a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzordzm_8fa2.html" title="User:Dzordzm">Dzordzm</a> 00:31, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Valid and well-put? "The term is not in current usage anywhere" - except in Junge Welt, El Pais, Segodnya and various other media. "It emanated from Serbian propagandists" - says who? "Serbian poitical establishment's disregard for international law" - it actually has more regard than most establishments.

<li><b>Delete</b> See Dado's comments. Also, so called Serbophobia is created by same minds in Serbia who planned <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbia</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_Genocide_8469.html" title="Bosnian Genocide">genocide in Bosnia</a>, <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Massacre_eb1f.html" title="Srebrenica Massacre">Srebrenica Massacre</a>, just to mention some of the many attrocities done or planned by Serbia in the 1990's. Some groups in Serbia really cannot deal with the facts of the wars in the 90's, but sure they can make the victims out of themselves, arguing "everybody's against us!". No, nobody's against a common Serb, but the Serbian people must face their own history and recent "doings" of their state/government, just like the Germans did after the WWII. When they do that, they will throw the ugly nationalism away that poisons not only the society in Serbia, but the neighbouring countries, as well (this goes for these countries, too).</li>

<p>Anyway, the article should at least have these facts included. --(<a href="../../../../bs/n/i/d/User%7ENidurhaf_c78a.html" class="extiw" title="bs:User:Nidurhaf">Nidurhaf</a>) 10:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You have used triple negative. Could you clarify your comment. Also can someone answer me following questions as this is quickly becoming a sort of a current issue and this term (which is being disputed may I remind) is now being used on this page to attack users who are merely posting their comments. The same accusations are being used to gather defensive or "politically correct" support by others. Some perhaps think that if they apply this emotionally charged word in a real situation, such as in their minds is this situation, that it will justify the common use of the term and as a result the article on Wikipedia: Following questions should be the only guideline to settle this issue: 1.Who are people that hate Serbs 2.Why do they hate them 3.What specifically have they done that can be caratherised as phobic behaviour towards Serbs.4. If so how can such behaviour be caratherised as phobic. Thank You --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 04:08, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Here's that in Serbian: "ne mozes reci da nema ljudi koji ne vole Srbe" - hope it's clearer. As to your questions: 1. a lot of various people hate Serbs; 2. for various reasons; some, because some Serbs did something bad to them, some because some Serbs did something bad to someone else, most because of anti-Serbian propaganda they've been exposed to; 3. various things, for example, started the First World War, created concentration camps for Serbs, or bombed Serbia; 4. as is written in the article, <i>The term is used in a non-clinical sense, as a political accusation.</i> <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 05:51, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Now that is just not fear, I am referring to the comment laid out by the anonymous user above. I am accused by him/her of being serbophobic, which is absolutely not true. I do not in any way condone judgement of people based on their ethnicity, religion, color and so on. The way I see it the actual nationalpobic person here is the anonymous user himself, by judging my voting, based on my ethnic background, just shows how much croatophobic he is. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 15:24, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Missi Romero is frequently talked about in Manson's autobiography and formed a key part of the early years. He mentions her as the first person he ever loved Just because she was only Manson's girlfriend does not warrant deletion. If this rule applied to all articles then a number of people would be deleted. Having said that, the article indeed needs brushing up. LuciferMorgan</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - hardly a good reason to delete a page. Both JFK and his <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination.html" title="Kennedy assassination">assassination</a> are reasonably encyclopedic topics about one of the more prominent politicians in the last century and how he died. Stemming from that are the various theories about how it came about, and its not original research to point out what the various points of view are. Because the 'official version' does not have very broad support, NPOV requires that the various other theories be explained, albeit in a general and condensed way. Are these theories "conspiratorial" theories? Of course, and this should be explained, albeit in a way which does not rely on a pejorative interpretation of the term "conspiracy." I do agree however that 'vandals and kooks' would feel more at home on some Wikipedia fork.&#160;;) -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 22:47, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The Kennedy assassination has one of the largest set of "alternate theories" of any major case, and it's definitely encyclopedic to document them.

<li><b>Keep</b> But completely revamp the page. The Kennedy assassination has resulted in the "official" theory of who killed Kennedy and why. The problem is that very few people believe the "official" theory.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But, this should be a factor for keeping the coverage expansive--not limiting it.The two alternative theories seem to be:</dd>
<dd>1) The "official" assassin, Oswald, was working with one or more other persons; or</dd>
<dd>2) The "official" assassin was framed by others who actually assassinated Kennedy.</dd>
<dd>One way of handling this is to merely document the fundamental flaws that plague the "official" theory, and the historical reasons those in control of the investigation claimed it was necessary that the public be convinced that Oswald committed the crime and did so alone.</dd>
<dd>Another way is to document the the most accepted alternative theories to the&#160;:official" theory.</dd>

<p>Significant readership has been established. I should ask that you google the magazine and see what turns up: It is linked to by leading print and internet magazines. It is reviewed and rated and appears in most major literary magazine listing sites. Do you still go so far to say that the magazine is not notable? By what standards? Indeed, would you argue that the contributors themselves, prominent and emerging artists in their fields, are non-notable. Please explain yourself, as opposed to casting a throw-away vote.--68.161.99.74 23:53, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - they have had 4 issues so far, which is not a lot of issues. Whilst I don't know the rules for number of subscribers, I imagine it is probably similar to the magical 5,000 number for forum members - hence 300 is somewhat too few. With only 4 issues so far, it is too new to have established significant notoriety.
