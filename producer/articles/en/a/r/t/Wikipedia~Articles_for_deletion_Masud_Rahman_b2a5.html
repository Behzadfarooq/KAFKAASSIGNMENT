<dd>As the papers of Masud Rahman are linked to this page I suggest this rather unnecessary commotion will wither away. Furthermore, comments about 'drinking' and 'sex' are highly offensive and completely unsupported by the content of the article. 163.1.227.76 23:26, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's a clear autobiography. Most of the article is about his friends. If he really deserves an article then the article will talk about his notable work in physics. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 23:30, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The biography does indeed have a surprising focus on his private life, but, as I just suggested, links to Mr. Rahman's papers are currently be prepared for the page. Furthermore, an anaylsis of the psychology behind his esoteric and meritous work at such a young age is highly valid. 163.1.227.76 23:39, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I object! I am trying to compile a study of a young, eminent scientist. Surely, Wikepedia is designed to promote the spread of knowledge about eminent people, in any field. Thus, I urge you all to stop hounding my page on Mr. Rahman; Wikepedia is no place to criticise the development of science, or the merit psychological profiles. Please take the time to look both at the content of the page, and this discussion before promoting the deletion of this page. 163.1.227.76 01:07, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am an avid inclusionist, but this makes no attempt to be an encyclopaedia article. It is a personal web page. As far as Wikipedians being anti-Islamic, please reveiew the above comments. <b>NOT ONE COMMENT</b> has made any reference, allusion or innuendo to him being Muslim. Being Muslim or Christian or atheist does not give anyone a bye past normal Wikipedia standards. You could just as easily argue that people are being anti-British or anti-scientist. I think we're just being anti-git, and there's no law against that. Shame on you for playing the prejudice card. There is real racism and real Islamophobia out there that hurts people in real ways everday.

<li>I find it not only sad but also infuriating that people create crappy vanity articles and then, when the inevitable VfD comes up, spin the whole thing into some kind of a sob story about how they're being oppressed for their religion. There are plenty of people out there who're hurting for real because of bigotry; whenever someone comes up with bullshit like this when faced with the consequences of their own vanity, it's a fucking insult to those who really <i>are</i> suffering from anti-Islamic sentiment, people who don't have the luxury of giggling over the big stink they're making on Wikipedia over a badly-written personal article about someone's infatuations and pretending that it's vital to the plight of Muslims everywhere.

<li>Do you not realize that the word "Ground Zero" refers not only to the WTC event? How are you even getting Anti-Islamist statements out of that anyways? It could be Pro-Terrorist for all you know.

<li>Vote struck (forgot about that). Horizontal line also removed, although I think it is important people realise there has been a change to the article. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 14:41, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It still reads as vanity. A child prodigy? Those glowing remarks about his family? I'm afraid I can't change my delete vote.<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 03:42, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Likewise. The article <i>still does not establish notability</i>. That's a key thing. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 07:07, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Article link does not work, and even if it did, it doesn't seem to have been published by any major journal. And even if it was, I have papers in journals and chapters in books, and still no article about myself.--<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPoli_5b72.html" title="User:Poli">Poli</a> 18:40, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)
