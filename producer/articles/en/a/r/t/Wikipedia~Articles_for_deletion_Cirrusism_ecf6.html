<li><b>Another comment</b> This entire VfD shows some of the worse rudeness I have seen on Wikipedia. The editor that had put this article on VfD did so two minutes after a <i>new user</i> created this article. I see no reason why this cannot expand, and I still believe that it is plausible that Wikipedia have some articles that may not show on Yahoo! or Google. If deleting an article by a user that had been on this site for no more than five minutes, and not even giving it a chance to expand is a <i>warm welcome</i> to you all, I do not see how anyone stays on this site (including myself). This entire vote is biased, because I most point out that so many Wikipedian are adverse to religion, they pretty much don't want to see more religion articles here. One major problem with Wikipedia is that too many editors are caught up in their self righteous "intellect" that they don't see the most intelligent thing to do: let other's expand their mind as well. Ergo, how about welcoming a new idea, and allowing potential editors (i.e. the one who made this article) feel welcome and obliged to edit on this encyclopedia, rather than bashing his first article, and scaring him away. I didn't even see <i>one</i> of you all welcome him into this dispute. But that is too late now, because he left the encyclopedia. Gee, I wonder why?<a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbraceyrules_85a6.html" title="User:Dbraceyrules">D. J.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is this "religion" notable? No. Is there any verifiable information about it? No. So we delete it. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a> 17:01, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Wow</b> I really am not trying to argue. You didn't give it much time to be notable, did you? So, you delete it after giving it three minutes to expand. The whole arguement that this is not notable is an <i>opinion</i> in itself. Why is it not notable? It 1)presents fact about the subject at hand, and 2) adds new information to this site. Ben-w has accused me of "ad hominem attacks" when I have only stated that the notion of giving an entirely new editor three minutes to create and improve an article was somewhat rude. I just have a feeling that it is. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbraceyrules_85a6.html" title="User:Dbraceyrules">D. J.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> All the time in the world will not make this article notable because <b>the subject is not notable</b>. Is there a way I can get this piece of information to enter your head? It is not relevant how long the article has been there or how mean you think I am or what you think Wikipedia should be. A two-person "religion" which consists entirely of a freeweb-hosted site is <b>not notable</b>. The group has at best a handful of adherents, there are no public documents or records or articles about it; it has no buildings dedicated to it, it has been involved in no newsworthy or historical events. It is <b>not notable</b>. <b>NOT NOTABLE</b>. If you want to make a case for keeping this article, you need to do so based on the <b>notability</b> of Cirrusism. Try to find an article about it in a newspaper. There isn't one. Find a reference to it in any published media. There isn't any. Find an external webpage that discusses it. There isn't one. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a> 19:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, there is an external link, as posted by the new user. How is it that your opinion: that it is not notable, any greater than it is notable? The article 1) DOES PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES EXIST. YOU GAVE THE ARTICLE THREE MINUTES TO EXPAND AND YET BLINDLY BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE "NOTABLE" Maybe the article would be more to your whims if you had the dececency to have a modicum of patience. The whole argument that the notability should be basd on the side of an article is very scewed. One editor posted that "Wikipedia is not actually here to spread new ideas" And yet this supposed to be an encyclopedia of unbiased content, used to benefit others? This article has <b>not been given time to expand, as Ben-w has impulsively bought this up for VfD, without consideration that the article had been three minutes old, and thus, has not time to expand.</b><a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbraceyrules_85a6.html" title="User:Dbraceyrules">D.
