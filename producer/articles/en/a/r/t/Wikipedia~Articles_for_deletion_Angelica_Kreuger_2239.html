And of course, Romania is a republic, so being in line for the throne isn't notable as it is unlikely to be inherited by anyone. And being 88th in line to the UK throne is highly non-notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> - well, this is a pretty good point. But I did find there's still a "monarchy in exile" for Romania, so we ought to afford some standard of notability to the position. Still, if the succession is not for ladies, then there's not much here. As far as I can tell, 88th is too far down the British line to get auto-notability - which cuts off at 39th. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The sources I'm looking at say that only Romanian males are entitled to the throne. Of course, I'm not looking at any Romanian-language sites (I can't speak a word of it and don't trust online translating services, i.e. babelfish), and some of these are off webservers like geocities... <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 14:52, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - okay, so if we can find a more authoritative source that women can inherit the throne, I'm pretty sure she's a keep - if not, I'm pretty sure she's a delete (or merge somewhere?). Since all our (not that reliable) sources say she's not in line for the Romanian throne, I guess it's a provisional delete, unless we find a more authoritative source on the Romanian Monarchy that says she can get the crown. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - although the Romanian throne was, <i>per</i> the Romanian monarchical constitution, only open to males, and thus King Michael's heir under the official law would be the Prince of Hohenzollern or some close relative of the Prince of Hohenzollern, King Michael has declared his eldest daughter Margarita (the subject of this article's aunt) to be his heir. I'm not sure if he's officially altered the order of succession further than this, and of course it's dubious whether he has the right to declare his daughter to be the heir. It seems likely, though, that at least some (if not most) Romanian monarchists will recognize Margarita as head of house when the King dies. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 15:24, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks - I was mistakenly reading your 100 as as a lower bound rather than an approximate limit and was trying to find some upper bound to at least give a range for discussion. Probably most editors then would agree with a range of [10, 100] for discussion purposes (where no other notability is claimed for the person). <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 23:05, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm inclined to agree here. Her position may make her notable (Either in the British Succession or the Romanian one), but her parentage does not.

<li><b>Comment</b>
<ol>
<li>The British Constitution does not distinguish between persons who are the first or 900th in the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_British_Throne_8a29.html" title="Line of succession to the British Throne">Line of succession to the British Throne</a>: if called to the throne, whether by the death of one or 899 persons, whether titled or not, rich or poor, the heir automatically and inescapably becomes Monarch. That is one of several laws that apply to and render notable those in the British succession: one may not unilaterally decline the honor without passage of a specific Parliamentary law excusing one from the duty of reigning. Other laws applicable to some in the line of succession restrict who, how old, and where these persons are allowed to marry (and ignoring the law doesn't just void one's place in line -- rather, it voids the marriage!) When <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline%2C_Princess_of_Hanover_5bc5.html" title="Caroline, Princess of Hanover">Princess Caroline of Monaco</a> married <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_August_V%2C_Prince_of_Hanover_9069.html" title="Ernst August V, Prince of Hanover">Prince Ernst August of Hanover</a> in 1999, both of them required the permission of two of the modern world's historical "Great Powers": France had to signal its official acquiescence to her marriage, and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a> had to issue an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order-in-Council_6258.html" title="Order-in-Council">Order-in-Council</a> authorizing him to marry her. She was second in the line of succession to Monaco's throne, and he was about 360th in line to the UK's. Yet the moment they were married the groom permanently dropped out of the UK's succession order because his bride is a Roman Catholic. But their six year-old daughter is in line to succeed to the crowns of both Monaco and the UK, and is subject to both realms' laws governing royalty -- would that make <i>her</i> notable? Only those of the blood royal are subject to these kinds of obscure but fascinating and very real restrictions -- and how near or distant they are to the throne is immaterial.</li>
<li>No, Angelica isn't anywhere in the line of succession to the defunct Romanian crown, but is that the criterion? Suppose Prince William of Wales marries a Roman Catholic this year and has a daughter by this time next year: she will not be in the UK's line of succession. But will she be notable? Absolutely. Not because of her succession rights, but because of her kinship to the British royal family.</li>
<li>Notability is not the same as distinction: One distinguishes oneself, but notability is something that is attributed to one <i>by others</i>. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie of York get somewhat more media coverage than Peter and Zara Phillips, but the difference is not huge: Coverage of their lives does not derive from royal titles or succession rights, but from the fact that all four are grandchildren of Queen Elizabeth II -- two in the male, and two in the female line. Ergo, virtually any relative of a reigning monarch is inherently notable, because many people are curious about the lives and lifestyles of that rare and endangered species: royalty.</li>
<li>How notable deposed monarchs' families are will depend greatly on the time elapsed since deposition. King Michael of Romania's grandchildren draw little media coverage because he lost his throne half a century ago. Much more interest is shown in the grandchildren of King Constantine II of the Hellenes because he only lost his throne in the 1970s. More interest is also shown in the grandchildren of ex-King Simeon of Bulgaria because, although he lost his throne before King Michael, he returned to Bulgaria in the 21st century as President. That brings up another relevant criterion: historically, exiled monarchs or their issue often return to national sovereignty or influence and, history noting that pattern, an encyclopedia should not be as short-memoried as a newspaper. I'd suggest that all children, all dynastic descendants and/or the heir of living ex-monarchs be deemed notable. Angelica Kreuger, as it happens, doesn't qualify because she is not a <i>dynastic</i> grand-daughter of a living ex-king -- daughters of daughters did not belong to Romania's royal family when enthroned, so they need not be considered royal on WP. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 04:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I agree with the position that <i>merely being related to someone famous confers no status</i>, but disagree with the position <i>merely being in line for a crown confers no status</i>. Being in line for a crown is a position, but some disingenious person will ask "Well, I'm like 33 millionth in the line of ascention, why don't I get an article?

<li>She is most certainly <i>not</i> fifth in line to the Romanian throne under the old monarchical constitution. She is not in line for the throne at all. Her grandfather may have "amended" the laws of succession to declare her in line for the pretendership, but I'm not sure - somebody would have to look this up. Of course the old king has no authority to do under the old monarchical constitution, but the old monarchical constitution is a dead letter anyway - and if, by some fluke, the Romanian monarchy got restored (it is actually quite possible it might have been restored shortly after the fall of communism, if things had gone differently), it is unlikely that the old constitution would be restored, so I'm not sure how to consider this. Her mother is, however, a princess. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 20:05, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> verifiable grandchildren of monarchs (this seems reasonable, right?).

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm pretty sure most of us would vote keep if she was fifth in line to the Romanian throne, but merely "child of famous person X" isn't enough, she needs some criterion of her own (like holding a position in line to the throne), since she doesn't, she doesn't make the cut.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ardric47- I don't think being the verifiable grandchild of a deposed king is enough to confer notability. In fact, I would only regard the child of a deposed monarch as notable if they were a prince/princess at the time of their parents' deposition/abdication. I would change my vote only if it was shown there was a realistic chance of this royal house regaining the throne. <i>Then</i> someone in succession would be notable, as someone with a real chance of becoming a future monarch <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 13:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - unless she is actually a royal herself (i.e. a princess), I don't think she should have a page. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:58, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>If we adopt the exceedingly narrow proposals for notability, Lindley would qualify at birth by being 5th in line - can people genuinely become "unencyclopaedic" - this seems like a fairly strange claim, if we're trying to being an encyclopaedia for the ages, rather than just a news source. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Linley is frequently discussed in the British press, as far as I can gather. A google news search turns up <a href="http://property.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14052-2287285,00.html" class="external text" title="http://property.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14052-2287285,00.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> from <i>The Times</i>, from a couple of weeks ago. One would imagine that a Lexis-Nexis search would probably turn up considerable press coverage of Linley. I think if you look into it you'll discover that even more distant people get a fair amount of coverage in the British press - there was press coverage when <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Helen_Taylor_2662.html" title="Lady Helen Taylor">Lady Helen Taylor</a>, the Duke of Kent's daughter, had her children, for instance, and coverage (and criticism, of course) of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marina_Ogilvy_0e03.html" title="Marina Ogilvy">Marina Ogilvy</a>, Princess Alexandra's daughter, when she was on public assistance. Even people only distantly connected to the royal family get fairly significant coverage in the British press. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 01:19, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Her trifle info will find its home at her mother's article, if worth preserving here. As individual, Angelica is not notable enough. <a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESuedois_b9b2.html" title="User:Suedois">Suedois</a> 02:51, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The article itself virtually proves her non-notability (i.e. nothing more than the barest genealogical information). I'm about as "pro-royal" as you can get, but that doesn't mean I think there should be an article on every relative of a royal. <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcferran_2c68.html" title="User:Mcferran">Noel S McFerran</a> 21:41, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
