<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:07, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Deletion? Well, I think <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gothard_56b6.html" title="Bill Gothard">Bill Gothard</a> is more the "founder" of IBLP than anything, though you're right about it being his foremost, um, "item of achievement," so to speak. But while the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_in_Basic_Life_Principles_1370.html" title="Institute in Basic Life Principles">Institute in Basic Life Principles</a> is unofficially aka the "Bill Gothard thing," it's something that has reached millions of people (over 2.5 million have attended IBLP's various <a href="http://iblp.org/iblp/about/whatwedo/" class="external text" title="http://iblp.org/iblp/about/whatwedo/" rel="nofollow">Seminars</a> alone) and is still an important thing to many on a daily basis. The Institute is relatively huge, all things considered. But even if the main thing about Gothard is IBLP and vice versa, does that by itself warrant deletion (yea, newbie here)? True that both articles do overlap significantly though, particularly in the many areas that stress the "highly controversial" aspects of Bill Gothard and IBLP.</p>
<p>On another topic, maybe both articles should just be left alive solely because of how much work various Wikipedians have put into them already? Or is there another reason for deletion that I'm missing? Thanks for any clarification-- <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeien_ea45.html" title="User:Weien">Weien</a> 04:00, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have no problem with that. I can see that I have got this the wrong way round, it is indeed the organisation which is the sideline.

<li><b>Strong Keep, anti-Merge</b>, Since Gothard has caroused with Boris Yeltsin (wouldn't include this in the article as it is original research, but I saw him shake hands with Yeltsin on stage at the '92 ATIA conference in Knoxville when ATIA assumed responsibility for some public schools in Moscow), has personally led numerous seminars with &gt;15k attendees, and has been instrumental in the publishing of numerous books, periodicals, and homeschool curricula. As someone who considers himself a "victim" of Gothard's legalism, I do have a POV on this (which I would be remiss in omitting). Nonetheless, I think Gothard's notability is virtually unquestionable. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 15:34, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would also add that the IBLP largely emerged to take advantage of the popularity generated by Gothard's "chalk talks" (where he speaks as he is drawing a landscape of some sort, and then, as a visual reinforcement of his conclusion to the talk, changes the lighting to reveal some sort of Christian imagery). IBLP's "Basic" seminars in later years usually featured a video of Gothard speaking if he was unavailable (which was more frequently the case as the Basic seminars in became more popular)<a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 19:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep, anti-Merge</b>. Gothard is a very recognizable figure within Christian fundamentalist circles, and his influence is quite broad and controversial. (I would predict that a random poll would find more people recognize Bill Gothard by name than any of his related organizations.) You would not merge <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Robertson_25ef.html" title="Pat Robertson">Pat Robertson</a> with the <a href="../../../7/0/0/700_Club_8d0a.html" title="700 Club">700 Club</a>, since the person is as newsworthy as the organization, sometimes more so.

<li>Why would a fan of John Piper support Bill Gothard? I don't understand. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 00:42, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The guy is sure controversial, also among Christians, but that's doesn't make him not noteworthy, on the contrary. There has even a 380 page book been written about him: Veinot, A Matter of Basic Principles: Bill Gothard and the Christian Life which has 70 customer reviews at amazon.com and was worth an article for ChristianityToday. apologeticsindex.org gives him and his institute a whole page, rickross.com has an articles collection on him, So an article in Wikipedia is deserved but needs to be watched closely for NPOV. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 00:15, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
