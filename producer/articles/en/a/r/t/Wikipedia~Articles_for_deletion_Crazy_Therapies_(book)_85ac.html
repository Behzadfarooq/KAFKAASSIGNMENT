<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, the book gets plenty of search engine hits. The book has not one, but two separate authors. According to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28books%29_a736.html#Note_on_notability_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (books)">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(books)#Note_on_notability_criteria</a>&#160;:

<p>"Ask yourself if several libraries or bookshops, or a no-subscription website have a copy of the book, so that other wikipedians can easily consult the book, or at least have access to on-line or press-published reviews of the book."</p>
</blockquote>
The book most certainly fits all of these listed criteria. It is readily available in libraries and bookshops, and has dozens of on-line and press-published reviews from notable sources. The book itself is used as a scholarly source in journal articles. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a> 03:31, 19 October 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Merging this article the author's article would be a step backwards--useful information that currently exists in this article (e.g. the table of contents) would have to be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> Allow time to improve. I don't know the book, it would be more interesting to me if the article was wikified to link it to a discussion of Recovered Memory Therapy, Multiple Personality Disorder, Satanic Ritual Abuse and other such issues of controversial therapeutic practice that were quite crucial at the time, (1996) and are still important now. Then the article would be a good read, if the books'perspective on these issues was discussed. As it stands its a bit like something straight off 'amazon' or another book site, but linked to these issues it would make a good article for me. I supect this is what the books' about, those contemporary issues, discussing the authors views on these issues more to put the book in context would stop it being purely a rave about the book. I was referred here by user smeelgova as we had agreed on a previous article. But I like to think I've been reasonably impartial. I am passing my suggestions on to the article's talk page and smeelgova himself so if there is any value in them hopefully they will be used and the article will improve- for my tastes at least<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkinsmum_5c9a.html" title="User:Merkinsmum">Merkinsmum</a> 00:38, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The criteria clearly states that if <b>one</b> of the criteria is met, the book is "generally notable." One of these criteria is, <i>"The book's author meets Wikipedia's notability criteria for people, based on his/her work as a writer."</i>, which <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Singer_e382.html" title="Margaret Singer">Margaret Singer</a> most certainly does. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a> 05:21, 22 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. An extension to information relating to a notable author. The "Table of Contents" section provides a useful summary pending expansion of the article. Thanks to <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">User:Smeelgova</a> (as a fellow-editor with an interest in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Singer_e382.html" title="Margaret Singer">Margaret Singer</a>) for bringing this proposed deletion to my attention in a non-partisan note. -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 12:20, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> but get rid of the cheesy blurb at top of article--looks like an advertisement.<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlendoremus_892f.html" title="User:Glendoremus">Glendoremus</a> 05:54, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, don't merge</b>. She's a recognized author, and if the book has even a paragraph it should have its own article, however stubby. <a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegship_9306.html" title="User:Pegship">Pegship</a> 03:27, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. It's obviously a book so should have its own article, but the article needs cleaning up - you can see the problems as soon as you arrive at the page. Also, I was only alerted to this Wikipedia Article Deletion debate when <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a> posted a message on my user talk page. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthuxtable_ab42.html" title="User:Matthuxtable">Matthuxtable</a> 21:24, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: For note, Smeelgova's talk page says that the user is no longer editing Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthuxtable_ab42.html" title="User:Matthuxtable">Matthuxtable</a> 21:25, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we close this AfD debate yet? Smeelgova may have gone but that's irrelevant really, I still want this article to live!:)<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkinsmum_5c9a.html" title="User:Merkinsmum">Merkinsmum</a> 17:09, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
