<li>Except it's not just a poll; it's the name of the documentary. Besides, <i>Channel 4</i> is too regional – around here, that's the CBS affiliate.

<li>A list of names of cartoons is not a copyright violation. You have to be joking. If a book published a newly-compiled list of names of victims from a disaster, you'd actually claim that the list of peoples' names is copyrighted??? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 03:37, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>A list of <i><b>anything</b></i> which has been voted on as "the best" or "the greatest" or "the whatever" by the readers or watchers or editors or whatever of <i><b>a particular entity</b></i> is their intellectual property and is therefore copyrighted.

<li>Let's say a telephone company compiles a list of its subscribers, and provides the subscribers with a phone book with all their names listed in it. Would you consider that list copyrighted? The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/499_US_340.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/499_US_340.htm" rel="nofollow">U.S. Supreme Court doesn't</a>. Facts can't be copyrighted. It is a fact that The Simpsons came in at #1 on their list, and that Aladdin came in at #17, just as it is a fact that Joe Schmoe was a subscriber to Rural Phone Company and that his phone number was X. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 00:59, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because it's coverage of a documentary. Whether the list itself is a copyvio, I don't know. In the U.S., bodies of facts when compiled a certain way are in fact defensible (for example, CDDB). In any case, the article should stay, with or without the list. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 03:46, 2005 Apr 12 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>NO VOTE</b> because I'm undecided, no wait, that's not it, because this is obviously a highly watched television special about a popular subject matter which offers a trove of interesting and informative information about the history and popularity of cartoons. Perhaps 'No vote' because this is, without a doubt, the most inane example of an attempt to trim any wikipedia content that wouldn't make it into a print version. GIVE UP ALREADY. Read my post on the village pump for a less ranting and more academic look at the problem.

<dd>I looked at Demi's comment, and perhaps I was a little hasty in declaring that a list cannot be copyrighted, it will need to be investigated. But still keep. 07:38, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Take a look at point 2 on C4's "Terms and Conditions" page. <a href="http://www.channel4.com/terms_and_conditions.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.channel4.com/terms_and_conditions.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. What do you read into it? Can a ranking be coyrighted, or are the presence of all those wikilinks on our list enough to avoid running afoul of copyrights? <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:45, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think it a list like this could be copyrighted as an "original selection and arrangement" of facts, especially if there were a lot of them, like weekly Billboard charts. But in this case, I think it's fair use, as the list is a small part of the program, and anyone seeing this list is going to be more likely to want to watch it. Channel 4 puts the results on their website <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/cartoons/results.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/cartoons/results.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, so internet surfers aren't going to be watching the program just to find out the results. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
