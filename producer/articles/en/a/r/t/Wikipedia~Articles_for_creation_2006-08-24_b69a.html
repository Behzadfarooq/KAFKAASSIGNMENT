<p>Arthur Edward Stilwell (October 21, 1859 - September 26, 1928), railroad entrepreneur and founder of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Arthur%2C_Texas_a374.html" title="Port Arthur, Texas">Port Arthur, Texas</a>, was born in <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochester%2C_New_York_4bd8.html" title="Rochester, New York">Rochester, New York</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a>.</p>
<p>While working as a traveling salesman he courted and married Jennie A. Wood, and the couple moved to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a> and then <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, where Arthur sold insurance for the Travelers Insurance Company, inventing a coupon annuity <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life-insurance.html" title="Life-insurance">life-insurance</a> policy which paid the policy holder an income after a certain age. With the money made selling these policies, the Stilwells returned to Kansas City where Arthur sold real estate and began building the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railway. In his quest to connect Kansas City to the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Mexico_73a1.html" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> by rail, be began building and acquiring rail lines for the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad Company (later to become the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Southern_df94.html" title="Kansas City Southern">Kansas City Southern</a> Railroad, plotting townsites along the way which included <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mena%2C_Arkansas_15b4.html" title="Mena, Arkansas">Mena, Arkansas</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stilwell%2C_Kansas_7108.html" title="Stilwell, Kansas">Stilwell, Kansas</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Arthur%2C_Texas_a374.html" title="Port Arthur, Texas">Port Arthur, Texas</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>Setbacks including lawsuits, a hurricane, and yellow fever caused financial problems for the otherwise successful venture, and on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a> the KCPG was thrown into <a href="../../../r/e/c/Receivership.html" title="Receivership">receivership</a> by one of its financiers, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Warne_Gates_8df8.html" title="John Warne Gates">John Warne Gates</a>, over an unpaid printing bill. Stilwell was out, but the discovery of giant oil-field in Texas in 1901 ensured the railroad's future success.</p>
<p>Unfazed by losing control of the KCPG, Stilwell announced plans to build a railroad connecting Kansas City with the Pacific Ocean and organized the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Mexico_and_Orient_Railway_e9a2.html" title="Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway">Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway</a>. Although progress was made, financial problems and the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_Revolution_7e35.html" title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> caused this company to be forced into receivership, also, in <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>.</p>
<p>After this the Stilwells moved to New York, where Arthur spent his time writing books, plays, poems and hymns. He would claim that all of his ideas were given to him while he slept by elfin-like "Brownies" from the spirit world.</p>
<p>Arthur Stilwell died of apoplexy on September 26, 1928 in New York. His distraught wife, Jennie, committed <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> by jumping out the window of their New York apartment thirteen days later. The Stilwells were said to have left an estate of only $1,000. The cremated remains of the Stilwells have never been located.</p>
<p>In all, Arthur Stilwell organized 41 companies of various kinds during his career and is credited with building more than 2,300 miles of railroad in his lifetime and founding more than 40 cities.</p>

<p><b>Jerry Williams</b> was lead singer/songwriter of the group <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvest.html" title="Harvest">Harvest</a> and founder and former president of Harvest Ministries (established in 1977). A forerunner in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_Christian_Music_8d53.html" title="Contemporary Christian Music">Contemporary Christian Music</a>, Harvest had a large following from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s and made 14 albums and 2 music videos.</p>
<p>Under Williams, Harvest established a discipleship program that ministered to many artists who went on to further ministries. These include former original Harvest members CCM artist Ed Kerr (Integrity Music) and well known Messianic Music artist Paul Wilber. He was also a member of the group <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesa.html" title="Mesa">Mesa</a> along with his two friends <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dana_Key_dfbf.html" title="Dana Key">Dana Key</a> of <a href="../../../d/e/g/DeGarmo_%26_Key_9fab.html" title="DeGarmo &amp; Key">DeGarmo &amp; Key</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Holm_7c43.html" title="Dallas Holm">Dallas Holm</a>, both CCM artists. Mesa released one album in 1993 entitled <i>Mesa</i>.</p>

<p>Williams and his wife Donna are currently the founders of <b>EPIC (Exiles Pardoned In Christ) Ministries Inc.</b>, a non-denominational ministry based in Houston, Texas.

io-homecontrol¬Æ is a wireless technology based on radio frequency (868 MHz) and also the name for the association driving io-homecontrol to be the preferred standard for home automation within building components.</p>
<p>io-homecontrol revolutionizes the total comfort and control of one‚Äôs household. Thanks to this new radio technology the components communicate with each other, to bring at home new solutions for improved comfort, well-being, energy savings, security and indoor climate control in total simplicity. In practice, io-homecontrol¬Æ doesn‚Äôt require any infrastructure and therefore no installation costs as this new radio technology is already part of the products and a simple command automatically detects them as soon as they are installed.</p>
<p>io-homecontrol¬Æ is also an association which have been launched in June 2005 by some of the world‚Äôs leading firms in home comfort technology including HONEYWELL, the global leader for solutions of residential and commercial building controls&#160;; SOMFY, the international specialist in automatic control of openings and closures in homes and buildings and VELUX, the world leader in roof windows. io-homecontrol members today include the three founding partners as well as the H√ñRMANN Group, European leading supplier for residential and industrial doors and operators.</p>

<p>Liam Johnston , about the best thing thats ever happened to Rainham Eagles, since he's been there they've esteablished themselves as title and cup contenders.</p>
<p>Since being put in Defence by Manager Leigh Govey, teams have found it very difficult to score, his strength and all round good attributes makes him a great asset to the club.</p>
<p><br />
Due to him playing in Division 2 with Rainham Eagles many top flight teams have showed there interest in him and have tried to persuade him to move at the end of the season.</p>
<p><br />
He has been seen training with Horsted United who look like a strong candidate to ply his signature.</p>
<p><br />
Liam Johnston has stated that a move away from the Eagles is not definate but he will only consider a stay if they get promoted or if he is made Captain.</p>

Quad Riot are an up and coming band from Medway, Kent sounding not unlike Bloc Party duelling with the Killers in Robert Smith's art rock-shaped blender.</p>
<p>Think: Bloc Party, The Killers, Gang Of Four, The Cure, The Strokes, The Kaiser Chiefs</p>
<p>Quad Riot are:</p>

<p>Crazy George - drums, general craziness</p>
<p>People first stumbled across Quad Riot when they played under the name "10 Side Zero" at Chathams Infamous venue the Tap'n'Tin (Where Pete Doherty &amp; the Libertines re-joined). After successful gigs as a three piece they felt they needed another guitarist to free them up to play the frantic guitar based music that drives them. So enter Justin (Jut man) Easton, long-time friend to the band and Bassist from popular local band "Orphan". They then renamed themselves "Quad Riot" because they had all been to the same school and had been punished as students with the dreaded Quadrangle.</p>
<p>Quad Riot recently got 'unsigned band of the week' on XFM and got into the final of the Diesel-U-Music competition for best unsigned UK rock act.</p>

Neil Landstrumm's extensive discography spans from 1994-1999 recording for some of the most influential labels in Techno including Tresor, Peacefrog, Scandinavia, Mosquito and Sonic Groove. His own Techno and design imprint, Scandinavia, enjoys worldwide recognition for being one of the few labels still innovating in the field. During 1994 in Edinburgh, Scotland both friendships and working relationships were formed between a group of artists provided the infrastructure of what was to unfold. The up-front and heavy Sativa club provided the focus of creative attention between Landstrumm, Tobias Schmidt, Shandy and Dave Tarrida, providing them the opportunity to develop unique live performance and DJ skills. During this formative period, the distinctive Landstrumm Peacefrog sound evolved and debuted on four EPs and the crowning Brown By August LP of 1995. Strong connections and EP releases were also made on Cristian Vogel's Mosquito label in Brighton and Adam-X's Sonic Grooove label in NYC.</p>
<p>In 1996 the Scandinavia and Tresor assocation began with the first LP release marking a strict departure from the more Chicago-based Peacefrog style. Understanding Disinformation tested the new Bass Techno sound citing both influences from classic Detroit Techno and the more abstract Sheffield Bleep Techno. Metallic soundscapes, sub-bass and stark beats set the bleep-tone of the three LP's to follow.</p>
<p>Bedrooms &amp; Cities, a narrative of Landstrumm's worldwide DJ excursions, displayed a more atonal while song-structured style, again building on the UK bleep movement from the early 1990's. Low and pounding basslines combined with swinging raw DMX rhythms, researched sounds, electro thips and zaps gave Landstrumm his best selling work to date pushing the distinctive Scandinavia logo into new domains.</p>
<p>After being granted a USO1 Artist Visa, Landstrumm relocated the label and studio to Brooklyn, NY in August 1997 to experience inner city urban culture in the raw. Months later in 1998, the third release of his Tresor album series, Pro Audio, was completed entirely in Brooklyn with heavily designed and manipulated sounds created using an Apple Macintosh Powerbook 1400 and BIAS Peak 1.64 providing him with fresh raw media for sonic experiments. Landstrumm used Bit-rate decimation and SFX Machine techniques to provide grainy and subsonic grooves within a constantly moving structure. Pro Audio illustrates the shift from swinging Jack-Trax to Sound design for the Digital Territory. Razor sharp scissor hats, sub-funk bass and rolling Hip Hop structures display the influence of NYC's culture into his musical output. Pro-Audio contained pieces recorded over the whole of 1998, re-edited, processed and released that September.</p>
<p>The artists horizons have hacked themselves a clever niche in the multimedia mainframe, oft revered and imitated. In progress and upcoming Landstrumm chapters include Scandinavia Animation, Sugar Experiment Station (with Tobias Schmidt), Scan 2 Game Architects, MTV shorts and a fourth album with Tresor.</p>

<p><b>PALWO .LUO MUBIITO/ Chope''''</b><i>PEOPLE WHO SPEAK PALWO VERSION OF LUO LANGUAGE'</i> The palwo version of the luo language is spoken by the luo Babiito(chope) who still live in Bunyoro uptodate. These people evolved after the inter- marriages between the original luo who cross the nile into Bunyoro,Current Districts of Masindi,Hoima and Buliisa. They were led by their king Isingoma Mpuga Rukiidi, who later formed Babiito dynasty and later Bunyoro kingdom, aline or family where the ruler Omukama of Bunyoro emerged from. The word "Chope" means men are not there because the Banyoro men would invade the camp of the luo Babiito when their men had gone for Cattle keeping ,enjoy their women in their absence.</p>
<p>These people still occupy many areas in the Districts of Bunyoro, Masind- in places like Karumba, Mutunda,Alero,Katulikire, Gang dyang, Bweyele, Karungu, Kiryandongo, Kigumba, Pakanyi, Kisorosoro, Masindi town, Hoima town.etc.</p>
<p>As said early these people easily mixed up and their originallanguage change drastically with of current some words being used belong to the Bunyoro tones.</p>
<p>Further more they have aweakness of refusing their language and culture, that makes them lost within the Banyoro. Sources The History of the Luo ,OKOT'P BITEK</p>

<p>Tom Merry was a character created by Charles Hamilton under the pseudonym of Martin Clifford (more commonly known as Frank Richards the creator of Billy Bunter) and he wrote stories for over thirty years about Tom Merry of St. Jim's in the boy‚Äôs weekly paper called the Gem which was launched in 1907.</p>
<p>There was 1705 Issues of the Gem published, 404 were reprints of previous stories, thus a total of 1301 stories in all. The Genuine Martin Clifford stories amounted to approximately 830 Later when the Gem had long since gone, due to paper shortages bought on by the Second World War, and falling sales, he continued writing books about Tom Merry these were published by Spring Books from about 1949 and also Mandeville from the 1950s. There were 13 books in all and the books re-introduce characters that appeared in the Gem in pre-war days ‚Äì Tom Merry, Manners, Lowther of the Shell and Jack Blake, Herries and Dig and not forgetting the immortal Arthur Augustus D‚ÄôArcy of Study No.6.</p>
<p>St. Jim‚Äôs stories were published in six Tom Merry Annuals published by Mandeville from 1949 to 1954.</p>
<p>Eleven Tom Merry stories were published in the 1950's by Gold Hawk in paperback form and these are much sought after by collectors today.</p>
<p>In the 1970s Howard Baker published 20 Gem Volumes most in facsimile form apart from volume 4; Tom Merry and the Night Raiders and volume 5; The Boy‚Äôs of St. Jim‚Äôs, which were reproduced in a "conventional book style" Howard Baker also published some Gem Facsimiles in the Greyfriars Book Club these were intended for collectors and were nicely bound in green with gilt edges and supplied in a slip case and limited in the number published to 400 copies.</p>

<p>The Merchant Guildry of Stirling cannot trace its exact origins. The Guilds of Europe stem from the establishment of city life after the end of the Roman Empire. Although Scotland had a small population, its burghs were well established by the 11th century. The famous Laws of the Four Burghs (of which Stirling was one along with Edinburgh, Roxburgh and Berwick) became the municipal laws for all the Scottish Burghs.</p>
<p>From the beginnings of the Guildry no-one could engage in commerce unless he was a burgess of the town. It was formed to protect trading rights. Guildry members were not manual workers and were forbidden by the Laws of the Four Burghs to be so.</p>
<p>The Burgh Reform Act of 1833 provided for the election of Town Councils, and the Burgh Trading Act of 1846 abolished the privileges of Merchant Guilds. The Guildry then assumed its present form as an interesting survival, with the Society maintaining the ancient traditions of the Town.</p>

<p>Linda Roberts is the current selectwoman of the growing suburban community of East Windsor in northern Connecticut. She has been selectwoman of East Windsor for over ten years and oversaw the development of the town as it attracted local businesses like Big Y and the Multiplex Cinemas. She is Governor Jodi Rell's endorsed underticket candidate for state treasurer. Her opponent is the incumbent Denise Nappier of Hartford. Nappier is rumored to have ambitions to run for Mayor in Hartford next year. Nappier has failed to post information on 13 million dollars in unclaimed property. Linda Roberts on the other hand, thinks that she can do better (and she probably can).</p>

Igbide clan is located in Isoko south Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. The predominant occupation is fishing. This is done mainly in the Urie lake (also the scene of a popular annual fishing festival) located at Owodokpokpo. There is also some farming concentrated mainly on cassava and groundnuts. The Igbides claim to have originated from Mgbidi in the Eastern (Ibo) part of Nigeria. This marks them distinctively from most other Isoko clans who mainly originated from Benin. This affiliation to the Igbos can be observed in the dress/costume codes of the Igbides in major festivals like ABAME, the salutation sequence and chants as well as the mercantile nature of a typical Igbide man. The Igbide people took early to christianity. Infact, Owodokpokpo-Igbide is regarded as one of the main entry points of christianity into Isoko Land. Igbide is also an oil producing community and is host to Shell's Oroni OIL Field.</p>

<p>A book by authors Philip J. Corso and William J. Birnes, which claims that an unidentified flying object of extraterrestrial origin crashed in the New Mexico desert in July 1947.

<p>Philip Atkinson was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, on the 7th June 1947, the result of a wartime marriage between a state registered nurse and a Captain in the Royal Army Ordinance Corp. His father had been educated at Cambridge University before working for some years for the foreign office in Africa, but was an ardent supporter of George Orwell and a socialist. So after being demobbed and winning the position as lecturer in History at Kings college, Newcastle, he decided to plant his family among the proletariat, the heroes of Nineteen Eighty-Four. This meant his middle-class wife and three children lived for the next fourteen years on a new council estate in the company of resettled slum dwellers. And this action, inspired by inverted snobbery, had a lasting impact upon his spouse and offspring, especially his middle-child.</p>
<p>Like all children I wanted to be accepted by my peers and be part of the gang of small boys who lived in the street. They were my heroes, I hung on every word they said, and I did everything I could to win their approval. Their contemptuous treatment of me I accepted as only natural because I was the youngest and weakest. They were tough and clever while I was puny and inexperienced. But one day this all changed. To my delight, a boy who was smaller and younger than me, moved into the street, and I knew that it would only be a matter of time before I could demonstrate my superiority to the newcomer. And when the gang resolved to have a boxing competition, I felt that this was my chance. Previously I would have been omitted from such a competition as being too weak to match in a fight, but now there was a possible partner, and as the gang split up into matched pairs I was pitted against the new boy. And when it was our turn to box, I gently, but firmly, displayed my clear superiority. Alas, when the judges, the oldest boys, declared the result, it was not me, but the new boy, who was deemed the winner. I was stunned.</p>
<p>For some time afterwards I struggled to understand this decision. I knew that I had won the fight, but this was not enough; it was not my stature nor strength but some innate personal quality that condemned me. It was clear that regardless of what I did, I would never win the respect of my peers, so I stopped trying. But I also knew the judges had lied, so to understand their motive I started to look closely at my erstwhile heroes and began to see their undeniable flaws. They were not rational; they had rejected me out of prejudice. While they were all larger than me, I found they only presented a threat as a group. Alone, they not only left me in peace, but seemed a little nervous at my presence. And in games that required strategy, I found it was easy to best them. My esteem for my peers became replaced by contempt, and planted the seed of suspicion in my mind that my whole community was of the same calibre ‚Äîfoolish cowards. A notion that experience rarely confounded but often confirmed, so insensibly I became a social exile.</p>
<p>This was just as well, for in a declining community any citizen who retains respect for the truth must become alienated from the majority of his fellow citizens because they hate the truth. Inevitably I could only ever be a social outcast, but being freed from the need to win social approval also meant being freed from social prejudices, and being able to see my community more clearly; a detachment that is essential for any student of society.</p>
<p>As an adult it is easy to understand why the other boys in the street hated me, I was from a different class. My father was an honest, educated man, who didn't smoke or drink, and would never dream of striking his wife, but he was surrounded by drunks, thieves and wife-beaters. Our family enjoyed money, comfort and stability, unlike many of those around us. Not only were we the only family in the street to have a car, but also we were the only family in the whole suburb to have tea on the lawn. Everything about us was different, and we were naturally resented. While the neighbouring adults never confronted my father, their children were delighted to bully his children. My siblings and myself became social half-castes, accepted by no class and despised by all. The result in my case was an initial bitter resentment of my community, along with the traditional notions that I should pursue university and a career; so I dropped out of school to take a job as a bus conductor. And to escape this dead-end job, I emigrated, arriving in Australia in 1969, aged 22, with a pregnant wife, two small children, 30 pounds sterling, no job and no qualifications other than an incomplete public school education.</p>
<p>With determination, skill and a little luck I forged a career in computers before being forced into retirement in 1991; a fate that brought as much relief as anxiety. No more salary, little chance of ever getting a job, but no longer having to pretend that the community and its administration was sane. And I was fortunate that my second wife, an Australian by birth, was happy to work so her husband did not, and for the first time in my life I was blessed with leisure. Not only did I not have to toil, but also I did not have to worry about paying the bills, which is another essential qualification for any student of the community.</p>
<p>Of course I could have restarted the education that I abandoned in my teens, but by then the true nature of universities had become obvious; they were no longer centres of learning pursuing truth but centres of profit pursuing customers. Inevitably striving for popularity with youth has made universities bastions of Political Correctness, and full of the kind of people who wanted to burn Galileo for daring to question that the sun circled the earth. So I spent my enforced idleness applying the skills acquired as a system's analyst, to discover why my society is disintegrating into delusion and impotence. An effort resulting in a simple theory which outlines the process of communal rise and decline, an explanation that seems to have eluded mankind despite the regular and inevitable cycle that has always been present.</p>
<p>In January 2000 I became an Internet publisher, placing a variety of books 'online' at my own expense, in an attempt to preserve some of the vanishing wisdom of humanity.</p>
<p>Early in 2004 I realized that not only did my theory clarify the subject of civilization, but it also clarified that of Philosophy, so ever since then I have considered myself a philosopher.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-24_b69a.html" title="Edit section: Saga Records">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Saga Records</span></h2>
<p><b>Saga Records Limited</b> was renamed from a company called Saga Films Limited. Saga Films was setup by a musician called Leonard Cassini. He had the idea of creating short films about lives of composers and illustrated by still images but with music performed by prize winning musicians and orchestras specialising in that composers work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he had financial troubles and via contacts approached Major Wilfred A Banks for help. Major Banks took over the Company and tried to get cinema chains and television interested in showing the films. This was unsuccessful because of limited appeal.</p>
<p>Major Banks then considered what assets the Company had and realised that the music was of top quality and perhaps the major record companies would be interested in releasing the music on LP records. He was given short shrift, being told that classical music did not have a large market and that the record companies had enough musicians and orchestras for their own needs.</p>
<p>Undetered by the rebuffs the Major approached a mail order company who he already supplied. He was told that they wanted to include records in their catalogues but all the manufacturers refused to supply them because of the fear that it would effect prices and the retail distribution outlets.</p>
<p>As the recordings had already been made it was only a question of pressing the LP's and getting the sleeves and packaging right. The major record companies refused to press the LP's although Garrod and Lofthouse were happy to design and make the sleeves.</p>
<p>Major Banks was by this time aware that he stood no chance with the UK record industry so he contacted Pathe Vox in France. To cut a long story short, they were happy to press the LP's and armed with costings Major Banks concluded a deal with Kays mail order which allowed the to sell the records at ¬£1.25 (in new money) whereas the market price of LP's in the shops at that time was ¬£3.15. Sales were satisfactory and lead to PYE launching the Golden Guinea range in response.</p>
<p>Some time later Major Banks was contacted by Sir Joseph Lockwood (the Chairman of EMI) who asked Major Banks to attend his offices. Major Banks was quite concerned at this turn of events and wondered what action EMI might take.</p>
<p>At the meeting Sir Joseph said that he was conducting a review of EMI's group business and had occasion to visit his French subsidiary Pathe Vox. On seeing the Saga records ready for shipment to the UK he was delighted to discover, at last, who was pressing the LP's. Sir Joseph then enquired about the volume being shipped and he was given the figures. He was amazed and shocked that the quantity meant that nearly every one of Saga's Records sold enough to make them number one on the Classical Hit Parade.</p>
<p>He then asked Major Banks if EMI could press the records in the UK. Major Banks was delighted as the UK pressings were on higher quality material.</p>
<p>The record venture lead to pop music with Triumph records, RGM Sound with Joe Meek and Telstar as it's biggest hit. Saga was eventually sold to Allied Records.</p>
<p>There were many well known classical artists and orchestras recorded by Saga Light music and musicals also appeared on its label and electronic equipment.</p>

<p>Major Banks, Triumph records and Joe Meek feature in John Repsch's Book 'The Legendary Joe Meek' and the Stage show 'Telstar'. The are many articles in the New Musical Express and the Record Mirror in the late 1950's and early 60's. Illustrations of some of the record sleeves are on Sergio Fiorentino's website. There are also Photos in John Repsch's book notably one taken at the Radio Show in Olympia. Major Banks is also mentioned in Wikipedia86.29.206.201 16:31, 23 August 2006 (UTC) <a href="http://www.geocities.com/elumpe1/SFDiscography.html#pseudonymous" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/elumpe1/SFDiscography.html#pseudonymous" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/elumpe1/SFDiscography.html#pseudonymous</a></p>
<p>A search for 'SAGA XID' or SAGA FID' will reveal some of the discography.</p>

<p>DAAMIT is a fictitious acronym for the company formed by AMD's acquisition of ATI, Inc. Originally posted in a fake news article by BBspot.com's Brian Briggs on July 27, 2006, this humorous acronym has been growing in popularity, due primarily to it's adoption by editors at the technology news website, <a href="http://www.theInquirer.net" class="external text" title="http://www.theInquirer.net" rel="nofollow">the Inquirer</a>.</p>
<p><br />
In this article, Briggs cites AMD's CEO Hector Ruiz as saying, "We wanted to keep the letters from each company, but didn't like the looks of AMDATI. It lacks imagination. Our marketing team found DAAMIT appealed most to our focus groups."</p>

<p>Average Frustrated Chump. A "nice guy". A guy who has no pick up skills and rarely manages to close a target pick up. Also a guy who tends to supplicate in his behavior to HBs. Meaning, buying flowers for a chick when going out for coffee, putting her on a pedestal, and generally letting women walk all over him in the vein hope of somehow being seen as attractive in their eyes. A common term used for AFCs that have seen the error of their ways but not yet gained PUA skills is RACF (Recovering AFC).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-24_b69a.html" title="Edit section: Terry Sylvester">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Terry Sylvester</span></h2>
<p>Terry Sylvester was born on the 8th January 1947 in Liverpool, England. His father James, a jazz trombone player, introduced him to music at an early age. He was brought up in the Allerton area of Liverpool, and lived in the next road to Paul &amp; Mike McCartney. He left school just before his 15th birthday and worked for one year as an apprentice panel beater for Peter Harrison, (George Harrison's brother). At 16 he was sharing the stage with the Beatles regularly in and around Liverpool and at the world famous Cavern Club, fronting his own group the Escorts. When the Beatles appeared at the Cavern for the last time on the 3rd August 1963, Terry &amp; the Escorts were invited by Brian Epstein &amp; the Beatles to be on the same bill.</p>
<p>In August 1965 the Escorts were appearing with the Hollies at the "Hit House Club" in Munich Germany. When some members of the Escorts were taken ill before the show, Graham Nash, Allan Clarke, and Bobby Elliott from the Hollies graciously filled in for them, and performed with Terry for the first time. In January 1966 when guitarist Ralph Ellis decided to leave the Swinging Blue Jeans, the then 18 year old Terry was asked to join the group.</p>
<p>The Swinging Blue Jeans had a number of hit records including "Hippy Hippy Shake", "Good Golly Miss Molly" &amp; "You're No Good". From 1966 to 1969 Terry toured the UK and Europe continuously, and appeared on numerous TV and radio shows. In 1968 when they were touring Czechoslovakia, a lucky tip from a high ranking fan enabled them to leave the country the day before Russia invaded.</p>
<p>In December 1968, Graham Nash left the Hollies to form Crosby, Stills, &amp; Nash. The remaining members of the group remembered Terry from Munich, contact was made &amp; the rest as they say, is history. Terry's first single with the Hollies "Sorry Suzanne" reached Number 3 in the UK charts and established the group once again as a top ten hit making act. Terry's first album "Hollies Sing Dylan" went even further, all the way to number 1. Soon after they recorded "He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother", with the then unknown session player Elton John playing piano. The song became a world wide hit, and remains to this day an anthem for those who choose to help people less fortunate than themselves. More hits followed including the follow up single "I Can't Tell The Bottom From The Top", U.S. Number 1 "Long Cool Woman In A Black Dress", "Gasoline Ally Bred" and the 1974 universal classic love song, "The Air That I Breathe".</p>
<p>During the 1970's the Hollies toured extensively, performing in North &amp; South America, Australia the Far East, &amp; Europe. Also, during this period the trio of Sylvester-Clarke-Hicks wrote a good number of the Hollies songs. In 1975 they recorded what many people regard as their finest album, "Another Night". Christchurch, New Zealand in 1976 was the location &amp; year for the "Hollies Live" album that still sounds fresh today. Sony re-released it in 1998 on CD titled, "Live Hits The Hollies".</p>
<p>Terry also wrote songs for himself and released a solo album. The album "I Believe", recorded at Abbey Road Studios and produced by Alan Parsons and the Hollies long time producer Ron Richards, was re-released in 1997 on CD. The cover photograph of the US release was taken by famous UK photographer, David Bailey. In 1975 he was asked by Alan Parsons to sing the critically acclaimed final song "To One In Paradise" on "The Alan Parsons Project" debut album, "Tales of Mystery And Imagination".</p>
<p>In 1981 Terry recorded and produced an album with Oscar winning songwriter and Bread member James Griffin. The album "Griffin &amp; Sylvester" was recorded in Memphis Tennessee, and has recently been released in CD format with added bonus tracks. Terry and James appear in concert with American singer / songwriter John Ford Coley. The trio (Griffin, Sylvester, &amp; Coley) are planning to release a new CD in 2005.</p>
<p>Unlike many of his contemporaries, Terry owns the rights to all of his recordings &amp; songs. His music publishing company Charlotte Music, has over 200 songs in it's catalogue. Apart from Terry, artists that have recorded his material include Percy Sledge, Denny Doherty, Dean Ford, Lynn Paul, Wicked Lester, High Button, Joan Turner, Liverpool Football Club, and of course the Escorts, the Swinging Blue Jeans, the Hollies, and Griffin &amp; Sylvester. Terry has been awarded 5 Platinum, 9 Gold, and 6 Silver Discs so far in his career.</p>
<p>Since 1997 he's called Toronto home, where he lives with the love of his life, Diane. In his spare time he enjoys reading books on the history of the Native American Indian, playing golf, collecting Georgian silver, watching baseball, holidaying in Central America &amp; the Caribbean, and of course keeping in touch with his beloved Liverpool Football Club. He keeps fit by taking long walks, swimming, &amp; playing tennis.</p>
<p>As well as performing with his band, Terry also likes to appear with his solo "Live &amp; Acoustic" stage act. Both feature the Hollies &amp; Swinging Blue Jeans hits, plus songs &amp; stories from his early days at the Cavern Club, where he appeared with the Beatles &amp; the rest of the great groups from that wonderful era.</p>

The duo met at FVL High School in <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appleton.html" title="Appleton">Appleton</a> <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> and began writing original tunes and rehearsing. The actual songs were recorded between 1992 and 1997 during the start of the Screamo/Emo genre.

The original projects were called "Raucous" (1992), "Invasion of Sanity" (1993), "Flagrant Violations Of Reality" (1995), and "Psychiatria" (1997). Other members included Paul Jaeger, Joe Cea, Missy Franko, Greg DuCharme and Brett Furuta.</p>

<p>Bridle Information and Technology Solutions Pvt. Ltd (<a href="http://www.bridleit.com" class="external text" title="http://www.bridleit.com" rel="nofollow">Bridle</a>) is a young company, focused on creating innovative services for Indian consumers. Fueled by a bunch of <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in" class="external text" title="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in" rel="nofollow">Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences, Pilani</a> (<a href="../../../b/i/t/BITS_Pilani_c305.html" title="BITS Pilani">BITS Pilani</a>) graduates, including <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Rama+Krishna+Gaddipati" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Rama+Krishna+Gaddipati" rel="nofollow">Rama Krishna Gaddipati</a>, Bridle is a company who believes that Mobile to India is what Internet to the West was. With a vision to touch every mobile subscriber in India at least once a day, through its services, Bridle is an army ever ready for the conquest.</p>
<p>Bridle has launched SchoolMATE<a href="http://www.schoolmate.in" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.schoolmate.in" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, a service which empowers parents to know about their children at school. You may learn more about SchoolMATE here (<a href="http://www.schoolmate.in" class="external text" title="http://www.schoolmate.in" rel="nofollow">SchoolMATE official Website</a>). Within a year of launch, in May 2005, they have 70,000 paid parent subscriptions for SchoolMATE service in just two cities <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyderabad.html" title="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a> and Vishakapatnam of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andhra_Pradesh_0379.html" title="Andhra Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. Bridle is now working on extending SchoolMATE service to other states in India and is building new services as well.</p>
<p>From three employees to thirty three, from 1000 to 70,000 paid subscribers and about a hundred thousand subscriptions overall, from an idea to product and to creation of a new market, from nobody to somebody, last one year was a remarkable journey for Bridle. It is remarkable as it not only gave Bridle a sign of success but also asserted their understanding of the Indian consumer. It is remarkable because, it gave them an occasion to celebrate not just the spirit of young entrepreneurship but also the satisfaction of creating a new market!</p>
<p>For a young team with an average age of 22 years and has no prior business experience, Bridle is a learning experience. It epitomizes that real good businesses can be created by innovation in approaching and addressing consumer needs and that perseverance and passion are keys to entrepreneurial success.</p>

<p>MUD shell (mudsh) is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_shell.html" title="Unix shell">Unix_shell</a> that behaves like a <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUD</a> environment. It is not a full-featured shell but rather a programmers' joke.</p>
<p>mudsh was written in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl.html" title="Perl">Perl</a> by Dean "Gandalf" Swift and Xirium in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. Today mudsh is not being actively developed nor supported any more. However it is still possible to find its <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_code.html" title="Source code">source code</a> online.</p>
<p>A typical mudsh session looks like this:</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-24_b69a.html" title="Edit section: Office of the Vice President">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Office of the Vice President</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the Vice President's Office in the West Wing, the Vice President and his staff maintain a set of offices in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), which is located next to the West Wing on the White House premises. The Vice President's Office in the EEOB is called the Vice President's Ceremonial Office. This restored, historical office served as the Navy Secretary's Office when the EEOB housed the State, Navy and War Departments. Today, the Vice President uses the office for meetings and press interviews.</p>
<p>Sixteen secretaries of the Navy occupied the office from 1879 until 1921. From 1921 until 1947, General John Pershing occupied the room as Army Chief of Staff and as Chairman of the Battle Monuments Commission. Pershing's occupancy of the office was interrupted only once during these 26 years, when President Hoover was forced to relocate his offices following a Christmas Eve fire in the West Wing of the White House in 1929. Since 1960 it has been occupied by every Vice President from Lyndon B. Johnson to Richard B. Cheney. (with the exception of Hubert Humphrey, who used a room on the floor below). Since its restoration in the 1980s, it has been considered a "ceremonial" office.</p>
<p>The room was designed by William McPherson, a well-known Boston painter and decorator. The walls and ceiling were decorated with ornamental stencilling and allegorical symbols of the Navy Department, hand painted in typical Victorian colors. These designs have been restored on part of one wall (two places between the hall way entrance doors) and replicated on canvas throughout the rest of the room. The reason for replication on canvas is two-fold: first, large areas of the original designs were damaged and a large amount of in-painting would have been necessary; second, the replicated designs on canvas preserve the original design underneath. The floor is very delicate, being of mahogany, white maple and cherry. The two fireplaces are original Belgian black marble; the overmantles regilded during the restoration. The original Minton tile hearths were removed and replaced with green marble.</p>
<p>The chandeliers are replicas of the circa 1900 gasoliers, which had been removed and could not be located. The historic fixtures, as viewed in photographs, were equipped for both gas and electric power, the gas globes being on top, the electric lights below.</p>
<p>There are several items of note in the room, but the most interesting may be the Vice-President's Desk. This desk is part of the White House collection and was first used by Theodore Roosevelt in 1902. Several important figures have chosen to use this desk - including Presidents Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover and Eisenhower. It was placed in storage from December of 1929 until 1945, when it was then used by President Truman. Vice President Johnson and all subsequent Vice Presidents have used the desk. The inside of the top drawer has been signed by the various users since the 1940s.</p>

<p>The magocrats is a term used to refer to an elite few of mages in the fantastic warcraft universe who posses both magical and political power.Many times they were able to bend the will of the king himself.King Terenas last king of Lordaeron had tried to decrease their power but it was rather vain as many of his counsellors belonged to the order of Kirin Tor and could easily fuel a revolt against him.</p>
