<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as there is some sourced notability and this seems to be a relatively established artist. However this article needs a complete rewrite - as it stands it is advertising and highly <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. I'm adding some tags in case it passes AfD. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza">Gw<font color="green">e</font>rnol</a> 13:54, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Seems to fit the aspiring artist pattern, who has gotten the occasional article but not much acclaim yet. Not that many Google hits for the name, and most seem to be for other people of the same name (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Joseph+Pisani%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=200&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Joseph+Pisani%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=200&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:01, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> despite my comment above, and despite the article's author doing his case no favours. I think that <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> applies here: Vegalo has only been a user for a day or two, and the article falls a bit short of WP's quality standards, but I think that the artist is notable, and that the author needs assistance in bringing it up to standard. For example <a href="http://www.123soho.com/artgroup/jesus_2000/jesus26.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.123soho.com/artgroup/jesus_2000/jesus26.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.123soho.com/artgroup/jesus_2000/jesus26.htm</a> offers enough information to allow an easy and clear assertion of notability in the first para.<br />
Anyway, there are gazillions of <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a> articles here on minor characters from obscure video games, so surely we van find room for a prolific artist and businessman who may not be the next Picasso, but appears to have had a very successful career? --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 14:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Now that the article has been rewritten, and specifically now that the text copied-and-pasted from the artist's homepage has been replaced by what I assume is original writing, I see no reason to delete it; three press articles are three press articles, regardless of their language. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:21, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> without meaning to bite. Reads like a short glossy mag article, verging on an advert, and not an encyclopedia entry.

<li><b>Comment</b> The article doesn't mention significant exhibitions where the Pisani is the focus or a notable contributor; there are no press reviews or critical appraisals of Pisani's work quoted in order to guage his notability amongst his peers or in his tradition of artistic expression. <b>cleanup</b> the purple prose and add some of the above content to make this article useful for a researcher. <span style="border: 1px solid #800080;"><a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a><a href="../../../%28/a/e/User_talk%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User talk:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background:#FFFFFF" face="Ariel" color="#800080"><b>&#160;(talk)&#160;</b></font></a></span> 15:33, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(According to <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" class="external text" title="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" rel="nofollow">babelfish</a>:)If the sun becomes the carpet if concerning a layman modern art momentarily by the window of the gallery Steinegger in Ruedlingen looks, it becomes perhaps in the pictures issued there first only circles, lines, strips or squares in strong colors to recognize. In it hidden are however everyday impressions and memories of journeys. The pictures, which from New Yorker artist comes the Joseph Pisani, are issued under the title "The Trials and Misdemeanors OF Life on the Road". The Vernissage took place on Friday. Pisani was born in New York and took after some travel in Switzerland domicile. Its work - abstract expressionistische painting - is to energize the viewer for thinking and to the closer Hinsehen. A picture, in which among other things a broad red strip and a teppichfoermiges object are to be seen, is called "The View from My Bungalow". "I lived a time long in Egypt. The red strip stands for the Red Sea, and the sun has here the form of an eastern carpet ", explains Pisani. Everyone sees something else as proceeds it when painting - does it have a conception of its next work already before painting? "if I to paint begin, mix I first colors, like it me straight please - to know without, what from it" Pisani becomes, says. "short before the picture is finished, comes the brainstorm: Well clearly, those are the colored seas of the Indonesian island Flores!" How can the untrained viewer open the meaning of the forms and colors? "the titles are to help thereby", mean Pisani, "and the longer one a picture regarded, the more recognize one - however everyone sees something else in the pictures."
