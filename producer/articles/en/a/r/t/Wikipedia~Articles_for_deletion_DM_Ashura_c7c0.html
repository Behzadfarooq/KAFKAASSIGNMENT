<p>There were two issues in this debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the issue of notability, a majority of users were of the opinion that the subject was sufficiently notable to warrant keeping the article. Several users were satisfied the subject met the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guideline. Debate on this point was, on the whole, in favour of <b>keeping</b> the article.</li>
<li>On the issue of verifiability, several users raised concerns that the article was not based on truly independent, non-trivial sources. These concerns were not addressed by those in favour of keeping the article. Debate on this point was in favour of <b>deleting</b> the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. Further, since the arguments about sources were not addressed, the article will be tagged with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreliable_2bcc.html" title="Template:Unreliable">unreliable</a>}}.

<p>DM Ashura is a <a href="../../../b/e/m/Bemani.html" title="Bemani">Bemani</a> fan known for making remixes of songs. A few of his songs are now in DDR, but I don't think that makes him "notable". In any case, unless Konami included a short bio in the Ultramix 4 booklet, I don't think anything but the fact that he made these songs is verifiable. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">T</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SPUI_0b50.html" title="Special:Contributions/SPUI">C</a>) 02:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>'Fraid not, Bill, because it doesn't represent an independent (i.e. unconnected to the subject of the article) source. For more info on what would work, see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The problem is, the only place your music is really mentioned in significant sources of any kind is just mentions that it's appeared in these two music games, which is not really enough for an article. (And to User:MarsPhoenix, the line in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> about appearing in multiple non-trivial published works is referring to being mentioned in something like a newspaper article, not having their own work released in a game or on an album). Unfortunately, I'm not sure if even the BroadJam piece qualifies, because as it stands I can't actually find much evidence for notability of BroadJam itself (it doesn't even have its own article yet, but I'm not dismissing the possibility that the notability is there but no-one's written the article yet). <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 03:46, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My argument as for the "major"ness of the music contest is that the winners were featured in what is possibly the most well-known and best-selling music game franchise in the world.

<li><b>comment</b> Third party sources indicating notability, in this case, need to be something other than your own creation (a personal website), a DDR official, or Konami feature. If you had a Third Party, by that criteria, review, award, or mention of another reputable or notable source then that would satisfy the requirements. -- <a href="../../../w/t/f/User%7EWtfunkymonkey_476f.html" title="User:Wtfunkymonkey">wtfunkymonkey</a> 05:08, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Comparing this to other articles on Bemani artists, this one seems to have even more information than most, though more sources couldn't hurt. What keeps this from being a weak keep or neutral is the fact that this was put up on AfD very shortly after its creation leads me to question the faith of the nominator, who is a fairly well-known troll in the Bemani community, and has a very long history of bad faith actions here. As for the sources, the Broadjam page linked to on the article does refer to the song and the artist in question, and the artist is not a Konami employee, so the reference would be third-party. --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#6699FF">desat</font></a> 16:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> He's a liscensed artist, he can't be stuck into Ultramix 4 page.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the notability of this artist has been proven, what with his work being featured in 4 published games, and a CD due out next month. We may need some sources to satisfy the credibility of the article, but this isn't anything that won't be handled soon enough. DarkProdigy 02:12, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <s>I'm leaning towards keep. The fan-done-good angle is probably sufficient notability in itself.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Kind of a weak delete. Lots of other Bemani artists don't have dedicated articles, especially in the cases where a particular artist only has a couple of songs in a game. I'll concede that the "fan done good" angle is a potential reason to keep it around.

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, please bold your first word so everything is easier to read. Thanks.&#160;:) Now to answer your question: He's "notable" because, minus any Bemani connections, he is still a up and coming musician that is very well known (although mostly just throughout the Bemani community). His success <b>may</b> spread later so that he is well known thoughout any music community, but we can't tell the future, now can we? So are you saying let's not give him a page until he's "really really really" famous? And who decides when that is? <a href="../../../b/k/i/User%7EBkid_df17.html" title="User:Bkid">Bkid</a> 00:13, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This has nothing to do with talent. I don't think anyone would consider that a reason to keep an article around. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrano_713e.html" title="User:Drano">Drano</a> 09:13, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You just argued "His success may spread later so that he is well known throughout any music community.". As I say, this is not a valid argument.

<li><b>Comment</b> A redirect here doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense, as others have noted. One, there aren't any other artists mentioned on the pages suggested to redirect to, and two, such a redirect seems out of place—I know it has been suggested in past AfDs for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Levin_472a.html" title="Rob Levin">Rob Levin</a>, which was thought to be unreasonable by Jimbo and others. This isn't the same situation at all, but the point remains that a redirect doesn't seem to be a good solution. I think Coredesat and MarsPhoenix said everything else very well. In repsonse to SPUI, keeping in mind <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, creating another article "because <a href="../../../d/m/_/DM_Ashura_c994.html" title="DM Ashura">DM Ashura</a> exists" doesn't seem to be very sound reasoning.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Smells too much of OR to me, and when I try Google I get either (a) Wikipedia and clones, (b) chat from assorted fans on assorted NN boards, or (c) stuff from DM Ashura himself.

<li><b>comment</b> Original research with <s>six</s> seven references on a one-page article. What, precisely, qualifies as OR in your view? There is very little here that is not backed up by another source. There is very little new knowledge. The only thing that qualifies would be the album's listing.

<li><b>Comment</b> DMAshura recently contacted me to discuss his case. He's got some pertinent points to make, but felt uncomfortable adding them to the deletion debate on his own article, so I'll be summarising and presenting them on his behalf.<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 19:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1) This is a notability-based discussion. DMAshura asserts he has notability at least equal to Konami's in-house DDR composers, who have their own (significantly stubbier) biographies on the Wikipedia. Therefore, unless the AfD is expanded to encompass those articles, his own should not be deleted. As evidence: He is one of four artists to win a Konami-organised competition to have his work included in a DDR title.<a href="http://www.konami-digital-entertainment.com/production/ddr/contest.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.konami-digital-entertainment.com/production/ddr/contest.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.broadjam.com/submissions/details/contest/00_splash.asp?contest_id=73" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.broadjam.com/submissions/details/contest/00_splash.asp?contest_id=73" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.broadjam.com/mm/052506/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.broadjam.com/mm/052506/index.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. He is the only one of the four comissioned by Konami to provide additional material the game, beyond his competition entry. He is also the only one of the four to have his work included in Konami's "V-Rare" CDs, produced to promote upcoming DDR releases.<a href="http://www.orangeloungeradio.com/phpnuke/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=660" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.orangeloungeradio.com/phpnuke/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=660" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php?news_id=107" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php?news_id=107" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) DMAshura's case for notability is not limited to his work on DDR, specifically he has provided music for <a href="../../../o/2/j/O2Jam_b651.html" title="O2Jam">O2Jam</a>. <a href="http://o2jam.e-games.com.my/artiste_bio01.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://o2jam.e-games.com.my/artiste_bio01.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> The producers of O2Jam assert that he is notable in the "beat game" (music game) community. <a href="http://o2jam.e-games.com.my/announcement_content.asp?gsection=news&amp;id=1116" class="external autonumber" title="http://o2jam.e-games.com.my/announcement_content.asp?gsection=news&amp;id=1116" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) Argument against merging. Given the lengths of the discographies of the various artists, merging the biographies into a list article would be unwieldy.</dd>
