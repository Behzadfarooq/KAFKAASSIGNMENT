<li><b>KEEP</b> I just edited this List to make the introduction consistent with the new name. This article happens to be an index or list of other articles on alternative medicine. It happens to be part of a set of 5 Lists called the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject%7EAlternative_Medicine_ce35.html#Core_Project_Lists_and_Articles" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject:Alternative Medicine">Core Project Lists and Articles</a> of the Wikiproject on Alternative Medicine. Together these 5 Lists provide a master list of alternative medicine topics. What does this list do? Quoting <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>: <i>"Lists have a substantial advantage over categories and series boxes in that they can be annotated. A list can include items that do not yet have an article, and can also show series or groups where the items would be completely separate on the category page. A well-annotated list may duplicate a category, but not be redundant with it."</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes#Lists" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes#Lists" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. That is precisely what this List does for miscellaneous topics in alternative medicine. The key difference betweeny this list and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine.html" title="Index of topics in alternative medicine">Index of topics in alternative medicine</a> is that this list as the quote states above includes items that do not yet have an article. In other words, it is how the project on alternative medicine is suggesting what new articles can be written by any editor. <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine.html" title="Index of topics in alternative medicine">Index of topics in alternative medicine</a> lists only articles currently existing on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 13:48, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is not accidental that I did not list five CAM lists on VfD. List articles are fine. I love list articles. Miscellaneous topics, index of topics, and terms and concepts, however, do not have any clear difference among them, thus two of the three should go. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 14:02, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Each of the 5 lists covers a different topic. As the guideline you have been referring me to lately states, <b>lists can make suggestions for new articles that can be written.</b> That is what this List does. You could <i>merge</i> the red color open links into the <b>Index</b> as those are articles that have not been written yet. But, I see no reason to mess with it. It is fine just the way it is. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 14:26, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are misunderstanding the guideline. Perhaps this is because it is unclear. I am not sure. Regardles, yes. One of the advantages of lists is that they can show places where Wikipedia needs expansion. However, that is an advantage - not a primary purpose. If the major purpose of this article is a form of "pages needing creation/expansion," it should be moved to the Wikipedia namespace and filed under your Wikiproject. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:52, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was under the impression that making comments like yours in a VfD vote was not permitted. Am I wrong on this? And, why are you constantly talking about guidelines, as if you had the final authority on every guideline? You do not seem to be very knowledgeable about many things, such as to what you are trying to delete for who knows what reason. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 13:21, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

Even though <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">User:Snowspinner</a> has no interest in alternative medicine, Snowspinner decided to make it into a stub article.

<li>Oops! I wrote the wrong link the first time around. I aplogize for the confusion. It went from the <b>List of topics on the philosophy of alternative medicine</b> to the present name of <b>List of miscellaneous topics related to alternative medicine</b> because some editors felt that <b>philosophy of alternative medicine</b> was not quite descriptive of the contents of this List. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 13:14, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a> and redirect there.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Why do these few sentences need to be separate from <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a>? What was planned as the expansion of this article? <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a>, being only 27K bytes in length, still has room, and this is only one paragraph. By the time it is cleaned up and worked into <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">Alternative medicine</a>, it probably mostly evaporates since there isn't much here. I don't see how Philosophy of alternative medicine is at all a reasonable redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terms_and_concepts_used_in_alternative_medicine.html" title="List of terms and concepts used in alternative medicine">List of terms and concepts used in alternative medicine</a>. There isn't anything obvious on the list of terms and concepts that relates to "philosophy" of alternative medicine, although I must admit I don't have a clue what "philosophy" of alternative medicine might be. Neither does anyone else, apparently, since the article is still a stub. Right now, I am having a hard time seeing why this article should not just be deleted. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:39, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Chicago has an awful lot of aldermen, but I think we should say that members of aldermanic boards, city councils, etc, of any large city are inherently notable. Otherwise, we could have an awful lot of unnecessary VfD fights. It's hard to imagine a Chicago alderman (past or present) whom you <i>coudn't</i> write about encyclopedically.

Word is that he was a particularly notable alderman, and held some higher positions too. This article, however, says nothing, and while Chicago Aldermen are important to Chicago, they remain local politicians who do no thave the notability of mayor. Hansen, it seems, was an exception, and several people who voted to keep that article admitted they did so not because he was an alderman. <b>Delete</b> this one. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 09:58, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Jesus Christ! I just looked at the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_aldermen.html" title="Chicago aldermen">Chicago aldermen</a> page and we have a list of 50 people who are all on their way to having substubs reading "X is a Chicago alderman". I think turning them <i>all</i> into redirects is a no-brainer here, as they currently give no information that isn't included by having their names on the list. The problem with that is deciding what to do after they are no longer aldermen. Anyway, I'll probably go ahead and do that after this VfD is over, unless its decided that they should be deleted. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:07, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> is surely my view.

The Chinese modern higher education start by foreign church, e.g., The Peking University (åäº¬å½ææ¸é¢, not today's <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing_University_bd4f.html" title="Beijing University">Beijing University</a> (åäº¬å¤§å­¸) but the <a href="../../../y/e/n/Yenching_University_1eed.html" title="Yenching University">Yenching University</a> (çäº¬å¤§å­¸) and merged with BJU or PKU in 1952) and The Nanking University (åäº¬å½ææ¸é¢, not today's <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanjing_University_46c5.html" title="Nanjing University">Nanjing University</a> (åäº¬å¤§å­¸) but the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Nanking_70d2.html" title="University of Nanking">University of Nanking</a> (ééµå¤§å­¸) and merged with NJU in 1952) established by American Christian church in 1887 and 1888. But they were not actually universities as their core objective was for religion at the time. Later in 1897 there was the first Chinese school with the Chinese name <i>university(å¤§å­¸)</i> --Peiyang University(åæ´å¤§å­¸å , renamed <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tianjin_University_6562.html" title="Tianjin University">Tianjin University</a>(å¤©æ´¥å¤§å­¸) in 1951). Itâs generally accepted as the first Chinese semi-modern? University(ä¸­åç¬¬ä¸æè¿ä»£å¤§å­¸). It was actually an engineering/technology institute. The first comprehensive Chinese university was National <a href="../../../p/e/k/Peking_University_8391.html" title="Peking University">Peking University</a>(also known as Metropolitan University(äº¬å¸«å¤§å­¸å ) in its earlier days and renamed Peking University in 1912) and the second national comprehensive Chinese university was National Southeast University(åç«æ±åå¤§å­¸, renamed <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Central_University_d210.html" title="National Central University">National Central University</a> in 1928 and <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanjing_University_46c5.html" title="Nanjing University">Nanjing University</a> in 1949, also known as Nanjing Higher Normal Institute in its earlier days(åäº¬é«ç­å¸«ç¯å­¸æ ¡)). Given the name <i>university</i>(å¤§å­¸), such Chinese universities as Peiyang University, Peking University, Shanxi University were not real modern university in their earlier days.

<li>I'm inclined to keep this one. <i>"Hilary Hook" -wikipedia</i> yields 260 hits -- I believe <i>-dictionary -encyclopedia</i> reduces the number of hits because a lot of them are for websites selling books, which may include dictionaries and encyclopedias. Various web pages repeat the bit about the BBC documentary, which, I know, is less than rock-solid support.

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 5 delete votes and 4 keep votes (one unexplained). While two of them are relatively new users, their comments are cogent and fact-based. I interpret them as good-faith contributions. The premise of some of the "delete" votes was the copyvio allegation. In a comment below, a contributor to the article says that this is not a copyright violation but that comemnt is not definitively sourced on the article's page. In researching it, I note that the article says it was created in 2004 and that the official rules of the game are not yet finalized. That makes key elements of it <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">unverifiable</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion on this one and delete it. However, I am going to put a copy of the current version in <a href="../../../r/b/p/User%7ERbphd2009_c420.html" title="User:Rbphd2009">rbphd2009</a>'s userspace so that he/she can move it back into the main articlespace if/when it becomes a more stable sport. I am also unlinking it from other articles for now. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 08:37, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Viperball" is according to the article an offshoot of <a href="../../../t/o/c/Toccer.html" title="Toccer">Toccer</a> which is already somewhat obscure, from what I can tell. I searched on google and didn't come up with much about Viperball that was related to the sport except for a few pages by the creator. I don't think the sport quite exists yet; nobody would be likely to look it up on Wikipedia, but the page creator did place a link on Invented_sport, as well as <a href="../../../t/o/c/Toccer.html" title="Toccer">Toccer</a>. Could anyone confirm that <a href="../../../t/o/c/Toccer.html" title="Toccer">Toccer</a> is widely regarded as a sport either? I don't live in that area of the country. In any case, I don't think that <a href="../../../v/i/p/Viperball.html" title="Viperball">Viperball</a> is played widely enough(if it all) to need an article. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioYeti_9ed0.html" title="User:RadioYeti">RadioYeti</a> 01:27, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not a copyright violation. The Toccer Players Association authorized the posting of the rules of the sport, etc. as that group governs Viperball. That said, whether it's "notable" or "not notable" is debatable. Toccer is played here in Wyoming, as well as on the East Coast. So whether it's "notable or not," it's got more reach and notably than say duck-pin bowling in Maryland. Or I guess we could wait 10 years and post it here when the sport has the notoriety of <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netball.html" title="Netball">netball</a> in the US, though I would argue it already does in less time.| <a href="../../../r/b/p/User%7ERbphd2009_c420.html" title="User:Rbphd2009">rbphd2009</a> 19:20, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm going to have to read up on the deletion policy and corrective actions, but Eden is a place name in Atchison County.

<li>Megan1967 and Kappa, I believe that "fuck you", "fuck off", "fuck (someone) over", "fuck me sideways" (jocular), "fuck-up" (noun) and more are idiomatic. Would you suggest redirects from each to "fuck"? <s>I suggest not, and I further suggest that any person who's not extraordinarily dimwitted and doesn't find an article for one of them (or for "fuck you") can go to "fuck".</s> -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:35, 2005 Feb 15 (UTC).

Redirects for less likely expressions wouldn't be worth creating (or deleting, if created).

<dd>Hoary I suggested redirecting in order to prevent article recreation.

<ul>
<li>Kanji names in Japan are governed by the government's rules on kanji use. There are currently (Oct 2004) 2,232 "name kanji" (the <i>jinmeiyÅ kanji</i> äººåç¨æ¼¢å­) used in personal names, and the government plans to increase this list by 578 kanji in the near future. Only kanji which appear on the official list may be used in given names. This is to ensure that names can be written and read by those literate in Japanese.
<ul>
<li>All right. Mathematics time: Assume that names made from that set of characters may be up to two characters long. How many possible names is that for this page? How many possible names is it assuming that names may be up to three characters long? Assume that <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> can <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romaji.html" title="Romaji">romanize</a> one name in 20 seconds.

<li>Assuming that we do not count names written in hiragana and katakana (which could be a combination of at least 70 different characters, and various lengths), and we only count 2810 kanji letters for the personal names...</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous with 5 clear "delete" votes and 3 clear "keep" votes. While there is a clear majority to delete, there is not the overwhelming majority necessary to indicate concensus to delete. the decision defaults to "keep" for now.</p>
<p>I note however that the article is in very poor shape being unformated and unverified.

<li>Nominating articles on VFD that are obviously not nonsense, vanity or original research - and therefore not valid subjects for deletion in the first place - is a selfish and unneccesary imposition on editors who would rather not have to waste hours of their time ensuring that good content isn't summarily deleted from Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 13:15, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Marginal agreement with <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a>. While it's important that everyone feel welcome to nominate articles for VfD, it's also important that they consider the cost of doing so. 8 people each spent perhaps 5 minutes researching <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurij_I_of_Halicz_747b.html" title="Jurij I of Halicz">Jurij I of Halicz</a> to establish he was worthy of an article here - 40 minutes that may have been better spent.

<p>This was a recreation of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_Myths_c6ff.html" title="Mind Myths">Mind Myths</a> by User:144.214.54.82, which was nominated for deletion in January (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Mind_Myths_6140.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mind Myths">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mind Myths</a>) with the consensus to merge with <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">Brain</a>. Normally, this should have been speedied as a recreation of deleted material. Instead, it was cleaned up and expanded a bit. When I found it on Jan 18, I felt that it was unencyclopedic, but noticed that most of the information seemed to reference a single book (<i>Mind Myths</i> by Sergio Della Sala). Because of this, I changed the subject of the article from "mind myths" themselves, to this book. On January 27, User:144.214.54.82 changed the subject back. I reverted this on February 10, but <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">User:Paranoid</a> reverted me the next day. We began discussing this on the talk page, when <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">User:dbenbenn</a> pointed out that this article had already been deleted.</p>
<p>There are two version for this page. I feel that both should be deleted. If the article is about "mind myths" themselves, it is unencyclopedic and has already been deleted once.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The two main reasons to keep are (1) sousveillance already survived a vfd in the past. Since then, it has grown substantially in common usage, and in many of the newspapers and magazines it no longer appears in quotes, or with definition or explanation. For example, I got a call from the Life Magazine fact checker, who wanted to learn more about this, and she thought it was an old French word (i.e. didn't realize it was newly coined) since it has been in such widespread use. (2) A large number of publications, printed materials, articles, etc., make reference to <a href="http://wikipedia.org/Sousveillance" class="external free" title="http://wikipedia.org/Sousveillance" rel="nofollow">http://wikipedia.org/Sousveillance</a> and thus deletion of this entry would create a loss in faith of the permanence of Wikipedia entries, and the ability to make scientific or scholarly references into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlogger_c41d.html" title="User:Glogger">Glogger</a> 17:34, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I don't think the re-naming was a good thing because (1) sousveillance is a broader concept than inverse surveillance (sousveillance is a proper superset of inverse surveillance); (2) sousveillance is in far wider usage than inverse surveillance e.g. 27,000 Google hits as compared with approx. 800, and an even higher ratio in the published literature. Disclaimer: I also coined the term "inverse surveillance" so I'm equally partial/non-impartial to both of these terms. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlogger_c41d.html" title="User:Glogger">Glogger</a> 13:56, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm gonna have to go with <b>merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverse_surveillance.html" title="Inverse surveillance">Inverse surveillance</a>, which is a better article but still rather messy, and in need of some NPOVing. <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverse_surveillance.html" title="Inverse surveillance">Inverse surveillance</a> implies there's a difference between that and "sousveillance", but it isn't clear to me what the difference is. The <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sousveillance.html" title="Sousveillance">sousveillance</a> article is just a mess; when I read it I didn't have the remotest idea what it was talking about. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 23:30, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I propose the following: (1) get rid of or the poorly written sousveillance article; (2) rename the "inverse surveillance" article to sousveillance; (3) make a re-direct from "inverse surveillance" that points to the sousveillance article. That way the article will be titled by sousveillance (the more widely used term than inverse surveillance) but will contain the better written of the two, and eliminate the redundancy of having two articles in which one describes a topic that is a subset of the other. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlogger_c41d.html" title="User:Glogger">Glogger</a> 04:25, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If it is decided to go with my suggestion of getting rid of Sousveillance and then renaming Inverse_surveillance to Sousveillance, perhaps we could pull in some parts of the deleted article to merge. Also, Inverse_surveillance, once renamed to Sousveillance, would hopefully then also retain the edit history and the original VfD result of "keep". Some minor edits would be required because I (perhaps in bad judgement) edited the article once it was changed to "Inverse surveillance" in the past, in order to match that changed title, but on second thought, it seems like it had been a mistake to rename it to Inverse surveillance and it probably should have been left as Sousveillance, so as not to produce this fork between what is now two articles in which one is a proper superset of the other (making the other redundant to some degree). <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlogger_c41d.html" title="User:Glogger">Glogger</a> 04:20, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Dr. Pantagis appears to have written a good article, and also equiveillance is growing in usage. For example, we have an upcoming conference on this topic, and I believe that equiveillance (the equilibrium/balance between sur- and sous-veillance) is of growing interest to many researchers who are building upon this concept. A number of printed publications, proceedings, and the like, make reference to equiveillance, so I hope that we can keep this article, as distinct from either surveillance or sousveillance. Also, it is preferable to have one word, rather than a two-word solution like inverse surveillance that is harder to search on, and not used as much in the published literature (and means something quite different than equiveillance). <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlogger_c41d.html" title="User:Glogger">Glogger</a> 17:42, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>let me finish my edits, but due to patient load, it is difficult to get to all the corrections by the five day deadline: i strongly believe there are many concepts that define our modern world that can be represented in an image, or a word, or a cluster of words called a poem. My attempt here is not self promotional; it touches upon the worry of a concerned citizen as I watch many persons slowly become compassionateless to the elderly. Equiveillance is an important concept to many persons, and perhaps to those voting for delete. I hope to express this notion with the rewrites I have begun, opening my series of thoughts phenomenologically as a wikified glog. A detached humanity that does not see the importance of tribal dynamics, falls into the fragmentation of feeling that becomes a cold detachement that leads to human evil. We watch as humans to cooperate and protect. many are weak and exposed to the one way surveillance of imprisoned emotion, locked into the lost of cruel abandonment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will need more time before the final verdict, I thank you for your understanding.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This was hard to suss out. I found a few Google hits in Slavic when searching for "Slavonski Robin Hud" which include the name Jovo StanisavljeviÄ Äaruga(they didn't show up for Caruga, because of the missing accents). I then <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=+Jovo+Stanisavljevi%C4%87+%C4%8Caruga&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=+Jovo+Stanisavljevi%C4%87+%C4%8Caruga&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Googled the proper spelling</a> with accents and got substantially more hits (71). That's not a whole lot, but I'd imagine there just aren't many Slavic folk resources online. Therefore, I'm suggesting we keep it unless someone who knows Slavic folklore says the person isn't notable. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperzonk_e38e.html" title="User:Hyperzonk">HyperZonk</a> 17:56, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tentative <b>Keep</b>, with reservations, after Googling the accented spelling (thanks to HyperZonk) showed almost all of those hits are Wikipedia mirrors. Most are for a Serbian outlaw, and a few are for a Serbian athlete. If this is verified as not a wikipropagated hoax (for the latter's self-promotion or roasting) but a longlasting and widespread "Slavic Robin Hood" legend, then I think it's an encyclopedic topic for the English WP despite the fact that little seems to be online. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:52, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> What hundreds of bands? I'd have to disagree that this isn't a noteworthy example, considering that their work has been used as an example of the use and worth of the Creative Commons movement by one of its founders, Professor Lawrence Lessig. Certainly, though it's not there yet, we shouldn't let the page die because of a quick-triggered user or so that doesn't know otherwise. BCarea 19:29, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This band doesn't even come up when audio searching the creative common's website, furthermore a search with "lawrence lessig" and tryad yeilds less than ten results. The only mention of it, seems to be on band-members websites. There are plenty of creative commons examples given in the wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#Projects_and_works_using_Creative_Commons_licenses" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#Projects_and_works_using_Creative_Commons_licenses" rel="nofollow">here</a>. A search for "creative commons" and "tryad" yields less than twenty results, with almost all, being clones of a "press release" created by the band, promoting themselves, made to sound like an article. These twenty results, should be compared to the 5.6 million results that "creative commons" alone yields, how can we say that Tryad is of any significance to the creative commons movement? I really don't believe that the unverified claim that Professor Lessig played one of their songs makes the band noteable. This is just self-promotion. --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendanfox_bfcb.html" title="User:Brendanfox">Brendanfox</a> 01:09, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mmm, to a degree. I would say that Maltese nobility are not <i>intrinsically</i> notable; but I am sure there are some Maltese nobility who <i>are</i> notable. While an opinion that Maltese nobility are not intrinsically notable would be a Good Thing, I hope it doesn't lead to the deletion of articles where notability actually DOES exist for independent reasons. (Interestingly, we had this debate about UK peers a couple of days back and there seemed to be a lot of opinion - which I disagreed with - that being a UK peer <i>is</i> intrinsically notable.) <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 15:32, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Not a copyvio if the author is who he claims to be, which I see no reason to doubt. The issue is perhaps whether he really wants to release it under GFDL and accept the edits of others. And the "by permission" thing should be on the talkpages. /<a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 17:29, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Additional comment</b> as to notability: Aristocratic families (i.e. not the petty nobility of low-level officers and civil servants that exists in most of Europe) are almost always somewhat notable because of landownership, patronage of churches etc and the political significance of their relationships. In most cases at least a few members were notable in themselves. But this article is not really written in encyclopedic style, lacks wikilinks and other things which would put things better in context. The important individuals should be in articles of their own, the others could perhaps be mentioned in passing in an shorter article on the family (more like the British peerage articles). I wish the author would spend some time cleaning up his articles and adapting them to Wikipedia style. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 18:08, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sigh. I'll never win this battle, but I feel that all schools should have an entry on wikipedia, no matter how notable. We let all small towns have their own entry, don't we? Even towns of absolutely no import. We allow towns with populations of less than 100 people to have their own entries, and all the articles ever says is the stuff the robots put in there. Yet we don't allow individual articles for each school? I don't understand the difference. So I'll vote <i>keep</i>, even though I already know I've lost this one. Maybe my vote will convince someone else to rethink their position the next time a school article gets put up on VfD. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Herboso_fb30.html" title="User:Eric Herboso">Eric</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEric_Herboso_ef91.html" title="User talk:Eric Herboso">Herboso</a> 22:33, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What do I need to do to show that I'm not a sock puppet? I've used wikipedia for a long time as a resource, I just don't usually see something I can improve on. This entry seems to be fairly notable (by nature of its content), I have heard it used by people I know from the area, and it shouldn't be deleted simply because it is unique to a certain age group. Many things are unique to certain age groups, should we not comment on a large number of age-specific sociological functions? Or only the age-specific in certain regions? Where do we draw the line?--Billoday 22:49, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is difficult to prove that you're not a sockpuppet when you have only two edits, both on this VfD. You have every right to state your opinion, with the understanding that the admin tallying this VfD may choose to place less weight on your vote. It's not always that easy to figure out where to draw the line when it comes to notibility. In general, something that is notable only to a portion of an age group in one city is <i>not</i> notable. If it starts to catch on, perhaps it will become notable and suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 22:56, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. An editor has apparently moved some ancient Larry Sanger text that was on <a href="../../../c/o/s/Talk%7ECosmological_argument_a0aa.html" title="Talk:Cosmological argument">Talk:Cosmological argument</a> to a separate article. The reason this text was long ago moved to the Talk page in the first place is that despite Sanger's public posturing about the low quality and anti-elitism of Wikipedia (he presumably being part of the elite to which Wikipedia is anti-), Sanger's writing was never very good. Often it was just disconnected lecture notes, as in this case. Further, it doesn't make sense to have this text in a separate article. The rebuttals for the cosmological argument should be in the article itself, and indeed there are rebuttals there already. It is hard to see what this editor was up to, but it doesn't make sense. It is too bad that it takes 5 days to undo dumb moves like this, but in this case it has taken five months for it to be nominated so a few more days isn't going to do any harm. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:03, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, <i>it is not</i> an invalid vote. This has been gone over time and time again. There seems to be an urban legend that a merge-and-delete can't be achieved without violating GFDL. The truth is that a GFDL-kosher merge-and-delete can be done fairly easily if the merged material is the product of a single contributor (all that is needed is proper attribution with a suitable comment in the Talk page of the merged article), and rather more laboriously if it has a complex history (by merging histories, which can be performed by any sysop). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:06, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Roberto Weiss was an important scholar who published several influential books and many articles on the renaissance and humanism. He was a member of numerous academies and held the professorhip of Italian at UCL for 23 years. Have you tried searching for information on Weiss before making this nomination? / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 22:31, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are thousands of university professors and even more published academicsâmy own family is not without its shareâand these accomplishments do not automatically imply encyclopedic notability. The article, a series of single-sentence factoids, is "fluffed" to begin with, and yet still does not exceed a single paragraph. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustin_Hair_324b.html" title="User:Austin Hair">A.D.H.</a> (<a href="../../../a/u/s/User_talk%7EAustin_Hair_31c5.html" title="User talk:Austin Hair">t</a>&amp;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Austin_Hair_f978.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Austin Hair">m</a>) 22:54, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The current policy on academics on Wikipedia is the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProfessor_test_c55c.html" title="Wikipedia:Professor test">professor test</a>: <i>"If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor, they can and should be included"</i>.

<ul>
<li><b>This is not current policy.</b> Please <b>read</b> the linked page you cite. It is a <b>proposal.</b> It has never received consensus. Please do not attempt "proof by repeated assertion." And it is not not a test "for academics," but one proposed measure of notability for inclusion of any biography. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:06, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fine, it is not current policy then, but is the best we have until people agree on something. A policy is needed. Judging the notability of academics by voting in each case is difficult and puts them at a disadvantage compared to pop-culture celebrities and sportspeople (and slashdot trolls, for that matter). / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 16:50, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

The <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Buchan_5f30.html" title="John Buchan">John Buchan</a> connection is mildly interesting. www.abebooks.com turns up 31 used copies books by him; interestingly enough there are many other titles besides "The Renaissance discovery of classical antiquity." My local public library doesn't have any books by him but the local library interloan network has "Humanism In England During The Fifteenth Century." and "The spread of Italian" humanism. I'm being inconsistent because I've voted to delete roughly comparable academics, but, hey, Ralph Waldo Emerson, right? I think I'm being swayed by the snapshot.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm not especially keen on people writing articles on family members but this man seems more than significant enough for inclusion.
