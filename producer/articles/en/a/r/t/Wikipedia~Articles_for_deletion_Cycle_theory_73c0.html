<p>New set of articles about non-notable pet theory. Original set of articles posted in June/July 2005.</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following additional articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><s><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Foundation_for_the_Study_of_Cycles_0b90.html" title="The Foundation for the Study of Cycles">The Foundation for the Study of Cycles</a></s></li>
<li>Cycles Research Institute</li>
<li>Unified Theory of Cycles</li>
</ul>
<p>Material regarding Cycles Theory was originally inserted into Wikipedia in the summer of 2005. This was backed out where it was added into articles like <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycle.html" title="Cycle">Cycle</a>, and deleted outright when it was presented in articles like Harmonics Theory, as it represents the pet theory of one individual (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Harmonics_Theory_9b87.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Harmonics_Theory_%282nd_nomination%29_bb72.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory (2nd nomination)</a> for sample context).

<dd>Too funny. This is a 501c3 U.S. recognized organization. That is doing research in cycle theory. Your personal opinions on whether it is bias, rubbish or pseudoscience is redundant. This is a verifiable entity conduction research in cycle theory. Thus a sub on the theory should be expanded. Therefore, cycle theory should be on wikipedia as the foundation and it research arm. Personally, I hold little interest in the topic. But what does interest me is giving credit were it should be given and it should be. <a href="../../../h/0/r/User%7EH0riz0n_8488.html" title="User:H0riz0n">H0riz0n</a> 06:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First - State a vote of "<b>keep</b>" or "<b>delete</b>", at the beginning of your voting comment, either as a blanket for all articles listed, or on an article-by-article basis.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second - getting registered as a non-profit organization doesn't make you noteworthy. It means you went to the appropriate office, filled in the form, and paid the fee. I've been part of one which consisted of half a dozen people who met once a year to satisfy the AGM requirements so I'm quite familiar with the process.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The most likely deletion criterion considered here is notability (though that's not a cast in stone policy, it tends to be what gets considered). What makes a _scientific_ _theory_ notable or non-notable is how much mention it gets by scientists. What makes an entity in general notable or non-notable is how much mention it gets by the public at large. Google is the usual yardstick for this for AfD disputes. Go and check for yourself to see whether this is notable or not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Third - while status as science or pseudoscience isn't relevant for an AfD vote, it _is_ relevant for how the articles themselves are presented (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>). I have a strong background in science and engineering. If I call something pseudoscience, it's because I have the expertise to know it certainly is. If I'm not sure, I _say_ that I'm not sure, and <i>ask scientists</i>. Accusing me of "bias" and "personal opinion" when assigning labels like that verges on being a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. Please consider the possibility that I _do_ know what I'm talking about. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 07:07, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These results are inflated by a variety of things. I get 353 results from your search. After removing results from cyclesresearchinstitute.org and tomes.biz, these results are brought down to around 260. Additionally, from playing around with the search parameters, it appears that of these 260, about 100 are the result of spamming of newsgroups with announcements.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- Though there are many studies of cyclic processes in different forms of science, I see no independent evidence for the existence of a coherent discipline known as "cycle theory" as defined on the article page, one which tried to be a "unified theory of cycles". The key question here is not whether one can find times when various economic models are described a cyclical, but whether or not there exists a "cycle theory" as a disciplinary field. It seems, from a superficial look at the links offered here, that the author is trying to carve out some sort of new interdisciplinary approach. That's good and well, but unless there is independent reference to this from a mainstream source of some sort I don't think it passes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and does not belong on Wikipedia. If/when it becomes a notable disciplinary approach, we'll be happy to have an article on it. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 05:08, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - More than half of the 350 results on google are either self-references or newsgroup spamming. The articles focus quite a bit on cycles outside of business, but have no links to <b>peer-reviewed and respected</b> publications outside of the business-related links. It appears that "Cycle Theory" might be an obscure business theory, but depending considerably on psychology of people involved in business, which bears little relation to what these articles are about. To cite a precedent, this is much less notable than Aetherometry, which was deleted for non-notability. Foundation for the Study of Cycles seems a bit questionable too - many of the links to it appear to be astrology related - but I will look into this later. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> 05:56, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Modern <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamical_system.html" title="Dynamical system">dynamical systems</a> theory offers much insight into why cycles are common (but certainly not ubiqitous) in dynamical systems, including systems which are often used to model phenomena in economics, biology, and physics.</li>
<li>"Cycle theory" as described at the <a href="http://www.foundationforthestudyofcycles.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.foundationforthestudyofcycles.org/" rel="nofollow">FSC website</a> and in Cycles Research Institute and the other articles up for AfD amounts to little more than the observation that cycles are common (but certainly not ubiquitious) in phenomena which nowadays are often modeled as some kind of dynamical system (continuous or discrete).</li>
<li><i>There is no such subject as "cycle theory" in mathematics or dynamical systems theory.</i></li>
<li>The mathematical theory of dynamical systems is a <i>theory</i>. The "cycle theory" promoted in these articles is vapid nonsense.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Since the real theory (dynamical systems) is both beautiful and powerful, I encourage anyone interested to learn a bit about it.

<dd>There are in fact beautiful connections between cycles, closed geodesics, zeta functions, primes, and all that.

<dd><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">User:Fabartus</a>, your comment is almost unreadable (I tried to improve the formatting but probably failed). I have some comments:
<ol>
<li>move to <i>what</i>? What is this <i>"respectable webpage"</i>? What on Earth does "respectable webpage" even mean? Are you saying that you believe that WP should have articles on <i>every website in the world?!</i></li>
<li>Up above we already discussed the key issue in detail the point: in his websites, UseNet postings, and WP articles, Tomes uses legitimate terms from math and mathematical sciences like <i>harmonic</i>, <i>cycle</i>, and by mentions some genuine legitimate research, in hope that the reader will conclude that Edward R. Dewey's vapid numerology is meaningful and mainstream. Neither is the case. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_R._Dewey&amp;oldid=47348205" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_R._Dewey&amp;oldid=47348205" rel="nofollow">my version</a> of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_R._Dewey_8f73.html" title="Edward R. Dewey">Edward R. Dewey</a>, I tried to stress the contrast between vapid numerological mysticism and genuine mathematical theories, by sketching some theorems from dynamical systems theory which mention (mathematical precise notions of) "cycles".</li>
<li>You seem to imply that you believe that we critics don't know what we are talking about when it comes to mathematics and science in general or cycles in particular. Did you overlook the fact that my own <a href="http://www.genealogy.ams.org/html/id.phtml?id=28250" class="external text" title="http://www.genealogy.ams.org/html/id.phtml?id=28250" rel="nofollow">dissertation</a> concerned a class of dynamical systems which (in the generic case) contain no cycles whatever, contrary to the ludicrous claim, attributed to Dewey by Tomes, that <i>"cycles are present in everything which has been studied"</i>. I assure you that before you can understand notions of <i>aperiodicity</i>, you need to understand notions of <i>periodicity</i>!</li>
<li>You ask <i>"Has anyone noticed that one of the Board Members on the below link is the CEO of FedEX? Think he's wasting his time?"</i>. By "Board Members on the below link", I presume you mean "Members of the Board of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles". So what are the scientific credentials of this person? If he has none, why would you think we would be impressed? Particularly since we are well aware of a common cranky tactic of inflating polite replies to emails into "endorsements" (I've been a victim of that myself).</li>
<li><i>"From the same site"</i>: aye, there's the rub. Edward R. Dewey appears to be entirely non-notable in the sense that I am unable to find information about him which does <i>not</i> come from one of the websites associated with Ray Tomes, which I insist are neither reliable nor independent sources of information.</li>
<li><i>"The Foundation has now become the recognized world center for multidisciplinary cycle research."</i> The trouble is, the only source for this claim appears to be none other than Ray Tomes and members of his organization. I take it that you are one yourself? In any case, this ducks the point, since mainstream science has recognized no need for "multidisciplinary cycle research", while happily accepting dynamical systems theory, which already provides powerful, beautiful, provable, and highly applicable insights into many aspects of dynamical behavior, including cyclical and non-cyclical behavior.</li>

<dd>Some points in response here:
<ul>
<li>The search for "Cycles Research" isn't returning what you think it is - take a look at the results. Hardly any of these results are related to the articles in question. Searching for "Cycles Theory" gives similarly erroneous results.</li>
<li>Many of us are mathematicians or physicists who are certainly qualified to judge the notability of these articles.</li>
<li>Although the FSC site certainly asserts notability, it offers little concrete evidence for such. Interestingly, the "recognized world center" for research doesn't appear to have an address, and at least one of its four constituents admits that it doesn't have an office (look at the CRI page, About CRI). Trusting the assertions given on such a site is rather naive, as we have seen in the past (see the Aetherometry discussions, for example).</li>
<li>Many pseudoscientific and obscure organizations have been around for a long time, or claim to have been around for a long time. That doesn't make them notable.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Whether these people (or person) are able to show something in the future or not doesn't really effect their notability now. They are still pseudoscientists, just like others we have deleted before, and non-notable ones at that. They appear to have attached themselves to a term used in economics, but do not really appear to have anything to do with it - while Cycle Theory in business has to do with psychology and other such things, and could probably be formulated on a rational basis, this group is concerned with things like linking cycles in the sun to economics. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> 13:07, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is almost but not quite at the level of noting that <i>many things can be counted,</i> creating a Foundation for the Study of Countability espousing "Countability Theory" as a deep theory of nature, putting [[Category:Countables]] on a bunch of pages and then justifying by pointing out that in mathematics there is something called <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_theory.html" title="Number theory">Number theory</a>.

<dd>Pedantic but to my mind important correction: you wrote <i>"The fact that there are actual discussions in specific fields of something called 'cycle theory'"'.

<dd>No, no, you misunderstand me, or I wasn't clear. While I appreciated your point about dynamical systems theory, I wasn't responding to you at all. Some posters above seemed to be suggesting that since there's a real theory called "cycle theory" (in field X) the term can be used in any context, which is clearly wrong. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> above wrote "while Cycle Theory in business has to do with psychology and other such things"--I was expanding on his point, not yours. My point was that even if there <i>were</i> something called "cycle theory" in some field (I have no idea whether any field actually uses the term), that doesn't justify the use of the term promiscuously or, in the Tomesian sense, as some kind of universal Key to All Sciences. So, I am in fact in complete agreement with you (and, I believe, <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a>).

<dd><b>Suggestion for admin</b>: looks this AfD will pass, and a good thing too! I think <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Foundation_for_the_Study_of_Cycles_0b90.html" title="The Foundation for the Study of Cycles">The Foundation for the Study of Cycles</a> should also be deleted, but the nominator waffled. Do I need to initiate a separate AfD for that page? Whichever admin deletes the articles, can you please ensure that the AfD itself is kept? Since several of us expect that <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">User:RayTomes</a> will create more articles containing similar content, it might be helpful to avoid having to say all this over again and again and again.

<dd>To the best of my knowledge, AfD pages stick around. I dug up links to the old Harmonics Theory ones when HT was re-posted. Anything that directly duplicates deleted content, under the same name or not, gets speedied pretty quickly. I nominated these two articles using the full AfD process because I thought they were different enough in content that it would be hard to make an ironclad case for them being duplicates. I removed FSC from the list of nominated articles because the two remaining articles, unlike FSC, _largely_ duplicated previously-deleted content, and so would probably be less contested than an AfD that included the FSC article. I'll take a closer look at the two articles you nominated this coming week.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 06:02, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Like others, I agree that the existence of studies of cyclical behaviour in different fields does not mean that there is any "grand theory of cycles". <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin1243_1326.html" title="User:Kevin1243">Kevin</a> 07:09, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> this AfD and the related articles seem to be a concerted effort by some editor to remove any metion of the vast body of work which has gone into syudying economic and other cycles. Do not judge this by mathematics, judge it by economic theory. As a number of different articles are listed here

<dd>Salix, as a mathematician I have no quarrel with mathematical economics. But, Salix, <i>these articles hardly mention economics!</i> Their only purpose is to promote the numerological mysticism of Dewey/Tomes. That is cranky POV-pushing and I think that cranky POV-pushing is unacceptable in Wikipedia. Let us not lose sight of the fact that ultimately WP is or should be reliable source of information for the general reader. It is not a soapbox for promoting crank "theories". ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:47, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> per Fastfission and Rodii, who made the crucial point that the article seems to be about a new interdisciplinary approach to "cycles".

<li><b>No vote.</b> I'm no longer certain. While looking up info on <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_R._Dewey_8f73.html" title="Edward R. Dewey">Edward R. Dewey</a>, I found <a href="http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;q=http://www.springerlink.com/index/G46WMJ6021724N56.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;q=http://www.springerlink.com/index/G46WMJ6021724N56.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It mentions that he worked in "interdisciplinary cycle research" and that there is now a <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary Cycle Research</i> <a href="http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/f06e2d629b6d7fc9.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/f06e2d629b6d7fc9.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> So it would appear there is such a field, with Dewey as a pioneer. I'm unsure of whether the field is notable enough for inclusion; this is due in part to just the general crappy state of the article on cycle theory. But it may be that after appropriate cleanup, it would be suitable. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 11:45, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
