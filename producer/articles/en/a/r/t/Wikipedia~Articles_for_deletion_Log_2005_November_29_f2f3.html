<dd>Comment: Of course, in saying that, the fact that people in Oman and India and Hawaii had all made temples and plays and such calling them "Kadavul" this that or the other suggests that it may warrant an encyclopaedic article. I'm not sure. Does God warrant an encyclopaedic article? Or how about a name for God?

<dd>It did seem pretty obvious that it was the word for Allah, both from the original version of the article and from the google search I did on it. But I am not sure.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am going to vote now. I have discussed this in dic def talk, and it seems that there is a clear precedent for making an encyclopaedic article about the name of a deity. Based on what references I did have a look at, it seems that this has an encyclopaedic value at least partially independent of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>. After all, there is an Indian English-speaking game show called "Kadavul" while they speak English and could easily have named it Allah. There must be some reason for that. So, while I am not the one that should be writing the article, I think we should stub it and leave it for someone a bit more knowledgeable. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 05:44, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Haeleth, when you refer to "fans of the series" you're probably referring to those of the UK version. It's actually from the US version (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Office_%28US%29_a211.html" title="The Office (US)">The Office (US)</a>) which is why the UK fans wouldn't remember it.

<li>Given that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is a guideline and not a policy, this is perhaps a great example of why it should remain a guideline - here's a band that doesn't fit WP:MUSIC, but is notable due to its significance of being the first band from Doha. Perhaps WP:MUSIC is the wrong rationale to judge them. Anyways, <b>keep</b> assuming proper verification. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 14:42, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I just don't know that being the "first" band is automatically notable without A) verification and B) any sign that being the first band had an impact. Say I formed a band in 1987 and billed it as the first death metal band in Kentucky... more people live here than in Doha. But we played a few shows in people's basements, had no releases, didn't spur a scene, no one really remembers us. Would we be notable? I think not... just typical band vanity. Now evidence that they had an impact on the music scene is obviously going to be harder to come by, becase they're in Qatar, not Kentucky. But still... considering the lack of releases, verification and the way this fits the typical high school band mold... --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:01, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, right, you said exactly the thing: It's Qatar, not Kentucky. Of course verification is important, and I'm adjusting my vote to reflect that as I should have before. Notability because of the culture and inherent impact is, IMO, important. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 16:21, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Popularity is not everything. A lot of unpopular things have historical importance because of being the first of something - even if they did not subsequently influence anything. Firsts that influenced culture, like for example <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> was significant not due to its popularity (it wasn't all THAT popular) but because it was the first ever heavy metal band in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, whilst less popular bands such as Carcus (band) were if anything more influential because of being the first death metal band in the world, in spite of popularity. I can think of so many examples of hardly heard of things that are important because of being the first, and having historical importance. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 18:50, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Indeed, I would suggest that hardly heard of things with historical relevance is precisely what an encyclopaedia is there for. If its something that we already know about, then we don't need to look it up, do we? I mean, who cares about looking up about <a href="../../../i/c/q/ICQ_3c2b.html" title="ICQ">ICQ</a>? We already know about it because its enormously popular, well known, etc. You might care about the intricacies of how it came about or something, but other than that, who cares? I am much more interested in hearing about less heard-of things like about a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planemo.html" title="Planemo">planemo</a> to describe <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluto.html" title="Pluto">Pluto</a> and the 10th planet, or about that woman who was a natural conductor of electricity, because then we are learning something new. IMO those things are much more encyclopaedic than a popular thing such as ICQ. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a>
<dl>
<dd>All of this is true, but the bottom line is that something actually has to have an influence, even if it's obscure to popular culture. We can just assume they're influential without any evidence... and as far as I can tell there's no evidence that they're more than the typical highschool myspace band that gets voted deleted all the time. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 21:43, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Is that policy, to keep the history?<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 20:49, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's standard practice. More to the point, it's simpler to keep the history than to delete it, so what's the point of going to any extra effort? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 21:04, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Point taken. I suppose in the long run too when someone does get the urge to write an actual article about this school too it makes it a tad easier to rewrite it. Granted I'd rather history be gone, but that is secondary in my mind to the merge so *shrug*.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 21:13, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the normal GFDL attribution requirement applies here. We're not using the text of the school article, we're just adding a mention of the school to the district. Simple facts, like a school name, by themselves, aren't copyrightable (as far as I know). There's really no text in the school article to move anyhow (for instance my sentence saying the school is part of the district would obviously not be used in the district article). So, I think the issue of preserving history here is not signficant, and I would be fine either way. Before a copyright holder can complain their GFDL-rights were violated (through lack of attribution), they actually have to show that copyrightable/copyrighted work was actually copied, in my non-lawyered opinion. So, I think what's done with the old history is a minor issue, that can go either way. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Given that the author also used the mis-spelling "fundemental", I suspect that this is little more than the tautologous notion that the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fundaments" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:fundaments">fundaments</a> of calculus are the elements of the fundamental theories of calculus. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:29, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: I should point out (and it pains me to do so) that there is a valid term that may trip up Google searches: "fundament" and "fundiment" are both archaically valid, and they can both refer to the foundation of just about anything. Further, they are used as a polite term for the anus in early 19th century parlance. However, that's a Wiktionary matter.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Roller coasters aren't inherently notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia and this one isn't much more notable than any other coaster. New rides are frequently the fastest, or the highest, or have the most loops when they first open, but they are usually surpassed in a few months or years because the industry is extremely competitive. I have a hard time thinking of anything that could make a roller coaster notable enough to be in an encyclopedia. For me, it would have to be the first of a type of coaster, the most visited ride in the nation, the oldest coaster in operation or cause a large number of deaths. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:19, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think it matters a lot, but I'm sticking to my guns, on the basis of, shrug, "what harm does it do?" We're told that redirects are cheap, and it's a real historical person, etc. etc. I'm probably wrong, but I have a faint, faint synaptic firing that says maybe I've heard the name somewhere. However, the only likely places are Shaw's <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Joan_73a4.html" title="Saint Joan">Saint Joan</a> and Mark Twain's <i>Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc.</i> I just did an online search of the PG text of the Twain book <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2874/2874-8.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2874/2874-8.txt" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2875/2875-8.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2875/2875-8.txt" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> and the executioner is not named, only referred to as "the executioner." Deletion would probably do no harm since a search would find the Joan of Arc article. In fact most Google hits on "Geoffroy Therage" are to copies of the Wikipedia article on Joan of Arc. So, it doesn't matter... but I can't think of any particular reason to change my vote. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:32, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I question the inclusion of this article. The SAB is <i>somewhat</i> known in online atheist communities (I'm a regular at alt.atheism on Usenet by the way) and you find a number Google hits but it's still something of a "local" phenomena. It's not all that well regarded and <b>certainly</b> isn't viewed as a scholarly work. The SAB is already cited at <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inerrancy.html" title="Inerrancy">Inerrancy</a> and, I think, that's sufficient for a non-peer reviewed, purely web phenomena. The traffic in Alexa isn't terribly high and the discussion forum at SAB has attracted only about 480 users. If somebody wanted to take a crack at it (I'll pass), it <i>might</i> be worth merging into an article of "contemporary" online Biblical criticism works but I just can't--myself--see it having its own article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I remember coming across this years and years ago and reading a fair chunk of it, but I can't remember any mention of it in the past few years (probably because I stopped reading philosophical debates on forums back in high school).

<li><b>Keep</b>. SAB comes up regularly in online discussion of Christianity - most people with an interest in biblical errors/inerrancy arguments will have heard of it, I think. It's scholarship is shoddy, but that isn't a reason for deletion of the article about it. I don't think it is fair to describe it as a vanity page, either - there is no evidence that the site author wrote the article, and a variety of people have been editing it back and forth. SAB is 'cited' at <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inerrancy.html" title="Inerrancy">Inerrancy</a> only as one of about forty links at the bottom of an already-long article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, just in case there's confusion, I'm an atheist, a known regular of alt.atheism, the host of the alt-atheism.org website, and Gastrich thinks I'm in some "conspiracy" to wipe Christianity off the Internet or something equally silly.

<li><b>Comment</b> Except it's not even that. Actually, it came out of a question by another user--who is definitely not Gastrich--of whether the SAB is notable enough to have a page and my own attempt to <b>defend</b> the SAB sounded pretty weak in my own ears. Even with my own personal bias of being an atheist I couldn't come up with much to defend the SAB having an article of its own. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li>Let me try a defense: I have voted for inclusion on articles of much lesser notability, whether or not I liked the concept embodied. 100,000 Google hits is a very large number. I don't believe we're in any danger of lowering the bar here to include all books. This one happens to be widely read and widely commented upon. Someone who has heard of it might well look to Wikipedia as a source of information. The article can list the book's strengths and weaknesses in a nonbiased manner. Given the subject, few other well known sources can be counted upon for neutrality. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 19:11, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Interesting. In six or seven years of being one of the loud mouths on alt.atheism and running generally amok in the online atheist community, I've rarely seen a reference to it. In fact, the most attention I can recall being paid to it comes from Gastrich (who seems quite obsessed with it). I just still can't see it having its own article. It's already cited in <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inerrancy.html" title="Inerrancy">Inerrancy</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alleged_inconsistencies_in_the_Bible_bc4e.html" title="Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible">Alleged_inconsistencies_in_the_Bible</a> (maybe some other places I'm not aware of).

<p>I haven't read the WPBIO thing yet, but the Euphemian Literary Society is very noteable. It is one of the most profound liteterary societies in the US in which Robert E. Lee was himself an honorary member! You can search www.google.com yourself and find it listed many times and you can search erskine.edu and find it. The society has had a big impact on history.</p>

<li>It seems someone went ahead and speedy-deleted it. I don't contest that the ELS might be notable, and there is a possibility that Davey wrote the content of that website being the ELS historian. But Davey himself is clearly <i>not</i> notable if his only claim to fame is an honorary, temporary position in a student organization. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 06:55, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you very much, but I am not a honorary temporary position in an organization, but the official webmaster for the organization and the historian. I was appointed the position and had to qualify to become a member, in which I will always be the member, because I am an Erskine College faculty.</p>

<li>As a yet-to-be-released software product, I would say delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I was going to vote delete because they haven't been published, but they meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> quite happily due to media coverage. <a href="http://www.dominationthroughimpurity.com/reviews.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dominationthroughimpurity.com/reviews.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. I would suggest that in cases like this <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, which states that a band has to be published, shouldn't be used, as they seem to be notable enough as a live band.

You Am I eventually had number 1 hits. The reality is that some bands don't want to make a studio album and only ever play live. Many examples of this kind of thing.

<dd>The above contributor is the originator (I won't say "author") of the article, which, as mentioned above, is copy'n'pasted from the band's website. I have no argument about the band's notability, but the article could document which label, which festivals, etc. As it stands, though, it's a copyright violation, it's not wikified, and it has no sourcing of any kind except for the band's website. It's gotta be better than that. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 02:07, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I can't vote again, but may I say, if <i>band has a record produced on a label, tours and plays various festivals</i> then WHY DOESN'T THE ARTICLE SAY SO??? WHAT LABEL, WHAT TOURS, WHAT FESTIVALS? Even if it IS true, I'm basically at the point where, if a band is too freaken lazy to make their OWN case for notability, why should I have to slog through the web to find it? I say: even if a band is notable, if they don't make the claim in the article, the hell with them.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 08:45, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. the band did not write this article. I am a fan of the band, and I was merely adding a side project for one of the members from the Nile page, and I decided to add information for it. I took the bio from their website and didn't change anything because I didn't realize 10 people would see it over night before I had time to learn how to properly use wikipedia and edit and add to the content. also this is from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such." From this, DTI is allowed to be posted here because Joe Payne from Nile is in this band. (Cyrock)

<li><b>Comment</b> I was the original person to post the information, then someone else kindly first edited it so it was not in copyright violation.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Allmusic.com is rather cryptic about Joe Payne; his genre is rock, and absolutely no other information. I get 262 Google hits for "Joe Payne" + Nile. I don't think that makes him "extremely notable". -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 02:05, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Has nothing to do with him. The Guideline says "member was in a BAND that is extremely notable. Nile is one of the most known death metal bands other than Cannibal Corpse. Thus, according to my previous statement, this article is allowed. Also allmusic is not very up to date and correct. They list Nile as Rock, when they are Death Metal, and do not mention their latest album which came out 8 months ago. (Cyrock)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. You forgot to quote the rest of the line from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, "note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such." Right now it looks like Joe Payne's notability comes from recently joining a notable band, and I don't see that notability rubbing off on Domination Through Impurity. When Joe Payne gets his own article, then there can be a Redirect from Domination Through Impurity to his article. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 02:29, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Open your eyes. You forgot to read. I quoted the ENTIRE thing in my original post on it. Stop trying to make things up to further your own arguement. Also until it clearly says an Artist needs to be "extremely notable" before joining an "extremely noteable" band, this article is clearly able to be posted. It only says the BAND of which the artist is in has to be. Also your personal opinion on Nile "rubbing off" on DTI has ZERO credibility. Your personal opinion is not fact. I can just as easily say it will "rub off". (Cyrock)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Cyrock, sorry, I didn't mean to pile on you like that. I was getting a little frustrated after seeing a bunch of really poor band articles. The D through I article is improved, by the way, good work and congrats. It must suck to have a bumch of people piling on you when you're just starting out. Sorry, and welcome to Wikipedia! Unfortunately getting caught up in a deletion argument is probably the worst way to start out! There's a lot of fuzzy warm goodness here too, so don't get scared off! <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 08:41, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and close Vfd. No claims to notoriety. Article starts with <i>"is a little known website"</i>. So unless it has historical importance (first of something, etc) then its a no-brainer to delete it. Don't know why this isn't a reason for Speedy Delete, but so be it. IMO when the article itself admits that its irrelevant, I think it should be able to be deleted on the spot.

<li><b>I Honestly Don't Care</b> I'm the guy who owns the site, I was just told about this thing today by the guy who posted it. Wow, what a pile of crap he wrote. Anyway, do what you want boys &amp; girls, gave me some material to write about today anyway. Although a little commentary, for a site that offers encyclopedia entries for Chat Rooms &amp; a guy who legally changed his name to Optimus Prime because his wife divorced him, it seems highly dubious for you guys to be put in a position where you make that sort of call? Well either way, it's all in good fun! There is quite a lot of interesting stuff to read!</li>

<li>Judging from the title, this is <i>not</i> primarily intended to be about the pharmaceutical, but about the TV commercial that comes with it. This explains the relatively few Google hits - <i>"Jag är Ipren - Den intelligenta värktabletten"</i> ("I am Ipren - the intelligent painkiller") is an exact quote from the song sung by the dorky man dressed as a pill, the "Ipren man" (in the picture). It is a notable campaign in Sweden. I don't know what the policy is on articles on TV commercials, but since this isn't really an article to begin with, I vote <b>delete</b>. If somebody is willing to write a decent stub, I would reconsider. <a href="../../../i/p/r/Ipren.html" title="Ipren">Ipren</a> could be redirected to <a href="../../../i/b/u/Ibuprofen.html" title="Ibuprofen">Ibuprofen</a> (but it is now a redirect to <a href="../../../i/r/p/Irpin%27.html" title="Irpin'">Irpin'</a> for reasons not explained in that article).

Some articles for administrators themselves look no different. But may be wikipedia has a silent ownership and there are more equals among equals. When individuals are profiled, there will be some contents to manifest like vanity - but outlooks are mostly subjective. Modify, moderate, do anything but don't kill information. <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sum.html" title="Sum">sum</a></p>

<dd>I didn't "single out" this article because of its content. I would nominate any similar article for deletion. The article is a vanity page for a non-notable person and a copy-violation from his own website, according to the votes above, which are fairly unanimous. I appreciate your concerns but I feel consensus will show this kind of article is not welcome at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErath_3567.html" title="User:Erath">Erath</a> 17:04, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Preserve</b> The Galvin family used to be rulers of southern provinces of Ireland, such as Dungarvan and Youghal. Also, a sect of the Galvin Family are the founders of the communications giant Motorola. Also, the Galvin's are high ranking officials in the American health system, one being Chief of Physiotheraphy for the AHA. A member of the Galvin family was in the English national football team in the early 1900s. Daniel Galvin, world renowned hairdress, is 'World Hair Colourist of the Year' and is a powerful force in fashion from London, and ever increasingly, the world. Another thing of 'notable' worth is that a Galvin was the very first soldier to paratroop into Holland after Operation Market Garden was commenced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I think there is no information here that would serve as 'vanity'. As the site says itself "Many visitors come to this site to acquire knowledge. The second reason is to share knowledge." I am merely sharing knowledge, and now people may, if desired, which I'm sure people will desire, to read the article. It is not MY article, it is a article for other Galvin's around the world, of which there are many, and anyone else for that matter to find more on there background and be educated in its long and notable History.</p>
<p>As well as this, I had not finished this article and I did intend to add 'notable's' and such like.</p>
<p>As for calling the family shield bogus, I have official documentation that says otherwise, and dozens of NON PROFIT sites also show the coat of arms. It is a part of FAMILY history, not for INDIVIDUAL profit</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've had a good think about this. There <i>are</i> notable families, such as the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_family.html" title="Kennedy family">Kennedy family</a>. I might even accept this article if it were about the ancestral rulers in Ireland (though I would imagine Galvin clan might be a better article title in that case). But it's stretching the definition of "family" too far to claim that everyone with the same surname is part of a single family that is <i>per se</i> encyclopedic because some of its members are. Any individual Galvins who are notable should have their own article, as <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvin.html" title="Galvin">some of them do</a>. --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 12:04, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The word family can and does mean 'A group of persons sharing common ancestry.' or 'Lineage' so actually the phraseology is correct. I have also expanded this article to include the notables, or the 'distinguised lineage'. As for the Notables, they are all proper and correct, and worthy of being notable. As 'notable' means 'Worthy of note or notice' and for those looking upon on <i>FAMILY</i> ancestory, they are notables, or for those just browsing Wikipedia in general. So, the arguements that this is vanity is incorrect, as it serves no egotistical purpose, but a insightful one. And if you look up to the bit I posted earlier as to what Wikipedia is about, some of you seem to have forgotten, as it is there help people "accquire knowledge" and thats what this article does. Not to serve as a vanity article, as vanity is pride in ones own accomplishments, and the accomplishments of Galvin ancestors are not my accomplishments, but theirs. Also, it does now contain notables and the phraseology within the article is perfectly correct and proper.

<dd>As stated on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, in the normal course of things this discussion should last five days, and it will be down to the administrator who closes the debate to decide on the worth or otherwise of the arguments here. "Vanity" - only mentioned as a reason for deletion by one person - is sometimes used as shorthand for "articles in which someone has a personal stake", such as someone writing about their own website, company, family, etc. And the fact that you had earlier created a (speedy deleted) article on Alex galvin probably didn't help matters. Had you actually bothered to engage with people rather than dismissing them as "idiotic", you might have got further (I nearly voted to keep this). --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 16:05, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> to <i>OpenToppedBus</i>. I sincerely apologise, however, the sheer number of lamentable comments have aggravated me as all comments have been responded to and though they may have been useful, they are now outdated(referring to the comments such as <i>StoatBringers</i>) or are and were incorrect (such as <i>Ifnords</i>). As for the call for personal family member pages, from a variety of you, do you really think I'm going to start upon them when I get a veto upon the creatin of this page (designed to be the root of the member pages). The idea seems almost hypocritical at this moment in time. Also, despite this, there are already several notable pages linking the Galvin name, links which are on the page. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexius05_9599.html" title="User:Alexius05">Alexius05</a> 13:22 3rd December, 2005.</li>

<li>OK will try and 'wikify' and organise the article soon. I still do not get why people would want to remove a small article about a non profit organisation&#160;? The name is not taken and is not causing anyone trouble. Its an article about a non-profit organisation that does a number of things for the community, including providinng a free meal every week to 300-400 people in need. One of the reasons why there are not links to this website from others is because the website hasn't been up for that long.

<li><b>Keep</b> I just did a bit of a cleanup though it still needs some work. I think it's an important and notable mp3 blog that's gaining buckets of popularity with every passing day. It's been mentioned in the press (ok, just a tiny bit but it is something) and is a big part of the community. The word itself is interesting as well if its use kicks off. It's not quite as popular as something like <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluxblog.html" title="Fluxblog">Fluxblog</a> but it's getting there. I'm slightly biased because I'm a reader (though don't know the author personally or anything like that) but I think it should stay if we're to have articles on mp3 blogs or other such websites at all. <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJellypuzzle_8e24.html" title="User:Jellypuzzle">Jellypuzzle</a> 18:21, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Fair point, I guess. I heard it from other 1L sections when I arrived at NYU Law. Supposedly it came from other schools, but I don't know which ones, so I said on the post its origins are unclear. Since it <b>is</b> a universal concept with no name, I thought it was worth posting it on here. Plus, I've heard it used in my own sections and it seems to be catching on quick.

<p>I am currently a student at NYU law school and have heard the phrase "Hammertime" on several occasions, particularly right after (and sometimes during) the 120+ minute procedure class I'm taking that is scheduled to be 110 minutes long. I am not sure of the phrase's origins either, but have been told that it describes the extra time that a student (especially one who is being questioned as a class draws to a scheduled end) is on the spot as s/he is being "pounded" (or "hammered") with questions. This makes sense to me, as law schools in general are known for the use of socratic questioning. As far as it's popularity, I have noticed that the phrase is known mostly to students who have such professors, and the fact that a student (even one at NYU law) has gone through school without hearing it may simply mean that the student has not had such professors. I also have no idea when it started being used. Forgot to sign, sorry. Mp1639 03:24, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Oh man, I use this all the time, and I'm not American. "Hammer time". Dum dum de dum dum dum. "You Can't Touch This". Hammer time is when you get down and do something cool. MC Hammer didn't actually start it though - that's where he got his name from. He popularised it. I think it dates back a few decades before then too.

<li><b>Reply.</b> When you contribute to the Wikipedia anonymously (without signing in with a user name), the edit will be attributed to the IP address of the computer or server you are using. Unfortunately the users on the computer or LAN on which you are working have vandalized numerous articles on the Wikipedia. You can contribute under your own user name without fear of being accused of someone else’s vandalism by creating a user name and then signing in each time you contribute. It’s easy, it’s free, and takes about 30 seconds. Just click on the “sign in” link at the top of each page, think up a user name, and sign in. That’s all there is to it. •<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 01:26, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm the originator of this version of this artice. Globex Financial Investment Consulting no longer exists. Its web site has been offline for more than a year.

Cyberpets had thousands of active accounts in its peak.

<li>I used to work for an IBM business partner - nothing gets released without at least five name changes&#160;:-) Looks like this is still on the blocks, though - still a research project not a commercial product.

<li>As a yet-to-be-released software product, I would say delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> - well, I've used this one, and its really a good way to describe racism. After all, nobody ever admits to being racist, do they? You don't go around the street screaming out "Yay, I'm racist and proud!". Nobody does. KKK don't think they are racist. Neo-Nazis don't either. Even <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Hanson_2918.html" title="Pauline Hanson">Pauline Hanson</a> doesn't think she's racist. This is a very good way of describing racism.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I know for a fact that Jamie E Paton did not write this, so there for it is not a a vanity page. He has become a famous face around the east London, Essex areas, and i personally feel it will be an attack on him to bring it down. Jamie has achieved a lot in his short life and it will be a real shame to lose the page. I feel its only fair the rest of the world gets to read about the amazing achievements of this amazing determined person. Thanks User:Coolchris.cockram 20:39, 29 November 2005

<li>I beg to differ. I'm quite bright and I cannot put myself in any of those lists and I wouldn't put myself in the European American category either as I'm not entirely European American. I'm white, but I've got about a sixteenth Native American in me. not to mention a sixteenth or thirty-second of every western european country and scandinavian. And I doubt I'm alone.

<li>None of the lists require purity of the blood. A noteworthy person who is like you ethnically can be placed in several lists. I think what you're wanting is something like a List of uncategorizable European-Americans or List of mixed ethnic people. I'm not convinced anyone you named on this list fits that.

<li>(to Gateman1997) So will this overlap those other ones, or simply include those who cannot trace their ancestry, as you say?

<li><b>Emphatic delete</b> - this (and similarly-named) list is a meaningless exercise in futility. It fails on several fronts:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) The definition of the "races" is dubious at best (we all have descended from Africans. Some came to the US after Europe, after Asia, etc.). In many contexts, it is a political, not a social or genetic, difference.</p>
<p>2) The distinction between races is also arbitrary at best. As late as the 1980s (maybe later, but I'm not sure), Louisiana State law required a placement of "Black" on a person's driver's license - regardless of appearance - if the person is at least 1/32 black. Do <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paula_Abdul_c06c.html" title="Paula Abdul">Paula Abdul</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halle_Berry_1870.html" title="Halle Berry">Halle Berry</a> make this article? All have ancestors who lived in Europe.</p>
<p>3) The name of the article - List of Caucasian Americans - is much too vague. Who is going to visit the hospitals on an hourly basis to keep the list up to date?</p>
<p>4) And if you think my question in #3 is silly, so is the idea of having even a Partial list of Caucasian Americans... and I also extend that argument to any "List of **** Americans" on Wikipedia for that same reason. Adding "notable" or "famous" might not make it better, but the title should mention why the individuals on the list deserve to be singled out on Wikipedia besides their so-called race.</p>
<p>5) As far as I am concerned, there is only one race of people on Earth: the human race.</p>

<ul>
<li>1) Your feelings on race are irrelevant in the eyes of most governments on the face of this planet. I agree we're all humans when it comes down to it... but that's not the way our governments see it. 2) And the distinction is ambiguous to a point, however as you point out there are limits placed on what constitutes a race for a person. However for the sake of this list Hallie Berry could make a case for being put on it. 3) The name of the list is also just as it should be. To be on Wikipedia a person has to be notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> so to make the list it is implied a person is notable. 4)Point three isn't silly, just misinformed. 5) As I said in point one, the US, Canadian, UK, French, Russian, South African, etc, etc... governments disagree with you.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 06:27, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> B.Wind, with regard to number 2. Paula Abdul is 1/2 of Jewish American. Mariah Carey is 1/2 Irish American. Halle Berry is 1/2 English American. Race, just like religion, seems to be in the eye of the beholder. Halle Berry, for example, would probably take issue being called <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian.html" title="Caucasian">Caucasian</a> even if she is 1/2 white (<a href="http://racerelations.about.com/od/celebritiesandrace/a/hollywoodtoday.htm" class="external text" title="http://racerelations.about.com/od/celebritiesandrace/a/hollywoodtoday.htm" rel="nofollow">url</a>). On the other hand, why would it matter if she is labeled on both the Caucasian page and African American page anyway?

<li>Hi. Oh the whole Vfd thing was bringing me down. For the record, I really do say Schwhoa. Sometimes its nice to bring in a perspective there. I know, its not enough reason for it to stay, but I hate to see things be unanimously deleted when they were good faith. I have been trying to think which philosophy most describes me. I was looking at the different ones. I was going to say inclusionist, but not really. I've been voting 50/50, and some articles really annoy me, and I often vote delete when everyone else votes keep. I guess I tend to like to disprove common misconceptions. i.e. if everyone is voting keep, I am more likely to want to vote delete, and vice versa. Of course, that doesn't mean I will go against everyone. I was spending ages on these votes, and I got too tired. Its tiring to do research on every single damn vote. That Asgaard one should stay there, no question in my mind over that one. But this one, well, who cares. I presume you are referring to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammertime.html" title="Hammertime">Hammertime</a> as the other one. Similar kind of vote to this one. I wasn't lying, but you're right, I wasn't researching things like I normally do.

<li><b>Keep</b>, of course. Easy for me to say that, since I wrote it. In this article, I was merely trying to describe a phenomenon: the fact that the term "North Slavic" is used for three different phenomena - the grouping of East and West Slavic together under the header "North Slavic" (you don't believe me? Google for it), the fact that there are scientists who believe a North Slavic branch does exist, or has existed (I'll look for sources), and a group of conlangs based on that last premise. As for the conlangs: I agree that the languages mentioned there are not notable enough to warrant articles on their own (viz. wikipedia.pl, which has individual articles about no less than six of them!). We've had many discussions already about merging articles like that into one, and in this case I simply decided to do that in advance. While the languages mentioned may not be notable enough on their own, they certainly are as a group. That has nothing to do with "wikipedia being a vehicle for their promotion". BTW, the languages in question are all <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">artlangs</a>, so there's really nothing to promote here. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 08:55, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I am surprized why people keep ignoring that the main issue with wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. I am not at all against fringe theories here, but the more obscure subject is covered, the better it must be referenced.</p>
<p>We have plenty of trolls here to invent nations and languages. For example not long time ago <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Ruthenian_language_05f8.html" title="Black Ruthenian language">Black Ruthenian language</a> was created several times. (and BTW the waves of this hoax are still on net; e.g. at a website that sells cars: <a href="http://www.carluvers.com/cars/Black_Ruthenian_language" class="external text" title="http://www.carluvers.com/cars/Black_Ruthenian_language" rel="nofollow">Black_Ruthenian_language</a>). I suggest you to take a look at it and see that this one was written with love and care, much better that the article we are discussing.</p>
<p>Threfore rather than poking at my ignorance you better provide solid references. I tried to search web, but the traces of the term (in non-toy usage) were very weak to convince me in its notability. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 20:03, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am surprized that, when searching the web, you didn't find <a href="http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art208e.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art208e.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> or <a href="http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art066e.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art066e.pdf" rel="nofollow">this publication</a> by prof. Kortlandt, who does use the term North Slavic. Kortlandt can hardly be viewed as a marginal reference. The former reference was on the first google page when I searched for "North Slavic". <a href="../../../x/y/b/User%7EXyboi_c5a6.html" title="User:Xyboi">Xyboi</a> 20:17, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, Kortlandt is one of the sources I had in mind. And here's another reference (regarding the use of "North Slavic" vs. for "East ánd West Slavic" vs. "South Slavic"):</dd>
<dd><b>Bernard Comrie &amp; Greville G. Corbett, <i>The Slavonic languages</i></b> (London, 1993), p. 75, pp. 115-119 and several other places in the same book. An authoritative source, if I may say so.</dd>
<dd>The existence of the North Slavic constructed languages is obvious enough and needs not to be proven here. If the many references on the web are not good enough for you, the article written by Prof. Tilman Berger definitely should be!</dd>
<dd>As for the alledged North Slavic background of the Novgorod dialect: I know there are sources for that too, but I can't recall them offhand now. I'll look into that.</dd>
<dd>Satisfied now? Instead of displaying such a condescending attitude, you might as well have asked these questions <b>before</b> issuing a VFD against the article. I'm not exactly a newbie in wikiland, but let me tell you this: if this is the way potentially prolific new wikipedians are normally dealt with after they write their first or second article, there's a huge chance you'll lose them forever! --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 20:53, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My "condescending attitude" is in my nomination: "insufficiently notable linguistic exercise. Wikipedia is not a vehicle of its popularization" and related to toy-languages. It is a modern development, played on web. Still, miserable visibility hence notability. The actual linguistic discussion is secondary importance here. If this article survives, it must be renamed into Constructed North Slavic languages. If there was a serious theory about "real" N-Slavic langs, it must be presented under <b>this</b> title, with proper references, for verification. Kortlan's use of the term proves nothing; for all I saw, it is just a matter of convenience. In any case, this if way far from mainstream. As for my attitude, we live in real world. There are muggers and killers and trolls, and me. As you see, nothing terrible happened. Your opinion prevailed. No need to panic. I am not going to fight tooth and claw. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:21, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, Mikkalai, I'm not trying to popularise anything; I notice a certain phenomenon and I try to describe it, that's all. If you don't care for "toy-languages", that's fine. So leave people alone who do. As far as I am concerned, constructed languages are an art form just like any other art form.</dd>
<dd>Next: first you claim nothing of what's written can be proven and ask for references, then you get your references, and next you say that "the actual linguistic discussion is of secondary importance". Now, have I missed something?</dd>
<dd>About renaming the article: no. North Slavic languages are an existing phenomenon, whether you like it or not. And there are two different meanings for it, both given in the article, plus the constructed languages that are based on the premise of one of those. I see no reason for splitting it in two (or three) until the size of the article would demand it. And FYI: Kortlandt is one of the best-esteemed authorities in the field.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I haven't said a word about your ignorance. But to be very honest, I am <b>very</b> unpleasantly surprised about the unfriendly tone of this discussion. Anyway, <i>schwamm drüber</i>. How do you want those references placed in the article? References to the very existence of a phenomenon surely shouldn't be placed in the "external links" section?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I voted keep above already. I'd like to inject some cites, but it's hard to know where to fit them in this flamewar. However: this article could use a little fixup, yes. North Slavic is somewhat tenuous as a language family; it's more often considered an areal pheonomenon, or a dialect continuum including East and West Slavic. I agree the article could stand some more depth and some better sourcing. To me that indicates the article should be improved, not deleted. Some links, though (via google): <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/events/abstracts/rappaport/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/events/abstracts/rappaport/" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> <a href="http://www.ku.edu/~slavic/bss99-greenbergm.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ku.edu/~slavic/bss99-greenbergm.html" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> and</li>

<dd>North Slavic is a real linguistic concept. It's not particularly obscure. Comrie, Timberlake, Hult, Rappaport, and Tommola are all well-known and respected academic linguists with substantial publication records, not hobbyists or amateurs. I repeat, if Mikka thinks that the conlangs aspect of this article is bogus, he should edit the page or take his case to the talk page, not try to do this via AfD.

<dd>Thank you. Honestly, I <i>do</i> agree with you that the article could do with some more depth. I sincerely hope that people more knowledgeable than me will take care of that, because unlike some others here, I am not a real expert in the field, merely a well-informed amateur. But I'm still not sure you to go about the "cite your sources" thingy. It appears to me that a footnote would be inappropriate if the book(s) in question only prove that a certain word is indeed used in a certain meaning. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 06:33, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know this page has been previously nominated, deleted, undeleted etc., but a good amount of time has passed this is a nn made up (in 1996) nonsense language and is inappropriate for Wikipedia in my OP. I bet I'll lose this one, but I know there is at least some belief out there that this should be deleted even though some work has been put into it and even though it has been around for some time (with rare editing) Gator (talk) 20:32, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> — I don't really like conlangs, but I do a fair amount of work on languages on Wikipedia. This one has two <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_639-3_b450.html" title="ISO 639-3">ISO 639-3</a> codes, which indicates that it has a degree of recognition (even though those codes are in draft form, and it's likely to lose one of them). Ceqli is a fairly important <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineered_language.html" title="Engineered language">engineered language</a>, and enginerred languages are useful scientific tools for the study of language and logic.

<p>I've actually spent a long time thinking about this one before I nominated it as I think it's a more complex issue than meets the eye. Google comes up with only ~400 hits for "fashion of thinking" and "fashion of thought", a decent number of which stem from wikipedia and pages that pull from wp. There is only one page in wp which links to this page (despite the fact that this page has been here for months), and that page (<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought.html" title="Thought">thought</a>), doesn't really need the link. The author seems to claim that it's a phrase, but I honestly don't see it. It's simply a less common use of the word <i>fashion</i>. Is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22make+a+left+hand+turn%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22make+a+left+hand+turn%22" rel="nofollow">"make a left hand turn"</a> worthy of a wp entry? It has 100 times the results of this phrase, and it has about the same claim to notability or uniqueness. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 20:56, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> - the anonymous poster (who should sign his entries on Talk pages) admitted that it was his original "theory" (actually in scientific terms, it is a hypothesis or conjecture, not a theory, until it has been tested).

However, he is so off-the-radar that the source I cite claims 3 books, only lists 2 of which he is the author of only 1 (the editor of the other). Amazon can't find his 3rd work, either.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am abstaining for now. The article itself clearly establishes notability alright, having held a seat in the Irish parliament is good enough for that. My worry is the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiablility</a> of this, because no <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">sources have been cited</a>, and I am having trouble finding any information on this. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:18, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - would it be possible for you to upload those texts to Wikisource? I was unable to access them from The Times website (not surprising because of their dates). Furthermore, I wasn't able to retrieve lists of MPs from either the Parliament website or the History of Parliament website to confirm the information. The Parliament website suggested that UK denizens may be able to retrieve historical lists, though. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 15:50, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>An online digital archive of the London Times from 1785 to 1985 is available via the Thomson Gale detabases (subscription required). My understanding it that uploading the articles themselves would be a breach of copyright. I do recall that there is a publication entitled "Who's Who of British Members of Parliament", which might be of use for verification purposes, but I don't know what periods it covers; the standard "Who's Who" starts, I think, sometime in the 1890's. I have to agree that the UK Parliament is quite poor in terms of the extent of the historical information it provides online. <a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGustavus_faab.html" title="User:Gustavus">Gustavus</a> 17:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clean it up, but keep it!</b> Yakov deals with some pretty esoteric stuff, but he is an expert and his work is important. Unfortunately, his colleagues are more likely to be praying in front of a certain wall in Jerusalem than to be editing Wiki's. It's going to be hard to find legitimate peers to contribute, he runs in some fairly elite circles. Most people have no idea his world even exists. bluezionlion 30 November 2005</li>

<li>Mr. Newman obtained his Talmudic expertise in the Yeshiva world of Jerusalem, and he excels in the field because of his genius. Unfortunately, it is difficult for an outsider to have that sufficiently documented or quantified. It's kind of an insider thing--the people who know are able to recognize the people who know. Yakov is unique, though, in that he is able to add to that rich background considerable expertise in philosophy and the hard sciences. He is also able to bring a wealth of colorful life experiences and adventures obtained while traveling the world. He really is someone odd and wonderful--a treasure. I want to share him, but I don't know how to get it across who he is. Hopefully, I am can make enough progress to save the article. Again, I really appreciate you helping me.

<p><b>Response</b>: Dalbury &amp; Flapdragon, I am very thankful for your time and your responses. I would like to continue to draw on the feedback I have received from you and others to refine this thing until it ultimately works. (How does the Dylan Thomas poem go? "Do not go gentle into that good night...")</p>
<p>Of course, my primary ambition is to document the fact that Yakov Newman is a notable Talmudic scholar and expert on Judaica. But, that is extremely difficult to do. Most of us are accustomed to the system of degrees, peer review, and publishing used within Western Academia to establish credibility. The Yeshiva world works a little differently than that. The sages there do not spend too much time worrying about being accepted as an expert by those who are not of that world, so I have had to struggle for outside material. To this point I have found documentation for him being cited by the author of a Kabbala manual. And, I have found a Conference program listing him as being a presenter on Jewish/Christian history. That is not much, I know, but I hope that it will be seen as evidence that he is regarded in certain circles as being an authority.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Newman's poetry, that really isn't a priority for me. He is a talented poet, but that is primarily only going to be known by a few folks along the coffee shop circuit between Boston and Berkley, so I am willing to remove such a claim if it presents a problem.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Newman being a genius, I present the following evidence: The Wiktionary defines genius as meaning "someone possessing extraordinary intelligence or skill." (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genius" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genius" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genius</a>) According to the official Mensa International website, "membership in Mensa is open to persons who have attained a score within the upper two percent of the general population on an approved intelligence test that has been properly administered and supervised." (<a href="http://www.mensa.org/index0.php?page=10" class="external free" title="http://www.mensa.org/index0.php?page=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.mensa.org/index0.php?page=10</a>) The official Utah Mensa website identifies Yakov Newman as being the Deputy "LocSec" (Local Secretary) for Utah (Region 9, Group 840) in May of 2002. (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/utahmensa/may01.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/utahmensa/may01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/utahmensa/may01.htm</a>) I believe the preceding sufficiently establishes the fact that Mr. Newman is a genius. But, I will remove that term if it sounds like hyperbole.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Newman being a notable, one of the criteria given in the [WP:BIO] is that of being someone in the news: On March 18, 2003, the Deseret Morning News reported under the headline "Peace protest ends in arrests" (page B-2) that Yakov Newman and nine other members of "Utah Citizens for Peace entered [U.S. Congressman, Jim] Matheson's office Monday and demanded he change his stand on the pending [Iraq] war. They refused to leave his office if that stand didn't change — even if it meant some arrests..." Accompanying the article is a photograph of Yakov reading a prayer book while he and another protester are being arrested. (<a href="http://www.desnews.com/cgi-bin/cqcgi_state/@state.env?CQ_SESSION_KEY=ZYPXYUEHVENY&amp;CQ_CUR_DOCUMENT=1&amp;CQ_TEXT_MAIN=YES" class="external text" title="http://www.desnews.com/cgi-bin/cqcgi_state/@state.env?CQ_SESSION_KEY=ZYPXYUEHVENY&amp;CQ_CUR_DOCUMENT=1&amp;CQ_TEXT_MAIN=YES" rel="nofollow">See Deseret Morning News Archives</a>)</p>
<p>This incident is also documented on the following websites:</p>

</ul>
<p>As for the biography, it actually originates with a public domain media kit that Mr. Newman supplies to organizations that he addresses. The first time I saw it was on the Utah Atheist website some years back. They posted it after they had invited him to address their organization. Since then it has bounced around the web in various incarnations.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Am I making any progress? Thanks! <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedtopusa_5422.html" title="User:Redtopusa">Redtopusa</a> 01:54, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I repeat: without a filibuster (preferably in three sentences or less), <i><b>what</b></i> is his claim to fame and what separates him from other scholars? Both the article and posts from Retopusa and Bluezionlion indicated more an essay of idol worship rather than an encyclopedic article. With all the words going on, what would make Mr. Newman noteworthy to the average Joe Blow in Peoria (or Manchester)? <a href="../../../1/4/7/User%7E147.70.242.21.html" title="User:147.70.242.21">147.70.242.21</a> 19:24, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) Yakov Newman's claim to fame is that he is a news-making public figure and a rare authority in Talmudic studies.</li>
<li>(2) What separates him from other scholars is his genius and pioneering efforts within the discipline.</li>
<li>(3) He is noteworthy to the average person because he represents one of the few sources accessible to such an individual for traditional Talmudic learning. <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedtopusa_5422.html" title="User:Redtopusa">Redtopusa</a></b> 22:05, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Sorry, Redtopusa, none of those contentions make him rise to meet the notability criteria:</p>
<p>1)"News making public figure" -- being part of a group who had a sit-in, for example -- wouldn't be sufficient in that it doesn't separate himself from the others in the activity. The term "news making public figure" is an exceptionally vague term -- a county commissioner making the news when he bowled a perfect 300 game, for example, wouldn't in itself merit inclusion in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>2)The fact that he is a "rare authority on Talmudic studies" (by whose objective standards? That would have to be referenced, too... but I digress) is not notable to anybody outside the field. If that were the case, we'd have to include "premier authorities" of every possible field of Academia... and that is most highly POV at best.</p>
<p>3)Genius is not noteworthiness in itself - there are over 6 million <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">geniuses</a> in the United States alone - and "pioneering efforts within the discipline" harkens back to my comment #2 above.</p>
<p>4)And your #3 ("He represents one of the few sources accessible to such an individual for traditional Talmudic learning") is essentially a restatement of "rare authority on Talmudic studies," and until/unless Talmudic studies get more mainstream attention, it cannot be notable enough for a general-purpose reference.</p>
<p>While I am sympathetic to your (and Bluezionlion's) passion for Mr. Newman (and I know you are doing this in good faith - coincidence aside (per B.Wind)), there are more appropriate places and resources for your project at this time. Until Mr. Newman gets much more national notice, I cannot see this endeavor succeeding here, and I must maintain my advocacy for deletion. <a href="../../../1/4/7/User%7E147.70.242.21.html" title="User:147.70.242.21">147.70.242.21</a> 23:05, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Redtopusa, though I feel you have had trouble relating to the Wikipedia concept, I for one salute your passion, persistence, good faith and courtesy. I feel sure there will be things you can contribute to articles such as <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">Yeshiva</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaica.html" title="Judaica">Judaica</a> etc. The essential thing is to make sure what you add is objective, verifiable, neutrally expressed and genuinely notable.

<dd>I wholeheartedly agree. I think that it was simply too early for this article. The notoriety of Yakov Newman needs to be established to a much wider audience. One useful way is to "work your way" down from general to specific (for example, while a particular actor in himself might not be notable, he could be mentioned in an article covering a motion picture or television series in which he appeared). <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedtopusa_5422.html" title="User:Redtopusa">Redtopusa</a>, please don't let a stumble dissuade you from writing great articles - just about all of us get into similar situations at one time or another, and not necessarily at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:21, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
