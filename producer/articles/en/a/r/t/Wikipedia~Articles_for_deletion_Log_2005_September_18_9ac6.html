<p><b>Please Delete Ashida Kim</b></p>
<p>This is the fifth time I have come to your administration council asking to be removed from your site. For several years I didn't even know it existed, no one from your outfit had the common courtesy to notify me at all. When I found out abut it, it proved to be a pure "trash and bash" site foisted on you by the mental midgets at Bullshido.net, who slam everyone in the martial arts world, including me, most of whom they have never met. They went to great difficulty to "set me up" so they could pretend I committed some infringement on their personal space, they use every dirty debating trick in the book, like demanding proof then refusing to accept it, and are not capable of carrying on an intelligent discussion. They come to my website and bash me every time they get a new account because I have banned hundreds of "sock puppet names" they create to harass me. But, the final straw was them stating in a post giving the names, addresses and phone numbers&lt;/a&gt; of several of my friends so the could be attacked that "two members of Bullshido have reviewed a videotape of a man in the yard at (address withheld) who appears to be the same older man shown as Ashida Kim in this picture (link to an associate website)." Now gentlemen, no matter what you say, that is stalking. It is a crime. I have committed no crime, all I have ever done was defend myself against the scurrilous attacks of a pack of internet trolls. I have come here many times to ask that this entry be removed OR protected. Last time I create an account so I could monitor the entry, your crew just deleted it till now. Then restored it ONLY because I complained about it. I did not come here to "turn the site into a personal endorsement." I come here every time to ask you to remove it. What I get in return is "pass the buck" to this page or that so I must repeat my complaint a thousand times only to have it ignored again. So, here we are doing it all again, doing it your way, by your rules, following your policies. I don't understand why you INSIST on keeping this page up except to harass me and make me waste my time begging you to take it down. Am I so important to you that you must continue this shabby treatment? You guys make a big deal out of Bill Aguair saying I wasn't in the BDFS; even after I showed him my ID card signed by his Grandmaster. BUT, when HE came to my site and demanded, not asked politely as I have done many times to you, that I stop claming to be affiliated with him and that I take down all references to the BDFS, I did it. Simple to keep the peace. Why is it you can't do the same here? Why is it so important that you maintain a page that is repeated vandalized, that I, the subject, do not want up in the first place, and that has now become a source of information used by stalkers to sneak up and attack my friends? See, if we have to fight one of these clowns and kill him, or they us, it won't hurt YOU at all, safely behind your intellectual armor and distanced by the internet. But the families of those involved will pay the emotional price for years. Is that what you want? So, I ask again, as politely and respectfully as I can, please remove the Ashida Kim entry. Now, because some of the moderators on this board have accused me of being an impersonator, so they could ignore my request, my e-mail is given below. I have had this address for twelve years. Everyone on the internet knows how to get in touch with me because the trolls delight in spamming me to death; and you, with this entry, are helping them. --Ashida Kim dojopress@aol.com</p>

<li>If Mr. Kim would state an adequate, appropriate reason why the page on him ought to be deleted, such as that he's insufficiently notable to be worthy of mention here, then I might vote to delete it, but for now, with only his blustery, ranting demands, I feel compelled to vote to <b>Keep</b> just to show that we don't give in to such attempts at bullying. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 16:30, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>. As much as I wouldn't mind seeing the article go away forever, "Kim" is a somewhat notable character in the Western <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-ninja.html" title="Neo-ninja">neo-ninja</a> fantasy martial arts business. He has been selling books detailing his theories on how to murder people secretly through ads in the back of comic books for some 20 years or so now, and is also the subject of much ridicule at the bullshido.com website and others. The user above who signed himself "Ashida Kim" requesting this AfD seems to be the same person who has an account at User:Ashida Kim that he has apparently forgotten how to access. In general, the user does show a consistent pattern of disjointed invective, <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_personal_attacks.html" title="No personal attacks">personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_legal_threats.html" title="No legal threats">legal threats</a> throughout his tenure here, including in the last few days on <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFire_Star_ea51.html" title="User talk:Fire Star">my talk page</a>. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 16:35, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firestar says I forgot how to access my account. I say the account was closed without notrification or permission. When I tried to access it I got a page that said "No User Account Has Been Established." Once again, you demonstrate your prejudice. Then you delete my arguments so only my enemies have a voice.</dd>
<dd>BUT that is irrelevant. DTobias, You ask for "an adequate, appropriate reason why the page on him ought to be deleted." Isn't putting the lives of my friends in danger sufficient? Isn't stalking them in their own homes enough? You claim I've got all this "bluster?" Where is it? I related the facts of the case and BEGGED you to PLEASE Protect or Remove this page, (can't get more humble or defeated than that) and YOU come back with a personal attack against my attitude, which I earned honestly dealing with this same kind of repeated baiting. Breaking your own rules means nothing, eh? And, all of this is for nothing. Because this is your game. To taunt, to split hairs, to hide behind your "policies" and pretend you are important. I'm not that important. You want me to say it so you can publish it to all your troll buddies on the troll web ring, fine. "I'm not that great. Anyone can do what I do if they but know how, and I show them how." Humble enough for ya? Will you take down the entry now? Of course not, because getting attention from me is all you live for, LOL Ashida Kim

<dd>I actually said "apparently forgotten" as I didn't want to assert categorically that you had. The account hasn't been deleted. Even if you were banned it wouldn't be deleted. The following collection of blue, underlined letters are a "link", put your screen's cursor on them on them and right click your mouse: User:Ashida Kim.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There doesn't seem to be anything on this page which could be viewed as endangering anyone's life. No address is provided -- not even a real name. Although the subject of this article may, in fact, be the victim on stalkers, there is nothing in this article which promotes or facilitates such illegal activity. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 17:22, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On further reflection, I will vote to <b>keep</b> this article. Despite the subject's claims, this article demonstrates that Wikipedia's editors are actively pursuing a NPOV and do not tolerate inappropriate information which might contribute to stalking. Most incidents of vandalism to this article seem to have been fixed within an hour of their occurance. If Mr. Kim prefers to remain anonymous, I suggest that he stop publishing books and maintaining his own website. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 22:10, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article's subject is (barely) notable. There <i>are</i> examples of stalker-like edits in the page's histroy, (addresses, phone numbers, etc), given in the page's history, (which page protection won't hide, btw), but this is simple vandalism, and can be quickly corrected. The stalker-ish edits in the history can also be excised from public view, if it is felt to be truly nessesary, but none of this has to do with whether or not the article should be kept. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>( <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Func_6e40.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Func">@</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a>) 17:35, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This person seems to be somewhat notable within the fantasy world inhabited by those who think that a knowledge of eastern martial arts makes them supermen. Even if the complainant really is Ashida Kim, there's no reason to delete an article just because the subject asks us to, as long as the information is accurate. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:32, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Whether the fantasy world that <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> is talking about is notable or not is also a decent debate, but i'll go with the crowd and say that we're just barely past ninjacruft here. Due to the remarkable work of <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a>, this article has gone from a piece of self indulgent tripe into a fairly good article. The real problem with it though isn't the article itself, but Ashida Kim's behavior, which you can see for yourself on this AfD. I used to think it was just humorous posturing, but it really is getting disruptive and I wouldn't be surprised if he eventually gets banned for something. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 23:45, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Try To Stay On Topic.</b> This is not about the information being accurate. Which it isn't. It is about this entry be used to post the names of my friends so they can be attacked. Please pay attention and quit wandering off topic. And quit pretending that this isn't me talking to you. That is just another cheap shot from a bunch of cheap shot experts! Ashida Kim
<ul>
<li>You're the one who's off-topic, since the valid criteria for deletion of an article have nothing to do with people using it to post names of people for stalking -- that, if it happens, is considered vandalism and is dealt with by reverting the particular edits, and/or banning the particular users involved; it says nothing about whether the article they happen to be vandalizing ought to be deleted or not. And, incidentally, I see no signs of any edits within the last few weeks that involve posting anybody's name or address for the purpose of enabling stalking; if such has happened, it must be a long time ago, and not relevant to current deletion or protection discussion. This page is for the discussion of whether the page should be deleted, and is not the appropriate place to report vandalism or stalking. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 21:15, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable pseudo-ninja. Someone notable enough to be a public figure, even of such minor stature as this douchebag, doesn't get to have his article removed just because he doesn't like it. Are there inaccuracies? Note them on the talk page so they can be fixed. (Fixing them yourself--well, we discourage writing and editing articles about yourself.) If the verifiable and accurate information exposes you as a douchebag, you only have yourself to blame. -- <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 21:32, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DELETE</b> There is no proof of any of the claims made against Ashida Kim. Further, the posting of the names and locations of his friends and associates is a direct invasion of privacy that could lead to unfortunate situations for both parties. The truth regarding Mr.Kim is not really known, other than what he has willingly revealed, and so it is in-appropriate to post such claims that are mere assumptions based on little real evidence. Such is the work of biased men who posess narrow minded views regarding a man who has done no harm to anyone and just wishes to be left alone. Please be responsible and remove the article.

<p>Tobias and Phil, If either of you had read the Discussion Page for Ashida Kim you would have seen the names I object to being STILL published. If you had read the first entry in this thread you would have seen me quote Bullshido saying they had taped my friends. THAT is evidence of stalking. The reason you don't see it is because you refuse to look at it. As for you Turnstep, the only reason my diatribes are so long is because guys like you keep making me repeat it all. What you want is for me to get angry so you can tell me how "non-grandmasterly" I am acting. THAT is proof that all of you lot are just trolls looking for attention. There is no justice here. On the one hand you tell me how insignificant I am, and in the next breath compare me to George Bush. Which is it? Either one that makes you silly point because you are lying. Old lawyer trick, "when the facts are on your side, pound on the facts, when the law is on your side pound on the law, when neither the facts nor the law are on your side, pound on the table." That is what you are doing, just making noise to make yourselves heard. I have shown you up for the little pimps you are. If I am so insignificant, why keep me on site? Answer, to harass me. If I am so great as George Bush, why not talk to me and get the truth instead of publishing a bunch of lies and making me waste all this time more than once in a futile effort to change your closed minds? Any sane person can see who is in the right here, and it ain't you guys, LOL --Ashida Kim</p>

<p>On September 6th the entry began "Ashida Kim is the pseudonym of Radford Davis." I have been complaining about it ever since.

<dd>Actually, there isn't that much vandalism compared to some pages. We are generally reluctant to protect pages for extended periods of time so that well meaning editors can have as much of a go as possible at improving them. We'll usually block the vandal instead for ever increasing amounts of time, up to indefinitely, if they insist on continuing. We usually only protect a real article temporarily in special circumstances (hordes of vandals all editing at the same time, usually), and never permanently. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 02:52, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Every time one of my friends comes here to cast a vote for deletion they are blocked and their vote deleted. You say that if a page comes under an edit war you will close it, but whenever anyone tries to edit it you revert and block their IP. You even accuse me of doing it and prevent me from making any more entries on the AfD page. See boys, this is a rigged game. Just like I said it was. You refuse to play by your own rules. So stop pretending you are on some "noble mission" to save the world from mean old Ashida. There is an old Gaelic saying, "Them that don't like us, may God turn their hearts, and if he can't turn their hearts may he turn their ankles so we will know them by their limping."

I say again, look at the votes to keep. Almost all of them are for vindictive reasons, just to aggravate me is the main theme. Can't you see a pattern of abuse here? I ask you again, if I am so insignificant, why do you insist on maintaining this pillory, trash and bash site? Just for meanness. Just because you love to make me waste my time arguing with you when you are as biased as a Congressional committee. You're going to keep on hounding me as long as you can get away with it. But, I am showing everyone who comes to your silly ass site what a prejudiced bunch of punks you are. So just keep it up! --Ashida Kim

<li>I feel this is a worthwhile contribution, as it's a longstanding paper that's been producing daily news for the last 35 years. This is no flash-in-the-pan publication, but an institution that has eeked into national news more than once. Aside from that, the paper is the primary news service for people living in and around Isla Vista, California. It has a daily circulation of 20,000.

<li>From Author, sorry I dont know how to make my own reply to this so i'm adding an edit. Jeremy Nimmo is a hidden legacy and none of his work has been properly released, we are trying to get the word about him out but people like you are hiding it from the public to see, things like this lead to his demise. Please keep the article. Internet publicity is very sparse and you cannot rely on it having all the information, including very small time musicians.

I have no idea what the justification is for articles about utterly routine results of sports contests. Shouldn't this be in Wikinews or something? Thousands of sporting contests are played every day all over the world, but for some reason English cricket matches are considered notable. I think maybe this should be one of the Centralized Discussions and not just individual AfDs. There is absolutely nothing encyclopedic about a report of a minor sporting match. We're not talking about the FA World Cup or even international test matches here. -- <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 18:56, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is becoming seriously annoying. We have had many discussions over this. I can recall five off the top of my head. The end result was "no consensus". I simply cannot believe people are still nominating them. Perhaps they are just ignorant of what has gone before. If so, allow me to summarise. These articles are not going to last forever. Shortly, at the end of the English cricket season, they will be merged into relevant articles. In the meantime, they are being transcluded onto various other pages so we have <i>something</i> on these pages. This accounts for the odd formatting. Thus they will not stand forever as articles in their own right. On the other hand, it's true, it's verifiable. Why delete? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 19:43, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sigh. Perhaps the fact that you are getting lots of AfDs on this matter is a sign you are doing something wrong? The idea of keeping temporary articles on something that are later merged and deleted is definitely non-standard practice. One thing to do is to keep them on temporary pages outside of the main wiki space. I struck out my delete vote, but please think about these things next time. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 20:17, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Maybe it's a sign that what we're (sorry, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> and <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> with our support) doing is controversial and unusual.

<li>Besides, where would we "ask for permission" to do such a thing? It's a wiki. There's no one holy god to ask permission for every single gritty thing we want to do. If we did it on the Village pump, people might argue that "oh, not everyone reads that stuff" and list it on AfD anyway. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 20:50, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really being critical, and definitely IAR, I agree. You can probably avoid all these annoying AfDs from people who aren't up to speed if in the future you put them in a temp space, e.g., User:Sam Korn/Northamptonshire v Somerset 29 June 2005. It is very unusual for articles to be created in the main space with the expectation that they will later be deleted -- hence all the delete votes from people who think it's a permanent article.

If so, sorry for wasting your time. If not, then these articles are valuable in creating the pages on the 2005 English cricket season, since it eases the strain on editors and creates good summary pages from different perspectives, as I have outlined above. Some might come here to see how the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty20_in_England_in_2005_0918.html" title="Twenty20 in England in 2005">Twenty20 Cup</a> went, others would perhaps have an interest in how Somerset's season were.

<ul>
<li>So why these articles weren't transwikied to Wikinews? They'd like them there very much. Problem solved. Cricket fans can do their original reporting and Wikipedia gets free of this POV ridden stuff. Also there was never a consensus on keeping these articles. Ask any Wikipedian not affiliated with cricket what he thinks about it? He'll probably say: original reporting, not suited for Wikipedia. And he'll be right. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 14:54, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, they wouldn't like them very much, because of licensing problems. Unless the writer of the articles (well, ok, me) agreed to license the articles in the public domain. As for "original reporting"? The <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a> is: "The phrase "original research" in this context refers to [...] data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication'". The data it is based on is published in a reputable publication, and even linked to in the article. Of course it has to be rephrased and put it in a new form, otherwise someone would slap a copyvio on the page! As for "ask any Wikipedian not affiliated with cricket what he thinks about it" - that's how TWO successive VfDs have ended in keeps, with many votes from people not even on WP:Cricket? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 15:10, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, with Tony having abandoned the Schoolwatch program as well as his not voting or improving school articles, elementary schools are in great short-term danger on an article-by-article basis.

<li>Bethel Maine is a town of just a little more than 2000 people so it is only important for <i>only</i> 2000 people so its still very non-notable. The elementary school nearby got about 2000 students but that doesn't mean it is still notable. There should be a limit on schools I belive. All High schools and higher should be kept and im willing to expand on it but under that it is Way to much unless it is signifantly expanded in which in this case it won't too small of a school.--<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">Aranda56</a> 19:21, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm amazed at the staggering presumption of people who believe that because something is of no importance to <i>them</i>, personally, <i>now</i>, it is never going to have any significance to anyone, ever.

<dd>I asked you whether it was of importance to you; you didn't answer. I'm amazed at the staggering presumption of people who think they know what future historians and social scientists will care about (our ancestors certainly didn't), and at the gall to assume that Wikipedia must be hijacked to serve the needs of future historians. I'm sure if they want to know about the school system, there's a Department of Education report that gives more useful information then Wikipedia, and that for every school. Personally, I think that future historians might be very intersted in garage bands and what they mean about the role and level of average people as artistic creators, and find it much harder to get their hands on the information. But I don't think that's a hole that Wikipedia is designed to fill.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 12:46, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's a cocktail recipe plus the claimed name of its inventor and some alternative names. The article tells us that this cocktail was invented some three weeks ago. Google turns up nothing, there's nothing by this name in any of my cocktail recipe books, and the article of course cites no sources. As far as Wikipedia goes, this therefore appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> — the promulgation of a new cocktail using Wikipedia.
<p>Wikibooks has a no original research policy as well. (See <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks">What is Wikibooks?</a>.) Although it is (for obvious reasons) a strict one when it comes to educational textbooks, there is little precedent for its application to recipes. Given the problems with this recipe, I haven't transwikified it. Instead, I've left a note on the talk page for the Cocktails section of the <i><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Bartending">Bartending</a></i> wikibook.

<ul>
<li>The article presents itself as a first-hand report, and does not identify a source for the report other than itself, which is what matters, regardless of the nationality of the editor who wrote the text. Another issue, which is verifiability -- articles on Wikipedia need to cite sources; Wikipedia's not the place to put original research, essays, etc -- any major point of views mentioned ultimately need a a source, and things like firsthand reports have a problem here, as well. Wikipedia's role is to document the notable points of view, not to form or describe new opinions about subjects written about in articles, but this article cites no source for the description given, only a stray link to score numbers. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 22:39, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>On the contrary, that link entirely verifies the entire article. It may not be clear to someone who doesn't understand exactly how cricket works, but that isn't our fault.

<ul>
<li>It is verified by the scorecard - they scored 282 runs in the space of 45 overs - which, FYI, is a fairly high score in cricket.

<li>It's true. It's verifiable. It's going to be merged into a bigger article soon enough. What are people's issues with these pages? As for the neutrality thing, anyone is allowed to place their comments on an AfD nomination. It just happens that many of these nominations have happened before, so cricket fans on Wikipedia are used to coming together to deal with this kind of stuff. Neutrality is quite clearly not an issue. If users were neutral, after all, they wouldn't have an opinion to keep or to delete! (I jest, by the way—I know you meant that the above users are biased.)

<li>Disturbing to say the least. If WP:Cricket wants to be taken seriously, I suggest you first lobby for some sort of cricket clause in the official policy. Doing it this way is not improving WP; it's creating an internal CricketPedia without establishing a reasonable consensus.

<li>Nonsense. One of WP's strongest points (and one of the reasons for its great success) is its willingness to accept all information. Consider how we're a great resource for Pokemon information, and info on Star Trek. There's even a Klingon WP! This sort of in depth info is what makes WP great.

<p>This article should be deleted because it is a neologism. That is, the article defines a phrase "fox news liberal", but I find no google results which use use the phrase as a cohesive whole as described in the article. For example, there appear resuts such as "Colmes is the Fox News liberal counterpoint to Hannity". I also find no use of the term desribe someone who is or was not literally on Fox News (whereas the article's point is to describe a phrase which could be applied to those not literally on Fox News). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.127.147.125 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.127.147.125_429a.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.127.147.125">contribs</a>) 04:10, 24 August 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<li><b>Merge with <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democrat_in_Name_Only_732a.html" title="Democrat in Name Only">Democrat in Name Only</a></b>. Article was nominated VFD by someone without an account. While that is not forbidden, it is possible that a political bias could be present. That being said, however, I agree that the article does not appear much on a google search. However, since the article is already referenced at political locations such as <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Fox_News_liberal" class="external text" title="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Fox_News_liberal" rel="nofollow">dKosopedia</a>, it is likely that the term may not be a "neologism", but a term whose use is on the increase. To me, merging with the <a href="../../../d/i/n/DINO_c6f5.html" title="DINO">DINO</a> article seems to be the most sensible course of action.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 04:13, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

That text is also under the GFDL, but Wikipedia's article should cite the source.

<li>Is it copied from dKosopedia? A cursory look that I took made me think this was the older article (though it was a cursory look; I may have erred).

<li><b>Merge with DINO</b>. After looking at the situation surrounding Cindy Sheehan, I agree. There is political bias among the writers. This article is either a <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. It doesn't really matter to me that people have favorable or unfavorable support for our President and anyone in politics. But it would be fair to keep a neutral stance to addressing people.

<p>This is very cleanly done, but it doesn't seem to be, well, to be <i>saying</i> very much. There are trees in various mythologies, yes, but the fact that they're <i>deciduous</i> trees doesn't really play a part. If it grows Magical Apples, then the relevant part is that it's an Apple tree, not that apple trees are deciduous. Also, maybe it's part of the magic/religiosity/whatever that this particular tree <i>isn't</i> deciduous? Unless the story specifies, we can't know either way. It'd be like assessing the blood types of mythological figures based on the predominant blood types of the ethnic groups in which the mythologies arose. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 13:58, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would agree to a merge except that I think the information here is very off-base. Since this is an AfD, shouldn't the discussion be centred around whether the information is useful, relevant or accurate? I think this should be <b>deleted</b> because it implies a connection (deciduous) that is simply wrong. True, the trees may be deciduous, but that is not why the cultures mythologised or iconicised them and this suggests otherwise.

<li><b>Keep</b>, sigh. This is an extremely current term in the blogosphere and has been around for a long time, at least since 2000. Note that the article is not "Wikipedia's list of Republicans who are not true Republicans". RINO (and DINO) are common terms on the respective blogs like Redstate and the Dailykos -- not to mention the various TV shows and action groups that have also used these exact phrases and are listed in the article.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I've seen this term in use in the partisan press, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Events_c196.html" title="Human Events">Human Events</a> for instance.

<li>But it's just a standard phrase applied to the two major political parties. I don't even see it a set term, let alone as an article.

<ul>
<li>IMO, one reasonable test that both these articles pass is that they would be recognized as acronyms: "RINO"/"DINO". There are lots of articles that could be termed "standard phrases" used for POV ends -- e.g., <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation.html" title="Strategic lawsuit against public participation">Strategic lawsuit against public participation</a>. Nobody would use "CINO" and expect to be understood.

<ul>
<li>If you search Google, you'll find a few instances of "LINO"; "labor in name only", so I don't buy that argument. An acronym does not make it unique. I can't comment on the legal article, since I don't know how common the term actually it is. But both the phrase and the entire concept is too common to deserve its own article. This just smacks of US-centrism to me. The goal of the article is also very diffuse and inherently problematic; what defines a Republican in the first place? Is it the party program? The stereotype? Their actions vs. their opinions? This is too slippery an issue for an encyclopedia to be dealing with. If you keep it, people will just keep adding "putative" persons to the list. It wouldn't surprise me if most of Congress winds up there sooner or later. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 09:14, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just to be clear, again, wikipedia is <i>not</i> deciding who is or is not a "RINO"; it is reporting on who has been specifically called that by various pressure groups or partisan journalists. "LINO" may or may not be current (I doubt it) but if LINO starts showing up in press releases from left-wing British pressure groups and in columns by political figures, then by all means we should include it. It doesn't matter if all of Congress eventually gets included -- that would be a fantastically useful list, since the entries would be accompanied by links to the press coverage in question. There are plenty of articles that are prone to people adding "putative" members, but we have ways to deal with vandalism and content disputes. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 18:34, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that's sooo useless. What's the point of having an article on a term if it turns out to be more or less all-encompassing? That means that Wikipedia "decides" that no Republican is a "real Republican", which is utterly useless to any reader. The article is not going to be taken seriously here. It's going to be a battleground for US party political nonsense. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 06:52, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a term that is in general use, and what is the point of Wikipedia if it can't be used to find out what a term like this means? I came across this article looking for an easy reference to point someone to in a comment on my own blog as an explanation for the term RINO. This isn't just a blogosphere coinage - the citations at the end of the entry show that the term has wider currency in the mainstream media.<br />
<br />
That said, the article badly needs editing: it only needs a short summary of what the term means, citations showing its use over the years, etc. I don't see how a long list of "examples of" helps anybody, and the caption to the Giuliani/Powell photograph ("Rudy Giuliani and Colin Powell are widely popular with the American people...") doesn't seem very encyclopedia-ish. --John H 13:56, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Even if I discount Joaquin Murietta as they'd only been here one day, and lump all the deletes and merges together, I'm still not satisified there is a consensus on what to do. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:29, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am reopening this poll because it was closed prematurely, before everyone with an opinion about this matter has expressed his/her views. As such, there is no consensus on whether this article should be kept or deleted. Nor do I think that the situation has been sufficiently explained. Here are three reasons why this article should be deleted:
<ol>
<li>Precedents. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcelles_6733.html" title="User:Sarcelles">Sarcelles</a> has previously created 4 similar articles: Changchun Public Security Bureau, Tangshan Public Security Bureau, Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau, Lu'an Public Security Bureau. None of those survived VfD, because they were deemed non-notable and POV. It makes little sense for this to be kept.</li>
<li>POV. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcelles_6733.html" title="User:Sarcelles">Sarcelles</a> has a history of starting purely POV articles for the sake of pushing his agenda. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Chinese_cities_da9a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Chinese cities">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Chinese cities</a> for a detailed account of his actions starting from mid-May. Three Wikipedians (<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">User:Abstrakt</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html" title="User:Miborovsky">User:Miborovsky</a>, and I) are currently considering an RfC or even RfA against him if the situation does not improve quickly, because we are sick and tired of chasing after literally hundreds of his edits, de-POVizing when we can and VfD'ing when his creations are unsalvageable. This article is an example of that.</li>
<li>Non-notable. There are 300+ prefectures or equivalents in China, Bengbu being one of them. Bengbu itself is an unremarkable city in Anhui province. Its public security bureau is, in turn, one of dozens of bureaus in its bureaucracy. There is absolutely nothing sufficiently remarkable about it to warrant an article at this point in time. The same goes for the other 4 articles that were already deleted.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>As such, this article should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 02:46, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I saw Sarcelles Falun Gong pushing articles earlier. Should be deleted. It's not like its as notable as a primary school is it? Maybe it should be in mentioned or listified in some sort of Police Hierarchy in China article - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 02:59, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. nonnotable. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 03:01, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Should be merged into a bigger article until it needs breaking out, but none of the reasons given here for not even mentioning it is actually compelling. Number of entities is absolutely not a good criterion for deletion. There are how many species on this planet? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:08, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Where should this article be merged to? Which sentence of this article, except the last one, even provides unique and encyclopedic information? The police department of Bengbu is located in Bengbu, and is in charge of the polic there... and it has detention centers! The last sentence is unique and encyclopedic, but there's already an article on the dissident; we don't need a 2nd article just to say who detained him.</dd>
<dd>As such, there isn't even anything here to merge into any other articles. This article should be deleted outright. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 05:25, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Honestly there is little information other than the location and that it is a government office handling policing. Until I can see a better reason for keeping this article, my vote is unchanged. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">Abstrakt</a></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, since we can say something specific about this particular PSB. Anyone researching it would not appreciate being redirected to <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhang_Lin_426c.html" title="Zhang Lin">Zhang Lin</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:42, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I could also say something about my neighbourhood police kiosk, how it arrested 2 students for drinking and driving... Notable? I think not. The chance of someone researching is, as much as the chance that someone would be researching the above-stated kiosk. --<a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html" title="User:Miborovsky">Mib</a><a href="../../../m/i/b/User_talk%7EMiborovsky_4d3c.html" title="User talk:Miborovsky">orovsky</a> <a href="../../../n/a/m/Image%7ENamechop.jpg_9903.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/4/40/Namechop.jpg/20px-Namechop.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../n/a/m/Image%7ENamechop.jpg_9903.html" /></a> 07:31, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think a prefecture branch of the PSB bears any comparison to a local police kiosk, nor does arresting an internationally known dissent compare with arresting students for drinking and driving. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Well how an internationally known athlete? How about I start an article on the police station whose officers arrested Micheal Phelps for drunk driving?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If you are an <b>expert</b> than feel free to give us tips on how to expand. Like <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html" title="User:Miborovsky">Mib</a> have already pointed out, there isn't anything else in this article to expand upon. And I'm opposed to the idea of merging this information into the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengbu.html" title="Bengbu">Bengbu</a> article because that would be doing what <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcelles_6733.html" title="User:Sarcelles">Sarcelles</a> once did, and that was making assinine edits on Chinese city article to make the main focus about prisons and police. <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">Abstrakt</a> 14:21, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>Anyone researching it would not appreciate being redirected to <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhang_Lin_426c.html" title="Zhang Lin">Zhang Lin</a>.</i> — Then this researcher would find out <i>absolutely no new info</i> about the Bengbu PSB from this article.</dd>
<dd>Look, if you guys want to start a WikiProject to describe every single bureau of every single prefecture and county in China (~50 x ~5000 = 250000 new articles), then please go ahead. If I can start, say, Hulan County Forestry Department or Haidong Prefecture Education Bureau, and write a useless subsubstub article that goes "The Haidong Prefecture Education Bureau is located in Haidong, <a href="../../../q/i/n/Qinghai.html" title="Qinghai">Qinghai</a>, and is in charge of education there. [end]", and get away with it, then please keep this article too. But until you decide to do that, this article should be deleted. Unless, of course, if you support Sarcelles' agenda of POV-pushing that he has engaged in for over four months. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 17:46, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Leave it</b>. I come from the same community as Cameron Allan and have been fortunate enough to meet him a few times. Throughout much of New Zealand his accomplishments as Head Student and Student Representative on the Board of Trustees are held in great esteem. I know the author of the article, a young writer Thomas Anderson, who is by all accounts a fair and unbiased writer. On a world scale Allan may not be "notable” but in New Zealand, particularly in the Horowhenua, he is held in the highest regard. <i>(Unsigned comment by 60.234.149.114; IP's first wikipedia contribution)</i>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is about Classical Music, not Pop Music. You can find information about "Juan Manuel Abras" through looking at specialized and renown international Classical Music databases (notability is required form being there; not "everybody" is listed) like the Music Infomation Center Austria (MICA) or the Gaudeamus Foundation Contemporary Music Center. Therefore, why shouldn't you be able to find such information through looking at Wikipedia? Of course the article is worth of keeping! I would encourage users like ESkog, Dottore So and Zoe (see previous posts) not to comment topics that are outside their field of knowledge,instead of posting erratic opinions on serious matters like Classical Music.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Kurt Weber and Zotrix. You are right, Blackcap: besides the article's style, it's the biography itself that establishes notability. However, you must be versed in classical music (prizes he was awarded, institutions he studied at, teachers he studied with, etc.) to notice it properly. Check the listed specialized pages for some clues.

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Peter's point. Such attractions, if notable enough to be memorialised after they shut down, should be mentioned in the context of their location.

<li>Note that I'm voting delete on this. Obviously it shouldn't be kept, I'm just saying that it can't be speedied.
