<li><b>Delete</b> (but do not speedy-delete). Non-noteworthy protologism, only 6 or 7 Google hits.

<li><b>Comment <i>still</i> Delete</b> I took another read of the article and find no improvement. The explanation(s) offered on the article's talk page indicates that this is simply a slang expression thus should be <b>Deleted</b> as a slang <i>dicdef</i>. There are indeed religio-cultural aspects in some manifestations of mental illness or anti-social behavior but this "phrase" is not the appropriate object for an article about such disorders. I disagree, however, with the person who claims this is a "personal attack against Christianity." It's actually too poorly formulated to be much of anything at this point. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 22:40, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that generally there isn't a problem with jewish creation scientists harassing the scientific establishment with anti-intellectualist rhetoric, or jewish evangelists harassing college students to the point of tears and then justifying their unjust actions by saying its because god told them to do so. I will go on to say that there are a number of wikipedia articles that include popular "slang" that are not up for deletion.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolidusspriggan_50b5.html" title="User:Solidusspriggan">Solidusspriggan</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESolidusspriggan_e01e.html" title="User talk:Solidusspriggan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Solidusspriggan_429b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Solidusspriggan">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd><b>Reply</b> There may well be other WP articles that are also nothing more than slang definitions: post them for deletion. We can't vote on them till we see them. Your concerns about christofascists or "christ psychotics" may be better described in a different article. This one, being merely definitional, unsourced, and unverifiable original research simply does not satisfy the minimal requirements for inclusion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 23:02, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So in other words, you believe that this term is justified for inclusion in Wikipedia because of the actions of certain factions of the Christian religion? Might as well claim we need more articles portraying the KKK in a positive light because some criminals are black. Also, the usage of Christian Psychosis in that sense is not one based on psychological research, but rather anti-religious bias. Folks, I think we may have a POV pusher here. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 22:58, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is not an issue of free speech but of verifiability issues arising from what appears to be nothing other than a slang dictionary definition. I am an absolutist when it comes to defending free speech but this "article" simply belongs elsewhere. I acknowledge that the motivation for some or even many delete votes may well be simple knee-jerk hostility to anything seen as a negative opinion of any part of so-called Christianity. But motivation is not what counts here, what counts is whether the article meets minimal standards for inclusion and it does not. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 00:16, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b> This article is ostensibly justified as not being an attack on Christianity because it is NOT a political article but rather a psychological one. A justification under free speech (which technically does not apply on Wikipedia to begin with, hence why we are allowed to delete any articles whatsoever) would imply that it was a POV article, and deletable for that in addition to non-notability. Wikipedia is not for opinion pieces, that's what blog sites are for. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 00:18, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Suggestion to those who want it kept.</b> Rewrite the article under the title Religious psychosis, add more citations, and emphasize the psychological aspect. It should then be able to pass both NPOV and notability. That should eliminate the apparent bias in the title, and in that way keep you from having reactive christians jumping on the article. If you can't find the citations, then it fails notability regardless. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 00:37, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The term, per the article may have originated at a particular website, so it is a neologism.

<p><b>Comment</b>This article is vastly different. This is an article that outlines a psychological term. There is a specific islam-judeo-christian idea of faith that drives people to do things that a rational thinker would not do. This is often accompanied by psychological afflictions such as temporal lobe epilepsy or schizophrenia. While the term schizophrenic is a medical/psychological phrase, many times it is used to refer to someone's outlandish behavior by the general public or laymen, sometimes derivitives like "schizo" and the like are used, that does not invalidate the term schizophrenic itself. The same is true for christ psychosis. To rename this religion psychosis would no longer exemplify the idea that is central to the article, that of faith as laid out in the book of hebrews and the consequences on the mind of holding that belief. I feel those that are moving to have this article deleted are greatly unaware of the reality of the situation. I recommend reading <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viruses_of_the_Mind_a623.html" title="Viruses of the Mind">Viruses of the Mind</a> and watching Richard Dawkins' documentary: The Root of all Evil? and reading up on modern neuropsychology (and its relationship to archaic freudian psychology) before passing judgement, anything else would be a highly uninformed judgement and a promotion of ignorance and democratic 'truth' on wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> The unsigned remarks by <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolidusspriggan_50b5.html" title="User:Solidusspriggan">Solidusspriggan</a> re Dawkins are not relevant to this discussion and the statement that the article is about an actual medical diagnosis or term is simply and completely wrong. Solidusspriggan either has not read the above comments, has not understood them, or is actively supporting the maintenance of a page that spreads false information that was deliberately fabricated for placement on WP. This article constitutes <font color="red">gross abuse of Wikipedia</font> and should not be permitted to remain. I would urge the admins to take a look at the creators and contributors to the article to determine if it is appropriate to ban or impose sanctions for such willful behavior. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 23:03, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Counter.</b> The idea that usage as a "layman's medical term", which is itself an oxymoron, qualifies it as an encyclopedic usage is no more true of calling christians psychotic than it would be calling homosexuals psychotic. Even then, since hate organizations which are notable in their own right, such as the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westboro_Baptist_Church_20ea.html" title="Westboro Baptist Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a>, use such rhetoric, a hypothetical article on the term homosexual psychosis might be notable as a propoganda term <i>within context</i>, while this is not. Additionally, Wikipedia does not exist to make value judgments, merely cite the judgments of other official organizations. Further, Solidus's insistence that this term must be written about under the name Christian psychosis rather than religious shows that his interest is solely in the defamation of the Christian faith, <i>not</i> the inclusion of a psychological theory. His final appeal to keep the article "for the sake of truth" is simply a disguised form of the statement "but Christians really are psychos!", an opinion that is no more permissable in an encyclopedia seeking to maintain the NPOV than the sentiment that brands all Muslims as terrorists. Do not let a few POV pushing antitheist zealots undermine the wiki system. Thank you, and may reason prevail. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 05:57, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>I don't see anything as "layman medical term". I contend that your homosexual example is flawed, there is a perfectly sound darwinian explanation for homosexuality and for the ability of religious belief, however there is no Darwinian explanation for christianity itself. Beyond that, "faith" that is referred to here is something unique to the judeo-christian-islam religions. Buddhists, Hindus, Janists, etc do not have this same concept of faith. The Freudian citation is sound, the Freudian idea is almost wholly focused on christianity and Western relgion in general. The "faith" referred to in this article is that which as solidus said is laid out in the book of Hebrews: "Faith is evidence for things unseen" This statement in itself claims that the very act of believing makes something real. Well I believe everyone above voted to keep this article....OH IT DID'T CHANGE. I must be crazy! Sounds like all those voting to delete are the biased, attacking, and hypocritical ones. Solidus is the only one here with any sense. (as is the guy that said "keep for the sake of free speech" to delete this article would be a grave mistake and an example of the bias and innaccuracy wikipedia is criticized for. Because some sensitive religionists didn't want a compound word that could possibly imply there was something wrong with the people like <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Robertson_25ef.html" title="Pat Robertson">Pat Robertson</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_Bin_Laden_e170.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a> because of either their religious convictions motivated them or justify their actions. To oppose this article is to support terrorism and genocide as well as suppress knowledge. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeSears_c50c.html" title="User:GeorgeSears">GeorgeSears</a> 13:50, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Insults don't help your cause and the rest of your argument indicates you haven't read or haven't understood the above discussion. Wikipedia is not a place for the creation or popularization of invented terms that have been created for the express purpose of propogating themselves through WP. The article is a bad faith abuse of WP. The supposed term has no existence outside of the article. "Free speech", as Tjstrf has clearly stated above, is not a legitimate argument here because POV articles are against WP policy and WP is not obligated to host every proposed article. There are bulletin boards, usenet, and blogs for those types of things. But I suspect you already know that and are simply looking for an argument. The article is bogus and needs to go. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 19:54, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Reply.</b> Read my post reasonably and reply in a non-reactive manner, and then I might consider it worthy of a response. If your pet theory being attacked online makes you that angry, you shouldn't even be on the Wikipedia. For a completely different argument, this term and its article are provably both invented and written by the same forum, making it fail the vanity test. And not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but has anyone considered checking this page for sockpuppet accounts yet? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 21:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not at all invented by any particular forum, anyone that believes that is mistaken. This term has been around for decades and the fact that many people here that are unaware of its usage are only giving more evidence for why it should be included, I say, If everyone tried to delete every article that they knew nothing about wikipedia would be a barren place. Ignorance does not necessitate deletion. Has anyone considered checking this page for sockpuppet accounts yet? It seems the "delete" votes all have the same thing to say, and they say it over and over again, and they still make no valid point.<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolidusspriggan_50b5.html" title="User:Solidusspriggan">Solidusspriggan</a> 23:36, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply.</b> A term that has been around for decades garners only <b>8 hits</b> on Google and 6 of those are from the originator, calpurnpiso, of the TRA forums or from other TRA members who learned if from him.

<dd><b>Response</b> I say we wait just a bit longer and see. The subject matter shouldn't be an issue, it just needs to be presented in a more neutral manner than it currently is. If the author can re-word the article to be less of a POV, and cite more significant research on the matter, then I think it would be a fair enough branch-off of religious psychology. If it remains in its current state, however, then I can understand a deletion. grendale 16:28, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<b>keep</b> Firstly I must say that to discredit someone just because it is there first edit is highly irrational. If it were done to everyone who made their first edit I imagine very little would ever be written. This user obviously has some concern for the terrible and unbalanced attack on such a presently appropriate article, with the rise of fundamentalism and all, a terrible thing to delete.129.15.127.254</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> First, the poster was not "discredited" unless you believe that by being "revealed" as having a previously un-used ID is some sort of insult. Second, it is <i>not</i> irrational to note a poster's prior history of contributions. Third, you have no idea whether the poster has any concern about anything, you have only seen that a post has been made. Fourth, the rise of fundamentalism is not the issue under discussion. Fifth, nominations for deletion are not conducted by "vote". Sixth, it is an easy thing to convince others to attempt to "stuff the vote" on WP, even though the votes are not actually counted or binding. Seventh, because deletion requests are not made by popular vote but by reasoned analysis following sufficient discussion, it is helpful in considering how much weight to give to some comments to be able to compare the poster's history re reasonability and quality of prior contributions. Eighth, the ISP identifier for the above comment (129.15.127.254) is a shared one on a college campus so it is imposible to determine a more specific identity but the user's talk page has a number of warning templates indicative of an account which has been used in the past by those with a tendency to disregard WP ethics and courtesies. Ninth, it is the practice of these sorts of discussions to discount the comments of first time posters. Tenth, the article was created in bad faith in a deliberate attempt to misuse Wikipedia and that bad faith alone is sufficient to warrant deletion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 03:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As a general policy, a first edit should NEVER be on a VfD page. Also, since Wikipedia does not exist to promote or counteract any social agenda, (except that of collaboration and freedom, if those can be considered "agendas") an article whose existance was primarily for the sake of "curbing the rising tide of" <i>anything</i> should be deleted or rewritten as soon as feasibly possible, since such an article would be a misuse of Wikipedia for personal activism. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 04:51, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
