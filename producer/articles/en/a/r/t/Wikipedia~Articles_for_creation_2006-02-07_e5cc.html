<p>Tennis is an awesome game. It was created in the 12th century by some nobles in France. They played with hands at first instead of raquets and tennis balls. The nets were made of angora and therer was no such thing as a foot fault. In the vietnam war, many children over in vietnam played with broom handles instead of raquets. They became super-consistent because they had to have wonderful technique or they would hit the balls out or in the net. When the children moved to the United States, they became super-champion plus players because of their skills. they eventually went on to be a few of the pros of today. They are extremely successful because of their childhood days. In 1876, USA had their first court built. The major tournament today are played in USA, France, Australia, and England.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-07_e5cc.html" title="Edit section: Shaykh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shaykh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee</span></h2>
<p><b>Shaykh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee</b> was born into a poor family in the city of Ashkodera, what was then the capital of Albania in the year 1332 A.H./1914 C.E.. His father, al-Haaj Nooh Najjaatee al-Albaanee, had completed Sharee'ah studies in Istanbul and returned to Albania a scholar. After Albania was taken over by atheism the family made Hijrah to Damascus. In Damascus, Shaykh al-Albaanee completed His early education, and was then taught the Qur.aan, Tajweed, sciences of Arabic language, fiqh of the Hanafee madhab and further branches of the Deen by various Shaykhs and friends of His father. Shaykh al-Albaanee also learned from His father the art of clock and watch repair, and became both highly skilled and famous for His abilities in His tradework. He began to specialize in the field of Hadeeth and its related sciences by the age of 20, being influenced by articles in al-Manaar magazine. He began work in this field by transcribing al-Haafiz al-Iraaqee's monumental "al­Mughnee 'an-hamlil-Asfaar fil-Asfaar fee takhreej maa fil-lhyaa minal-Akhbaar," and added His own notes to it. Shaykh al-Albaanee delved further into the field of Hadeeth and its various sciences despite discourage­ment from His father. The books he needed were not to available from His father's library which was composed mainly of various works of Hanafee Fiqh. Since he could not afford many of the books he required he would borrow them from the famous library of Damascus - "al-Maktabah adth-Dthaahiriyyah" or sometimes from book sellers. He became engrossed with the science of Hadeeth to the extent that he would sometimes close up His shop and remain in the library for up to twelve hours - breaking off His work only for prayer - and would not even leave to eat, preferring to instead take two light snacks with him during these sessions. Eventually the library authorities granted him a special room for His studies, and His own key for access to the library before normal opening time. Often he would remain at work from early morning until after 'Ishaa. During this time he produced many useful works - many of which have yet to be printed. The Shaykh faced much opposition in His efforts to promote Tawheed and the Sunnah, but he bore this with patient perseverance. He was encouraged by some of the noble Shaykhs of Damascus who urged him to continue, amongst them Shaykh Bahjatul Bayjaar, Shaykh 'Abdul-Fattaah -the imam, and Towfeeq al-Barzah-rahimahumullaah. After some time he started giving two weekly classes attended by students of knowledge and university teachers in which he taught various books of 'Aqeedah, Fiqh, Usool and Hadeeth sciences. He also began organised monthly journeys for Da'wah to the various cities of Syria and then Jordan. After a number of His works appeared in print the Shaykh was chosen to teach Hadeeth in the new University in Madeenah, Saudi Arabia, for three years from 1381 to 1383H where he was also a member of the University board. After this he returned to His former studies and work in "al-Maktabah adth-Dthaahiriyyah" leaving His shop in the hands of one of His brothers. He visited various countries for Da'wah and lectures - amongst them Qatar, Egypt, Kuwait, the Emirates, Spain and England. He was forced to emigrate a number of times moving from Syria to Jordan, then Syria again, then Beirut, then the Emirates, then again to 'Ammaan, Jordan. His works - mainly in the field of Hadeeth and its sciences number over 100. His students are many and include many Shaykhs of the present day amongst them: Shaykh Hamdee Abdul-Majeed, Shaykh Muhammad Eed Abbaasee, Dr. Umar Sulaymaan al-Ashqar, Shaykh Muhammad lbraheem Shaqrah, Shaykh Muqbil ibn Haadee al-Waadi'ee, Shaykh Alee Khushshaan, Shaykh Muhammad Jameel Zaynoo, Shaykh Abdur-Rahmaan Abdus-Samad, Shaykh Alee Hasan Abdul-Hameed al-Halabee, Shaykh Saleem al-Hilaalee. The Shaykh passed away on Saturday 22 Jumaadaa ath-Thaaniyah 1420 A.H. / 2 October 1999 C.E. He was 87 years of age.</p>

74.32.8.80 03:25, 6 February 2006 (UTC) Bidoun is the name used to describe the stateless people of Kuwait.It is a group of people mostly of Arab nommad orgins and a minority of persian origins who migrated to Kuwait in the second half of the twentieth century. Like the Kuwaiti society, most of the Bidoun migrated to Kuwait from Saudi Arabic, Iraq, and Iran. This practice of migration was very common in Arabi at that time as borders were not set up. Most of the bidoun consider themselved natives of Kuwait and majority has been living there for more than 50 years and in 1950's and 1960's they were counted as Kuwaiti in the census of Kuwait. However, in 1980's the Kuwaiti government introduced drastic measures by preventing them from getting jobs in public and private sectors and considering them as illegal immigrants. Untill now, second and third generation Bidoun(who were born in Kuwait) are deprived from basic rights, such as the right to be educated, free public health, the right to travel (by not allowing them to obtain Kuwaiti passports), or obtaining driving license,or any I.D cards. These drastic measures have been constantly criticised by internation human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International. The people of Bidoun consider themselves an intrinsic part of the Kuwaiti society and despite these harsh measures, they did not protest publicly or violently.In the last six years many children born to Bidoun Kuwaiti were not given birth certificates and are still not allowed to attend free public schools. The Government established a charitable organisation to fund the education of the stateless people in private Arabic schools and this was commended by some human rights organisations. The Government's unwillingness to put an end to the suffering of the Bidoun of Kuwait has been met with severe criticism inside and outside Kuwait. The current government led by the new Emir Sheikh Subah Al-Ahmad and the prime minister Sheikh Nasser Al Mohammad has expressed its intention to tackle this complicated problem by trying to grant citizenship to those who have been living in Kuwait since 1965 and treating the rest of the Bidoun according in a more human manner by giving I.D's that will allow them to be given a lawful status in order to get basic services as us health and education.</p>

<p>Infamous videogames forum created after Edge magazine’s own forum originally disbanded in debacle in 2003.</p>
<p>The forum consists of industry luminaries, developers, journalists, and unemployed gamers alike, and maintains a focus on intelligent games discussion despite having many folders focused on music, TV, and the rather random ‘Off Topic.’</p>
<p>Now in its third year, Rllmuk is home to many informal cliques, sayings, and renowned members, and is notoriously hard for newcomers to fully assimilate into the community. However, despite almost continuous confrontation on some level, community spirit is high, illustrated when members donated over £1,440 to aid a fellow member who had been attacked and robbed in his own home.</p>
<p>Despite the fact the Edge forum has since reappeared, Rllmuk remains ever popular, consistently being one of the most active videogames forums on the internet. <a name="Sources_29" id="Sources_29"></a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-07_e5cc.html" title="Edit section: Conservation of Cultural Objects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conservation of Cultural Objects</span></h2>
<p>“All actions aimed at the safeguarding of cultural property for the future. The purpose of conservation is to study, record, retain and restore the culturally significant qualities of the object with the least possible intervention.” (CAC/CAPC, Code of Ethics for Conservation)</p>
<p>The conservation of material culture exists within the larger framework of preservation of the natural heritage. Like natural heritage conservation, the museum discipline encourages preservation through both preventive measures and active intervention. In effect, objects of heritage value are either preserved by control of their environment, or they are actively treated with a wide range of technical methods. The active intervention the general reader encounters in such treatments as Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel Ceiling or Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper is usually thought of as ‘restoration’, and this is how it has been known for centuries. The term conservation in this context is unique to English. In most European languages restoration is used universally to denote the process of treating objects, whether the aim is to stabilize them or to return them to a previous state. In English there is a divergence where the fields of conservation and restoration continue as distinct entities, both technically and socially. The International Council of Museums has attempted to redress this problem with the creation of the hybrid term ‘conservator/restorer’ in its English language documents.</p>
<p>The concept of conservation in referring specifically to the preservation of material culture first occurs in the 19th century. For example, in a memorandum presented to the meeting of the London Society of Antiquaries in 1855, the issue of the destructive and misleading character of architectural restoration is raised, stating that “A monument restored is frequently a monument destroyed”. In defining the word restoration “In the sense of preservation from further injuries by time or negligence” the authors of the memorandum have produced a nascent definition of conservation. The memorandum also mentions the institution of a “Conservation Fund”, an early occurrence of the word conservation in this context.</p>
<p>The practical discipline that came to be called conservation developed from the late 18th century and into the 19th century with the aim of preserving significant objects from the effects of time and negligence. This represented a new direction in the care of collections; a thrust towards understanding and combating deterioration through technical investigations into its cause, and later into the processes of treatment and their impact upon objects. This development must be viewed within the larger historical context of industrial and technical development, the reassessment of history, and political and social revolutions.</p>
<p>Ever since people have been collecting treasures and personal mementoes they have also taken measures to preserve them. Restorers have been employed for centuries by rich patrons – such as merchants, kings, and popes – but it was only in the 19th century that the causes of deterioration became of interest. Archaeology provided enormous impetus. The Iron and Bronze ages of Europe and the Classic Middle East yielded to the trowel and the pickaxe. Objects removed from their safe beds of soil, sand and clay would sometimes deteriorate dramatically. Why was this happening and what could be done to stop it? Restorers couldn’t answer these questions. Chemical investigations were made, and slowly but surely the mysterious processes of dissolution and decay became understood and controlled. This represented a new direction in the care of collections; a thrust towards understanding and combating deterioration through technical investigations into its cause, and later into the processes of treatment and their impact upon objects.</p>
<p>The research of Michael Faraday provides a key to attitudes during this period of change and development. Although he is best known for his work on electricity (the unit if capacitance, the farad, bears his name), his 1843 study, On the Ventilation of Gas Burners, is a key document in conservation science. He determined by the scientific method that the ‘red-rot’ deterioration observed on book leathers in the Library of the Athenaeum Club resulted from attack by atmospheric sulphur dioxide emanating from the newly installed gas lighting. It is a pioneering example of science applied to the study of deterioration.</p>
<p>Friedrich Rathgen’s experimental work on archaeological artifacts in the last decade of the 19th century at the Chemical Laboratory of the Royal Museums of Berlin stimulated the investigation and elucidation of deterioration processes. This work was translated into English in 1905, and had a significant influence on scientific work at the British Museum. The identification and characterization of deterioration on museum objects stored underground during the First World War provided the museum preservation discipline with a further underpinning of scientific investigation. In particular, the work conducted at the British Museum in the 1920s by Alexander Scott of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, leads into the modern era.</p>
<p>A conference in Rome, organized by the League of Nations in 1930, was the first venue for the discussion of the need for control of the museum environment, and other preventive measures aimed at ensuring the longevity of collections. This conference is generally regarded as the first international effort to place scientific research at the centre of the preservation of art works and antiquities.</p>
<p>The discipline of preservation of museum objects grew rapidly in England in the period after the Second World War as a result of experimental studies, and through the scientific reassessment of the effects of deterioration and subsequent restorative treatment. The inauguration of the journal Studies in Conservation in October of 1952, and the re-issue in much enhanced form of Harold Plenderleith’s The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art in 1956 signalled published legitimization of the term conservation as applied to the study and arrest of deterioration in works of art and artifacts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, systematic abstraction of technical papers had commenced with Technical Studies in the Field of Fine Arts, produced by the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University from 1932-42, and continued with Abstracts of Technical Studies in Art and Archaeology, produced by the Freer Gallery of Art between 1943 and 1952. It continues today with Art and Archaeology Technical Abstracts, produced by the International Institute for Conservation in association with the Getty Conservation Institute.</p>
<p>Regulation of ethical and professional practices was first outlined in the Murray Pease Report, which was adopted in 1963 by the American Group of the International Institute for Conservation. This became its published code of ethics in 1968, and organizations in many other countries followed this lead in producing codes for their own practitioners. By the creation and encoding of its own terminology, ethics, standards and literature the profession of conservation had distanced itself from the working class, largely oral tradition of restoration from which it had developed. Technical studies of works of art and treasured objects brought restoration from traditional working-class artisanship into the realm of science.</p>
<p>Both preventive and remedial techniques have advanced rapidly and heritage institutions such as museums, archives and art galleries control deterioration caused by such environmental factors as temperature, humidity, light, airborne contaminants and biological activity. They also deal systematically with all human aspects of handling, cleaning, storage, exhibition and transportation. The well-endowed institutions have conservation departments where both preventive measures and active laboratory treatment are conducted. Many nations support the less well fortunate institutions by providing government-supported conservation services.</p>
<p>Conservators must always strive to respect the material and objective reality of historic objects and works of art while still respecting the aesthetic values that they embody in stories, experience, usage and the passage of time. Active conservation treatment is often a tightrope between doing too little and doing too much.</p>
<p>“It is the responsibility of the conservator, acting alone or with others, to strive constantly to maintain a balance between the need of society to use a cultural property, and the preservation of that property.” (CAC/CAPC Code of Ethic for Conservation)</p>

<p>Teaming, or team teaching, i an educational approach where groups of two to four teachers are responsible throughout the school day for the core instruction of a group of about 150 to 175 students in both presentation and grading. They may interact in front of the class, discussing specific topics from divergent perspectives or take turns presenting material appropriate to their individual areas of specialization. This arrangement is supposed to facilitate collaborative planning among the teachers, promote the development of inter-disciplinary curricula and enable the teachers to work together over time to identify and respond to the strengths and weaknesses of individual students. Teaming also allows teachers to better cover the broad curriculum presented, especially, to middle schools and allows teachers to build upon their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. It requires a great deal of hard work and the personalities and philosophies of the team members have to mesh. They have to be committed to planning lessons jointly, and to engaging in deep discussions about how to best meet students' academic and developmental needs.</p>

<p>Gjorgji Gjeorgjievski is a very promising DJ playing some of the greatest trance progressive anthems and hits.</p>
<p>Since he was 14, he started to swim in the "trance" ocean. Beginning with some old-skul dance and euro-dance songs his style has changed over the years. Paul Van Dyk, Tiesto, Faithless, Oakenfold, Armin Van Buuren and others had a great influence on his musical tastes. Visiting some of their live performances, Gjorgji's preferences switched from dance to progressive trance.</p>
<p>Gjorgji currently is an undergraduate at Yale University, one of the best World's Universities, where he often organizes parties and spins trance hits and anthems.</p>
<p>His dream is to play music at some of the greatest electronic dance music festivals, such as Sensation, Trance Energy, as well to spin in one of the clubs on The Island (Ibiza).</p>

<p>A Spandage is an elastic type of bandage used on massive wounds and at the site of limb amputation where the prosthetic limb joins the body. Spandages are very useful when you have lost a limb or have recieved a massive wound. They are also useful after you have received a skin graft during an operation. The Spandage was first used in the American Revolution, when Italian farmer/minuteman Kyle Beltramini accidentally shot his commanding officer with a pistol in the foot. Beltramini performed the amputation with his hunting knife and no sedative, and using his stockings, fashioned the world's first spandage</p>

<p>Códigos are the rules of behaviour evolved in the early years of tango, which are still observed today in the traditional milongas of Buenos Aires as well as worldwide. Some rules include:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you don't want to stick together the whole evening, enter the milonga separately as a pair. if not, only if he asks someone else to dance, men (or leading women ) are free to ask her.</li>
<li>not ask people to dance, but try cabeceo, which is a slight movement of the head to indicate that you want to dance when someone looks at you</li>
<li>stay together for a whole tanda; if you don't want that with a dancer, simply ask in the middle of a tanda to start</li>
<li>as a women: wait till he starts the abrazo (embrace), only then touch him</li>
<li>as a man: you offer, she determines your distance (close embrace or not)</li>
<li>as a man: bring her back to her place after a tanda</li>
<li>as a man: don't pick her up from another man, but wait till she is back, has perhaps refreshed and then ask her</li>
<li>both: if the tango beat is not yet starting (found in old traditional ones and in surprisingly many electrotangos), do not yet embrace, but engage in conversation</li>
</ul>

<p>Product Of Neglect Art Collective Ltd. is a creativity movement based out of Canada, mostly in Vancouver, British Columbia. Started in 1988, it is promoted primarily through its archival website, online since 1994, which houses documents and results of projects which have happened within the collective/movement.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind the efforts of the collective revolve around a concept of "neglect", neither positive or negative, which is used as a creative process. In their creative processes, members of the collective "neglect" studying, or "neglect" perfection, detail, promotion, and have even "neglected" the movement its self during periods of accidental focus. Often the results of the creative drive are abandoned/performed in public places anonymously, and frequently the artist has neglected to explain or document much of the "product". The forms creative output may take are varied and include visual art, writing, street postering, music recording, live events, and netradio.</p>
<p>Product Of Neglect Art Collective Ltd. artists remain anonymous, or adopt pseudonyms, so as to avoid mixing personality with products. Only one member acts as public relations spokesperson, or "poster boy", currently the position is held by the collective's founding member who uses the name olo J. Milkman (born Jason C. Ross). This anonymization is thought of as "Anti-Warhol", and seeks to remove the 'cult of personality' from the 'art industry'.</p>
<p>Some people claim that the collective is parody, hoax, or satire, entirely the product of olo J. Milkman, however the range and volume of creative output leaves this in question. There have also been documented and published collaborations with other artists which speaks to its authenticity (in Vancouver based Front and Discorder magazines, as well as on CBC radio). However, olo J. Milkman does not deny that satire is a large component of Product Of Neglect, and claims it is one of the original purposes of the movement/collective.</p>
