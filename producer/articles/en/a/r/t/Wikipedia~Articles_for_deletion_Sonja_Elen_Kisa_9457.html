<li>Neutral vote: Of course, I'm staying out of this. I have to say it's not a vanity article, since another Wikipedian created the article about me, long before I even knew what the Wikipedia was! The only real reason for this article to exist is because people were linking to it from <a href="../../../t/o/k/Toki_Pona_266a.html" title="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</a>.

<li>Delete: I'd say that those whose only encyclopedic worthiness is as inventors of conlangs should be mentioned in those conlang articles (if they exist) or on user pages. This is the same as someone who is only famous for dating a celebrity -- the information is on the celebrity's page. I have my own feelings about conlangs, but that's not what we're voting on, here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:42, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: not sufficiently notable. Browsing through the 1140 google hits on <i>"Sonja Elen Kisa"</i> it looks like a substantial fraction (maybe half) are either at Wikipedia mirrors or web directories of people interested in Esperanto (e.g., <a href="http://www.excite.de/directory/World/Esperanto/Socio/Personaj_Hejmpa%C4%9Doj" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.excite.de/directory/World/Esperanto/Socio/Personaj_Hejmpa%C4%9Doj" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). I think a mention in the <a href="../../../t/o/k/Toki_Pona_266a.html" title="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</a> article is plenty. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E.

<li>No vote, but i'd like to note that the text of <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonja_Elen_Kisa_8914.html" title="Sonja Elen Kisa">Sonja Elen Kisa</a> was taken from an old version (and then deleted from) <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonjaaa_33fb.html" title="User:Sonjaaa">User:Sonjaaa</a>'s (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User:Sonjaaa&amp;diff=5559150&amp;oldid=5360699" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User:Sonjaaa&amp;diff=5559150&amp;oldid=5360699" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), but by <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck_SMITH_88e9.html" title="User:Chuck SMITH">User:Chuck SMITH</a>.

<ul>
<li>Actually, it's the other way around. Somebody had randomly deleted <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonja_Elen_Kisa_8914.html" title="Sonja Elen Kisa">Sonja Elen Kisa</a> in the past without proposing a vote (and they moved the content to my user page), and <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck_SMITH_88e9.html" title="User:Chuck SMITH">User:Chuck SMITH</a> reverted that unilateral delete/edit by restoring <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonja_Elen_Kisa_8914.html" title="Sonja Elen Kisa">Sonja Elen Kisa</a>, and moving the Wikified bio out of my user page back into the main article. Therefore, the page was never really part of my userinfo. It had been developped by people (probably speakers of Toki Pona and/or Esperanto, in which circles I have notoriety) like any Wikipedia article is.--<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonjaaa_33fb.html" title="User:Sonjaaa">Sonjaaa</a> 21:37, Sep 11, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or redirect to <a href="../../../t/o/k/Toki_Pona_266a.html" title="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</a>, since this is the only valuable contribution.

<li>BTW, google search seems to show that most toki pona hits (371 total, excluding about 6,000 "ghosts") are from wikipedia articles in different languages and in different mirrors.

<li><s>Non-voting comment: Sonja contacted me on <a href="../../../r/o/p/User_talk%7ERopers_2f09.html#Sonja_Elen_Kisa" title="User talk:Ropers">my talk page</a> and asked me to vote here, for the VfD poll on the article about herself. She got my name wrong (she called me Matt, and that's not my name), so this <i>might</i> still be a honest mistake and she might have intended to just contact a few of her accquaintances to ask them to vote here. It could however also be possible that this is a vanity poster who's now wikispamming all sorts of users to get her piece kept. I can't tell which it is. The quality and significance of her language probably is the one decisive factor and I cannot judge that.

I think I fell onto your talk page by accident through a discussion I read on Matt's page. I'm not wikispamming, and I clearly stated on the message intended for Matt that I encourage a vote either way, i.e. keep or delete.

<li><b>Merge</b> with <b>Redirect</b>. Short stubs like this that mostly reproduce information from another article are annoying and in general it is better for setting an example that Wikipedians don't have their own articles unless very, very notable indeed. The language is important enough to deserve an article and more about its creator in that article is a reasonable expansion of the article. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 01:36, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>No vote (I'm never sure what should or should not be on the Wikipedia), but I do have to say that I am frequently surprised by the infamy and popularity of Toki Pona. Also, it seems to me that if the conlang has its own wikipedia, perhaps it has a higher status than any random conlang. --68.78.42.242 02:03, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC) (<a href="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usor:Iustinus" class="external text" title="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usor:Iustinus" rel="nofollow">Justin</a>)
<ul>
<li>For the record, as far as I recall, Jimbo has stated that he did not support the creation of Toki Pona's Wikipedia (but once it existed wasn't keen to mess with other people's work). Being the author of yet another random conlang, that, as its author admits, may have a number of speakers that just scrapes into double figures, does not make one notable. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:11, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> and merge; it's too short and can always be split later. If there's a redirect then it can easily be referenced separately so it does no harm. In the meantime, Sonia, I suggest you personally (attempt to) invade <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon.html" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> with a force of several thousand and impose your language on the people there on pain of death.

<dd>I wondered about this too. I read <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> as saying that there is conspiracy to destroy Wikipedia through a program of rabid inclusionism.

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>Redirect</b>. When I first came to wikipedia, I had never heard of <a href="../../../t/o/k/Toki_Pona_266a.html" title="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</a>. I saw it mentioned here, so went to read the article. As far as I can tell from the current article, there is nothing encyclopedic about Toki Pona. It's an artificial language, equal to about 1000 others that I could make in an hour with my college linguistics textbook (or at least, I could make enough to fill a similar article). There is no mention of number of speakers or any other feature of the language that might make it worthy of being included. A short description of the author of the language and her qualifications would make the language seem slightly noteworthy, and statistics and anecdotes about its wide usage would do more. Without either, I would be tempted to list both the language article and the author's article on VfD, if I didn't already have the impression that the language is noteworthy from another source (namely, that there exists a Toki Pona language wikipedia. That makes it at least as noteworthy as Klingon, right?). As it stands, I don't think both articles should be deleted, but just merge the author's article and redirect. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" title="User talk:Lethe">Talk</a> 18:07, Sep 17, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
