<dd>This station should be kept. It was bought by Fisher Communications in January 2006. Radio Station World lists it as a Telefutura affiliate <a href="http://radiostationworld.com/Locations/United_States_of_America/Idaho/tv.asp?m=ida" class="external autonumber" title="http://radiostationworld.com/Locations/United_States_of_America/Idaho/tv.asp?m=ida" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, as does Univision <a href="http://www.univisionradio.com/corp/en/mp_list2.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.univisionradio.com/corp/en/mp_list2.jsp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. At the very least, it might be a translator worthy of a redirect to its primary, but it is the only Telefutura affiliate in the Idaho Falls/Pocatello market, and is therefore, notable. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 03:01, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(I've slightly reformatted your comment to make it more legible.) OK, but I don't quite see how this translates into notability per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Your links merely indicate that this radio station a) has been registered as such and b) has some physical antennas on a hill somewhere. The Fisher Broadcasting report just certifies that it meets certain radiation standards; it doesn't say anything about notability. WP:CORP requires that "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself", excluding trivial coverage such as in the first links. How does KUNP-LP meet this standard? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 05:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Licensed and operational television stations have always met the standard of notability. Please refer to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KTFL_bac7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KTFL">KTFL deletion proposal</a> for standards on notability of broadcast facilities. The inclusion of the TV station in Radio Station World and Univision establishes multiple non-trivial published works independent of the company/corporation, meeting even your standards, which are far more stringent. (Univision does not own the station.) In addition, the station is listed by the FCC as having been licensed since 2001. Apart from a personal testimony that the station is actually broadcasting Telefutura programming on UHF channel 24 in Pocatello, Idaho, I'm not sure how much more proof you can get that this station is operating and as such, merits inclusion into WikiPedia. There are many other stations included in Wikipedia with less documentation than KUNP-LP has. What I think we'll both agree on is that the KUNP-LP article as it stands is of poor quality and is based on long-outdated information - once this proceeding is complete, I plan to update and expand the article. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 09:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll have to disagree on the notability issue. Neither <a href="../../../t/v/s/WP%7ETVS_4679.html" title="WP:TVS">WP:TVS</a> nor the AfD you referred to indicate any general community-wide consensus that TV stations are <i>per se</i> notable, as opposed to other corporations. The sources you provide only list the station in a table of stations. This is utterly trivial coverage under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> ("Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories"), leaving aside the question whether these are reliable suorces under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> at all. Being licenced by the FCC isn't a notability criterion, <b>multiple substantial coverage by reliable sources</b> is (see in general: <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). Finally, I'm afraid your personal testimony isn't allowed under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and at any rate it's immaterial whether they broadcast anything. If no-one has bothered to write anything of substance about this station, they're still nonnotable. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 11:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't offering "personal testimony" - just using it as an example. Broadcast stations licensed in the US by the <a href="../../../f/c/c/FCC_a44b.html" title="FCC">FCC</a> or in other countries by their equivalent have always been accepted as notable in the English Wikipedia, either for standalone articles, or, as in the case of translators, for redirects to primary stations;. Using your standards would probably eliminate a good 50%-60% of US TV station articles already in Wikipedia due to the number of low-power television stations. Your arguments under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> are unconvincing, as the former has no specific guidelines that apply to broadcast television and the latter relies on precedent as a standard, precedent which overwhelmingly favors keeping the article. Your citation under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> also does not apply, as the <a href="../../../f/c/c/FCC_a44b.html" title="FCC">FCC</a> has published several documents concerning this station. Here's what I propose: let's keep the article, then post your argument to <a href="../../../t/v/s/WT%7ETVS_21aa.html" title="WT:TVS">WT:TVS</a>. If they go along with it, I will too, and will personally nominate the article again for deletion. But you're going against years of precedent here and taking up more space than the original article ever did in the first place. I don't know what kind of personal crusade you're on with this or why you think that your idea of notability trumps that which has been accepted until now, but I recommend that you leave this article as is and take up your cause with the TelevisionStationsProject group. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 20:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, let's see what some other people think around here, first. General AfD is the proper forum for notability discussions, not some specialised group, and I've yet to be convinced that the established precedent you mention does in fact exist. Contrary to your impression, I'm not on a crusade against anything and have in fact never before (I believe) edited anything TV-related - I just happened to stumble over a run-of-the-mill corporate article with no assertion of notability, and here we are. I'd appreciate it if you could <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> in your co-contributors. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:54, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your vehemence surprises me, especially in regards to a project in which you've had no dealings before. My "personal crusade" comment was not an assumption of bad faith, but rather a commentary on your insistence. Nevertheless, it has apparently offended you, and so for that, I do apologize. You might wish to consult <a href="../../../a/a/g/WP%7EAAGF_5ca1.html" title="WP:AAGF">WP:AAGF</a> next time before citing <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> so quickly. Also, please understand that broadcast entities do not fit well into your "run-of-the-mill corporate" template, especially when it comes to low-power broadcast. A low-power Telefutura station is not the same as a neighborhood McDonalds, and I'm not sure if any low-power television station or even any small-market full-power television station meets your "multiple substantial coverage by reliable sources" criterion for notability, which by the way, is not an established standard for notability. But low-power television stations are notable, as are full-power stations in small markets. As for the article's lack of assertion of notability, I've already covered that: it's a poorly-sourced, poorly-written article, but the answer is to improve the article, not to delete it. If I didn't think I could improve it, I wouldn't be contesting the AfD recommendation. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 02:23, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
