<li><b>Keep</b>, the article is crappy, but I think I can fix it into a nice stub. An Alexa rank of 48,246 and I found 1220 sites linking to it with Google. Appears to be sufficiently notable to me. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:59, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>At that level, it probably satisfies WP:WEB, but I would urge (not require) that the external link be to a site that discusses the group, rather than to the provider itself, just to limit the possibilities of page rank boosting. In particular, Google hits are inherently high for any e-mail provider, as anyone who puts in href mailto will generate a link. <b>Weakest keep.</b> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:10, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I might've been too hasty to nominate it, as the original version of the article biased me against it. However, despite a high ranking, it's an email provider—I haven't seen much evidence there's anything interesting about it other than a fair number of people use it for email.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<ul>
<li>No, but my point is that at least a feature listing can be quite detailed even without being a groundbreaking service. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolver_6882.html" title="User:Solver">Solver</a> 20:22, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'd like AfD to take a look at this. The topic of the article sounds alright when you read it.

It presumably exists/ed, but the article is a (sub-)stub without apparent potential for expansion. It would be virtually impossible to verify any future addition to the article based on what's on Google.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is an Irish organization. This may account in part for its paucity of web hits. Nevertheless, I can't find information that it's active; I found one mention of it some newsletter, but that's from Spring 2000. They did have a newsletter called Media Edge, but can't get any info on that either. One Martin Kieran appears to have been involved. He's co-written a couple of books. But there is no mention of TAME in the brief bio <a href="http://www.gillmacmillan.ie/Ecom/Library3.nsf/0/4F55A2E386CD43DD80256AE0003738B0?OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://www.gillmacmillan.ie/Ecom/Library3.nsf/0/4F55A2E386CD43DD80256AE0003738B0?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b> - The article is far too brief to be of use and needs to be expanded. The comment was made that the organization may be defunct and this would indeed account for fewer webhits. Deleting an entry because it refers to a dead organization is inappropriate, especially one that by its title would suggest it had at one time been of some significance in its area. If we delete it because it is (effectively) dead, then we need to also consider deleting entries for the Whig party, Greek Mythology, etc.--<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">eleuthero</a> 18:24, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>They</i> are verifiable and expandable. How would you suggest expanding this article? I'd be pleased if you can, but it's too common for people to say "expand" on AfD and have no idea or intention how that might be done. That said, if people can find a means of expanding and verifying this, that's great. I dont see any justification for your claim that its title suggests that it may have been of significance: that is just speculation. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:34, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Eleuthero, you are missreading the comments. No one is suggesting that this article be deleted merely because the organisation is defunct. Some effort has been made (with references and all) to determine if this indeed is/was a notable organisation.

<li><a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">Eleuthero</a> is wholly ignoring the requirement that <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">everything in Wikipedia be verifiable</a>. If the article cited sources, as its creator was <i>asked to do when xe created the article</i>, it would be verifiable. But, like so many articles, it cites no sources at all. Like other editors above, I've tried to <i>find</i> reliable sources. I haven't found any. I <i>cannot even find a source to verify the second half of the first sentence of the article</i>, where it describes what the purpose of this organization purportedly is. The only verifiable information about this organization is that some people say that they used to be members of it but that it doesn't exist now. There is <i>nothing else</i> documented about this organization that I have found. (In contrast, there are reams of published books about the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_party.html" title="Whig party">Whig party</a> and about <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>.) <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">Eleuthero</a>, the <i>only</i> argument that you can make to counter this, and to change everyone else's mind (This is a discussion.

But not all of them get them come to attention of the national GOP.

<li>Delete: Note that a great deal of her public service is highly partisan (i.e. "not real organizations" or, more NPOV, "head of minor, probably non-functional organizations that serve to increase partisan political position without affecting actual public health"), but that is not grounds for this vote. The <i>article</i> only profiles her as a bit of trivia for losing in two elections to the House. 440 losers per four years is too high a number, but the real number is higher than that, as there is no indication that this woman was the nominee of one of the two parties, and we have many more losers in the primaries. If this were a biography/profile of a Republican Party operative, it might well be a keep, but the notability established by the article is solely that she lost twice. Everybody hurts some time. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:24, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>She was the Republican nominee, not some minor party where you can get on the ballot by having 25 friends willing to sign a petition.

<li>I have no problem with that, as they are archivists. I don't believe, however, that an encyclopedia article is necessary <i>as a biography</i> of each failed candidate. My delete vote, though, was not actually based upon her herself but on this article, which did not include any information on her except her losing status. By itself, I don't think that triggers biography. In this particular person's case, she is being kept politically alive by some of the most harsh right wing Republican organizations. (I have heard her discussed by left wing sites and radio, as she's a bit vicious and nasty from my POV.) Thus, I do think a biography is possible, but not this article. Obviously, I would reconsider if it were rewritten. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:51, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This Mortal Kombat character doesn't actually exist, by the article's own admission. Moreover, I'm not entirely sure this is even a real rumor; I believe it might be someone's fanfic character or some other minor fan speculation.</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. It was a big controversy when <i>Mortal Kombat</i> came out, because there were no black characters in the game. The rumor was created by MK designers to silence the critics.

They interviewed <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Boon_34bc.html" title="Ed Boon">Boon</a> on the new MK game, and Boon mentioned the secret kickboxer character, amongst several other "hidden" characters. The magazine then intentionally published false information on this character, complete with screenshots and a fabricated storyline of his tournament involvement. The factuality of this character was debated for a long time, and the search for "Nimbus Terrafaux" was a mission taken on by many Mortal Kombat fans. I think what needs more attention than this attack on Nimbus Terrafaux concerns these other MK articles: Irata, Mirror, Monster, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Robin_%28Mortal_Kombat_character%29_4abc.html" title="Red Robin (Mortal Kombat character)">Red Robin</a>, Shawn, <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skarlet_%28Mortal_Kombat%29_d612.html" title="Skarlet (Mortal Kombat)">Skarlet</a>, Watchdog, and <a href="../../../z/e/b/Zebron.html" title="Zebron">Zebron</a>. Some "speedy deletes" I see, but yet this proposed Terrafaux deletion concerns a well-known Mortal Kombat rumor and professionally contained factual information.

<li>Hey, I used to play this, long long ago. Damn this article is FAQy (not really advertising, just a lot of instruction-manual type info). As for the notability of the website itself, well...

<li>Sure looks like the introduction to the game and the rules, rather than an article <i>about</i> the game and its historical relevance. We get one very short paragraph that's like an encyclopedia article, and the rest is just how to play. Wikipedia is not GameFAQs nor a how-to guide.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Reasons as follows: - (a) Awards being given by a foundation for the past 26 years and accepted by many notable people - Of the 28 recipients, around 20 of them I can immediately say are notable by Wikipedia standards (I do not know about the remaining remaining and hence cannot comment), of which some of them have received civilian awards from Government of India - If it is a non-notable organisation, notable people from all walks of life in India would not have been accepting it - think about it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(b) Among the earliest awards being given by private organisations in India and with a good purse right from inception (though I speak only from anecdotal hearing and cannot cite on-line references for these; hence would not like to stress on this point)</dd>
<dd>(c) As per Vyzasatya above</dd>
<dd>(d) I've undertaken a clean-up where apart from re-writing, categorising and re-organising, I deleted the lists of recipients of vaidika puraskaram (Vedic Scholars award) and <i>recognise the teacher award</i> as these recipients are not notable outside their work context. However, the general award and the literary award recipients are highly notable, the latter probably more in the context of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu.html" title="Telugu">Telugu</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andhra_Pradesh_0379.html" title="Andhra Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. The latter list may be a borderline case for inclusion but not the entire article and the list of general (known blandly as Raja-Lakshmi) awards definitely merits inclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The flip side: - (a) Organisation doesn't even seem to have its website though its activities and awards are widely covered by <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> media.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(b) The references for the article had to be obtained from TFAS, an association of Telugu people in USA, which gives another award to the recipients of the Raja-Lakshmi award - However, the later day awards can be corroborated by newspaper reports available on the net (e.g. The Hindu, Deccan Herald)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>To sum up - Not all its awards are notable but the Raja-Lakshmi award is notable because the awardees mention it prominently. Hence the article should be retained. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 17:40, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is a very valid and notable topic. This is certainly NOT original research. As for WP:V I see references scattered througout the article. I could not find a duplicate article with this info. I'm not sure if a <b>Rename</b> might not be in order, as I got no Google hits on "culture clash pathologies". But I don't know what else you would call it -- I'm not sure that there is a generally accepted name. HOWEVER, it needs major <b>Cleanup</b> as the tone is of a term paper, not an encylopedia entry. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> because the author is proposing a concept and/or term that is apparently original with him or her. The historical events involved are significant (and very much so) but if the concept and/or term isn't in the literature (such asq, it's a topic Jared Diamond would takle) then we're violating "no original research." And I can't find a single reference for "culture clash pathologies" myself.</li>

<li>If it's WP:NOR solely because of the name of the article, a Rename would be in order rather than a delete, I would think. I myself have an article, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Battle of annihilation">Battle of annihilation</a> (I know, needs work) whose title is only weakly in the literature and is really only a description of the phenomena. If there is a better title, responders might propose one. (Mind you, agree the article <i>body</i> is a mess, but IMO that is better addressed by a call for cleanup or attention rather than a delete. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:36, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> since the author has requested it and there are no other significant editors of the article (I forget which criterion that is, but it's in there, right?). Probably not necessary to create a redirect since the neologistic nature of the title was the major objection to the present article. Were there any objections directly related to the content that would necessitate keeping the AfD open on the moved article? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well... yeah. "The neologistic nature of the title" is still an issue. With an encyclopedia, readers start with a known topic name and go looking for information on that topic. In this case, who is going to come to Wikipedia and search for "Cultural collisions and mutual lethal contact"? Rather than "contributing to an encyclopedia," this feels like "publishing an article". The question that we should be asking, given the basically worthy material, is what article it should be part of? I might suggest <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_contact_%28anthropology%29.html" title="First contact (anthropology)">First contact (anthropology)</a>. (I'm not explaining this very well. Someone please help me. El Jigüe, no criticism of your work is intended. But the novelty of the name tends to make it look like original research rather than "information about X topic.") <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 22:11, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes. Any discussion of the impact of the contact between the hemispheres would have to be in a recognized category just to be found. Personally, I still feel the author is attempting his own, personal synthesis of the material. Which would be fine in, say, an anthropology journal but does it belong here? Also, the hypothesis that syphilis came from this continent and was carried to Europe is still highly speculative. I think the jury is still out (and that's an opinion from reading the literature, until recently, I was working on a degree in anthropology). Seems to me the author should consider contributing to existing categories and articles rather than attempting something original. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li><b>Delete</b>. As another user has pointed out, the creator of this article writes term papers, not encyclopedia entries. He also creates duplicate articles with identical content under multiple titles (for instance, this one was duplicated as the now-speedily-deleted Cultural collisions and mutual lethal contact), and spams them with internal links from other articles (for example he added a link to a Fidel Castro Cuban espionage page from <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_spies_56ae.html" title="American Civil War spies">American Civil War spies</a>). He rejects <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> and does not accept that his contributions are released under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, and thus engages in endless edit wars to defend "his" articles.

<p>This is a character from a book related to <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a></i>. The book bears little connection to the series' main arcs, and this character does not appear in the series. It's essentially non-notable <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a>. Since the character is not shown on the series or connected to an official website, it does not merit inclusion (via merge and redirect) on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Lost_234d.html" title="Characters of Lost">Characters of Lost</a>.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>.</s> Just because they're not part of the television version of Lost, doesn't mean the character doesn't warrant inclusion. If the book is published by a known publisher and supported by the show's creators, it's just as real as the show.

<li><b>Comment</b>: When Baronyx mentioned this to me, I didn't realize it was from a published book by the creators of the show. However, as it stands, I'm not sure if this is going to be fleshed out into a full article. Maybe this information should be moved to a more generic article about the book Lost: Endangered Species? --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DDG</a> 15:35, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Agree that Lost is more than just what appears on the TV show and such content may warrant a Wikipedia article. Between the book (with another planned), the announced short video vignettes for mobile phones, and the web sites, perhaps an article on "Lost in other other media" that would hold such content until separate articles are justified? <a href="../../../r/i/l/User%7ERillian_e63f.html" title="User:Rillian">Rillian</a> 17:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Rillian. <b>Merge</b> this character article elsewhere for now. I don't know what the consensus is regarding book-only characters for Lost (as opposed to, say, Star Trek or Doctor Who or James Bond), but I think it may be premature for this character to have her own article unless it is known that the character is going to be recurring in the books and/or be added to the show. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:36, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This guy is real, except he looks kinda different from his picture, cos the real deal is kinda more <b>nourished looking</b>. He came to my school at the start of this year for seminars and droned on about baked dinner for fifty minutes, then gave out booklets with random statistics and food pyramids and radio transcripts available to buy to listen on cassette. I don't have one myself, but I know some people kept them to make fun of him and prank his office number. I'll see whether I can get the seminar photos or a scan of his booklet or something or whether my teachers can write in about this guy.J.Hamile-Rakow</li>

<li>Notability isn't an issue. The subject matter is, according to the article at any rate (it effectively stating outright that there <i>are no</i> sources on the subject), unverifiable.

<li>Guys, I really am new to Wikipedia, so forgive me if this is the improper way/place to put forward my thoughts.
<p>Why is this article taken for deletion? The editor, by stating that "towel fetish is an unheard of concept" is being honest. The feelings may have been his/her own, or his own fetish. So what there's nothing to justify it?</p>
<p>I doubt if the first article published on 'Erotic Bondage' had anyone to justify it also! And neither is this sexually explicit material he has written - at least not compared to the stuff we have on Wikipedia!! Come on. I'd ask you to give the guy a chance.</p>
<p>-John.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there's "nothing to justify it", it does not belong here. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Everything here is required to be verifiable</a>. We aren't in the business of taking Wikipedia editors solely at their words. We have no reason to believe that Crazyideas (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crazyideas_7a6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crazyideas">contribs</a>) is "being honest", just as you have no reason to believe that <i>I</i> am being honest. This is why we <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>, providing editors with the independent means to <i>check</i> the articles that we are writing. If there <i>is no</i> means for checking an article, because there are no sources to be cited (and <i>this</i> article pretty much says that there aren't), then the article is unacceptable here.
<p>Furthermore, Wikipedia is not a publisher of first instance. If Crazyideas wants to announce to the world a new concept of towel fetishism, based upon firsthand personal testimony, then that is <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> material, which must be peer reviewed, fact checked, critiqued, and published <i>elsewhere</i>.</p>
<p>If you or anyone else want to convince those of us who think that the article should be deleted that the article should be kept, you can easily change our minds by the simple expedient of citing some <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable sources</a> for the subject matter of the article, demonstrating that it <i>is</i> verifiable and not original research. This is a discussion, and people's decisions are not set in stone. But that is the <i>only</i> way to satisfy the objections to the article that we have. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:19, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. In response to John, if there is something called a "towel fetish," that there is no internet activity surrounding this tells us that the practice is not widespread and is not particularly noteworthy. All sorts of conduct is the subject of one sexually fetish or another, but an article requires some minimal amount of practice or else it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. In this instance, unlike erotic bondage the article itself note that there are no websites that deal with the practice. And it doesn't take too large of an audience to support <i>some</i> web activity and this leads me to believe the practice is microscopic at best. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 13:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. ...but mark for cleanup and link from somewhere. As frightening as it may be, Google does turn up a few hits referring to people having a towel fetish. Might as well let the information collect somewhere.

<ul>
<li>Yes, and I gave three of them above. <i>Not one of them is a source that can be used to create an article.</i> Counting Google Web hits is not enough. It isn't research. Research requires that one <i>actually read</i> what Google turns up. If you found something using a Google Web search that can actually be used as a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable source</a> to construct a verifiable article, please tell us what it is. Otherwise, you have not shown that this article is verifiable. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:19, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I have to agree with the above, Google hits alone are insufficient unless you find links for the specific topic of the article. Towel and fetish are likely to come up often on a search since, well, fetishes are almost always messy. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 16:59, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: As RJHall says, it's original research. A paraphilia about the security blanket and infantile regression with a towel isn't altogether shocking, but the concept is not discussed in the literature.

<li>And this is why nominators should do research on schools before they nominate. This article appears to be a hoax, though the nominator failed to uncover this, thus demonstrating that they did not follow our deletion policy (which requires that one, before nominating, determine that the article does not fall under a category that does not require deletion, like a failure of POV, or needing cleanup.) It is a waste of everyones time to nominate articles that will obviously generate controvercy on AFD without doing the requiste research. <b>No vote</b> <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:30, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: If one wishes merely to refer to wp:sch, then that is fine. However, I feel that once one decides to take on the responsibility of saying "keep" or "delete," one <i>must</i> offer a rationale for that opinion that pertains to the article under debate. No meta page trumps a deliberative page, and, were there to be an actual policy to emerge from that debate (and I believe that it never will), then the decisions would be procedural and, again, not involve motioning for "keep" or "delete." Again, <i>if</i> you vote, rationalize the vote with reference to the article. I note that schools are the only situation where things have gotten so bad that folks are admittedly not even reading the articles and yet proposing that they be kept or deleted. This is against the spirit of AfD, to say the least, and that is why I took the unusual step of urging a disregarding of such motions. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:33, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I understand that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and not a this or a that, but Wikipedia is the first place I've seen any direct attempt to "define" this 'state' which I've heard persons referring to more and more frequently over the past ten years.</p>
<p>There's a couple of hundred entries in Google under uberhubris, and under the entry uber-hubris, several hundred more.</p>
<p>If not Wikipedia, then where?</p>
<p>I've previously heard "uberhubris" to refer to an internal state of being/mind, but have [I believe] seen it corrupted recently [probably as we turn to other languages to find our superlatives]. Jksamuels 00:50, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Urban Dictionary takes this kind of thing, but neither Wikipedia nor its dictionary counterpart Wiktionary do. Further, it's a really ugly portmonteau word, combining German with Greek. "Hubris" is already superlative: it is a pride so shocking that it outrages the gods in Greek <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tragedy.html" title="Tragedy">tragedy</a>. There was an Anglo-Saxon word along the same lines (maybe...depends on which side of a particular debate you take) in "ofermode," and other languages have their own versions. Thus, it's not really a needed word, either, except that there has been a debasement of "hubris" by people using it in a slipshod manner (which is normal). If that misuse continues for another decade or so, we may need a word to reestablish the original meaning, but not yet. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:15, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, defining neologisms isn't what Wikipedia articles are for. Geogre is kindly asked to withdraw his scandalous allegation of ugliness, though. I like the kiddingly redundant superlative, the tongue-twistingness and unpronouncability, and especially the uber/ubr chime between two languages so widely differing as German and Greek. Good luck to the word, just not in its own wiki article. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:17, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak delete</b> I like the concept, but the word is not notable enough, and it is a bit clumsy in english, so I will be surprised if catches on. If it does catch on, it is probably still more appropriate for a dictonary. If enough people vote keep to make it close, contact me and I may switch to keep, since I am generally anti-deletionist, and I believe in making allowances for minority opinion, even if it is a mere 15 or 20% minority.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 06:31, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep Page Open</b> This is my first wikidrama -- in a trial for the survival of an entry, I'm the apologist. How exciting. If it is the case that the entry is merely the definition of a neologism, and it is the case that the Wikispaces are not the 'proper' place, but Urban Dictionary IS -- then the remaining issue: Is the entry qua entry merely the definition of a neologism? Do articles ever 'grow'? Should this be changed to a 'stub'? --jksamuels 16:47, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete, but.... The bells are going off in my head suggesting that WoW took this from actual medieval literature. Any of our Anglo-Saxonists or Old Norse folks recognize it? I certainly can't replace the content with something more germane, but, if someone else can, that would be a nice way to get a two-for-one out of it ("Healadin is a figure in the Volsungsaga and the WoW people stoled the name"). Otherwise, barring someone with a better memory or my just imagining it, delete. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:19, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep:</b> As UTC is the earthly time and is not local time then the significance of UTC does indeed indicate that this person is likely to be the first person of the year 2003 and that certainly by the recorded time they can not be second. The information is also verifiable as hospitals by law have to record the time of birth, and if this alone is recognised in law then that time must be recognised as being accurate and not illegally "fudged". Given that there is likely to be just 1000 first persons in an entire millenium, whose passing may see billions of new people, then the significance is quite high given the importance of the calendar in general. That newspapers devote front page news to the phenomenon enforces that this is a definite seal of our society such that we attach national significance and importance to the event. Incidentally - if the odds were that just 100 people were born every second then we'd have over 3bn new people each year - so it is misguided to say that "surely" hundreds or even "thousands" of people qualify. It is more likely statistically that no other qualifies.--194.201.24.215 18:41, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please delete the article. We are publishing it on another respected academic press and it was an honest mistake to place it here. I did not understand the fundamental idea behind wikipedia and do so now. Yes, the work is an original contribution to the previous fields mentioned and as of yet has no larger audience. Again thank you for the critical commentary. I am sure in the future wikipedians will introduce the idea after it has been normalized. I do not mean any disrespect to the editorial culture here.

<p><b>Delete</b>: Non-notable comic. Article claims he is "known for his self invented mock-past careers and lives". Indeed; within the article it claims he lives in Manhattan and also in Los Angeles. Yet, his profiles (<a href="http://otisabi.deviantart.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://otisabi.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>,<a href="http://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/aslanturk_yilmaz.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/aslanturk_yilmaz.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>) say he lives in Turkey. Claims to be working in the motion picture industry yet IMDB has no entry under either Otisabi or Yilmaz Aslantürk. There are also claims to being a top male model, top water polo player (google for "Yilmaz Aslantürk" and "water polo" returns nothing), and rich playboy. I was strongly leaning towards speedy deleting this as nn-bio, but given there have been a few people who have contribute to the article I thought I'd give it half a chance by cleaning it up a bit and putting it here on AfD. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 14:46, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yılmaz Aslantürk (illustrator) and Otisabi (the cyber persona) are NOT the same person. Yılmaz Aslantürk, who resides in Turkey, created the Otisabi character for his Comic Strips. Otisabi the cyber personality liked that character and took its name as his handle/nickname. Also the claims of being a top model and water polo players are evidently NOT real but intended to be comical as made obvious by the following statement that clearly says "self invented". You might cross check with Eksi Sozluk (<a href="http://sozluk.sourtimes.org" class="external free" title="http://sozluk.sourtimes.org" rel="nofollow">http://sozluk.sourtimes.org</a>) for further verification.Otisabi</p>

<li>Then please indicate some reason...any reason...why this person (you?) is notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. As it is, the article clearly fails <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">Articles (7)</a> criteria and should be speedy deleted.

<p>Well, this person, (being me, but the article itself is not initially written by me or anyone I know of) is notable mainly for being one of the few internet persona's in Turkey that emerged as a nickname, gained popularity then made himself a career as a writer and journalist under the same nickname, announced specifically on the cover of a magazine (<a href="http://www.vatangazetesi.com.tr/boxer/index.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.vatangazetesi.com.tr/boxer/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatangazetesi.com.tr/boxer/index.asp</a>). It's like Durin (you?) emerging from wikipedia as an administrator and be invited to write for a mainstream magazine, acknowledged outside of wikipedia but still under the same LOTR nickname? Would you think of yourself notable enough? I just find it humiliating to prove and justify my existence.</p>
<p>Personally, I do not defend that otisabi should be included (or for that matter excluded) for any reason. I just saw the previous flawed article edited that out, I will edit in the "excuse" to justify otisabi's presence, however I would still like you to be provide a justification that corresponds to the article itself a little bit more coherent than "the article clearly fails <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">Articles (7)</a>". How clearly does it fail? If you will, please clarify that so that I can edit it accordingly. Otherwise you may proceed with your speed obsessed deletion.

<li>If I were obsessed with speedy deleting articles, I would have deleted this article on sight. Instead, I took the time and effort to clean it up a bit and placed it for AfD where this discussion is now happening. Had I just speedied it, we would not even be having this conversation. Let's throw pillows, not knives, ok?</li>
<li>As for it qualifying speedy deletion under A7; the article makes no assertion of notability of the individual that can be independently verified. I attempted to verify, and made an association of a name to the person that you hav indicated is inaccurate. As noted, claims of being a water polo scoring champ and etc. are fake. There's nothing in the article that we can verify to support notability. The link you have provided shows the word "Otisabi" on the page twice. Not knowing Turkish, I've no way of understanding the relevance. A journalist and/or writer is not notable enough because they are a journalist and/or writer. Has the person won awards? Published frequently? When and in what medium? There are journalists and writers at my local newspaper. None of them are remarkable in any respect. What makes "Otisabi" something encyclopedic? Perhaps it would be more appropriate to create this article on the Turkish Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 20:11, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
(editing in for the purposes of further clarification) Although I have mentioned the word "obsession" once in reference to your usage of the word "speedy", you kind of get a little too itchy about it (Maybe I should throw in a itching cream?). You, being the moderator with a topic under your name and "milestones of achievement" can and may by every right delete an article. It doesn't matter how fast you erase it. Giving a sense of urgency in a matter of quasi importance such as this one seems a bit sign of pointless self importance. Just so you know, this is just an article in question, it's not a "cut the red wire or the green wire in ten seconds" moment. Do we really need to throw in uncalled for adjectives? It's not important how fast it should be deleted but why it should be deleted. A little more coherence to the text itself would suffice. Next time let's throw meaningful references to the text rather than links to lengthy articles, mmmkay?</p>
<p>Now, as I said earlier I will not defend the necessity of the topic otisabi in wikipedia. It could have forever remained in its previous version (which somehow eluded your and other hall of fame moderators faster than bullet deletion skills. Maybe you should add these to your notable list of milestones as well.) I am not sure what would be the scope of notability and necessity in an ever growing English speaking world. Is it centered in English speaking world and their means of collecting information? If so wikipedia being one such medium would suffice to present what is notable in one country to the other. However, we're not really given anything specific, other than speed regarding a deletion. Oh and Thank you for editing the article, it wouldn't be what it was without you.</p>
<p>I must also point out some inconsistencies inherent to wikipedia's "notable person" criteria. You, Durin, for instance have a user article to your name. Even though you're just an editor who has just enough time (and perhaps, not enough life) to adorn your topic with milestones of quite puny achievements, you are somehow considered notable. However anyone with enough time can be a moderator in wikipedia, and have milestones of statistical achievements. Should any geek with a LOTR nickname be given space in an encyclopedia just because he/she has enough time to justify it? Of course you may say "but its a user page and everyone is entitled to one.". Sure, but it's not very easy to distinguish that at first glance. It is presented in the same format, and can easily serve as a vanity page if need be. Of course this is beside the main point.</p>
<p>The main point is what is the criteria for notability that is somewhat left undecided whether it relates to the culture, geography, language, etc. You say in your web page you want some verification of notability. Fair enough. But then again if you are unable to read the "verifications" due to your lack of language regarding the subject of verification which may be something other than English (and french) shouldn't you just leave the judgement to someone that might know Turkish? If you insist on verifications you first should be able to "see" them, right? Perhaps you should ask a comrade moderator who does rather than directing me to Turkish Wikipedia? Hmm? That didn't occur to you? No Turkish speaking mods in English wikipedia?</p>
<p>Other than that I do not see how you miss the point about the notability. Use your pace in thinking please, I will provide the pillows if you fall, do I not explicitly say that otisabi is notable because he started out as a cyber persona, gained fame, and eventually hired as a writer due to his fame. It's quite unlike the blokes in your local newspaper who probably gained fame in town gatherings, but then again how can you prove and distinguish one from the other?</p>
<p>Otisabi writes in a nation wide circulated magazine, and he did not apply for it, he is offered the place. If that is in par with guys being able to write in local newspapers, so be it. You might live in Times Square.</p>
<p>Has the person won awards? But Durin, doesn't that depend on the award itself? Suppose my friends decide to give me an award how would that qualify? Besides how would -you- know the difference given the fact that you are alien to Turkish and the cultural life in Turkey? Do every good writer in history won an award or another? What award did Kafka won? Was he published regularly when he was alive? No. However he was published after his death, but still it wasn't what made him notable. It was not through awards or being published regularly to fulfill a quantitative understanding that mattered, but his literature was studied. It was written about. Maybe that is something you should keep in your inventory of criteria.</p>
<p>Was otisabi considered worthy in that sense? Yes. I can provide you articles. But would you be able to tell anything from it? No, because you don't know Turkish. Oh but somehow you think you are -still- eligible.</p>
<p>Was he regularly published, article clearly says that he is being published, and he is a publisher as well (and again nationwide, unlike your local paper friends). But there's a thing called vanity press, and regular publishing does not make you notable. That is unless you think there's relation between money and notability other than the "note" in "banknote".</p>
<p>Maybe Durin, just maybe, you should have said: is he translated into English so that he is notable to be published in English Wikipedia, then I would understand. Then you would have a point, then I would rest my case. Then I could have asked the initial question where is the center of wikipedia? Does it exclude Internet because of its insignificance as a source of being notable? If it does doesn't it also make itself not so notable since it is Internet based?</p>
<p>However, that I did not see. And allow me to be honest when I say that I find you quite naive and Pavlovian after milestones of achievements. Other than applying ready made bio templates you should be more attentive to the articles you have power upon. You should ask the questions that refer to specific points in a copy paste friendly environment, you should be able to provide a rule that directly explains the situation, rather than giving out general guidelines.</p>
<p>So next time please do not offer faux apologies by saying " Sorry to disappoint, but I don't see why a person who spends time on the web and becomes a writer/journalist is therefore notable." I am not disappointed by not being able to make it in wikipedia. I am disappointed that even wikipedia is run by bureaucrats who throw in a little bit of obscurity can rule and survive.</p>
<p>So here's what you could have asked: "Is he notable because he one day decided to be a nationwide publicized writer journalist, or was he asked/urged to be one because of his fame in the internet?" But that requires a sharp knife that wasn't in the drawer in the first place doesn't it?</p>
<p>Sorry to provide you one by throwing to your direction. If that was too sharp for you, here, a pillow, rest your weary head after a day of accomplishment.</p>

<li>Well I'm satisfied that these chaps exist, they provide a performance venue in the Bronx area of Madhattoes, and they've produced a CD of some performances. I can't see why we should delete the article but perhaps we should consider redirecting to a more complete article.

<dd>I'm not sure what you're asking. You want to know where to redirect? Unless there's an obvious target, why would this be a candidate for redirection at all? Are you hoping for a List of clubs in the Bronx article or something? As for why it should be deleted, the most compelling reason offered so far is that it's not verifiable. Other concerns are that it's an ad, and, (for those who believe in notability), it's not notable. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 02:08, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> How right you are, Linas. But they aren't trying to come off that way to users like you or me, they just don't know any better. There are actually many challenging conceptual issues in ecology which have not been adequately addressed by talented applied mathematicians, only by mathematically challenged ecologists. This has been very harmful to that field. I should also add that not all ecologists have been mathematically challenged by any means, in fact you'd probably get a kick out of some classic papers by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_May_0456.html" title="Robert May">Robert May</a> once you have enough dynamical systems and ecology background. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:45, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article fails to define what Maximum empower is, or even what empower is, spending only three very short sentances on its definition. It then takes a decent paragraph to point out that there have been no scientific articles published on it, and that the physics and chemistry community reject the concept. As such, it seems to be both non-notable and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> by the article author into some uncertain concept originally advanced by H.T.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Empower has been referred to in Odum's <b>Environmental Accounting</b>, and <b>A Prosperous way down</b>. The principle of maximum empower is notable because Odum identifies it as what policy should aim towards. The concept has historical and contemporary use, and should therefore be included in Wiki. Currently I try to fill Odum shoes for the world but cannot and need help.

But I'd like to see evidence that it <i>is</i> verifiable, i.e. <i>that there are reliable sources available that editors can use for constructing a verifiable and neutral article on the subject</i>. There have been attempts to make <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a> more verifiable, and less a collection of mere original research added by random Wikipedia editors, and the article now sports a (scant) few reliable sources.

<li>Unverifiability is one of the reasons that we delete articles, yes. If there were reliable sources that could be used to improve the article, then it wouldn't be unverifiable. Conversely, if the article is unverifiable, then there aren't any reliable sources that can be used to improve the article and cleanup is impossible. As I said, it needs to be demonstrated that improving the article <i>is at least possible</i>, as it is for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>. Find reliable sources on the subject that can be used to create an article (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a> was the subject of newspaper articles and a television documentary.) and cite them, and you <i>will</i> change editors' minds. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:49, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Many people use this term and refer to it. Not sure how much more verifiable you want. Pete Hurd poses a rather high hurdle, is that actual Wikipedia policy or just Pete's feelings? This editor heard the term used more than once on a recent visit to Singapore, but of course that's not verifiable. If no verifiable sources exist but the preponderance of evidence suggests that the term exists and is used roughly as the article outlines shouldn't that be sufficient? I should point out that i'm inclusionist rather than deletionist, and want people to be able to find what they look for. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 21:43, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

If "no sources exist" for the verification of an article, then we cannot have an article.
<p>The web log posting that you cite deals with the subject in depth, but given that it's the pseudonymous author's self-proclaimed "two-sen stereotypical opinion at its height", are you truly convinced that this is a <i>reliable</i> source, despite what <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Bulletin_boards_and_posts_to_Usenet" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Bulletin_boards_and_posts_to_Usenet</a> says?

<li>I'm just saying that most pages in wikipedia does not have references, that page on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a> have one which is not much of a reference in my opinion, the external links for <a href="../../../a/h/_/Ah_beng.html" title="Ah beng">ah beng</a> is of about as good quality as the onces for chav, i.e. neither are very good. I have seen Ah Beng mentioned many times in ST, I have heard it said many times on TV, but I can not tell you when and I can not give you reference, I did not say that any "in depth" articles have been published, I claimed that it is used in press and TV. If you really think this is a made up fake word then you can vote for delete, but the word is used, if you ask 100 people in Singapore what it means all will verify it, I can agree that the article(s) are badly written but the word is there! best use of it on the web from a reputable source <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_News_Asia_3b09.html" title="Channel News Asia">Channel_News_Asia</a> is this link, but it does not explain the meaning but maybe proves that the word is used?<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/analysis/031103_english.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/analysis/031103_english.htm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefan_3752.html" title="User:Stefan">Stefan</a> 10:48, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As per <a href="../../../a/h/_/Ah_beng.html" title="Ah beng">Ah beng</a>: What is wrong with this article is the same thing that is wrong with articles such as <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westies_%28people%29.html" title="Westies (people)">Westies (people)</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogan.html" title="Bogan">Bogan</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a>: The article is a massive original research magnet. Contrary to what Ifnord says, the article isn't referenced very well, or even at all, really; and verifiability has not been demonstrated. It contains a few external hyperlinks to some web sites, none of which are exactly <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> (most are the same web sites that are listed for <a href="../../../a/h/_/Ah_beng.html" title="Ah beng">Ah beng</a>), and the content of the article is only weakly supported by the "sources" in any event. This may be a valid stereotype. But I'd like to see evidence that it <i>is</i> verifiable, i.e. <i>that there are reliable sources available that editors can use for constructing a verifiable and neutral article on the subject</i>. There have been attempts to make <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a> more verifiable, and less a collection of mere original research added by random Wikipedia editors, and the article now sports a (scant) few reliable sources. It needs to be demonstrated that the same <i>is at least possible</i> for this article. That hasn't actually been done yet.

<li>To retort Uncle G's comments, the "Ah beng and Ah Lian" phenomenon is well documented in Singapore, and there're plenty of cultural references to them in local newspapers and context.

<li>You are conflating attestation (which is what a dictionary would ask for) with verification. All that that link gives is an example of the phrase "Ah Beng" (which is not even the title of the article under discussion) being used in a sentence. It doesn't actually tell us what an Ah Beng <i>is</i>, let alone what an Ah Lian is.
<p>So I ask again: How are readers supposed to verify an encyclopaedia article that purports to tell them <i>what an Ah Lian is</i>? So far, all that we've had that actually attempts to describe the concept are dictionaries that are by their own admission humourous. Please cite a source, that doesn't say "This is just for fun-lah!" or "This is a Satirical Humour Website" right at the top of the page, telling us what an Ah Lian is. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:51, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Those are <i>quotations</i>, that a dictionary uses to show a word actually in use, not references. That's more like a reliable source. It professes to be a serious attampt at a Singlish dictionary. The fact that it <i>is</i> a dictionary, however, does mean that there's less than one sentence of information about Ah Lians there, because that's all that the dictionary entry gives us, and everything in the current article, all of the text that purports to describe fashion, jobs, music, and language, must be excised as having no reliable sources supporting it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:51, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Isn't quotations that the word is in use from a reputable source proof enough that a) the term is verifiable, and also, b) these terms <i>are</i> defined: <i>He says he doesn’t give a hoot if people call him an ah beng, <b>a catch-all term for the uncouth, the uneducated, the unrefined, the unenlightened, who blindly define status by the brands they own.</b> .. “I’m the king of bengs,” he laughs, “I have my own Prada bag, Prada shoes, Prada jacket, Gucci belt, clothes from Calvin Klein, Armani, Valentino..”</i> (Cleo, May 1999)</li>
<li>If that's what you are asking for, a dictionary on Singlish terms published by OUP or Cambridge before you call something verifiable, then I'm afraid you won't be able to find any. Ditto with any dialect terms used in a third-world country. What is <i>verifiable</i> of course, is that such terms <i>are</i> in use (proven), and to me that's good enough to persuade anyone that such terms should stay in Wikipedia. Unless you think there's a universal hoax going on, I can tell you the description of this term is pretty accurate here, and unless you think a book publisher has more integrity than several Wikipedians here, and not one, you have to take someone's word for it.</li>
<li>Using your same argument, so, if an obscure movie is shown to exist in IMDB, we still shouldn't include it because none of us have watched it, and we can't take the word of those who have, right? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 14:18, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

The criticism of the current quality level of the prose, and of the verifiability of the content may be valid, but that is an argument for cleanup, for placing <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> tags, for refactoring... not deletion. To omit this term is to be, in my view, unencyclopedic.

<li><b>Leave Posted</b> - Bundy was placed on the list of notable Penn State people, and the article was placed on the Wikipedia because of the presence of his name on the noteable people list. He is the director of the single largest organization at the Pennsylvania State University and a nationally-renound marching band.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I am unclear why this article is up for deletion. As a newer user of Wiki, I am not familiar with your short hand of "per nomination." I was also unable to find it in the articles for deletion. However, I believe I found reasons to keep this page. Dr. Bundy is listed on the list famous Penn Staters which can be found here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_State_University_people" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_State_University_people" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_State_University_people</a></p>
<p>I do not understand how this can be deemed as not notable. I say this article stays posted on the following grounds:</p>
<p>• Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers</p>
<p>• Recording musicians who have sold more than 5,000 albums, CDs, or similar recordings (see WikiProject Music's Notability and Music Guidelines)</p>
<p>• Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:</p>
<p>o Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers</p>
<p>o A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following o An independent biography</p>
<p>o Name recognition</p>
<p>o Commercial endorsements</p>
<p>• Dr. Bundy is the leader of the largest organization at Penn State, the Penn State Blue Band. This 300 member strong marching band is known not only to the 40,000 students enrolled at Penn State, but regularly play to over 100,000 different people per week during football season, and it is no secret that he is the director. Through his leadership, the band was featured at Marc Jacobs Fall 2005 Fashion show in New York City. <a href="http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/S2006RTW/review/MJACOBS" class="external free" title="http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/S2006RTW/review/MJACOBS" rel="nofollow">http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/S2006RTW/review/MJACOBS</a> • www.marcjacobs.com • • HIS band was also featured in an advertisement in the December issue Vogue Magazine along with Kiera Knightley • <a href="http://live.psu.edu/story/14756" class="external free" title="http://live.psu.edu/story/14756" rel="nofollow">http://live.psu.edu/story/14756</a> • <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/news/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1133259840146320.xml&amp;coll=1" class="external free" title="http://www.pennlive.com/news/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1133259840146320.xml&amp;coll=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.pennlive.com/news/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1133259840146320.xml&amp;coll=1</a> • This year, the Sudler Trophy, the “Heisman Trophy for marching bands,” was awarded to the Blue Band, again under his direction. • The Blue Band has released numerous albums over Dr. Bundy’s tenure at Penn State. These albums have certainly sold more than 5000 copies, as a few of the older ones are out of print.</p>

<p>Hello, it seems you are intent on deleting this article because:</p>
<p>1. It is nothing but an attack on the subject ( {db-attack} )<br />
2. It is a 'non-encyclopedic advertisement'<br /></p>
<p>I am left confused as to how it can be both. It is merely a profile of a very popular pub across the street from a very popular institute. As my colleague Dr. Fusia put it:</p>
<p>"Patented nonesense my ass. That's perfectly relevant, and if anybody uses wikipedia, it's the GT crowd.</p>
<p>Snobby wikipedia bastards."</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> After an incredible barrage of trigger-happy speedy deletes, the article seems to have stabilized. I think it is a poor reflection on us that the contributor's pleas for time to expand the article were ignored. I have attempted to bring the article up to standards. After researching the building's history, I have not found any great notability. This article is certainly not the least notable on Wikipedia, but its deletion wouldn't be a great loss either. If the result is keep, I'll add a photo. -<a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESCEhardt_7145.html" title="User:SCEhardt"><font color="blue">SCEhard</font></a><a href="../../../s/c/e/User_talk%7ESCEhardt_f6c3.html" title="User talk:SCEhardt"><font color="#3D9140"><b>T</b></font></a> 20:45, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, this was an interesting second Wikipedia experiment. You might want to delete my original posting too, it is pretty non-notable:</li>

<p>Anyways, I suggest you make an adjustment to your site policy. In 'Criteria for speedy deletion', it states&#160;:<br /></p>
<p>"Note that some Wikipedians create articles in multiple saves. Avoid deleting a page too soon after its initial creation, as the author may be working on it."</p>
<p>Since it was obviously the speedy deletion chain of events, and not the non-notability that got this article deleted ( as evidenced by the existance of the Figo article ), perhaps you can further quantify your standards for speedy deletion. For example, replace "too soon" with "within 2 hours".</p>
<p>~~~~Original Poster<br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Also, where can I find the policy on "Non-Notable". I didn't see it on WP:NOT.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know, I am starting to think I am in the right here. From WP:ISNOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>"Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style."</p>
<p>Also, the following sentence:</p>
<p>"Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" companies are not likely to be acceptable."</p>
<p>The thrird party in this case was the administrator who helped contributing information to the page.</p>

<p>Nom &amp; vote <b>Del</b> on this bio of a 39-y.o. (nearly-)Average Joe Professor, who is unusual but not notable in having in his late 20s completed his education in his native Russia and apparently become a Costa Rican citizen.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b>: In case someone thinks that is <i>unusual</i> enough to be notable, we deserve more research before taking it into acct:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ If his mother were Russian and his father a Latin-American, it would be significantly <i>less</i> unusual. And while anomie that provokes a "search for one's roots" does not preclude notability, it is usually a profound distraction from achieving things that constitute notability.</dd>
<dd>_ _ In that case and in light of the surname, evaluating the full picture might require knowing whether the parents were married to each other. However, i think i recall that Soviet-era women predominantly kept their surnames on marrying; i don't recall anything about the surnames of their children, except that <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a>'s sons <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakov_Dzhugashvili_2d76.html" title="Yakov Dzhugashvili">Yakov Dzhugashvili</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasily_Dzhugashvili_000c.html" title="Vasily Dzhugashvili">Vasily Dzhugashvili</a> by his two wives used his birth-surname, and his (disaffected) daughter <a href="../../../s/v/e/Svetlana_Alliluyeva_e1dd.html" title="Svetlana Alliluyeva">Svetlana Alliluyeva</a> used her mother's.</dd>
<dd>_ _ IMO the bio's surname could be
<ol>
<li>a Russian father's surname,</li>
<li>the Russianization of a Latin-American surname, or</li>
<li>the masculine form of a feminine surname that i assume would be Fëdorova or Fedorova.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>IMO #3 could possibly be the approach used in surnaming the male child of some absent fathers.<br />

I always try to add a brief note to all authors whose articles I AfD, and many CSD ones too, giving instructions on how to undo the causes of an AfD and offering help and advice in future via my talk page. But the 'pedia is being unhelpful with this one - every visit to the talk page is getting me a Wikimedia Foundation error. Someone, somewhere doesn't want me to in this case (and it's frustrating!).

<li>The article as it stands mainly comprises requests for people to come and support the team, and an unattributed non-neutral opinion that it needs a "decent captain". I tried to rewrite the article from sources, but came up empty handed when I looked for some sources. The only things that I found were a news report stating little more than that this is one in a list of football teams, and a directory entry on a web site where most of the fields were not filled in. If this were a company, it would fail the primary <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> notability criterion by a huge margin. No-one independent of the team has written anything substantial at all about it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It would be ridiculous to include the name of every bit part actor into the Barney article. The article must either stand alone or be deleted as non-notable. I am neutral given that the actor does have an IMDB entry (as per MacGyverMagic) but appears to have few credits. In my opinion, it is a borderline situation. I am inclined say keep the article as it is factually true and the notability is questionable, but it does seem absurd to make Wikipedia into a repository of information on every actor ever to play even a handful of small roles. Again, I am neutral, except in that I must say that a merge is out of the question. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 23:48, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an article about the owner of the world's largest rabbit. There are two possibilies here. Both mean that we should <b>Delete</b>. 1) It is a complete hoax (look at the picture). 2) The original article claimed that the rabbit was 26 pounds and 7 ounces.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Until this urban legend is listed on Snopes, there's no chance that this is more than a story someone concocted.

<li>Sure, I definitely see where you all are coming from, but don't be so hasty to delete. This may be an issue of "SpeedaMay" being misspelled (certainly seems like an odd word and I didn't get any Google results either). Also, Snopes doesn't exactly list everything, although they ARE a valuable resource (and I share it with my students in English). This may indeed be nonsense, but further research is needed, I think, before deletion is necessary. 172.173.36.198 01:41, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article cites no sources, and (like <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">Peruvianllama</a>) I can find no sources. The article also directly implies, by stating that there has been no media coverage and that <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Legends_Reference_Pages_ed46.html" title="Urban Legends Reference Pages">Snopes</a> hasn't documented this, that there are no sources to be found.

<dd><b>comment</b> the city was added into the article on <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Egypt_ea6a.html" title="Memphis, Egypt">Memphis, Egypt</a> (nb - this was added by the same author). It say that the modern name for the place is Mit-Rahineh, which is a real archaeological site. It's worth noting, though, that the editor's additions to that page are... well... not brilliant (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Memphis%2C_Egypt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29711217" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Memphis%2C_Egypt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29711217" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>), and no text I have found onliune referring to Mit-rahineh mentions this alternative name.

<li><b>Analyze</b>. User 160.39.129.27 -- with no previous edits -- created several large articles about one <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Turney_Stewart_15b5.html" title="Alexander Turney Stewart">Alexander Turney Stewart</a> in about 30 minutes. Some thoughts: (1) They are obviously copied from an existing document -- no one can type that fast -- which raises but does not prove copyvio. (2) What the person did was create several articles named: <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Turney_Stewart_15b5.html" title="Alexander Turney Stewart">Alexander Turney Stewart</a>, 1 Stewart's Early Years, 2 His Road To Success..., 4 Later Years, 5 Death And Influence, and 6 References. So we need to treat those as one issue. Some of those have been speedied, some VfD'd, and some just with merge or warning tags. I don't know what's going on here either. Our boy's a but rash, but this is not neccesarily vandalism or copyvio, and we might end up with a good article about Alexander Turney Stewart out of all this. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 23:02, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

Follow how quickly I make edits on here, and how many big edits I've made in the past 2 weeks. I'm sure its comparable with the amount that this person made.

<li>OK, so why are people without verifiable sources in there at all? Surely they should have been deleted long ago. If the list is as you state, surely the fundamentals of WP require that the collaborative project takes a firm grip on something with such obvious potential to go out of control?

<dd>This list was fairly recently split off from the LSD article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Having a list of notable people who comment on the experience, but then having to put the names on the talk page due to lack of verifiability, makes absolutly no sense.

<li><b>Note</b>. There is a category <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category.html" title="Category">Hallucinogen researchers, users, and proponents</a>, population 31.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with the sentiment that a list of famous people who have commented on LSD experiences is of more interest than a list of famous people who have commented on being stung by a jellyfish. Generally speaking, people don't often mention being stung because it's merely a minor inconvenience, whereas LSD trips usually have more far-reaching, profound effects on one's life. If some of the assertions are false, let the subjects remove themselves from the page; otherwise, the topic was of enough interest to me to click on the link, and I'm sure many others would be interested to know Steve Jobs's opinion on the drug. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDontknockmysmock_6c68.html" title="User:Dontknockmysmock">Dontknockmysmock</a></li>
<li><s><b>Undecided</b></s> the title sucks, the concept is flawed (the list is pretty pointless without the context of why they commented and what comment they made), false additions may be actionable so <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is crucial, but in the end there are some people (like <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_K_Dick_3e06.html" title="Philip K Dick">Philip K Dick</a> who are known for having experimented with, and talked about, LSD. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:42, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just followed up a sample; they vary from Bill Bailey, whose "comments" are mainly jokes (and pretty much universally thought not to be among his better ones), to Dick Feynman, who professed to be embarrassed about it. Apparently. (I don't remember that from his books) So without context this is appears to me to be a <i>seriously</i> pointless list. How would people feel about a list of people who tried smoking when they were at college, but didn't really take to it? The ones that made a big deal of it, like Timothy Leary (immortalised in song by the Moody Blues) are well enough known. I am struggling to see the point of this article. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:51, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> it is. Here's why:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>For what value of "comment"? Would "I never had an LSD experience" count? Where on the scale from "none of your business" to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Leary_7ce7.html" title="Timothy Leary">Timothy Leary</a> is the cutoff point? What did Syd Barrett <i>comment</i> about LSD? As far as I'm aware he is a recluse, and while he was not a recluse I don't recall him being coherent for long enough to make any comment, so <i>what was the supposed comment</i> in this case of this extensively-documented figure?</li>
<li>For what value of "notable"? Are only people with blue links included? No. Nor is there any guarantee that normal WP standards of notability are being applied. If only <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> candidates are included, why not a category so that authors on the person's article know they've been included and can verify the information?</li>
<li>For what value of "experience"? As medication? As experiment? As life-changing influence? As "me-too" experimentation back in the 60s?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>But most of all, whatever the level of verifiability and original research involved, that does this article <i>actually</i> tell us about either LSD or the people involved? In what way does it add to our understanding of Bill Gates to have him lumped in with Philip K. Dick? Does this finally explain Microsoft Bob? Not as such: all it tells us is that Gates is a baby boomer. It is every bit as relevant as list of people who admit to having worn flares (in fact, to a first approximation, it's the same list).</dd>
<dd>If this article told me about the LSD experience and how it defined the writing of PKD then it might be interesting, but that's not what it is.

<dd>It tells us much more about cultural connections between people and their culture. the 60s was a time of great upheaval, and a list such as this can help to show who changed, how things changed, and etc. LSD and what people think about it has ramifications far beyond cleaning my drier of lint.

<dd>Not really. No more than experimenting with smoking or E does, anyway.

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. I'm not sure if the other teams you mention above are notable enough to stay either, but as per your request, one way to improve the page would be to make a similar "Notable Achievements" section like they all have. Better still (and probably the only way to save the page at this point) would be a "References" section in which you provide links to outside sources about the group (e.g. newspaper articles). Wikipedia has a requirement that information be verifiable. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 03:19, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, I have to admit no one has ever written about us earnestly in a publication that is credible (the school newspaper is so terrible, I can not, would not, shall not dare to post a page of it. An example is the fact that they refer to African-Americans as "coloureds"). Well, I suppose that's all then. If you delete our page, then please don't delete the other clans' articles. They are, at least- "<b>remarkable</b>". Saintboy 04:20, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> since MMORPG clans do not express importance in Wikipedia. Also, no other clans of CounterStrike are created, so why this?
