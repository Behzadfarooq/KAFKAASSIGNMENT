<li><b>Comment</b>I am one of the original members of the UCLA branch of The Puya. I have attended all Puyapalooza celebrations since their inception. I have contributed funds to The Puya's UCLA UNICAMP fund raising efforts. I have also made many contributions to The Puya's website.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The Puya is a welcoming club that draws people in with open arms and discriminates against none. Local events promote networking, unity, and everything else that The Puya embodies. The history of The Puya should be documented for future clubs and for people wondering what The Puya is. <a href="../../../m/t/n/User%7EMtnsurfer_dd15.html" title="User:Mtnsurfer">Mtnsurfer</a> 17:01, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As a member of The Puya, I object strongly to this deletion. I have attended Puyapalooza celebrations, and received from fellow The Puya members my original inspiration for the student group I founded at UCLA, [<a href="http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/articles.asp?id=31486" class="external text" title="http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/articles.asp?id=31486" rel="nofollow">the Bruin Nerds</a>]. The Puya is an inspiration to all of us, and should remain on Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As a member of UCLA's The Puya and a counselor as a student and alumnus at UCLA Unicamp, I started The Puya club at Tulane University as a graduate student. During Spring Break 2006, I hosted USC law and Loyola Law The Puya students at my apartment who came to New Orleans for their Legal Aid Projects.<a href="http://lawweb.usc.edu/sconnect/KatrinaPresentation.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://lawweb.usc.edu/sconnect/KatrinaPresentation.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> additionally, I organized the New Orleans version of Puyapalooza, whose proceeds were of course donated to UCLA Unicamp.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>I am the founder and president of the Computer Recycling Club at Diamond Bar High School. I have worked with the The Puya on several occasions, and the club has helped our club with finding and restoring dozens of computers. All of the members of The Puya have been very generous and helpful, and all of us at the Computer Recycling Club would like to thank The Puya members for their hard work and dedication. I would object strongly to the deletion of The Puya from Wikipedia because it is a great club which inspires many to help others. --Rishi Kumar</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>as an original member of The Puya(UCLA), I enjoyed every meeting, and every puyapalloza. I have helped raise money for Unicamp. I was also vice-chairman for the original puyapalooza, assuring the safety and security of the chairman, as well as the event. There are many things to add and talk about that i would like to save for the wiki site. please add The Puya!! myspace.com/wilkesey</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am appealing to the good will of the Wikipedians. Yes, it is true that 7 years ago, this whole The Puya thing started off as a joke. It was complete nonsense, two guys getting together to hang out, became three guys, four members, eight, and so on. But pretty soon, we had enough people where we formed a club. It was something like <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_club.html" title="Fight club">fight club</a>, or a fraternity. Our goal was not to just hang out and drink, but we planned events like block parties, tailgates, etc.. it was what you would expect from undergrads.</li>
</ul>
<p>As our members graduated and went on to either the working class or grad school, they started the group on their own campuses or workplaces.</p>
<p>As we grew and matured, we found ourselves involved in many activities. For example, people at Cal helped join a protest against the Armenian genocide, some at UCLA volunteered for UniCamp, while others were inspired to start their own groups. Nevertheless, the whole project and spirit of the group has been marred by never having any legitimacy. Sure we had t-shirts, but that's not enough. Our goal is to legitimize the group so that when we have an activity or event, we will be recognized. Because up until now, whenever we mentioned our group, everyone thought it was a joke. But it isnt. For example, during the Armenian genocide protest at Cal, when asked what group the members where from, and they said "The Puya," the writer laughed and refused to name our group. It has been an uphill battle to gain our legitimacy. Just because we are not mentioned in an article, does not meen our members did not participate.</p>
<p>Yes it is true that if you google "The Puya" you might find articles about the founder, puya. But that does not mean the group does not exist. We have set up a myspace group, and will be setting up groups on friendster and facebook to show our membership.</p>
<p>We are not a local college club, unless your definition of local includes <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Fransico_fcab.html" title="San Fransico">San Fransico</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Barbara_58f3.html" title="Santa Barbara">Santa Barbara</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>.--65.88.178.10 19:27, 4 May 2006 (UTC) --Thepuya 19:28, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
