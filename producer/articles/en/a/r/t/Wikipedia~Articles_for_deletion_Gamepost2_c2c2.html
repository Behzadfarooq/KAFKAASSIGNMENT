<p>The Game Revolution gamepost is a forum for many people and it discusses many important topics. Not only does it keep up to date on everything videogame, but it has made strong friendships and even brought lovers together. The site is very important in the lives of many, and this page will give a history to ease the burden of retelling the story over and over. It will become more insightful as the history is written and will be very useful to hundreds of people. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.62.15.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.62.15.170_4a4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.62.15.170">contribs</a>) UTC 16:00, 30 October 2005.</small></p>

<li>I understand where you're coming from, and please understand that this is not a slight on your community. If you want to document the history of your community, that's entirely understandable and even commendable. Go for it. However, Wikipedia is not the place to do it; it's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host_or_webspace_provider" title="WP:NOT">not a free webhost provider</a>. Generally speaking, "useful to hundreds of people" is not really enough to warrant inclusion to Wikipedia, unless it's a particularly obscure, yet notable topic. Gamepost, in the end, simply yet another web forum, and while I don't mean to belittle its significance to you, I must say that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, it's simply not big and influential enough to merit mention, any more than my personal blog or the various online forums I've been known to hang out at are; just because they're important to me, that doesn't mean that the rest of the world cares. That may sound cold, but please understand that I'm not trying to offend. We're building an encyclopedia, not a place where relatively small communities can showcase themselves. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:46, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about other forums that get mention such as Neowin? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Don Gero (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Don_Gero_b45b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Don Gero">contribs</a>) UTC 03:08, 31 October 2005.</small>
<ul>
<li>Please sign your comments. You can do that by typing out four tildes, like this: ~~~~. That'll leave your username (or IP address) and the time when you left the comment -- that way everyone knows who said what. And to answer your actual question, I'm not actually all that familiar with Neowin, but judging by its article, it is a far more notable forum than Gamepost is. Honestly, it should be fairly obvious why this is the case, but since you ask, I'm going to quote a couple of relevant bits from the article: <i>"Powered by Invision Power Board forum software, Neowin has an active technology forum consisting of 118,979 registered users (October 26, 2005) and more than 5 million posts."</i> That's a lot of users right there. Compared to Gamepost's 10,000+ users, that's a whole different order of magnitude. Size does matter. One of their articles has also been the <i>"most viewed story on Slashdot ever"</i> -- not a <i>huge</i> claim to fame, but that's not easily pulled off, either. Apparently, theirs is a fairly influential webforum, and a very, very significant number of people go there for their Windows-related news. (Note that as 118,979 is just the number of <i>registered</i> users, it's likely that far more people actively follow it.) Gamepost, on the other hand, is not readily distinguishable from numerous other game forums. Also, please note that Neowin's <i>forums</i> do not have an article of their own. In fact, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game-Revolution_0fbd.html" title="Game-Revolution">Game-Revolution</a> already has an article on Wikipedia, and that's not going anywhere (though it could certainly use some work). The current consensus to merge the articles means that the (relevant and notable) information on the current Gamepost article is preserved and moved to Game-Revolution, so it's not like Gamepost is getting treated any different from Neowin. (Of course, if the forums themselves <i>are</i> somehow notable enough to deserve an article all their own, please tell us why this is so; if you can do that, I'm sure that we're more than willing to revise our votes. It's not an uncommon thing to happen during the AfD process, though I should probably point out that generally we favor hard facts over emotional pleas.) Hope this helps. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 03:53, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
