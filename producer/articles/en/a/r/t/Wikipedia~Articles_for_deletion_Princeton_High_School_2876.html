<li><b>Delete.</b> Useless collection of generic facts about an insignificant school. This is not an encyclopedia article.

<li>Delete: as per the deletion policy and general consensus on Wikipedia. Unless the article demonstrates that this particular high school is significant among high schools, it has no identity and cannot be discussed. Every donut shop "affects thousands of lives," as does every phone book, every traffic light, etc. Rows of things performing identical functions are not responsible for nor creditable with the individual experiences of that function. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:20, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>This donut shop analogy is kinda surreal. Anyway if there was a general consensus to delete high schools, schoolwatch would get them all deleted instead of the reverse. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:30, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That may be your opinion and you are entitled to it, but at least in Illinois applying the word "common" to IB programs would be a real stretch. And as long as we are stating opinions, I think to put a school stub on VfD <b>two minutes</b> after it is created is absolutely ridiculous. The whole purpose of any stub is to create an article. Regardless of whether a school should be "notable" to get an article, I would venture to say (again, only my opinion) that most people who are voting to delete are doing so on the content of the stub without any investigation of the "notability" of the school. Give it time to develop, IMO. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 14:39, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> I understand the merge--I can understand someone wanting to do that--but why delete? Redirects are cheap and anyone typing or wikying to the name of the school would still get a link to the information. So why delete the redirect? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:07, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Good question, and having done a quick google I think the name should be used as a disambig (linking to the education sections in the geographical articles rather than redlinks), since there appear to be numerous high schools in the US with that name. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 09:04, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I teach at the school - and in fact began this article on 5/22/05, then posted a link to it on my webpage asking my students (those from the advanced placement and IB program mentioned in the article) to improve upon it. They have begun to do so already. The school is significant within the Cincinnati area and within Ohio - just having been named #1 fund-raising school in the nation for Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma (raising over $35,000 this year) and having a student score a perfect 2400 on the recent SAT. The article needs improvement, yes, but not deletion. As a rookie, I am thoroughly open to advice - particlarly from the user who mentioned that the article title was incorrect. Just checked the BEEEFSTEW page and understand a bit better. Gimme a couple of days to write a better article before evaluating, please. --<a href="../../../p/h/s/User%7EPhschemguy_08e5.html" title="User:Phschemguy">phschemguy</a> 08:38, May 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
