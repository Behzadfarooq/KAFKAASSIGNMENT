<p>Unreferenced. Policy says articles must be attributed to published sources.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If there is doubt that a topic is real, then the lack of sources can be used to remove quickly. But this is a notable enough fetish and someone else can go hunting for so-called "published" sources (an extremely outdated and 20th century term, incidentally. People need to understand that online sources are just as viable in 2007; this is not a sign of support for the particular sources currently cited in this article). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:24, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ski, I am quoting policy. Articles on wikipedia must be backed and back-able by "reliable sources".

I have added a reference to the article and have referred the article to someone more knowledgeable in this area than I in order to reference some of the specific information that has been moved to the talk page. Some of the information that was moved probably shouldn't have been as it is relevant and based upon recurring topics of discussion within some of the pages listed under "external links" (and it makes it much harder for that material to subsequently become referenced as it's somewhat "hidden"). Much of the information that needs citing can probably be found within those links, however I do not currently have time to look through the sites that the links point to in order to find it (nor do I particularly care to as this sort of thing is not my "bag," as they say). <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 01:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The nominator of this article has nominated a number of articles about non-orthodox sexual practices, and succeeding in deleting some of them. As anyone who uses an uncensored version of the internet knows, they are all of them in use, they all of them are discussed, and there are abundant illustrations, fictional and real. I do not want to speculate on others' motives. I think I know my own: they are most of them not things I find personally appealing, except in an anthropological sense. In that sense I find all human behavior interesting, &amp; wish to know about it -- from a safe distance--and I think that people in general do or at least should also find that nothing human is alien to them. An encyclopedia is a relatively safe place. It is better that young people first discover these thing here than on the open web, and I wish such resources had been available to me.</li>

<dd>Obviously, the sources will be a little different from the usual ones. But many of the cultural phenomena today have sources that are not quite the conventional published sources, and it is time WP acknowledged it. We are finding ourselves in the ironic role of having been one of the makers of this change, but not recognizing it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think I just said: "...I also admit that I did little to search...". Given the body of work out there, <i>someone, somewhere,</i> has likely commented on it. In fact, it is the subject of one part of the book Deviant Desires (the lone ref in the article currently). So, someone has added a reliable source. More likely exist. Just because I don't choose to make this <i>my</i> topic of research currently doesn't mean the article should be deleted. Attribution requires that <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source...</i>. This material is attributable (and one ref so far attributes it). It's also pretty obvious that when the subject is sexual fetish, the NYT or WSJ aren't going to run front page stories concerning the subject. This pushes our given requirements for "reliability" to their limit and takes longer to find such valid sources. I don't think it's unreasonable to keep this article until more of these hidden resources are found. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 12:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is my opinion that this article meets the burden of attribution, reliable sourcing, and/or verifiability (depending on which way the wind is blowing through wiki-policy right now). As such I hope the submitter and/or closing admin takes note of the current state of the article and ask that above editors reconsider their comments in light of the recent changes made to the article that address all criticism in the nomination.
