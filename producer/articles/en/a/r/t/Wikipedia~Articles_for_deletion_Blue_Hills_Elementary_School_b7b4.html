<li><b>Weak Keep</b> (all). Although all of the articles have little to no encyclopedic value, it is always important to keep in mind the school-related argument, which Silensor laid out very well.

<li><b>Keep</b> based of precedents. (I won't object if <i>all</i> elementary and middle schools were deleted) Faria is consistently ranked no.1 in CA, so it's notable in itw own right.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 05:15, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>. Please try to have some clue what the standards and precedents are before mass nominating articles that you don't like. Please also read the deletion policy, in which you will find that "non-notable" is not a criterion for deletion. Nor is having few sentences. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:48, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whoa there champ. There is no reason to be <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">uncivil</a>. My nomination was made <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">in good faith</a>, and you have no reason to believe otherwise. This is the first Afd nomination that I've ever made for schools and I would appreciate it if you wouldn't <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite the newcomer</a>. Whether or not I like the articles is irrelavant. As <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> indicated above with his reference to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments</a> there are both arguments for and against keeping the schools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I did take the time to look into the precedents of schools, relying mainly on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>. <strike>Please note that I did not nominate any of the high schools in the district as there does appear to be clear precedent that high schools are notable.</strike> Also please note that <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> states "It has 3 or more full and complete sentences of verifiable, factual information that is not published solely by the school itself..."

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, there are no high schools in the district, so I don't see how you can nominate them for deletion. <a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_f4f5.html" title="User:SFGiants">Ï‚×¤×§Î¹</a><a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_Esperanza_5f28.html" title="User:SFGiants/Esperanza"><font color="green">Ð”</font></a><a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_f4f5.html" title="User:SFGiants">Ð˜Ï„Ï‚</a> <a href="../../../s/f/g/User_talk%7ESFGiants_c3b8.html" title="User talk:SFGiants">â˜º</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7ESFGiants_1766.html" title="Special:Contributions:SFGiants">â˜»</a> 00:43, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good point. I didn't bother looking for high schools because of the precedent. I didn't realize that there weren't any high schools in the district. I've striken the statement.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarkbhm_d473.html" title="User:Clarkbhm">ClarkBHM</a> 01:14, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding non-notability, I was relying on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&amp;oldid=43281604|an" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&amp;oldid=43281604|an" rel="nofollow">answer to a question that I asked at the helpdesk</a> regarding the "AfD Policy for churches". The response states "Of course, non-notable churches should be deleted. The same goes for non-notable people, buildings, etc. Problem is that not everyone agrees what is notable." Given this instruction, I was to believe that non-notable subjects should be deleted. Heck, its even part of the A7 vanity speedy criterion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the end, if there is consensus to keep them, that's fine. If there is consensus to delete them, that's fine too. If there's no consensus at all, that's also fine. Based on the information that I had available, I nominated them for deletion. Everyone is welcome to disagree, but I only ask that you remain <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civil</a>. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarkbhm_d473.html" title="User:Clarkbhm">ClarkBHM</a> 14:47, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I am a parent with a child starting kindergarten this year in CUSD, and I am hungry for every bit of information on prospective schools. This year Murdock-Portal hosted information meetings for over a thousand parents, as did Faria A-Plus. I dare say that many of them, like I, have found and enjoyed these pages, and would like to keep them for parents who will come in the future. <small>â€”This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.141.183.253 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.141.183.253_9b81.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.141.183.253">contribs</a>) 00:35, 26 March 2006.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> AFD stands for *Articles* for deletion. So templates shouldn't be icnluded. Also, using the tag on them, makes a mess. The nomination is therefore invalid. Anyways, verifiable real schools are individually notable. If there's an issue of verifiability, than that warrants individual attention per article, not a group nom (and I would consider such an arguement, if made properly). But the nom hasn't discussed verifiability, so I'll assume that wasn't their concern, and hence they have no relevant issue worthy of consideration. The nominator has misread <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> which calls for merges of very short articles, not deletion (and it's not even a guideline, anyhow). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: The templates and category have been removed from this AFD, as they do not belong. So, now, one can read the article, without seeing multiple AFD messages in one article (which is patently absurd). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:13, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>. I wouldn't object to deleting some of them, but some schools - Faria, Kennedy, Miller, among others are quite notable. So, per <a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a>, I guess. -- Jjjsixsix <sup>(t)</sup>/<sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jjjsixsix_2e5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jjjsixsix">c</a>)</sub> <small>@</small> 21:26, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
