<p>Every town in ireland has a GAA Club, this list is basicly a list of towns of Ireland . Most of the links dont go too GAA clubs or information that is relevant. I speedy deleted but contributors raised a fuss, so I nominated. Gator (talk) 13:35, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yes there are a few Town Name GAA Club's, but there is also more like: Na Piarsaigh and St. Vincents.

<li><b>keep</b> Its maturing as we debate, links are being added, hurling only clubs are being deleted. It is not simply a list of towns in Ireland. Some city clubs have little to do with geography, alot of parishes have no teams, some parishes have teams with a name not the same as the parish itself and some places have joined with other areas to create a team. This is not a list of towns in Ireland. It will make a good list ...at least if i have anything to do with it&#160;:)<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleutherius_c8f6.html" title="User:Eleutherius">Eleutherius</a> 17:39, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and maintain. As Eleutherius says, the list is evolving, and the more information that is added, the better. Eleutherius, DarranC and KaptKos have explained that GAA clubs do not necessarily map 1:1 onto towns or parishes. A couple of other points: 1) In some parts of Ireland, only one of Gaelic football or hurling is played, and in some areas there will be separate clubs for the two games, but many GAA clubs will have both Gaelic football and hurling sections within the same club. I think there is an argument either for changing the name to List of GAA Clubs, indicating if necessary whether a particular club is hurling or football-only or dual, or alternatively for setting up a separate List of Hurling Clubs. 2) As far as links go, where the club is notable enough in its own right to merit a Wikipedia entry (e.g. <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossmaglen_Rangers_7fe4.html" title="Crossmaglen Rangers">Crossmaglen Rangers</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/_/Na_Fianna_CLG_f0fe.html" title="Na Fianna CLG">Na Fianna CLG</a>) then the link is straightforward. If the club doesn't have an article of its own, I see no harm in placing the link to the geographical area (parish, town, suburb) where it's located, especially if there's no club website currently available to be linked to (e.g. in the Leitrim listing, clubs like Allen Gaels (<a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumshanbo.html" title="Drumshanbo">Drumshanbo</a>) or Seán O'Heslins (<a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballinamore.html" title="Ballinamore">Ballinamore</a>) are associated with particular towns or villages but those aren't indicated by the club names). 3) There are a set of articles for county GAA structures, e.g. <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longford_GAA_3920.html" title="Longford GAA">Longford GAA</a>. Links could be included to them from the county headings. (One long-term solution might be to move the county lists to the respective county GAA articles, but it's a decision that we could come to a consensus about at a later stage - but the list should not be deleted.)

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../g/a/a/GAA_7b12.html#The_GAA_today" title="GAA">GAA#The_GAA_today</a> suggests that this list, if completed, would be over 3,000 items long, far too broad for one single list as described in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Appropriate_topics_for_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists_(stand-alone_lists)#Appropriate_topics_for_lists</a>.

Also, because it is limited to those in well defined leagues, it's easily verifable that all the clubs are there, is that going to be possible here also? My memory of playing club football in Ireland was that it was often knockout based, rather than league, so teams could easily join and leave, be created/merge, different team name in the same parish depending on age group, etc. so there was never a well defined list of clubs for any area. It's the lack of well defined listings that make the two lists so different for me. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 14:33, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
