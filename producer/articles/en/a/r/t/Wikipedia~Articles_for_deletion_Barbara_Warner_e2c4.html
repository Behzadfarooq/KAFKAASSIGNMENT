<p>I submit that this person's middling past success as a political candidate and current aspirations do not rise to the level of encyclopedic, no matter who her father was.</p>
<p><s>Also, the link to her campagin page suggests to me that this is being set up for promotional purposes, and my first attempt to put this up there was removed, strongly suggesting someone knows I'm right</s>.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Checking the page's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Warner&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Warner&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> it's evident that your statement that your "first attempt to put this up there was removed" is false. More likely there was a problem with your cache. Perhaps, in future, you should actually make sure that your accusations are correct before you make them?</p>
<p>I suggest you address the article on its own merits or lack thereof rather than attack editors and impugn their motives. My motivation for adding the article is that I read on a discussion board that she was running for the NDP nomination in Toronto Danforth (an important nomination as the riding is currently held by the NDP). Therefore, this makes her notable, at least for the moment (particularly as there are no other candidates for the nomination, at least none that I know of. Therefore: <b>Keep</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- There's nothing notable here. If she doesn't win the nomination, or does win the nomination but fails to win the seat, then there would really be no point in having this article -- to me, that just proves that this article is premature until this woman has actually been elected to something. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 12:01, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> until she wins a seat.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Political candidates are not notable in themselves unless they have another claim to fame. Ms Warner doesn't appear to have other claims to fame or notability. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 18:35, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is some disagreement on Wikipedia about how to handle politicians — some take the view that a person isn't notable unless and until they win, while others believe that balance requires permitting articles for every individual who stood as a candidate. In this case, however, the facts as we have them are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Inasmuch as it's looking like the federal election is imminent, it hasn't actually been called yet, and by extension the byelection to replace <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Churley_71af.html" title="Marilyn Churley">Marilyn Churley</a> hasn't been called yet since it's conditional on the date of Churley's resignation.</li>
<li>Warner is the only declared candidate for the NDP nomination <i>to date</i>; this doesn't necessarily imply that she's guaranteed to be the NDP candidate on the byelection ballot, as the actual nomination meeting isn't going to happen until after the byelection is called, which also leaves time for other candidates to throw their hats in the ring.</li>
<li>Any number of things could happen between now and the election. Churley could change her mind; the whole thing could be postponed by some last-minute deal; etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, I really don't see how this could be kept at the present time. <b>Delete</b>, albeit <b>without prejudice</b> against recreation if future events warrant. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:07, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Possible compromise: once she wins the nomination (as she almost certainly will), create a "candidates in by-elections" section on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_candidates%2C_2003_Ontario_provincial_election_6649.html" title="New Democratic Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election">New Democratic Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election</a> page, and move her bio there. If she wins the seat, return the bio to a separate page. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 22:39, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, major party candidates, especially ones that have a good chance of winning, are verifiable and of interest to readers. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 22:50, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, also strong object to "unless wins" criteria. While there are certainly non notable candidates, there are also candidates who are notable even if they do not win. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a> 03:19, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that there are nomination candidates who are notable prior to the nomination vote. But what is it about Barbara Warner that makes you think that she is notable? I'm not trying to be sarcastic, I am genuinely interested, especially in light of <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a>'s comments on the disagreement on Wikipedia about how to handle politicians. Most of the article as it stands now is about Marilyn Churley's federal candidacy and how she would have to resign her provincial seat once the federal writ was dropped. If Barbara Warner merits an article, then if I declared that I was seeking a major party nomination in my riding, would I also merit an article? <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 14:27, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
