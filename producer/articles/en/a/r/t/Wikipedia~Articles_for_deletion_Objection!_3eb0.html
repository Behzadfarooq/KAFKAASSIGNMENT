<li><b>Comment</b> Given that it has a weekly average of 8,675, which is quite high. We also have to consider that the alexa bias would weigh against this site since the majority of it's users are gee^H^H^Hmore technically minded, meaning they're less likely to have alexa installed, if we believe the sites figures for a moment, 59% of users don't use IE. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarksun_f33c.html" title="User:Darksun">Darksun</a> 23:13, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, or <b>Move</b> (as per Chris). I don't agree with <b>Merge</b> on the grounds that this page is not an official Phoenix Wright page, nor is not a feature or easter egg of the game. The page, as it stands as of this moment, is factually correct. The defense cedes that the notability of Objection! cannot be proved by conventional means. However, I propose, based on the fact that this article is well written and accurate, that the prosecution take it upon themselves to attempt to prove this article is not notable. My analysis of the article is, of course, subjective. I naturally invite you to contradict, or support my claim. Although, it might be more productive for Wikipedia if, instead of pointing out factual inaccuracies in this article, you instead take it upon yourself to investigate and rewrite parts which are not to your satisfaction. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrD_808e.html" title="User:MrD">MrD</a> 13:25, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, that's as bad as asking me to prove that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a> doesn't exist. As I have no access to statistics or anything reliable on the page, its notability is essentially non-falsifiable. That is, I can't prove that it's false. Therefore the burden responsibility should fall upon yourself to prove that it <i>is</i> notable. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 20:41, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I believe we've come to the crux of the matter, which is this: I believe that this article should never have been VfD'd. If you check the history, it was nominated originally for deletion only eight minutes after it was first made. I believe that such an article should at not be outed almost instantly just because it is classed as an 'internet phenomenon', but given 'stub' status until such time as it's notability can be determined <i>without any doubt</i> one way or the other. Is there any Wikipedia statistics that can be used to determine the popularity of the <i>article</i>? Ignoring the website for the time being: until statistics which are considered to be Wiki-kosher are gleaned (refer to my comments about asking the author for any more real stats), this is the only real data that can be analysed in any form. The only other fact around which we can base any real argument is that <b>Objection! exists</b>. Obvious, yes, but I believe that this alone may be the reason why it's been added to Wikipedia: Somebody figured that Objection! was popular enough to write about. Others, including myself, found it useful enough to refer to, and worthy enough to add to. It's a good article as it stands, and it should remain because of this. Basically, it's popularity is shown by its presence on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrD_808e.html" title="User:MrD">MrD</a> 10:24, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally, I think it's far more productive to AfD the article right away - <i>if</i> the subject fails to get popular, it means there's less wasted effort, if the subject becomes a sneaky hit, it's a matter of DRVing the thing and restoring the history (if needed). If, on the other hand, the (early) AfD finds the material keepable, that strengthens the article's reason of existence and is less likely to get AfD'd later, as you can refer to the earlier decision. Also remember, we don't make articles about stuff that's <i>about to become</i> popular, we're making articles about stuff that <i>is</i> popular. You can only start an "about to become popular" article if a country goes to war with another (apologies for using a current-events example) or something of <i>that</i> magnitude happens. Plus, we're absolutely not shy of deleting articles that are "popular" by Wikipedia standards (ie, have a ton of revisions) - the <i>notability</i> of the <i>subject</i> is all that matters. If Wikipedia <i>article</i> popularity mattered, we'd <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">create articles</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Wikipedia_6dad.html" title="English Wikipedia">about the articles</a>. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:46, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>But the notability of even the smallest of towns <i>is</i> established, they get sometimes AfDd, and pretty much always kept if the town actually exists... And besides, as you can see, you can write a lot more about Birkenhead than this thing. With multiple printed sources.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I recieved an e-mail from the creator of <b>Objection!</b> regarding Moeron's comment. I had previously e-mailed him for information about the information listed on his site, so he just sent me an e-mail asking for me to post this up for him. Apologies for taking up so much room, but he deserves to be heard out. I also recieved <a href="http://www.4camp.net:8081/sensortable.htm?id={DB323DAE-4CD7-44AC-82EF-3FDA9596D2D0}&amp;subid=3&amp;index=0" class="external text" title="http://www.4camp.net:8081/sensortable.htm?id={DB323DAE-4CD7-44AC-82EF-3FDA9596D2D0}&amp;subid=3&amp;index=0" rel="nofollow">this</a> page, which shows the site's current bandwidth usage for Objection!. It was provided to me at an earlier time, and I posted it - yet, most seemed to ignore it. I do have a screenshot and a few other sites, but I think that's all you need.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I linked to Objection on Wikipedia because I like Wikipedia, and I think that it's become a useful reference for information such as this. That's all," he said.</i></p>
<p>"<i>To tell you the truth, my host was absolutely livid about Objection. They thought it would be something that would pass in a day or two... when they saw the bandwidth per day, they just cut me like -that-. It was stretching it to convince them to change the message from 'This site has used too much bandwidth and is temporarily offline' (or something like that) to that single spartan HTML page. I wasn't at my home computer at the time of the cut, so I didn't have the Objection source stuff handy. I couldn't FTP the FAQ out of the website, they wouldn't let me. I had to contact the host directly to get them to upload that page instead of the standard bandwidth error. Wikipedia was the only site I could link to that had the correct information so they could find out what all these weird numbered links they were seeing on forums were.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Anyway, Objection!'ll be back before you know it, and Wikipedia can be back to it's ordinary self again.

<li><b>Comment</b> Explain what "small community" you are referring to. Listed on the Objection! wiki, it claims 3 rather LARGE "communities" are involved with the use and knowledge of Objection!. Various friends I know online and offline, who aren't involved or aware of those 3 communities know of Objection! and have directed my attention to it. A rather large portion of people who browse the internet on a daily basis know of this, in such a short time. Also, various people have been stating that it gets a high voltage of traffic, and the proof is in it's stats. Each "Objection!" page is rather small in filesize, for a site that hosts it's main content as a small, singlefile page, sure is using a large amount of bandwidth and gets a large amount of hits. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceSage_8a63.html" title="User:IceSage">IceSage</a> 04:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Why? Very simple. It's an amusing internet phenomenon that is developing the kind of fanbase that makes Snakes On A Plane already a smash hit before even coming out in theaters. It's the kind of driving force that has a life of its own because it was so simple, yet so clever. A device that generates comments in a court scene for fun and games? Sure, why not? People have adored more for less. It's the simple things in life that get to you. I don't think you should bother blotting out "Objection!", though I will say that it's good to see it gets a fair trial. And if anyone has any...objections...well, so be it. Personally, I like it. Let's keep it around for our simple enjoyment. 204.215.207.106 02:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)The Lord Massacre</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I like Wikipedia primarily <i>because</i> of its indiscriminate nature. To me, the fact that it archives information even on minor things that only a handful of people would want to look up is what seperates it from other encyclopedias. I'm aware that any point I could make has probably been hammered into the ground already, but you'd be hard-pressed to convince me that an article containing information I found personally useful is not noteworthy enough to exist. 59.167.180.72 04:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yeah, but there are more people who will turn to Wikipedia for information about this popular site than for information about your friend, and the information about the Iceberg level can be placed into the main <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land_3_505f.html" title="Kirby's Dream Land 3">Kirby's Dream Land 3</a> article. Granted, you could argue that this information be merged into the main <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Wright_815c.html" title="Phoenix Wright">Phoenix Wright</a> article, but I disagree with that merger on the grounds that it's not an official Phoenix Wright spinoff or advertisement.

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems to be popular enough to be notable. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanPMK_ec28.html" title="User:DanPMK">DanPMK</a> 11:31, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Very notable, seems to be quite literaly blitzing many large forums. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">AthlonBoy</a> 12:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> It's <b>literally</b> blitzing? Literally? Wow, as impressive and physically impossible as that is, I think the site should probably just get mention in the Phoenix Wright article for now...</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - In no way does this in any way meet Wikipedia's standards for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Much content of the article as it stands is original research as well. At most, this gets a mention in the main article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 15:49, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>It is notable enough to keep,it's been in knowledge on runescape community which has 74,000 members. This is why I don't like wikipedia, it's full of ignorant fools who don't know anything but regulations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.190.32.83 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.190.32.83.html" title="User talk:68.190.32.83">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.190.32.83_0ab2.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.190.32.83">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep or merge</b> Yes it's a bit of a silly phenomenon, but it's notable enough to keep around one way or another. <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEASports_390c.html" title="User:EASports">EASports</a> 20:48, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
