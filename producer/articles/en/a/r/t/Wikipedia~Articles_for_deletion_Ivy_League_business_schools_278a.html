<li><b>Weak keep</b>. All of the articles included are, in fact, Ivy League business schools. Unlike "Public Ivies," "Jesuit Ivies" or other bogus prestige-by-association faux "Ivies," these are business schools that <i>are</i> part of the eight Ivy League institutions. The real question is whether this article has any added value over the existing <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_school.html" title="Business school">business school</a>, and individual Ivy league and Ivy League biz school articles. I think it does have a little, since business schools tend to be compared against their peer business schools rather than the institutions as a whole. This article has some potential. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 02:18, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not denying that the article is "factual". The reason for deleting this article is that the topic itself is arbitrary and meaningless, as evidenced by the lack of Google hits. In the world of business schools, affiliation with the Ivy League is devoid of any significance. This list is as interesting and useful as "Ivy League engineering programs" or "Western US Medical Schools" (neither of which exist as articles, of course). <a href="../../../m/b/a/User%7EMBAguy_82c9.html" title="User:MBAguy">MBAguy</a> 08:52, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>[Off topic] I recently spent more time than I should have trying to trace the provenance of "Penn" and "UPenn"—someone simply kept deleting "UPenn" it from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> article on the grounds that it was "incorrect." It is so widely used that to call it "incorrect" seems... incorrect. But apparently for the past five years or so the University of Pennsylvania <i>has</i> been very assiduously pursuing a conscious branding strategy in which all nooks and crannies of the University are urged to use the proper logo, etc. and Penn is the official abbreviation. So... if you want to be in tune with what "defines" the University, you probably should get with the program. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:02, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a Penngineer I dislike the imperialist Wharton attitude that they "define" the University. It is an extremely prestigious business school at an extremely prestigious university. They certainly are not central to Penn's world-class medical school, multiple Nobel-winning chemistry department, or top-notch psychology department, to name a few divisions of the school that are at the very top of their game. But otherwise, agreed. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 01:44, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I dislike it. But I don't see any sufficient reason for deleting it. It's verifiable. By defining it as "Ivy League" you at least have some stable, objective criterion for what schools should be included. The dates of founding are mildly interesting to see together, as opposed to picking them out of the individual school articles. It's mildly interesting to note that two of the Ivy League members don't have business schools. It would be much, much more interesting to have an article on the history of business schools in general, and it would be interesting to have capsule summaries of the different characters and approaches of business schools. I thank whatever gods may be that this article at least does not include any rankings. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:19, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Ivy League business schools are the originators of such concepts as "business school," "business degree," and "MBA," as the article mentions. This may be a useful hub for info on those schools. There's a concern with the responses from MBAGuy who nominated this article for deletion. In his response to one voter, he said the "... Ivy League is devoid of any significance." That seems a bit much. He also said this factual article is "boosterism" for the schools - he didn't demonstrate that. After he nominated this article for deletion, he then edited the article several times to try to make the same negative points in the article that he makes in his vote and vote response. Why? One voter, Dpbsmith, was optimistic about this article since it isn't littered with current rankings. Unfortunately, MBAGuy then dumped rankings into the article. Why? Of the many available rankings, he seemed to pick the only magazine ranking that might support his negative cause. What's up with that? That negative approach doesn't seem to be in keeping with the Wikipedia spirit. If this article is not deleted, then it would definitely help to back out the stuff that MBAGuy added to the article AFTER he nominated it for deletion. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGO_WHARTON_1c0a.html" title="User:GO WHARTON">GO WHARTON</a> 02:27, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
