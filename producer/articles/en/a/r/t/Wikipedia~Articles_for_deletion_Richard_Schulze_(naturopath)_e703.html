<p><b>keep</b>: Oh, come on now, the objective is to build an encyclopedia, not gum up the process with ill-conceived serial AfDs. The article was cleaned up and expanded before the nuisance verify tag was added. There is plenty of evidence around the net that this practitioner has had a long and noteworthy career that a quick goofle search would have confirmed, for whomever put on the nuisance tag, which in turn has been proffered unreasonably as an excuse for deletion. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 19:37, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The identity of the poster of the tag is visible in the history. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is only a nuisance in a certain sense, that of being one of the three bases of WP.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I don't see any assertion of notability here. The PROFTEST doesn't apply, because the article doesn't claim he's a professor. I don't know if he qualifies as an author, because I don't know if his books are self-published.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a> is just returned from a 24 block for various sins including <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. It doesn't seem to have modified his behaviour at all. The variety of "natural" "healing" referred to here is Gerson "therapy" which consists largely of pouring coffee up your bottom an eating crushed fruit. The UK cancer help view on it is at <a href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default_printer_friend.asp?page=6019" class="external free" title="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default_printer_friend.asp?page=6019" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default_printer_friend.asp?page=6019</a> and the US NIH surprisingly anodyne note is at <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/templates/doc.aspx?viewid=16bae44e-dd9f-4c43-8d9b-92512697e3e0&amp;version=Patient&amp;sectionID=4&amp;#Section_14" class="external free" title="http://www.cancer.gov/templates/doc.aspx?viewid=16bae44e-dd9f-4c43-8d9b-92512697e3e0&amp;version=Patient&amp;sectionID=4&amp;#Section_14" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.gov/templates/doc.aspx?viewid=16bae44e-dd9f-4c43-8d9b-92512697e3e0&amp;version=Patient&amp;sectionID=4&amp;#Section_14</a> . There is a hint of what is wrong with this, and a collection of other articles started by John in his comment above - the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> is a prominent and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> resource, but what John offers here - not in support of the article but in an attack on me and a class of editors and reputable professionals - is what <i>somebody else</i> is <i>said</i> to have <i>said</i> in the NYT. The tropes involved do circulate, the latter looks like rubbish to me, even based on last week's clinics, but the 85% one was tracked down by David Sackett to a conversation involving Archie Cochrane in New Zealand (if I recall correctly) and reported and examined on the evidence-based-health mailing list at jisc.ac.uk (formerly mailbase.ac.uk). Far from being true, it turns out to be inverted, with examination of the evidence base for the primary intervention in common significant conditions showing a clearly evidenced basis in around 85%! And all of that is entirely irrelevant to the afd, being simply an attack by <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a> using whatever unreliable anecdotes he finds to breach <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. This is a pattern which has made him a nuisance on USENET lists for many years and deserves censure. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 13:58, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Lexis/Nexis has no hits on "Richard Schulze" and ("Osho" or "colon" or "naturopath"). Therefore, even if notable for being a book author, claims are not verifiable.

<li><b>Wider Comment</b>. Stifle blanked the copyvio content in this article, Ombudsman has now reverted it, and removed the copyvio tag with no discussion here or on the article discussion page and providing no indication of a licence for this to be published here. In the several links to largely irrelevant afd discussions that <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a> provided, there are edits by Ombudsman of other people's comments, and an edit of the discussion after the closing. Clearly the request on a closed discussion lacks the force of a direct order backed up by locking the database record, but all fo these acts seem to me to be objectionable, and part of a pattern of behaviour which has persisted despite periodic comments and exasperation by various other editors at least as long as I have known of Ombudsman. Is the contribution of the trio of Whaleto, Ombudsman and the anonymous IP address user calling himself "The Original Invisible Anon at 86.10.231.219" sufficient to outweigh the effort required to fix this sort of entry and the disruption caused by such behaviour and edits? <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 02:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"""Appears to me that Midgley has a problem with Ombudsman. Who was the "Invisible Anon"? Is Midgley the official Wikopedia guardian? Is there one? I am a newer editor, but it appears that there are some vicious battles.</p>
