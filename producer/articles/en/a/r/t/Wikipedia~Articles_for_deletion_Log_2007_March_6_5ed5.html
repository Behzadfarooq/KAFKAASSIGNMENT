<li><s><b>Delete pending references and context</b></s> The article currently suffers from two serious problems. The first is that it has no references to demonstrate that it's not original research. The second is that, as per the recommendations in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, the article should provide verifiable information and analysis on the real-world context and importance of the subject. At the very least, you should provide some references to demonstrate that this monster isn't the equivalent of just a "minor character" in the core D&amp;D fictional universe. The first problem is more serious than the second, but I'd probably want to see both issues dealt with to recommend keeping the article. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a></li>

<dd>Thanks, Bit. I think mentioning the real-world use of the monster in multiple novels outside just the game rules would probably help it establish some notability per WP:FICT. Information from the references you mention on the talk page of the article could be incorporated into the text to show that the creature was adapted for use by a variety of authors and doesn't just appear as a minor creature in a particular D&amp;D rules book. Given those references, I'm changing my recommendation to <b>Keep pending additional references</b>, meaning I'll support keeping the article with the assumption that it will have sufficient sourcing in due course. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:22, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/zax" class="extiw" title="wikt:zax">zax</a> is a dictionary article that tells us about the word. <a href="../../../z/a/x/Zax_%28tool%29.html" title="Zax (tool)">zax (tool)</a> is an encyclopaedia article that tells us about the tool. Should an encyclopaedia discuss such a tool? <i>The New American Cyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge</i>, written in 1862 (George Ripley and Charles Anderson Dana; New York: D. Appleton and Company), seems to think that an encyclopaedia should discuss such a tool, documenting the zax as it does on page 695, in the entry for SLATE. Moreover, for a picture of a zax, see figure 232 on page 117 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1850320160</a>. That discusses the zax along with several other slater's tools, such as the "ripper" and the "lath hammer". Wikipedia should probably discuss the zax in context with these other slater's tools, too. But since we don't even have an entry for the trade of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slater.html" title="Slater">slater</a> yet, let alone an article on the tools of that trade, there's no article to merge this one into, and certainly no reason to throw the content of this article away. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>In 1862, these were probably in almost as common use as hammers. Now, they are obscure collectors' items.

<p>Okay, I like Uriah Heep as much as the next person, but can see two problems with this article. It's nothing more than a dicdef and a link farm. Given the topic it will never be anything more than a dicdef. Suggest either deleting or merging with <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uriah_Heep_%28band%29_ad8e.html" title="Uriah Heep (band)">Uriah Heep (band)</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 01:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uriah_Heep_%28band%29_ad8e.html" title="Uriah Heep (band)">Uriah Heep (band)</a>, then change to redirect. I can find apparently long-standing references to the 'term', (e.g. "Hi, here is Rodrigo Werneck, a Heepster from Brazil."). But that it is still just a definition, which could (should?) be inside the <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uriah_Heep_%28band%29_ad8e.html" title="Uriah Heep (band)">Uriah Heep (band)</a> article. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 03:21, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> The article, at this point in time, is too small. I reccomend that it be merged with other articles. <a href="../../../j/t/g/User%7EJtg920_c7c7.html" title="User:Jtg920">Jtg920</a> 23:25, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Also merge the references to the "External links" section--they may aid in the development of the Uriah Heep article and can always be removed if found to be irrelevant. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:50, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Aside from glaring POV problems ("his distinguished portfolio", "He is an exemplary role model for the Indian-American community"), this is an unsourced biography of a <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">living person</a>. Someone has questioned the veracity of the info in the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaushik_Vasudevan&amp;diff=112953848&amp;oldid=112950698" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaushik_Vasudevan&amp;diff=112953848&amp;oldid=112950698" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and it's hard to know how seriously to take this without sourcing. One of the two external links is broken and I can't figure out what the other has to do with the subject. The assertion of notability is very vague:</p>
<blockquote>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I believe that we shall, as Wikipedians, respect the young folks and thier accomplishments. In fact, I personally know Kaushik, of whom the article was made because he is my nephew, and it seems to me that most, if not all the information in this article is true. However, I was surprised to see an article on him, especially such a lucidly written, almost professional-seeming article; it surprises me to see who would write about him. I bet that there are several non-googlable sources about him, and his work is visible for example, at <a href="http://www.kv17.com/scans" class="external free" title="http://www.kv17.com/scans" rel="nofollow">http://www.kv17.com/scans</a>; i have never seen such beautiful work throughout my life. I think that instead we shall keep this article but keep an eye on it and mark it for possible improvements. Sridhar Venkateshagopalan 4:19 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable club musician, unpublished, and misspelled name to boot (pun). The pun is that the same editor created Slippery Boot, a club that was one of his venues, which apparently was speedied. The reason I did not speedy this is that very probably the <i>intended</i> person is "Jay Aymar", which does get Google hits for the Ottawa area, but not for anything published or recent.

<p>Article is a stub, which is written in jargon and which no users seems able to expand to make coherent or informative. The technology is outdated, and no longer (if ever) notable. A Google search returns under 750 results, with at least 15 being a duplicate of the article found on Wikipedia. The technology is no longer commonly used, and deals with the concatenation of ISDN data lines, which have not been economically-feasible for several years. The article cannot be developed, is not notable, and is out of common usage.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Just in case you didn't realize it, there is a bit of a difference between being on Jeopardy and being on Survivor. In Survivor, a contestant can be on primetime for 14 weeks. So, I fail to see the comparison. And Kim Johnson was a runner-up, so she was on TV for a lot longer time than Deal or No Deal or most Jeopardy contestants. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 04:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> (not decided yet). I do not necessarily think that this should be "deleted", as this is a valid historical hypothesis. However, I do not think that this article can be expanded: Could the main author provide some reputable sources to prove otherwise? Also, I think that the title is not very descriptive and confusing.

<p>This player is far below notability. Additionally, the article lacks verifiability. According to the article, this player has played for the national team. Unfortunately it does not even mention the sport in question, there are several "indoor football" disciplines. His club, Deportivo football club has a Wikipedia article which meets speedy deletion criteria, but on this occasion I used prod instead, so it could be used as a reference for this AfD nomination. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulius_Sahara_5577.html" title="User:Julius Sahara">Julius Sahara</a> 06:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This absolutely fails NOT#DIR. It is a loose association of items which have nothing in common other than that they are songs performed on a particular TV show. The individual items did not gain fame or notability by virtue of the association so they don't pass the "Nixon's enemies list" proviso. Finally, WP:LIST is a <i>guideline</i>, not a free pass for every list article. If an article fails an actual <i>policy</i> or is otherwise unacceptable, pointing to its compliance with WP:LIST does not save it. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:25, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Um, no. The performance of a song on a TV show, when the songs share no other factor in common, is <i>not</i> enough of a commonality. The songs vary by genre, composer, lyricist, style, vocal range, tempo, key, etc. It is absurd to say that just because some TV person decided to sing a particular song on the air that the songs as a group become notable together. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:45, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the team as (at best) a very minor-league team. They aren't in the A-League, which is the top league in these parts, and what little indication there is of the level at which they <i>do</i> play suggests that it's a local-league affair.

<li>I can understand that you're keen to have this page on here, but WP has a whole bunch of policies which articles need to satisfy, the main ones being <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a>, neither of which your team seems to meet (or be able to meet). I'm sure you understand that these policies are there for a reason i.e. if we didn't have them the encyclopedia would drown in articles on everybody's garage bands, kids, pets, school projects, etc etc. I seem to recall a recent AfD discussion mentioning that there were something like 5000 indoor soccer teams active in the UK alone - can you imagine the effect on WP if we let every such team, not just in the UK but in the whole soccer-playing world, have an article.....? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The two sources cited at the bottom of the Deportivo page (there was a third, but it was a link to the article on the stadium which is bundled with this one for AfD purposes) consist of a series of forum posts and a directory entry proving that the club exists. We can thus be reasonably sure that it's not a hoax (although the flagicons of some of the players still seem unusual). We cannot, however, be sure of the notability of the team. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>2.) Ok, can we please reach an agreement, I havn't been lieing about anything here at all. The only semi-lie ive/weve told is the on eregarding estadio Northcetti. The place is actually (as im sure you all know) "Insportz Northcote" and we just made up the northcetti for fun. ill remove that now, and replace it with Insports Northcote - and Wont make a wiki for that. Please let this stay, it does no harm, really. It is a serious and yes, notable thing.

Your argument seems to hinge on the team being "big in Melbourne" - presumably if this is the case then you can cite coverage it has received in Melbourne newspapers, which would go a long way to satisfying <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 12:36, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You see, this is my problem, as you can probably guess i've exumed all internet resources. When i say big i dont mean everyone in the state knows, but to the football fraternity it is known. Local community newspapers do not publish their articles on the net. which leads me to my second point - you guys rely too much on the internet. Not all sources are internet. Is there a way for me to take a photo of my medal, then scan it on and imageshack it to be viewed. Note: i am being serious there, are there other ways of providing sources other than pre-made url links. i will take the photo if it means you'll allow the deportivo wiki in.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not notable. It's one team of many, from one location of many, from one city of many. One of the referenced websites lists nearly 20 sports centers in the Melbourne area, and this appears to be a team from a league at only one of those locations. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 17:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC) <b>Further comment:</b> The user who posted the article is Domenic Demaria, one of the players on the team. He is a 15 year old who posts in forums at football.co.uk, see all his posts here: <a href="http://forum.football.co.uk/search.php?search_id=1019827224&amp;start=25" class="external free" title="http://forum.football.co.uk/search.php?search_id=1019827224&amp;start=25" rel="nofollow">http://forum.football.co.uk/search.php?search_id=1019827224&amp;start=25</a> - which includes a post that mentions his age. With team members identified with names like "Billy" and opponents like "Jacob's Team", it seems clear this is just a local team composed of 15 year old amateurs at best. Claims in a forum post about the team being the subject of a Sportsnet article seem unverifiable and fabricated. The evidence points strongly to a non-notable amateur team like thousands worldwide, and a vanity article from the author about his teenager friends.

<p>Non-notable band, of which the opening sentence is "Andrew Skeen was formed by five teenagers in early March 2007".

<p>Does not pass WP:A "Exceptional claims require exceptional sources". This is a hotly debated subject, and developers of the game have both denied and confirmed certain aspects of the quoted article without further specification.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There is nothing exceptional in this subject, this is only a videogame, not "<i>historical events, politically charged issues, and biographies of living people</i>". Moreover, the development of this product was widely announced months ago, and devs have partially confirmed the contents of this article. The only reason they cant confirm it completely, are commercial agreements they have with magazines, and I dont think wikipedia is bound to respect agreements between third parties. The source, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Inquirer_aea9.html" title="The Inquirer">The Inquirer</a>, is reputable, and has revealed other "scoops" in the field of videogames before. I think the notice {{<a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_game_5940.html" title="Template:Future game">Future Game</a>}} its enough to warn readers that the informations in the article are not certain--<b><a href="../../../i/t/2E/User%7EIt.wiki%7ETwilight_32ee.html" title="User:It.wiki:Twilight"><font color="red">Twi</font></a><a href="../../../i/t/2E/User_talk%7EIt.wiki%7ETwilight_f583.html" title="User talk:It.wiki:Twilight">light</a></b> 11:13, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> As was pointed out, parts of this article have been denied by developers. The fact that unknown parts of what the article presents as facts have been confirmed while other unknown parts of it have been denied makes it just too speculative. When exact confirmation and details are available, this article will have merit, but until then I really don't see how it belongs on Wikipedia when part of the article is known to be false. I'd vote for a rewording, but it's impossible to identify the inaccurate parts yet. 85.81.127.21 11:52, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>There has been no official statement by Arenanet denying parts of that article. Only informal posts on fansite forums. It is even possibile that those forum post are inaccurate and actually all the informations provided by The inquirer are true. I repeat, we are not bound to provide official informations only, and if there is a leak like this, wikipedia must report it, IMHO. --<b><a href="../../../i/t/2E/User%7EIt.wiki%7ETwilight_32ee.html" title="User:It.wiki:Twilight"><font color="red">Twi</font></a><a href="../../../i/t/2E/User_talk%7EIt.wiki%7ETwilight_f583.html" title="User talk:It.wiki:Twilight">light</a></b> 12:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>These "informal" posts have been by a community manager and have long been established as a legitimate channel for official information. Certainly more legitimate than an "anonymous source" in a questionable article. You used these "informal" posts yourself to justify your Keep, so I believe that makes it hypocritical to question the validity of the same posts to challenge a Delete. Wikipedia must certainly <b>not</b> "report" anything. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news portal or general information dump. Even when discarding the posts made by developers, this is nothing but an unsubstantiated rumour, and creating a Wikipedia article based solely on rumour or speculation is a big no-no.

<dd>This is no rumor, this is a <b>source</b> written by a professional journalist, who puts his reputation and the reputation of his magazine in his article. Denying relevance of alternative sources of information, you are basically giving Arenanet the monopoly of news about its products. Arenanet can decide what can be published on wikipedia and what cannot, simply informally denying or not confirming them. This is censorship. --<b><a href="../../../i/t/2E/User%7EIt.wiki%7ETwilight_32ee.html" title="User:It.wiki:Twilight"><font color="red">Twi</font></a><a href="../../../i/t/2E/User_talk%7EIt.wiki%7ETwilight_f583.html" title="User talk:It.wiki:Twilight">light</a></b> 16:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There are several things wrong with using this article as a source. It starts out by saying that "NCSoft has announced the development and release dates for regular annual expansion of Guild Wars universe", when NCSoft has in fact made no such announcement. The entire premise of the article is false. Beyond that, the grammar of the article lends no credibility to the author's supposed journalistic professionalism. I am all for trusting trustworthy sources, but The Inquirer's track record inspires little confidence that they belong in this group, and I do not believe that a blanket claim like "trustworthy source" can be applied here. This has nothing to do with censorship. It's simply not encyclopaedic. 85.81.127.21 17:53, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here's the thing, if this list was done and perfect, I'd see no reason to delete it. However, it is only about 20 to 40% complete, and the only user who seems active it working on it is User:Bovineboy2008. Now, I don't want to just destory all of the hard work he's done, but I also don't want him to waste anymore time on a list that we may not even want. As it stands, it's just an inferior shoot-off of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_GameCube_games_53f4.html" title="List of GameCube games">List of GameCube games</a> which, at this pace, won't be done until the end of the year. Also, I don't like encouraging more than one list for a console, as it's hard enough to keep just one up to date. So I think we should go ahead and either kill it or save it, but not let it dangle in this semi-finished state. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 15:00, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b> - The list seems redundant at best. Though I must say, incompleteness (unless it can never be complete) isn't a good reason to delete something as the nature of the wiki encourages incomplete entries to be completed later when other editors come upon an article.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>) 15:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I think that we should get more people to work on it, or else it won't be done until next Christmas. If we can't get more people to work on it, then delete it or use it to help with the other list if it needs help. --<a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustinsimcox_106d.html" title="User:Austinsimcox">Austinsimcox</a> 15:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The length of time it will take to complete this is irrelevant <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETIND_80d6.html" title="WP:TIND">there is no deadline</a>. The list is useful and should be allowed to be completed. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimaspawn_d949.html" title="User:Shimaspawn">Shimaspawn</a> 16:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> So, it is only being worked on by one user, and he'll take a while to complete it? So what? That's not grounds for deletion. The organizational information it offers is reasonable, see also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chronology_of_PlayStation_games_5560.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chronology of PlayStation games">prior discussion on the Playstation lists</a>. If you're really troubled by it being a separate list, talk to the user about merging the information to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Gamecube_games_d820.html" title="List of Gamecube games">List of Gamecube games</a> or working on it in his/her userspace. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Incompleteness is a reason for cleanup, but not usually a reason for deletion. So unless there's another problem with the article, I'd say keep and hopefully interested editors will get it updated. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Incompleteness isn't a reason to delete, but the list is somewhat redundant, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_GameCube_games_53f4.html" title="List of GameCube games">List of GameCube games</a> contains far more information. I'm undecided as to whether the chronological format is of use; I think there's an argument to be made. But I think this list should be expanded with some of the other's information (developer, publisher) in order to make it more useful, or else the dates should be merged to the other list (which contains years, but not exact dates, of release currently). Hm... wonder whether there's a way to make a table sortable by selected header... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 19:33, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Too much redundancy with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_GameCube_games_53f4.html" title="List of GameCube games">List of GameCube games</a>, so merge the release date data.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> The attendance at the conference are notable, but the individuals are not. Most of the "citations" which are positive toward Mr. Weiss are rife with misrepresentations. From his title as Rabbi, which is not supported by any indicia of scholarship or ordination, to the extent of his support, Mr. Weiss and six or seven of his cronies have sucked many into their delusional world where they are believed to somehow espouse the true "Jewish voice." To the extent that this article is not written like others concerning eccentrics like the Joshua Norton, the self-styled emperor of the United States, or David Koresh, a self-proclaimed Messiah, this article is, to be perfectly frank, silly, irrelevant, and concerns a non-notable individual who was remarkably successful in convincing non Jews that he is somehow notable in the Jewish world.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This is purely a fact based issue. Mr. Weiss is not notable. He is not a Rabbi. He claims to represent an already splintered group of Neturei Karta followers. He actually claims to have HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of SUPPORTERS, even though he has about seven. His ideas are just a ruse to justify the donations he recieved from Arafat and continues to recieve from other avowed terrorists. He claims to lecture in a school which does not exist. Frankly, every thing stated in this article is untrue, save the fact he was condemned by the entire Jewish world--whether religious or non-religious, Zionist, or non-Zionist. It is made by an imposter who has not made a single notable achievement in his entire life except fool a non Jews like bsnowball who knows absolutely nothing about what he really is about and likes him only for political reasons (even though he has never and will never achieve anything of significance because he is completely out of his mind!). How this could have been going on for so long is beyond me. I strongly advocate this stain on Wikipedia's standards and firmly hope it is removed speedily. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCharlesII_1b3a.html" title="User:DavidCharlesII">DavidCharlesII</a> 15:25, 6 March 2007 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCharlesII_1b3a.html" title="User:DavidCharlesII">DavidCharlesII</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidCharlesII_630c.html" title="User talk:DavidCharlesII">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DavidCharlesII_d7ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/DavidCharlesII">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

He is assumed to be notable simply because he is a media hound and lied to appear notable. That's not notable.

<p><s><b>Strong Delete</b> Wow. This is really funny. You have Rabbi 67 and Rabbi David Charles attempting to add facts into this article to at least salvage it, and others who know nothing about the issues change it because it does not feel right--all while maintaining that the lies Mr. Weiss made are somehow sourced because they are in op-eds, while other op-eds are not "reliable." Hillarious. Mr. Weiss is a non-event, a nobody. No one ever heard of him. Everything about him in this article is untrue except for the fact that he was in Tehran and is banned from everything Jewish. I mean, come on, when do we start adding town idiots and town drunks to Wikipedia? Are they important, too? Rabbi 67 and David Charles deserve commendation for what they have tried to do. I think this is a better route. Take this piece of nonsense out of wikipedia. Unless, of course, you write an article about a flat Earth, making it sound like its true--based on sources from the 14th century.

<ul>
<li>It has a large amount of material on Weiss and quotes from him extensively. For example, it includes this paragraph "Rabbi Weiss, 54, grew up in the Orthodox neighborhood of Borough Park, Brooklyn, the son of Hungarians who fled Eastern Europe before Hitler’s troops closed its borders to Jews. He married 18 years ago and has six children. The family moved to Monsey seven years ago, solidifying Neturei Karta’s presence in the town." among others. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:53, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sounds incredibly trivial. His connection with the Tehran conference was what was important. While we are at it, you might have a point. An old lady was quoted today in NYT--Gertrude Rothman--she is 87, lives in the Bronx, likes to shop at the store across the block. She went there to buy salmon. she was wearing a pink blouse.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a balanced, well-sourced article which makes a solid case for Weiss' notability. <i>And notability is the only issue which falls under our purview.</i> I am militantly disinterested, as I hope the closing admin will be, in whether Weiss is "entitled" to be called a rabbi, the popularity (or lack thereof) of his organization or the degree to which he is obviously loathed by a faction here on Wikipedia. It does strike me as odd that so many folk know so much about someone they are claiming is non-notable, but ultimately, it's well to remember this: Wikipedia is not written to personally please you. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Nor is it to personally please you. The lies throughout the papers which are not about him but his organization are not so notable as to justify an entry in Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.81.158.13 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.81.158.13_5f38.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.81.158.13">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Well, frankly, were I an anonymous IP with no other edits on Wikipedia save for this discussion, I wouldn't myself presume to preach on what justifies an entry here or not. For my own part, I'm still bemused that so many people seem to know so much about a fellow they then go on to claim is non-notable. If that's really so, from what sources did you learn so much? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:27, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well I appreciate that you are bemused. I find it amusing that my history shows that I have made so few edits. I made hundreds. And I can preach on what makes fundamental sense. I would gladly prepare a beautiful article on Gertrude Rothman, a sweet, bubbly 87 year old lade who was quoted in the NYT. She likes fish, especially trout, believes that kids are not the way they used to be, and likes to shop in a stor across the street from her house. She lives in the Bronx. Even though she was quoted in the broader context of a burglarly next door, I think she is noteworthy. She was quoted in the Post, too, after all. Weiss is no less. Naturally, it is somewhat surprising that people know "so" much about him. Like the fact he was excomunnicated by every Jewish faction--Zionist or or anti-Zionist. Or that he lies about the extent of his support (a fact several anti semites refuse to allow in the article), claiming he has Hundreds of Thousands of followers, when, in fact, he has less than a dozen. But this is what happens when someone goes out in the open, pandering to the media, and calling himself Rabbi (demanding the title, actually, he did that on Radio), and proclaiming himself to be the true voice of Judaism. Before proclomations are made, one must find out who on Earth this eccentric is. If this article was written about an eccentric, Like Joshua Norton, for example, I would not have a problem with it. But to make him sound any more defies logic, common sense, and most significantly for wikipeida, the facts. The reality is that we don't write articles about mongrels on the street who are quoted on the news. We don't write articles about town drunks who people may know about. We certainly need not write an article about someone whose only significance is that he claims to lead a organization which he does not. Neturei Karta was split up between Rabbi Blau's followers. Weiss, at best, follows the view of one of those followers. Because he was excomunnicated by all, how could he be regarded as legit? How could this not be qualified in the article about him? Because all he is doing is talking about this follower's orgniazation, and its efforts in America to pander with the axis of Evil, we can quote it within the broader scope of what he's talking about. But there is no need to write about its insignificant, deranged messenger.67.81.158.13 19:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please stop ranting and explain how he doesn't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">this policy</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:45, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let's see. Mr. Weiss would probably fall under Creative professionals: scientists, authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, engineers, and other creative professionals.</li>
<li>This would mean he would have to be:</li>
<li>The person has received a notable award or honor, or has been often nominated for them.</li>
<li>The person is regarded as an important figure or significant expert by peers.</li>
<li>The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or idea.</li>
<li>The person has created a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, which has been the subject of multiple independent works, reviews, or documentaries.</li>
<li>The person or their work has been widely cited by authors, or is the basis for respected curriculum.</li>
<li>The person's work is or has been displayed in notable museums or exhibitions, or as a recognised monument.</li>
<li>Mr. Weiss does not fall under this category. Furthermore, "Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability. Once notability is established, primary sources may be used to add content. Ultimately, and most importantly, all content must be attributable." Most of the coverage on him is trivial, incidental coverage. moreover, there is little content to add aside from his date of birth, the amount of children he has and what he claims. Everything is else is completely made up. The problem is that anti semites refuse to allow in the sources that prove this. Believe me, many have tried to clean up this cesspool of lies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.81.158.13 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.81.158.13_5f38.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.81.158.13">contribs</a>) 20:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</small>

<li>Quite. I'm waiting for that myself, amidst the blizzard of straw man arguments, loaded statements, insults and other irrelevancies.

<li>On form, I doubt he will; I'm getting the strong impression this is far less about verifiable fact than about propaganda.

I do not attempt to tell whether the attempt to delete this article is due to the true but erroneous belief that this coverage did not occur, to the wish that it had not occurred, or to the view that WP should try to pretend such events are nonnotable in order to avoid encouraging them.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ignoring the fact that you are comparing this man to animals, it's not an adequate analogy. He has had coverage that focused on him alone.

<li>Leebo you are obviously not following my point. I am comparing the <i>content</i> of articles. The fact that space dogs have had "coverage" focused on them does not make them "different" to other <i>ordinary</i>, non-notable, dogs. A dog is a dog is a dog.

<li>At what point do you draw the line between saying someone is notable on their own or just one of the participants in something notable? Is a professional athlete notable outside of their team? Many are not, but they still get individual coverage and thus pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li>Also, I'm sure it's possible for a dog to be notable enough to have its own article. However, the notability guidelines for a dog would surely not be identical to those of a man, so I don't think there's any use in comparing the two.

There is a world of difference between and article about a person and an article that mentions a person. While Weiss has been mentioned in the news there is not coverage of him as a person. A while ago there was an someone who tried to claim a person had media coverage from the line "the writer of this opinion piece is...". That simply doesn't cut it.

<li><b>Response</b> The primary criterion for notability, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, is "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other." In <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <b>TOPIC</b> referes to the PERSON. In this article, all of the notability is in reference to the EVENT. As I said when I nominated this for deletion, the EVENT may well be, and in my opinion, IS notable. But NOT Mr. Weiss. None of these sources are about HIM outside of the EVENT. It really is not that difficult of a differentiation, in my opinion. What about it do you find incorrect? -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 16:27, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The part where you link, inaccurately, the sum total of Weiss' notability with said event, and the inference that someone isn't notable outside the setting for his or her notoriety. Few people could pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> under that premise. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:31, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just because there exist articles that should not be in the encyclopedia is not a blanket license for other such articles. On the point whether Weiss is notable outside of the event, I guess we will agree to disagree and let the AfD run its course.

<ul>
<li>People become notable from what they do, and what events they participate in. He has become notable by participating in the conferences, and by delivering the speech he gave there. This makes him notable, and it is shutting one's eyes to reality that make it possible to think otherwise. He if had merely gone to the concert and said nothing, <i>and</i> if no articles had been written centered around his activities there, then there would be a case. (I think that even then there would have been coverage about him a an individual, because the very fact of someone from his community going there was N, and recognized so in news coverage even before the speech was given.--and that would have made him notable. But after the delivery of the speech, probably every newspaper in the world had an article focused on him--the items given are a very small selection. <i>Articles focused on his individual contribution to the meeting, not just about the meeting.</i> We do not make it less Notable by eliminating the article--what we do, is make ourself unreliable as a source for major newsworthy figures of our own time.
<ul>
<li>There is a possible argument that those newsworthy because of extensive tabloid coverage of trivial events do not merit an article. This was not a trivial event. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have bad news. Mr. Weiss and his seven followers have been banned by Neturei Karta itself. See Here. <a href="http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/nkcherem.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/nkcherem.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/nkcherem.jpg</a>. This puts the already onerous problem about writing that Mr. Weiss is an adherent of Neturei Karta (I always tried to be factually correct and maintained that he CLAIMS to be an adherent of Neturei Karta) but also begs the question as to whether he should be put on the NK article. It would appear that all we can write about him is his name, his age, the amount of his children he has, his claim he is a member of NK, and the ban NK, and the rest of the anti-Zionist and Zionist world imposed on him and his seven followers. Everyone in the know, from the Agudah to the NK calls him a liar, a delusional, a fox in sheep's clothing, etc. He clearly lied to the media.

<dd>David, you just don't get it, do you? <i>Whether or not Weiss is the real deal or a con man has not one single thing to do with this AfD.</i> The <i>only</i> grounds for deletion would be on the basis of non-notability or lack of verification of the article's assertions. Avi is quite right; the more verifiable attention the world gives this fellow, the more notable he is. As it happens, under the Wikipedia article for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherem.html" title="Cherem">cherem</a>, the pronouncement against Weiss and his followers is one of the two specific incidents used as an example, and one of the only few attributed ones in recent centuries.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have updated the article to refer to the sources I mentioned. The article could be vastly improved and doesn't appear to do this man proper justice. However, I don't have time to do that right now! I have just added in what I hope is enough to establish that this artcle is about a notable subject and should be kept. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 17:34, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I speedily deleted this as part of a batch of articles constituting adverts for Enitharmon Press. For some reason I didn't notice the AfD (all the others were either tagged for speedy deletion or prodded, which might explain it). I'll undelete it now. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 22:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Further comment</b> To be fair, the page has been written by Enitharmon Press. It also refers only to the subject's more recent works (i.e. the ones they publish!), not his entire works. Therefore it needs rewriting and expanding to be less like an advert, but certainly worth keeping in my view. I will put some suitable tags on. I may even get round to a rewrite "one day".<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 10:50, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> He is the subject of a volume is Gale's "Contemporary author" series, which i am about to add as a reference. this is a very solid 3rd part recognition of notability. I would be prepared to argue that any author with a vol. in that series --a standard resource in all libraries--is N. ( I added his University page--he is a lecturer, not a prof., though they use that courtesy title. I doubt he would be notable on that alone).<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:40, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are lots of articles about elementary schools, many of them smaller than this one. There are 513 pages in the Category:Elementary schools in British Columbia. I think the precedent has been that school articles are notable enough to be kept. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostPirate_5f74.html" title="User:GhostPirate">GhostPirate</a> 16:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

There are a lot of elementary school articles there, but that doesn't mean we need them.

<p>This site is little more than a dressed up blog. Google and Alexa tests yield relatively high results, but that is largely due to a generic name and a propensity to post unsourced "articles" about celebrities that are then picked up by syndication or aggregator websites.

<li>No - you can't just take that first clause in isolation, otherwise every extra in a crowd scene in a major film, popular soap opera, etc. would be notable. If you look at the bullet-points; "Notability can be determined by: (a) Multiple features in credible magazines and newspapers (b) A large fan base, fan listing, or "cult" following (c) A credible independent biography (d) Wide name recognition (e) Commercial endorsements". <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 01:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Quite. Beyond that, by what standard was RollerGames "well known?" <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 01:55, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is absolutely no part of WP:BIO that states that "notablity" must be a combination of clauses. WP:BIO states very clearly "People who satisfy <b>at least one of these criteria</b> may merit their own Wikipedia articles..." And any show that was produced for at least a full season (at least 22 episodes) and shown nationally in the US is certainly "well known." --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 02:20, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't say it needed to be a combination.

<ul>
<li>I don't know what "(a) to (e)" is referring to, but it satifies the <b>Entertainers</b> clause of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 02:48, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(a) to (e) refers to my posting above. However, we're obviously not going to agree on the semantics of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> here, so I'll leave it to other editors to decide. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 03:19, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm afraid we just plain disagree, both that this nonentity satisfies WP:BIO or that an obscure, forgotten syndicated single-season show is "well-known."

<p>Lists of members of major ethnic groups in America (those with, say, <s>3 million</s> 1.5 million or more members) are too broad to adequately maintain, although I'd support splitting up such lists into more maintainable lists, such as "Chinses American actors" or "Chinese American writers". I expect to quickly add other major ethnic groups to this nomination, but not minor ethnic groups, where the lists can be more easily maintained. There are already deletion debates ongoing for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_African_Americans_735d.html" title="List of African Americans">List of African Americans</a> and List of Caucasian Americans. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related pages because the same arguments apply to all large ethnic groups. I will check with some reliable source to make sure I've got a reasonable (in my mind) cutoff point between "large" and "small" ethnic groups. I'm not sure how to treat smaller ethnic groups. Anyone can also nominate the rest of them. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment: What are the largest ethnic groups in the U.S.?</b> According to <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf" rel="nofollow">this U.S. Census PDF-file Web page</a>, these numbers of people identified themselves in the 2000 Census as being in these ethnic groups:
<ul>
<li>German American — 42.8 million (one in six Americans), 15 percent of the population</li>
<li>Irish American — 30.5 million, or 11 percent</li>
<li>African American — 24.9 million, or 9 percent</li>
<li>English American — 24.5 million, or 9 percent</li>
<li>Mexican American — 18.4 million, or 7 percent</li>
<li>Italian American — 15.6 million, or 6 percent</li>
<li>Polish American — 9 million or 8.2 percent</li>
<li>French American — 8.3 million</li>
<li>American Indian — 7.9 million</li>
<li>Scottish American — 4.9 million</li>
<li>Dutch American — 4.5 million</li>
<li>Norwegian American — 4.5 million</li>
<li>Scotch-Irish American — 4.3 million</li>
<li>Swedish American — 4 million</li>
<li>French Canadian — 2.3 million</li>
<li>Russian — 2.7 million</li>
<li>Puerto Rican — 2.7 million</li>
<li>"Hispanic" — 2.4 million</li>
<li>Chinese — 2.3 million</li>
<li>Filipino — 2.1 million</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks like a good cutoff point for major ethnic groups. I'm going to arrange the list of nominated deletions accordingly. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC) (added several others after "Swedish" immediately above in subsequent edit<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC) )</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> on the basis that this list is really not difficult to maintain, as it's not that long of a list. Population size of the ethnic group is no absolute indication of how many notable people are in that group. And if other editors find it difficult to maintain, then the obvious solution to suggest is to split it up by occupation, and not article deletion. This article doesn't really meet deletion criteria. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 18:33, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom as indiscriminate lists and directories seeking to capture anyone of a common ancestry or heritage with no regard as to whether that ancestry or heritage has anything to do with their achievements or notability. We are rightly suspicious of over-<i>categorization</i> on the basis of race or ethnicity. We should be equally suspicious of over-listification on that basis. I would not make the distinction that the nom is making between "major" and "minor" ethnic groups as that leads to POV issues in deciding what ethnicities are "minor" enough to warrant listification. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:13, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since when is ethnicity not a discriminating criterion? And over-listification? It's a list of people of an ethnic group; there is no over-lapping classification (unless you include people, but ethnicity implies that we're talking about people). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and agree with Hong Qi Gong. The alternative would implicitly encourage list-ification of non-list articles about these same groups, which is highly undesirable. Also, is this setting an arbitrary qualification population for list articles? If so, would this apply across articles, or would we have separate qualifiers for each "class" of articles? That seems like a messy proposition. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 19:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> all per nom. These lists have an inclusion criterion that is far too broad and far too indiscriminate and have the potential to stretch to lists thousands of names long and thus cannot be maintained. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 19:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

The Jewish list article is a list of lists, which seems fine to me since individual lists it links to should be maintainable. I don't see anything wrong with lists that categorize by BOTH ethnic group AND occupation. The Japanese list was a mistake: there are fewer Japanese Americans than I thought and I felt I had to cut the list somewhere. The top 20 ethnic groups in the U.S., by population, are now covered, and I think those are the lists that are too hard to maintain.

<li><b>Comment</b> This list is not an indiscriminant list as it is a list based of notable people that are discriminantly American of Chinese-descent. Furthermore, I'm not aware that a "potential to stretch" is criteria for deletion, and again, if the list <i>one day</i> becomes difficult to maintain, the obvious solution is to split it up by occupation. As of now, it is hardly difficult to maintain, and even if it were, deletion is uncalled for. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 19:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> The lists still violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>. As section one states, we should not have "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons." A list where the ONLY required associative property is ancestry is the perfect definition of being loosely associated. Claiming that the criteria include notability is implicit in <i>any</i> Wikipedia entry and trying to use that to fortify an argument that a list is narrower doesn't work. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 20:32, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, that's only your subjective assumption that "ancestry" is a loose association. Loose association does not require multiple associations if a substantial one will suffice. And ancestry, unlike favorite breakfast foods, is a defining characteristic of individuals. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:48, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll concede that in large part what it boils down to is a subjective definition on where the line seperating loose associations exists. Ancestry is indeed an inherent, defining characteristic as you say and is thus a lot more palatable than many. I suppose it's just my interpretation that ancestry is still too broad a qualifier - but then again I guess that's the purpose of these discussions, to establish a group consensus in situations where a key definition like "loose associations" is subject to interpretation.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 21:01, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, Arkyan, the definition of "broad" is ours to make. Fourty-two million-plus German Americans; 30 million Irish Americans, more than 15 million Italian Americans. Too broad by my book. I think most nations have fewer people than these. And for the potential of these lists to grow, take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Puerto_Ricans_8d5b.html" title="List of Puerto Ricans">List of Puerto Ricans</a>, covering the notable people of an ethnic group with 2.7 million Americans. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:33, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> HongQiGong, if all these lists are deleted, I'd be happy to help set up lists organized by Ethnic group/occupation, with lists of lists similar to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_American_Jews_106c.html" title="Lists of American Jews">Lists of American Jews</a> to help organize it, starting with the Chinese lists.

<ul>
<li>To be honest, I think the reason this article exists is precisely because multiple lists of Chinese Americans by occupation would be entirely too small each to merit their own individual existence. I really can't agree that the list as it is now is difficult to maintain, and deleting on the basis that it <i>may</i> become too difficult to maintain is very presumptious, as the criteria for inclusion on this list is a person's notability, which is not exactly easy to achieve like a listing of fruits or something. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 21:53, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good points, but consider Puerto Ricans, with 2.7 million people (I assume both in Puerto Rico and in the rest of the U.S.) and the extremely long <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Puerto_Ricans_8d5b.html" title="List of Puerto Ricans">List of Puerto Ricans</a>, which seems to be made up of every third Puerto Rican, almost all of whom have their own Wikipedia article. I think it would be presumptuous to think that there won't be a similar size list from among the 2.3 million Chinese Americans (and I'm not sure whether the Census includes in that the Taiwanese Americans). I think numbers of notable people also increase over time, so that the older the ethnic group is in America, the more notable people there will be, proportionally. But I still think there's an enormous number of Chinese Americans that Wikipedia isn't covering. I don't think smaller lists are a problem, even for navigation if there is a central list of lists. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:24, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Minor correction - as of 2005, there were 3.9 million Puerto Ricans (see <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>) and 3.4 million Chinese Americans (see <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_American_7e72.html" title="Chinese American">Chinese American</a>). Anyway, to compare how this list might grow like the list of Puerto Ricans kind of demonstrate a lack of understanding of Chinese American demographics. If you put most Chinese Americans on their own island territory, I'm sure this list would grow like the Puerto Rican list, because they'd have their own concentrated society and culture. Everything that's notable in Puerto Rican society and culture has to do with some notable Puerto Rican. But the fact is that Chinese Americans are very underrepresented in the media, sports, and basically anything that would make them mentionable in news media. Now, I try to keep myself informed with what's going on with the Chinese American population, and to the best of my knowledge, this list is pretty complete in terms of who is nationally notable. Most of the notable people that the list misses are probably people who are only locally notable in certain cities. And granted, the list may be missing people, but the fact remains that this list as of now is not large, and even if it grows, the natural solution is to suggest in its Talk page that it be split, not that it be deleted. I don't see how a <i>potential</i> for growth of this list is criteria for deletion. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 01:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, This nomination is not following proper procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. You cannot lump together a group of "Lists" to be deleted under one sole nomination. Each list to be deleted must be nominated separately thereby, giving each of the interested parties an opportunity to express themselves. That is the norm even if the nominator believes that the same arguments apply to all.</p>
<p>2. To list only the major ethnic groups in America because as the nominator states "those with, say, 3 million 1.5 million" is the same as discriminating per population. If you are going to nominate the deletion of a list of an ethnic, you either nominate "all" of the ethnic groups or none at all. This will also include lists that include people of different religions.</p>
<p>3. The nominators assumption that these lists cannot be maintained is a personal assumption of point of view. I'm sure that there are many editors who are looking out for the integrity of the lists which interest them.</p>
<p>4. The procedure which the nominator used to determined what legally constitute a major ethnic groups in America should have been discussed. Was a consensus held or was it the nominators assumption?</p>

<li>I don't think my argument about overly large lists holds water if the ethnic group is itself small -- that kind of self-regulates the list to keep the size down. What's a fair way of figuring out which ethnic groups are large or small? I thought it was fair to go to the U.S. Census and find out the biggest ones, but I had to make a decision as to how far down the list to go. What's a fair way of doing that? You have to pick a number, and that's a judgment call. Anyone who doesn't like my judgment call can vote against deletion, and by having a larger number of lists in this deletion debate, I hurt my own chances for deleting them, because more supporters are likely to come out. I don't see any fair way around that, and I don't see any clear mark for what's a major or minor ethnic group, so I did a bit of guesswork. I don't see any way around that, either.</li>
<li>Yes, it's my opinion. Maybe it's other people's opinion. Let consensus rule.</li>
<li>I wouldn't know where to have that discussion you speak of except right here, right now.

<li>Otto, .... your statement is inaccurate.

There are separate classes of theories as to the origins of ethnic identity (broadly termed, instrumentalism, primordialism, and constructivism). There are entire academic literatures dedicated to the study of <i>ethnic/racial/national groups or groupings</i> themselves (mostly in sociology, cultural anthropology, and political science). You don't even need to trust me. See the works of scholars such as Ted Gurr, James Fearon, Milton Esman, Pierre van den Berghe, etc. I can provide hundreds of more names of scholars who focus on ethnic groups in their entirety and not on subdivisions of such groups by income, age, and other non-cultural factors. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:41, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete All (or Split All)</b> All of these "List of XX-Americans" lists are necessarily overbroad. There are thousands (or even tens of thousands for the larger ethnic groups) of "notable" people from each of these groups. Throwing all of those names into one giant list would not only be impossible, it would also be of no use to anyone. I have yet to hear any compelling reason argument for the utility of a five-thousand item list where the only common thread between the names is ethnicity or ancestry.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The list has existed since April of 2003. Four years later, today, there are exactly 169 names on the list. It's hardly in any danger of growing into a list of "thousands" anytime soon.

<li><b>Response</b> - That's entirely true. It its current form the list is managable. But it is also incomplete. This simply isn't a list of every "notable" Chinese American. I can be pretty sure that's case because more people are tagged in the Chinese American category and its subcategories <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chinese_Americans" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chinese_Americans" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> than are on this list. And that doesn't even include the Chinese Americans who have not been tagged as such in their articles. Relatively speaking, it just seems to me that notability is too low of a standard. Like I mentioned on the African-American deletion discussion, while Martin Luther King is certainly a reasonable inclusion on that list, I'm not sure the Detroit Lions' fifth string wide receiver would be (although he is "notable" and thus meets the list's criteria.) I understand that this is a much bigger issue for the larger ethnic groups than the smaller ones, but the underlying issues are the same.

<li><b>Response</b> - I understand your point, however, the <i>potential</i> for a lot of growth of a list is not criteria for deletion. Even if this particular list is too large, the natural solution is to split the list, not delete it. But I do not see any suggestion in the Talk page of the article to split the list because it might become too large. For one thing, we actually do not know if this list would become unmanageable. It's purely conjecture to say it would become so. Chinese Americans are not Caucasian Americans and not African Americans. Arguments for why those lists should be deleted do not necessarily apply to <i>this</i> list, especially if the argument is that the lists are, or would become, too big. Chinese Americans are a much smaller population, and they are very underrepresented in basically anything that would make them mentionable in news media, and thus notable. This is not true of Caucasian Americans and African Americans. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 17:14, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> If you look up at my original post here, you can see that I slightly modified my vote. My primary concern relates to the utility of a list where the only criteria for inclusion are notability and ethnic heritage (neither of which are particularly restrictive). I believe that splitting this list (perhaps in the same manner as this list's Jewish-American counterpart: <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_American_Jews_106c.html" title="Lists of American Jews">Lists_of_American_Jews</a>) would address that issue by narrowing the scope of each individual list. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicjm_5b6f.html" title="User:Vicjm">Vicjm</a> 19:32, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. These lists are overly broad, unwieldy and unmaintainable.

<li>Actually, the lists are relatively well-sourced.

<li><b>Keep</b>. These lists are useful. The argument that they are too broad and general is nonsense because there are notability guidelines that stop any random Chinese American from putting him/herself on the list.

<li><b>Delete all</b> It's not just a question of sourcing them. The question that needs to be asked is: do these lists help people looking for information? My answer to that would be no. Having a list of American Jewish philosophers or Russian American mathematicians would actually serve a purpose, these lists however do not do that (in my opinion of course). <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 14:18, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Right. With only 169 names on the list, splitting it by occupation would result in a few very short lists, because the current list is already pretty short.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The information provided on this page is about a little known musician whose sphere of influence probably does not extend outside of Essex, UK, although he does have some American contacts. The information is not fiction, and any information which is, or is simply offensive will be promtly removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParonomasia_869c.html" title="User:Paronomasia">Paronomasia</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParonomasia_b577.html" title="User talk:Paronomasia">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paronomasia_bf61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paronomasia">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This page should not be deleted on the basis that Young Halz has an extremely popular underground following. Young Halz has successfully collaborated with rap artists across the Atlantic. He has sold in excess of 65000 albums in the UK and has done several concerts, increasing his popularity. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.159.140.188 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.159.140.188_afd6.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.159.140.188">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 81.159.140.188 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.159.140.188_afd6.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.159.140.188">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This page should most certainly not be deleted. As stated above Young Halz does indeed have a popular underground following, and his concerts have been very successful to my knowledge. His album Chamber Muzik is one of my personal favourites, and I would highly expect in excess of 30,000 copies of the album to have been sold. Those doubtful of his talent or even his musical presence, in Essex in particular, need only listen to his music. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.64.228.109_487e.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.64.228.109">84.64.228.109</a> (talk) 15:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>— 84.64.228.109 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.64.228.109_487e.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.64.228.109">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - For those of you voting "keep" for this entry, please have a look at Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a> guidelines. The fact that he is "a little known musician" whose influence does not extend beyond a limited region is what disqualifies him from the possibility of an entry in the encyclopedia until he has become popular enough to be mentioned by several third-party sources of information. Myspace pages and blogs (which appear to be all that a Google search for his name reveal) do not qualify as reliable sources. Expectations of possible sales is only guesswork, and if he's sold in excess of 65,000 albums it should be a simple matter to find a review of his music by a credible source. If one of these is posted in the entry, it might change things a bit. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 15:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Note that the three keep "votes" were all posted anonymously, the second was posted within two minutes of the first, and the third was posted less than half an hour later. Two of them have contributed to the article and the only edits they have made have been to that and to this AfD. The third's only contribution has been to this AfD. I think we can guess where their loyalties lie and not take their votes altogether seriously. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 16:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm really not sure how the time at which the comment was made or who it was by, or whether they signed it or not is relavent. If you recieved two letters in the post from the same person you would not immediately assume them to be some fraudulent vandal, so why do so here. The article is about a genuine musician who deserves as much credit as others who are unsigned. This is the reason why there is no definative count for sold CDs, they are published under his own record label which is not official or commercialised. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParonomasia_869c.html" title="User:Paronomasia">Paronomasia</a> 19:33, 7 March 2007</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This page should be kept because Young Halz is the future, he's blowing up fast and his fan base has reached all around the UK, his massive underground following even ranges to the USA. Your arguments would suggest that an underground legend like MF Doom should not have an article on wikipedia, which is absurd. -- gs_hova 20:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— gs_hova (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_gs_hova_f9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/gs hova">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

Furthermore, i don't have a clue what a "GHit" is, or SPS until i clicked on it- they are probably terms invented by the sorts of people who use words such as Hax or L33T - those who have nothing better to do with their spare time but use such words. Not the sort of people who are remotely interested in music, let alone rap. This is probably why so many of you consider it "non-notable", "self published" and "a hoax", even after being told that this is not the case.

<li><b>Comment</b> So what is a reliable source?

<li><b>Comment</b>: Exactly. Because many people consider Wikipedia a reliable source (at least to gain knowledge, if not cite), we cannot (and try not to) let unverified facts or someones' inferences creep into the articles. And because it caters to an international audience, the subject of an article has to have a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">significant sphere of influence</a> before it warrants an article. --<i><a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch"><font color="#275799">soum</font></a></i><sup>সৌমো</sup><i><a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoumyasch_8605.html" title="User talk:Soumyasch"><font color="#275799">yasch</font></a></i> 19:38, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I have vanity concerns, and way more is written here than what can be verified in sources. I'm also concerned about neutrality. I don't think rantradio.com should be used for reliable sources here. The Wired.com article says very little about this person. He may have been interviewed on a Satellite radio show once, but I don't know what was said or what that proves. Notability is questionable at best. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:34, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Questions on references</b> The vanity issues could theoretically be dealt with by cleaning up the article to remove biased or unreferenced statements. However, I am concerned that all the references in the article appear at first glance to be from rantradio.com, which is <i>not</i> independent of the article's subject. Neither is the subject's official web site. So I'd be much more comfortable keeping the article if it can be ammended to include some <i>independent</i> published articles or interviews with the man. If that's done, I'd go for "keep and cleanup article to remove bias and unverified statements". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:01, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Can we interpret that as "delete unless independent sources are found?" I think the community may have done as much research here as it's going to. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 22:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, if nothing else changes in the article, I'd probably lean toward deleting, with the possibility of recreating at a later date if those problems can be addressed. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:06, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - "Junior" in the Scottish context does not mean Under-18 players or anything like that. The Scottish Junior F.A. to which Jeanfield are affilated adminsters most of what would be "non-league" football in England. Several Junior clubs get much larger crowds than Scottish League Division Three, but there is no mechanism for them to move to come under the jurisdiction of the SFA and join the Scottish League. The Scottish Junior Cup final often draws a 5-figure crowd and is shown live on Scottish TV. If they were situated south of Hadrian's Wall, a club of this stature would be notable. Don't be put off by the word "Junior". In my opinion, all SJFA clubs would count as notable (there's another level, Scottish Amateur Football below that, and I certainly wouldn't vote to keep any club at that level) - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 19:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Out of order"?

<dd>PrincessBrat, get over yourself. In what way was Richard's comment "out of order"? He was merely pointing out that this is a club of similar stature to the hundreds of English non-league clubs that are on Wikipedia at present. He has quite eloquently explained what the term "junior" football means in a Scottish context, and that for me should suffice to keep the article. By the way, that means I say <b>keep</b> as well. As for your comments about the article being short - that surely isn't a basis for deletion. Otherwise we have to go around deleting every stub article that exists on the website! furthermore the length of any article is purely a subjective matter and no basis for deletion. - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Jim_Fae_Scotland_7bb9.html" title="User:Big Jim Fae Scotland">Big Jim Fae Scotland</a> 11:03, 7 March 2007

<dd>I still hold my view regardless of him being Scottish or English that it was unneccasary comment as it implied bias on articles that are English over Scottish. Also I must say there is only people in the local area or maybe someone with a keen interest in Scottish sides that could expand this article, snice the website is non-existant, and there isnt mucgh to go on on the google search. Id say there is more info on the under 19s side website. Im still holding my view of it being a glorified list - the intro seems reasonable but beyond that the article doesnt serve any purpose at the state its in at the moment and I dont see what use it is on here. The honours section is fine but its the middle content thats missing and I still hold by my view if someone could stick some info in this middle bit Id have no problems with the article. I note the two football teams from Big Jim do have some general all be it short info but they are not just a list of Squad and Management --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 11:49, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>a) You have no idea whether I'm English, Scottish or Papua New Guinean. However, you are correct - my comment did imply bias on articles that relate to English teams over Scottish teams, and I'll do more than imply it - I'll state it clearly here and now. Going back to the point, the article may be short, but what there is can be notable and verifiable and expandable by those who have more knowledge of the subject than I.

<dd>I wouldn't get so worked up over this fchd, it's only a non-notable article after all. Also, I took the liberty of reading your profile page and note your interest in this field and also that you're an Englishman. The article has been there since September and in 6 months nothing much added on. Hence why it's worthy to be done away with. It's likely if it hadn't been nominated for deletion that it would remain in a poor state and if anything this has helped it in some way. I think if you read what I've written you will see my reasons for agreeing with deletion, and I don't really care if you think they are right or wrong, I am entitled to state what I think. Instead of revisiting your biased comment and justifying it, I think you should use something better of your time. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 14:18, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Where on my profile does it state that I'm an Englishman? It says I live in Bideford. As a matter of fact I don't consider myself English at all, but you weren't to know that. I still think (while you are certainly entitled to your opinion), that your reasons for deletion are wrong - the fact that's it been there since September and in 6 months nothing much has been added on - do not meet any of the policy criteria for deletion. And I'll decide what I do with my time thank you very much. You're the one getting worked up, saying my original comment was "Over the top", using phraseolgy like "biased" etc. If I see I'm being pilloried, I reserve the right to explain, justify and defend myself. My interest after all, is primarily in the football clubs of England &amp; Wales. My original comment stands, if this club and article was in an English context, this AfD would simply not have happened. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 16:06, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point on 6 months was that its been there that long and remained a list! Thats fact. It really cannot be that notable if there isnt much there - dont you think, otherwise there would be lots to say about the club? In response if this was an English club, on that Ive read some of the articles on those clubs as well in lower/ameteur leagues and if I was doing an encyclopedia myself Id have them deleted as well as they are not notable, just like this club. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 17:25, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To dudesleeper if Alex Fergusons article is not edited for 6 months there is no issue, but his article would have <b>notable</b> content in it which would be valid after 6 months. At some point they wont be anything left to say about him as it would all be in the article! I would never support a nomination if it was unedited for 6 months but had notable content in it. What Im saying here is this article has had 6 months for someone to put some notable content in and there has been a failure to do that. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 17:25, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> though <b>Comment</b>: We should probably have a rule for how far down the Scottish football pyramid clubs automatically remain notable, in the same way as the English one (Level 10 being the limit IIRC). In Scotland at the moment, we appear to have Levels 1-4 (Scottish Premier/Scottish Leagues 1-3), Level 5 (Highland League etc.), followed by Junior football. Now are all the Junior league on one level (notable), or are there many levels, some of which would be notable, some not? Would someone more knowledgeable like to offer a guideline? <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 23:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are three regions: West (four tiers), East (three tiers) and North (also three). I'll defer to someone with more knowledge as to their notability, as I'm a relative newcomer to Scottish junior football's finer points. I'll enquire with <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Jim_Fae_Scotland_7bb9.html" title="User:Big Jim Fae Scotland">Big Jim Fae Scotland</a>, who started the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Junior_Football_Association_800b.html" title="Scottish Junior Football Association">SJFA</a> article. - <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudesleeper_55a1.html" title="User:Dudesleeper">Dudesleeper</a> <small><a href="../../../d/u/d/User_talk%7EDudesleeper_f154.html" title="User talk:Dudesleeper">Talk</a></small> 23:57, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's difficult to place the SJFA clubs alongside the SFA ones, as I've said above, there isn't a mechanism for any interchange between the two. I'd certainly place them at least alongside the Highland clubs etc. If they were in England, I'd expect all but the bottom few North Region clubs to pass the notability claims, and as that would exclude so few I'd be inclined to include them as well to complete the "set". - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 05:45, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As I have been mentioned here maybe I should post to sat that I agree with everything Richard (fchd) has said. We cannot readily categorise Scottish football at being at "levels" the same way as we can in England due to the absence of a pyramid system. However, if we were going to try and categorise the clubs as belonging to levels (or tiers) then we could probably identify eight in total (bearing in mind that this is purely my unofficial interpretation and there is no link between levels four and five, and the levels five to eight are wholly unconnected from one another except for some cup competitions), as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Level One</b> (1 league, 1 division): Scottish Premier League</li>
<li><b>Level Two</b> (1 league, 1 division): Scottish Football League First Division</li>
<li><b>Level Three</b> (1 league, 1 division): Scottish Football League Second Division</li>
<li><b>Level Four</b> (1 league, 1 division): Scottish Football League Third Division</li>
<li><b>Level Five</b> (6 leagues, 6 divisions): Highland Football League; East of Scotland Football League Premier Division; South of Scotland Football League; Juniors West Region Super League Premier Division; Juniors East Region Super League; Juniors North Region Premier Division</li>
<li><b>Level Six</b> (4 leagues, 4 divisions): East of Scotland Football League First Division; Juniors West Region Super League First Division; Juniors East Region Premier Division; Juniors North Region First Division</li>
<li><b>Level Seven</b> (3 leagues, 6 divisions): Juniors West Region Central First Division; Juniors West Region Ayrshire Division; Juniors East Region South Division; Juniors East Region Central Division; Juniors East Region North Division; Juniors North Region Second Division</li>
<li><b>Level Eight</b> (1 league, 1 division): Juniors Eest Region Central Second Division</li>
</ul>
<p>That is probably clear as mud to most people who aren't familiar with the intracate details of the bizarre way in which Scottish football has evolved. However, if we are determined to classify football clubs at belonging to some level or another then I think we can readily identify eight such "levels".</p>
<p>At any rate, I am firmly of the opinion that all "junior" clubs in Scotland are noteworthy and merit inclusion on Wikipedia. Indeed, I have written many of these articles myself and would be royally peed off if someone blithely started deleting them because they hadn't heard of the club themselves, or because the article is somehow too "short".</p>
<p>That's my tuppence worth anyway!</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - I feel the article should be deleted as Jeanfield Swifts are not a notable club whatsoever. They are comprised of amateur players in Scotland and there are better amateur teams in existence. Wikipedia has to draw the line when a team becoms not notable. I could argue that many amateur teams are a lot bigger than the 'junior' team Jeanfield swifts and attract bigger crowds. Having watched them a couple of times there are not any more than 40 people at their home games, at the very most. I'd say the average number is around 20. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 199.43.13.100 (<a href="../../../1/9/9/User_talk%7E199.43.13.100.html" title="User talk:199.43.13.100">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_199.43.13.100_a36e.html" title="Special:Contributions/199.43.13.100">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>This appears to be a fork of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> article. I'm not sure this is verifiable, and even if it is, that it's notable anyway. Is this encyclopedic?? Bencl300 19:33, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>; probably a hoax, and seems like the sort of thing that would get Brandt and his supporters to yell "See! That obnoxious Wikipedia site just keeps posting vicious false, defamatory stuff." Even in the unlikely event it were true, it would hardly seem like an incident deserving a separate article; at most it would rate a brief (no pun intended) mention in his main article like the various silly antics of the likes of Britney Spears do in their articles. Solid references would be needed to make any mention of something of this sort, however. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 19:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - "no verifiable content" is going too far. There's only one link in the article, but it's easy to follow that to a link for the monastery in Scotland, which does appear to be a traditionalist Catholic group. The monastery in Silver City, NM isn't hard to find information on either. Granted the article needs a lot of work, but it's not as clearly unverifable as the nom suggests. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">BPMullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 21:51, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>A charity with a website. A noble aim, I'm sure, but several of the 35 unique Google hits are unrelated, only one is anythign above trivial (a 1997 review of the website), Factiva turns up some passing mentikons and press releases, Google News a handful of the same. No evidence that I can see of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable secondary sources independent of the subject. My opinion is somewhat coloured by the fact that Sspillers (<a href="../../../s/s/p/User_talk%7ESspillers_0a74.html" title="User talk:Sspillers">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sspillers_2d8c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sspillers">contribs</a>) (check those contribs), who is employed by the academy, added a very large number of links some time back, often with blatantly promotional link text, and is now emailing me to ask for them to be allowed back in.

<p>The content of this article is superceded by the "<a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">Superpower</a>" page. It is pointless to have a second one reserved for countries/regions that may become superpowers. It is also worth noting that in the past, various pages on topics such as "China as an emerging superpower" were deleted after nomination. It appears various users are attempting to restore them, despite the decision to delete them. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 21:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This article has no content that does not exist in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">Superpower</a>, but is a valid term in and of itself and as such has a section in the more comprehensive article.

And bad form for not linking to the previous discussion. The Empire Strikes Back, like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_%28disambiguation%29_8c43.html" title="Star Wars (disambiguation)">Star Wars (disambiguation)</a> is a term that has come up in real life, as such, it's more appropriate to disambiguate here than mention it in the main article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's perfectly reasonable and acceptable to have a dab page for multiple uses of a title, even within a franchise, and there are also other uses that justify a dab page. I agree that the fact this has previously been nominated -- and kept -- should have been mentioned. In fact I just reminded myself that I also voted to keep in that discussion, too. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The disambiguation page lists 13 different objects and/or concepts. Not all of them are relevant to the main Star Wars article, and the disambiguation page serves a valid purpose in directing users to the multiple related uses of the term. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 09:21, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - More evidence needed that she has been notable or prolific within the genre of queefing.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Epbr123. "Notable" within the queefing genre (I almost can't believe there is a specific niche for this) suggests there be some independent coverage, and none is cited.

<li><b>Keep</b> In my opinion, "just doing one's job" is not a great reason for deletion – almost all biographical articles on Wikipedia are about people just doing their jobs – TV presenters, politicians, writers, musicians, pretty much everyone. In Kathy Bowlen's case, her job means she is seen, heard and recognised by hundreds of thousands of Victorians, and I'd been hard-pressed to consider that non-notable. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 01:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, this is the second time that you Peta, that you've wanted to change something that I've put on. I am aware that I saw a 26 year old woman from Canberra, studying university some time on TV commenting with your username to a news reporter a few months ago. Not notable too I guess. You're welcome to remove anything that I've placed on Wikipedia, if that's what you like, though I've been placing such material for the general public with no such bias (hopefully on my side).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's why I uploaded the material: someone put a link to this person, which I decided readily to follow-up on more information on the person. Here's why I put it on: The presenter is not a celebrity, agreed. But were someone interested in seeing a presenter and how he or she looks, I feel this would be an ideal place for someone this as general information. There are other presenters on the ABC news site too. If you feel that the presenter's privacy has been violated, well I'll be happy for the article to be deleted. Though I think trival information such as this should be available, deleting it would get close to being tyranical, Orwellian you might say.</p>
<p>End of commentary on my side then. Try0yrt 08:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> In my view "just doing her job" makes her notable, given the job she does. All kinds of notable people from <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W_Bush_83e6.html" title="George W Bush">George W Bush</a> down are notable only because of their job. I would say a newreader for the ABC at state level is definitely notable. It would also be a very sad day if one had to be a celebrity to be considered notable for our purposes</li>

<li>Can we really apply <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> here? These are lists, not biographies.

That said, I'm sure that hundreds if not thousands of ambassadors <i>are</i> notable enough for articles due to other achievements or positions, and I don't think we can easily apply the "local official" designation so broadly to them. I do, however, agree with JRG, these articles would be better as a "Country A-Country B relations" article with these lists as subsets. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 14:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Senior diplomats are very often quoted as representatives of their own countries, referred to as taking part in various official events or treaties, and frequently cited as experts in the media of their own countries, especially after retirement. Still, every single ambassador may not be individually worth an article. But even if the ambassadors are not always individually notable, the positions are, and <i>lists</i> like these ones can be very useful for establishing context and chronology in other historical articles. There is in fact a major reference work with lists just like these ones, but covering the period 1648-1815, <i>Repertory of the diplomatic representatives of all countries since the peace of Westphalia (1648)</i>, published by an international committee of historians in three volumes 1936-1960. A review of the first volume called it a "[work] of immense value to historians as a book of reference" (Basil Williams in <i>The English Historical Review</i> 1937, p. 709), a review of the final volume summarized it as an "indispensible work of reference" (D. B. Horn in <i>The English Historical Review</i> 1968, p. 189). <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 14:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This nomination is not grounded in a sound understanding of any criteria for deletion. Ambassadors are highly notable, particularly in the arena of foreign relations. It's not necessarily of interest to everyone, but it's notable, verifiable, and most importantly: discriminate. Also, I don't think the nominator understands the role an ambassador fills in International Relations. The suggestion that an Ambassador is on par with a "local official" is not based on a reasonable assessment of the two jobs. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 04:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've noticed a trend I find disturbing of nominating almost any and every list on wikipedia for deletion. I see several arguments, from those wanting to delete the lists, that are fallacious and yet persistent. First, I gently encourage anyone who thinks this (and other lists on AFD, for that matter) is "indiscriminate" to actually go to wiktionary and look up the definition of the word. A muddled understanding of this word -- the notion that it refers to lists of minor importance or something -- is leading to a lot of unnecessary deletions. Second, I've seen numerous suggestions that if every item (or most) on a list does not contain a blue link, the list is invalid. This isn't the point of lists. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> explicitly states that lists can be used to develop articles that have not been written. But lists are also important that simply record chronology, etc. This list imparts useful, verifiable, notable information. The fact that the links are all red is completely irrelevant and should not be cited as a criteria for deletion. Many problematic lists will have red links, but this is not a valid reason to delete <i>all</i> lists that have red links. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 15:42, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "disturbing trend" in this case is limited to a group of Australian editors who are in the process of tidying and pruning Australian lists into a manageable set for the limited effort available in that geography.

<dd>Slf67, I didn't mean to suggest that the trend is the result of a cabal of editors. I didn't mean to imply that any individual is responsible for all the deletions. I sincerely apologize if that's how it was interpreted. I just meant that there's a lot of lists being nominated recently, and I repeatedly see several policies incorrectly cited. If the red links bother you, why not just remove the links? It's a useful timeline that satisfies all of wikipedia's policies. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 02:44, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b><i>Very</i> not notable.</b> Let me remind you that "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other." There <i>are</i> no such sources -- Google News turns up only one hit for "David DeAngelo," and the reference is a single sentence long in a sex column. The article fails <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> for just this reason -- and <i>oh</i> how it fails <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. Look at the references that we <i>do</i> have after the past two years: (1) is total spam; (2) only says how large the dude's e-mail list is, and is not reliable nor independent of the subject; (3)-(4) are non-notable blogs, (5)-(8) are primary sources, authored by DeAngelo himself, (9) is an unreliable anonymous person who cannot spell his own name "Dmitri" right, and (10) is more total spam. We don't have sources because they don't exist -- and their nonexistence is a fact regardless of how many hits you get on Google with his name (102,000 as of this post, and a quick scan of the first 100 hits shows nothing useful for encyclopedic use.) -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 00:00, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>A disclosure is requested on your part. Assuming it's true that you are an anti-abortionist, do you truly believe that your anti-abortionist beliefs do not cause you to exhibit bias against the seduction community and against the subject of this article? I form this connection because successful seduction training results in increased sex which results in increased pregnancies which results in increased abortions. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a> 20:23, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your assumption is rather blatantly incorrect. I'm vigorously pro-choice within the first two trimesters of pregnancy, when 99% of abortions happen. Even if I weren't, you're trying to draw a very weak link -- from "anti-abortion" to "anti-sexual" to "anti-seduction," which makes very little sense on balance. My argument is simple: we can't do a biographical article on DeAngelo, because there aren't any biographies of him. We can't do a scientific article on DeAngelo's work, because he hasn't published his work scientifically. We can't do an analysis of DeAngelo's popular impact, because only one single book has been written containing any information on that (The Game); and this book discusses only one seminar and makes passing reference to an e-mail list. What remains? An article documenting DeAngelo's personal beliefs, citing his e-books and websites as sources. I don't think that merits an encyclopedia article. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 00:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am aware of the references that The Game makes -- I own the book. And none of them are good enough to deal with either a biography of DeAngelo, nor an analysis of popular impact. The two references in The Mystery Method -- well, did you even <i>read</i> the two references? They won't help either. Again, let me ask -- do you intend this as a biographical article, a scientific article, a popular-impact article, or an article on what DeAngelo happens to personally believe?

<li>But again, I'd respond that they're not relevant enough to make the man notable. The first falls into a problem with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability." The single sentence describing DeAngelo is not that sort of in-depth thing. And the other two are editorials -- one is a story about some romance novel that a woman is writing; the other is a guy talking about how interested he was in something DeAngelo wrote. Think about what we're looking for in a biography; what we're looking for from a notable source. What's DeAngelo's birthdate? His hometown? How do we know that his name is "Eben Pagan"? What's his pickup-success rate? What's the national average? How did he grow up? What has he contributed to the world? Remember, encyclopedias aren't designed to cover <i>every</i> guy out there on the internet with a website. Right now, this article is basically a detailed (but poorly sourced) article on his teachings in the field of dating. Nobody can say whether those teachings are useful, because no independent meticulous research has been done on that. All we know, is that there is some dude, who believes some things, has a website, and occasionally does private seminars that don't make it into the news. If he could back up his assertions, then maybe he'd be a great psychologist or sociologist. But right now, he's nothing of the sort -- and we don't have the sorts of news articles saying, "sociologist David DeAngelo revealed decisive proof today that attraction is caused by such-and-such." There is a certain character to notability. DeAngelo does not have that character. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 04:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I assert he is more than "some dude". Like I said before, seduction is not a topic most researchers delve into, for obvious reasons.

<li>Thanks for an apparently genuine reply. Note, however, that in the strict sense, notability must be demonstrated in the same manner that you have insisted must hold for this article. Therefore, as popular as the Daily Sun may be, and as important as the Theory Center may be, if they both don't have third-party external sources listed, they are a candidate for deletion. Are you getting the analogy? Yes, of course you are. But then why are you mentioning asking undergrads - isn't that similar to asking members of the seduction community about who the gurus are? Do you see the hypocrisy? Also, note that there are a dozen other unsourced Cornell articles that can be deleted. Do you still insist upon your extreme strictness? - Perhaps I should just AFD Daily Sun and Theory Center to see how that goes. Whatever your answer, I have a plan.</li>

<li>Oh, I'm not saying that "The Cornell undergraduates know about the Sun, therefore it is notable." Rather, I'm saying that "The Cornell undergrads know that the other three newspapers are not notable, therefore they are clearly notable. As for the Sun's notability, I'm fairly sure that the Sun has won awards for journalistic excellence, and the like. They'd probably be happy to furnish you with such references; it's one of the oldest college papers in the world.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From my perspective, it's not just that DeAngelo is (imho, rather clearly) non-notable. It's that the last time this was up for deletion, people promised notability, they promised nice, third-party references, and there wasn't consensus either way -- the votes for "keep" and "delete" split the vote pattern. I feel like the end result was a sort of contingent keep -- "We'll keep this article around, but only so long as you make good on your promise to demonstrate notability and get this thing sourced." Several years later, it still hasn't happened.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>You say: <i>The Cornell undergrads know that the other three newspapers are not notable, therefore they are clearly notable.</i> You therefore assert NOT(A)=A.</li>
<li>I'm sure The Daily Sun is a fine newspaper, but it's the responsibility of the editors of its WP article's editors to include acceptable third-party references, without which an AfD is probably not unjustified.</li>
<li>You said: <i>let's not pretend this is an "underground restricted-access seduction community"</i>. Oh but a good part of it is. This part, in fact, is very large and popular once you get access to it. My point is that David DeAngelo is notable there.</li>
<li>You said a lot about how he is not very academic. In research there is a balance between how extensive your results are and how significant they are. I've had university professors talk about their research at length with the research often not being "rigorously statistically significant with very high confidence". The truth is that I don't mind that at all, and most would agree with me there. It's not your call to say that only rigorous publications have value. This ain't physics. From what I've often seen, sociologists performing rigorous research often tend to prove rather trivial things, like the chances of sex for women after alcohol consumption are higher than normal, or that yes women are proven to have longer relationships with men who are financially stable and not entirely broke - all that was very useful - bleh. From an academic perspective, the preliminary work done by David DeAngelo actually gives academic researchers something more influential to work on. Also something you should know that is that only a part of his materials are original - most are borrowed and well sourced.</li>

<li>I apologize about that; I appear to have misspoke. I meant "The Cornell undergraduates know that it is not notable, therefore it is <b>not</b> notable." That is, Cornell undergraduates may not be able to testify to a Cornell article's notability; but they <i>can</i> testify to its <i>non-</i>notability. Do you see my point?</li>
<li>Most articles on Wikipedia fail <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. (The ones that don't get promoted to FA.) Failing WP:CITE is <i>only</i> grounds for deletion if it's impossible to find enough sources to build a good encyclopedia article. And as far as I can tell, in this case, that's true.</li>
<li>In the sense that I'm using it, "notable" is not reflexive to a community. Quoting from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, the relevant Wikipedia policy, "Notability is not subjective... The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy." So even if a community believes a person is <i>noteworthy</i> (which is what I believe you're claiming), this does not mean that the person is <i>notable</i>.</li>
<li>You're right. It's not either of our call. Rather, it's Wikipedia's call -- and Wikipedia has made that call, in my favor. Wikipedia doesn't adhere to <i>truth</i> -- they adhere to <i>verifiability</i>; see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for details. You're trying to say that you don't care whether DeAngelo's work is rigorous -- <i>but Wikipedia does</i>. It doesn't matter whether DeAngelo is right or not; and I never speculated either way on that. But either way, this article must pass <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>: "Wikipedia articles must be based on reliable sources. Reliable sources are <b>credible published materials with a reliable publication process</b>; their authors are generally regarded as trustworthy, or are authoritative in relation to the subject at hand... The most reliable sources are <b>books and journals published by universities; mainstream newspapers; and magazines and journals that are published by known publishing houses</b>. What these have in common is <b>process and approval between document creation and publication</b>. As a rule of thumb, <b>the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication.</b> Material that is self-published is <b>generally not regarded as reliable</b>, but see below for exceptions." (Emphases mine. The "exceptions" mentioned will do you no good, because DeAngelo's writings don't pass those tests -- and they'd have to make up a majority of the article anyways, which is not allowed by the "exceptions" clause.)</li>

<dd>(edit conflict) Having a gf or not is not an indicator of if the article should be kept. Personally I <i>do</i> have a gf, a totally awesome one to at that. However not everybody chooses to have one, there are certainly advantages to being single over having a gf and for a while before her I was of the view those advantages outweighed the negatives. Alternatively yet another view point is that <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a> might have more than one, and plans to add another to his harem!

<dd>(ding, carriage return) <i>3.</i> Regarding notability, if a subset of the world shows that a subject is notable then that subject is notable. Because in the end, it is impossible for the entire world to have found a subject to be notable and thus we are always dealing with a subset of the world. Also additionally you claim that <i>noteworthy</i> and <i>notable</i> are not the same thing. To which I'll refer you to the opening sentence of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> which you yourself referred to: <i><b>Notable</b> is defined as "worthy of being noted"</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 05:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's simply not how notability works. I am a prophet to a group of about half a dozen people. They consider me noteworthy. But I don't think that warrants a Wikipedia article. The opening sentence you quote is only eight days old as of right now; and may still require some revision -- but the rest of the article is crystal clear: Notability requires multiple reliable secondary sources. As I've been saying all this time, notability is really just an extension way to enforce Notability is a <i>guideline</i> to enforce the <i>core policy</i> of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>. WP:A says that it doesn't matter whether material is true or not; what matters is whether it's attributable to a reliable published source. The purpose of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> is to make sure that those reliable published sources <i>exist</i> before we go off on an article about this thing. When Cambridge publishes <i>The Cambridge Companion to Seduction</i> to go with their <i>Companion to Atheism</i> and <i>Companion to Wittgenstein</i>, well, <i>then</i> we can start covering DeAngelo's speculations on Wikipedia. But until we have <i>something</i> to write a biographical article with, a biographical article shouldn't be written. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 21:56, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>noteworthy = notable, there are even references for that on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. You are still misunderstanding me, I'm using notability in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> sense and not whatever else you are thinking I'm meaning. So when a subset of the world has found a person to be notable then obviously they <i>are</i> notable. Because we are always dealing with subsets of the world anyway. So if your half dozen people had made you notable (according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>) then yes you would be <i>notable</i>. Lastly, we obviously do not have to wait for Cambridge University Press to publish a book on a topic before we can write an article on it. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 03:07, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm saying that the criterion for notability is simply "there are good secondary sources," not "these people think that the person is notable." That's why I'm distinguishing the term "noteworthy" -- as in literally, "worthy of notice," -- from "notable", which has a precise Wikipedia meaning. As I (mis-)typed in my last comment, notability is a guideline meant to ask the question, "Can <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> be fulfilled?" -- and that's exactly what the question, "Is this notable?" means. And I still don't think we can write an article fulfilling <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. I really think that the few references so far found don't back up much, factually speaking. For example, I never got an answer to my question, "How do we know his real name is Eben Pagan?" The most that <i>The Game</i> will tell me is that the dude was a real-estate agent who teaches dating seminars that tell dudes to be "cocky funny." The American Chronicle expands this to "some dating-advice sites believe his writings will make you feel more confident." That's still only a stub article that we can write. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 02:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A stub article is better than no article. His notability has been asserted already. His real name and other such details are subject to finding sources. Until then, we go by the name he <i>uses</i>. Deleting him outright would mean ignoring the sources that we do have, ignoring his contributions to the seduction community, and branding him non-notable inspite of evidence which shows he is.

<li>Exactly how long did you spend looking at that article...&#160;?? The writers are from that other site, nothing wrong or unusual about that. Is common place that a writer will have their own site. As for <i>"who the hell are they?"</i> comment, that is not a reason they should be ignored. There is a lot you haven't heard of, for instance myself was just reading on wikipedia about a big affair involving a CIA leak. Never heard of it myself, most probably due to my geographical location but it is a <i>big</i> thing over there.

<li>I spent long enough to realize that this article could only be a good citation for the fact "Some people believe that DeAngelo's work makes you feel more confident" -- since that's the only mention that DeAngelo's work gets. And yes, this article <i>is</i> from the blog-ish site AskDanAndJennifer.com; as proof, you can find the original article <a href="http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/dating-tips/is-shyness-keeping-you-from-the-girl-of-your-dreams/" class="external text" title="http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/dating-tips/is-shyness-keeping-you-from-the-girl-of-your-dreams/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since it was an outsource to a third party blog, much like the comics or Dear Abby-ish columns in your normal paper, the American Chronicle likely did not do a thorough editorial review of their work.

<li><b>Keep</b> The only problem here is that the subject of sex/seduction is highly controversial and a spam/promo target. The article needs to be rewritten in NPV.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You seem to not understand what notability is. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other." Do you see any criteria in that statement for "extremely influential"...? For "a search on Google"...? No, and for good reason. There are no secondary sources, and no good article fulfilling <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> could possibly be written about this man.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Whiny comments like those by Drostie above illustrate the problem perfectly. Once a subject receives more than HALF A MILLION entries in the Google search engine, a WP article might become useful to a substantial number of readers because "Double Your Dating" qualifies as an Internet meme of its own. And yet some people engage in a systematic campaign to remove the subject just because it is controversial or personally distasteful to them. They would do better to help improve the article than trying to engage in selective censorship. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 19:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As per the above discussion, notability is not reflexive to a community. Though the community may be notable, not all noteworthy people in a notable community are notable. The real question is, are there reliable, independent secondary sources such that <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> could be fulfilled?

<li>What above "discussion"? I only see one comment by yourself. Plus I believe you probably incorrectly read what <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasuke_Sarutobi_1266.html" title="User:Sasuke Sarutobi">Sasuke Sarutobi</a> was stating. In my view it is that he said David DeAngelo is notable, and that <i>also</i> he is part of notable community. Or in other words he said he is notable, and then made an additional statement afterwards. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 05:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, and that comment was part of a discussion. In any case, DeAngelo's notability is precisely what's in question here. It doesn't help any of this to have people just saying "He is notable." Remember, AfD isn't a vote; and "notability" isn't based on the opinions of Wikipedia users. There have been no biographies of DeAngelo, nor a large academic (sociological) discussion in the peer-reviewed literature about his theories. He hasn't won any prominent sociology prizes. Without stuff like these, how are we supposed to write a good biographical encyclopedia article? -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 18:20, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't question that DeAngelo is notable within the seduction community; he clearly is. That's not the question here, though. The questions are whether he's notable enough for his own article, and whether there is enough material extant to write a biographical article which can pass <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. After digging through all the links, I'm willing to grant the former, sort of. The Orlando Sentinel article, along with a couple other passing references, is enough to establish that he's been regarded as an expert on seduction outside the seduction community. His case for notability is not as rock-solid as all the other persons on the list of "Notable members of the seduction community," all of whom have been the subject of reliable articles, but hey, some articles are harder to source than others. If the only question was one of notability, I'd change my vote. It's the latter question that I'm stuck on. Is David DeAngelo <i>really</i> a pseudonym? I'm quite sure it is. But where's the published biography? Is Eben Pagan his real name? Does he actually have a doctorate? What's it in? According to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, we could not even assert that David DeAngelo is a pseudonym unless we had a reliable source. What needs to be remembered here is that the article in question is <b>biographical</b>, which means there are policies which <i>must</i> be followed. <a href="../../../o/b/t/User%7EObtuseAngle_4728.html" title="User:ObtuseAngle">ObtuseAngle</a> 23:32, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
