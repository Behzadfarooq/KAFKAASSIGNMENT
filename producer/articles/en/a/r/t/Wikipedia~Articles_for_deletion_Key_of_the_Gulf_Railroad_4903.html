They were probably all redlinked there to begin with. I don't consider the charter information sufficient for a stub on a railroad.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Does a railroad count as defunct if no track was ever laid? It might make more sense to create an article named "List of never-built railroads of Florida" (with a better name than that) and to merge the articles into that. Or, if nothing else, create a separate section in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_defunct_Florida_railroads_cc77.html" title="List of defunct Florida railroads">List of defunct Florida railroads</a> per above. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 23:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> as above seems reasonable. Any of them that are longer than 2–3 paragraphs of law text can probably be kept as-is. If further detail can be added about the railways, the articles can be broken out again at that point. As a side-issue, nominating so many articles at one time without prior discussion is generally unhelpful. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:35, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete outright</b>: The problem with redirects is they aren't really free; they clutter up the namespace with a lot of similar-sounding names that are going to get in the way of the "not knowledgable enough to immediately recognize that these aren't real railroads" searching for real railroads. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 01:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would agree with this <i>if</i> these names are confusingly similar to those of railroads that had an operating history. Otherwise, since redirects aren't in categories, I don't think any user would stumble across one of the redirects unless he or she actually input the name of one of these planned or defunct railroads. I would also inquire whether the user who created these entries has been notified of the AfD as he or she might have a view that could help. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:51, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, this is complicated, but that is what happens with bulk nominations. Railroads are funny things, with some operating solely by leased track, and some never laying tracks (indeed, Amtrak didn't own tracks for the first few years of operation). All told, I prefer the <b>Merge and redirect</b> to a unified article that can discuss the Statute in one consolidated location, unless the railroad has a significant operating history after the statute. Of course, if more information becomes available about a particular road, it can always be spun back off from the central article.-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 02:53, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. "Paper railroads" are a not inconsequential part of railroad history. For instance, a specialty work in the field, Thomas T. Taber III's "Railroad Encyclopedia and Atlas of Pennsylvania", lists all of the railroads in the state that were chartered but never built. That said, many of these proposed railroads are not sufficiently documented to provide material for more than a stub. Condensing them into a single list seems reasonable. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 06:08, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
