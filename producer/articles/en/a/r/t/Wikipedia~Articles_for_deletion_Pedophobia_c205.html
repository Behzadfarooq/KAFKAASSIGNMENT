<ul>
<li><s><b>Weak keep</b>. I think it goes very slightly beyond the dicdef by including the <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultism.html" title="Adultism">adultism</a> thing, and it certainly has the potential to expand into a good encyclopedia article. Why not add an expand tag instead of deleting? Plus, it is referenced to an article by an anti-ageism group. If others do choose to delete, I'd suggest considering a redirect to <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ageism.html" title="Ageism">ageism</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 19:53, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</s> <s>Changing to <b>merge to <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebiphobia.html" title="Ephebiphobia">Ephebiphobia</a></b> per KeithTyler's comment below: Ephebiphobia already has a short bit about Pedophobia, so the merge should be really easy anyway.</s> Switching back to <b>keep</b> per KPalicz (am I wishy washy, or what?) <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 18:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This could be added to <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebiphobia.html" title="Ephebiphobia">Ephebiphobia</a>. Pedophobia and Ephebiphobia probably should be merged at best. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<p>Also, a well-known example: <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Luc_Picard_499e.html" title="Jean-Luc Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a>'s "character flaw" seemed to be some form of Pedophobia, although he overcame it as the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">series</a> progressed.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The key is the source of the name. Some web sites have created lists of many hundreds of phobias. (Spartaphobia is fear of Sparta, etc). What are the sources that say this is a psycological fear? The fact that this word exists on the net and a web article discussing ageism puts the word in a box is not enough for me. Is the word used other than on web lists? With no better sources I think no article and redirect to <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ageism.html" title="Ageism">Ageism</a> is fine.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 22:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The topic of pedophobia is explored in several academic circles, and there is substantial evidence to support its maintenance as an article. See updates. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 02:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By way of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_thinking.html" title="Critical thinking">critical thinking</a>, I've gotta ask why the articles about child and youth related oppression continually run up against this type of resistance within the Wikipedia community. I look up terms like <a href="../../../g/y/n/Gynarchy.html" title="Gynarchy">gynarchy</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androcracy.html" title="Androcracy">androcracy</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manx_cat.html" title="Manx cat">manx cat</a>, and all of them lack citations of any kind - yet their validity is undoubted. However, <a href="../../../e/p/h/Talk%7EEphebiphobia_fc14.html" title="Talk:Ephebiphobia">ephebiphobia</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/u/Talk%7EAdultism_6a62.html" title="Talk:Adultism">adultism</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;page=Student%20voice" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;page=Student%20voice" rel="nofollow">student voice</a>, have all been extremely scrutized - and now this. How biased is the Wikipedia community against young people and the realities they face every single day? Unfortunately, with the call to delete this article I am afraid the answer is coming clearer. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 05:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Per KeithTyler's comment above: The two words mean two different things, sourced in their roots. Academic literature supports the differentiation between them. Is it Wikipedia's place to negate what the academy has proven?<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 07:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: 8 google scholar hits, the word appears in the title of a 1995 book. Opinion of an expert may be better than the voting. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 06:48, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While it is similar to ephebiphobia, they talk about two different groups of people (teens vs. children) and some people may fear children but be ok with youth and vice versa. They are distinct enough to warrant individual pages I believe. <a href="../../../k/p/a/User%7EKPalicz_68f0.html" title="User:KPalicz">KPalicz</a> 13:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> The entire article is nonsense. It is original research and special pleading. It's highly questionable whether there ought to <i>be</i> an article on "pedophibia", and if there should it would probably be better to delete this one and start from scratch. We have had the same problem over at <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebiphobia.html" title="Ephebiphobia">Ephebiphobia</a>... the technique used is the same: establish (or try to) the existance of an obscure medical condition and then use that for leverage to write a social advocacy essay. OK, first: as to the <i><b>medical</b></i> condition "pedophobia": there's no question that the number of people who are subject to actual phobic reactions (panic, shortness of breath, sweating, etc.) brought on by the idea or presence of children is not <i>zero</i>. The number of people who have phobic reactions brought on by the idea or presence of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam.html" title="Spam">spiced ham</a>, Bob Hope, slotted spoons, or most <i>anything</i> is usually not zero, either. We don't have articles for each of these; I think we have one article where obscure phobias are given a one-line listing. <i>I think that "pedophobia" rates a line in this list</i> and no more. Second: as to the <i><b>social</b></i> phenomena "pedophobia", I'm not at all convinced that fear/scorn/hatred of <i>children</i> is sufficiently well established by verifiable neutral respected authority that the assertion of its notability is not original research. (Unlike <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebiphobia.html" title="Ephebiphobia">Ephebiphobia</a>, which article deserves existence because Ephebiphobia (fear/scorn/hatred of teens) <i>is</i> a real enough phenomena.) Yes, some people think that children are ridiculous or despicable. That does not in any way require this article's existence. Lots of people think that <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullet.html" title="Mullet">mullets</a> are ridiculous or despicable; lots of people hate cheese; lots of people think frogs are slimy and disgusting; and so forth. We don't have separate articles for these. The article looks on the surface to be scholarly. Closer examination shows that it is not, and ought to be deleted. And I don't say that lightly. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:44, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Since when is it the domain of Wikipedia editors to decide the relevance or veritability of established scientific study? Is this discussion really about the legitimacy of this article, or individual editors' opinions about the subject at hand? Are those two things synonomous, or does meeting the encyclopedic premise of Wikipedia supercede personal perspectives? Also, Herostratus, it would be good to see where your "closer examination" shows that the citations are not scholarly - and I don't say that lightly, either. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 23:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Uh, we judge the relevance and verifiability of sources and material all the time; that's what we <i>do</i> here. The discussion of is about the legitimacy of the article, the point being that, basically, <i><b>there is no such term as pedophobia</b></i>. Wikipedia is not the place for articles about terms that you yourself have made up. It is also not your personal soapbox. Get yourself published in sociological journals, establish the term "pedophobia" as an <i>actual term</i> in the literature, and we'd be happy to have the article. Not til then. However, I doubt that anyone will publish your work until you use more rigrorous reasoning. Your essay (and this is what it is, not an encyclopedia article) transparently attempts to conflate medical and sociological terminolgy for advocacy purposes. Scholarly journals don't fall for that. Sorry to be harsh, but there it is. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You have not directly addressed your concerns about the illegitimacy of the <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophobia.html#References" title="Pedophobia">references</a>, nor have you shown that any of the publications or other sources cited here is <i>illegitimate</i>. I don't understand your charges of me "making up" a term when the article references <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_journal.html" title="Academic journal">academic journals</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publisher.html" title="Publisher">publishers</a>, organizations, <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotherapy.html" title="Psychotherapy">psychotherapists</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_science.html" title="Social science">social scientists</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_pedagogy.html" title="Critical pedagogy">critical pedagogues</a>, and even a few other <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocacy.html" title="Advocacy">advocates</a> who have used the term - dating back into the 1980s, when I was probably the subject of the said non-existant phobia. Can you please explain how this term doesn't make your grade, and what gives you more authority than the articles referenced? Does anyone else support that concern? And for the sake of being <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pithy" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:pithy">pithy</a>, can you compare and contrast why <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapbox.html" title="Soapbox">soapbox</a> has an article of its own, but pedophobia should not? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 07:02, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
