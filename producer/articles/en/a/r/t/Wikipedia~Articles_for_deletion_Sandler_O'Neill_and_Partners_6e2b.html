<li><b>Delete</b> - Let us address <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. The sad fact that a tragic loss of life struck this firm heavily is not, in itself, a measure of notability. There are *not* multiple non-trivial published works that address what the firm does. The only possible notability it had, however briefly, was when it was nearly destroyed. I'm afraid it doesn't meet notability for me, based on how I see WP:CORP. --<font style="background:black"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="LightSteelBlue">Shrieking Harpy</font></a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/17px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="17" height="11" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a></font><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a></sup><sup>|</sup><sup>Count</sup> 21:30, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- I have to point out that Sandy Dancer, above, is being defeatist. If there are more important financial institutions than this one that don't have their articles, then those <i>also</i> deserve articles. Let's get busy and write them. We aren't using up paper, after all. This is a very notable firm, regardless of the 9/11. The fact that it also became part of history on that date works in favor of its notability, though, not against. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 22:02, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Can't be kept</b> I thought I would look at the article to see whether it might be kept. Unfortunately, as written there is nothing written about the company which would suggest it merits a place in wikipedia. Obviously the entry concentrates on the World trade centre terrorist actions. I'm sorry to sound cold, but as a user of Wikipedia, I would quite like to have some information on the casualties of the event, and that is what the article must provide - but I wouldn't be looking for this article under this name, so it would be almost senseless to put it in. I don't know whether it exists, but I can't see a problem with a page detailing the statistics of the event, which companies, were involved, how many people in each, where their offices were, etc. THere is a story to be told, and valuable information but this is not the way to enter it. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 23:37, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I read Mantanmoreland after I wrote above. I think the criteria I would apply is that the company has been used as an example by many reports - at the very least there ought to be an explanation of why this company has become an example and several references to reports. That doesn't come across in the article, it sounds as if it is one of several hundred. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 23:43, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, the article does <u>not</u> have to provide a list of terrorist casualties of the company to show notability. If you would like to see a list of casualties, you can make a request on the article's <a href="../../../s/a/n/Talk%7ESandler_O%27Neill_and_Partners_e355.html" title="Talk:Sandler O'Neill and Partners">Talk page</a>, but that has nothing to do with AfD. Besides, outside of that tragedy this company is presently a real and important international financial company in the investment world. Just a casual recent google news search and you can already find numerous business/finance articles where this company or its representatives are consulted, sourced and quoted as valuable financial analysts. <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:x_LLbY-BjccJ:www.chinapost.com.tw/business/detail.asp%3FID%3D94576%26GRP%3DE+%22Sandler+O%27Neill+and+Partners%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=26" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:x_LLbY-BjccJ:www.chinapost.com.tw/business/detail.asp%3FID%3D94576%26GRP%3DE+%22Sandler+O%27Neill+and+Partners%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=26" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/4316802.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/4316802.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061106.RNYSE06/TPStory/Business" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061106.RNYSE06/TPStory/Business" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.financialnews-us.com/?page=ushome&amp;contentid=1046630818" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.financialnews-us.com/?page=ushome&amp;contentid=1046630818" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://news.monstersandcritics.com/business/article_1209566.php/Business_Roundup" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.monstersandcritics.com/business/article_1209566.php/Business_Roundup" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 00:14, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Regarding the stats cited above, the key words here are "participated", "co-managed" and "advising". Bank deals such as debt and equity offerings typically have multiple banks and financial advisory firms participating in the deal. It is not unusual to have 3, 4 or 5 (or significantly more in syndicated loan deals for instance) large major banks (such as <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citigroup.html" title="Citigroup">Citigroup</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche_Bank_93b5.html" title="Deutsche Bank">Deutsche Bank</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merill_Lynch_1d93.html" title="Merill Lynch">Merill Lynch</a>) participating at different levels for different fees (Lead Manager, Senior Co-Manager, Junior Co-Manager, Lead Advisor, Co-Advisor, Bookrunner, Documentation Agent etc etc) <i>plus</i> smaller firms such as Sandler dealing with less capital intensive or specialized aspects of the deal which the larger institutions decline because the fees offered are too small (major banks turn down business all the time when the fees are too small). So "participating in raising $66.4bn for its clients" means that Sandler took part in $66.4bn worth of deals which larger players had the major roles. A better indicator would Sandler's actual earnings (a small fraction of the value of the deals). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 06:35, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Your analysis is of course correct. However, what these numbers indicate is that Sandler is a player even if it is not a top-bracket firm. That and combined with its Sept. 11 losses make this, in my view, a definite "keep."--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 16:10, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Wikipedia is not a memorial" doesn't mean that notable deaths must be ignored in determining notability of a company. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guideline naturally focuses on the routine case; it shouldn't be interpreted to mean that a single momentous event can <i>never</i> be the basis for keeping an article about a company. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 08:59, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Mantanmoreland, and by applying the "passer-by" notability test. (Yeah, ok, I just made it up). I'm just passing by, and I've heard of them...ergo, they're notable. (I'm fully aware that this test in no way comports with WP:Notability.) Seriously, though - if this company really does fail WP:Corp, I'd say that this is a good time to ignore all rules. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 19:02, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
