<p>Not notable; vanity page. Also looking at the other pages linked to by the Gaming_Horizon article to see if they are similar...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Note:</b> The page was just a placeholder for me to add more content later when the deletion submitter flagged it, I had just submitted the full version before I saw the deletion vote. Working on too many pages at once, methinks. (My second day as a submitter) <a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel86</a> 03:45, Dec 3, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note (again):</b> Regarding the lack of notability, some staff members of Gaming Horizon are notable members of internet culture. Aaron was the first person to bring hands-on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_%28game_system%29_b5ef.html" title="The Phantom (game system)">Phantom</a> coverage (including the first ever pictures) to the public, and he is probably GH's top editorialist. I realize some of the other staff members lack notability, so I will hold off on the creation of stub pages for them until they do something interesting =) <a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel86</a> 03:54, Dec 3, 2004 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel86</a> is the subject of the article (despite refering to himself in the third person), these claims are invalid without verification. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> 07:44, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, vanity. Not only was this never properly listed on vfd, but Asriel86 improperly removed the vfd notice <i>the same day it was applied</i>; this was going to be an independent nomination. Gaming Horizon should be looked at very carefully as well; <s>I'm not nominating it at this time, though I'm sorely tempted</s>. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 03:54, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Maybe take a nap? Other than some pointless staff pages that I later admitted I shouldn't have made, I don't see what the problem with Gaming Horizon is. If <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> can have an article, why can't it? And as for this article, I'd be glad to see some outside votes (didn't know it wasn't listed correctly, wondered why it was so inactive), but I'll contribute my obligatory <b>keep</b>. I was planning on adding articles for several gaming journalists in the future, and this would make a poor precedent for the legitimacy of professional journalists (internet ones especially) on a resource so closely connected to the internet and its culture. <a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel86</a> 04:45, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Self-serving <b>Comment</b> again, since Korath is turning this into a character arugment. The VFD was added to this article when it was just a stubb that looked like all the vanity pages here, name &amp; birthdate. Once I added some content, he retracted his delete vote. I ASSUMED that if the person who flagged the article in the first place changed his vote and that there were no other delete votes, it would be ok to remove the flag. I guess I was wrong. Also, I guess I should have used an anon IP to contribute this article, as I doubt most bibliographic articles about internet-culture people haven't been edited by their subjects. <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Lane_56ad.html" title="Sarah Lane">Sarah Lane</a>, for one.

<li>Where do you get that from? GH was the first place to host pictures and a hands-on preview of the system. Just because the site is getting lambasted as advertisement, it doesn't mean it cant even be referenced. Once the Phantom: Rewound features go back up (they got dropped in a server move), I will link to them in the external links section, since they detail the entire running history of the system. Unless, that is, I'm not supposed to provide valid information if I'm the person who compiled it. I also think that article containing the first pictures of the system is a notable piece of information for Phantom history. I'm fine with excluding that link as it is included in the Phantom: Rewound piece I mentioned before. For cripes sake, you dont have to discount every edit I've ever made because you don't like the ones pertainant to myself -- I built that Phantom page from the ground up; I'm more than a vane advertiser. I don't need to have all my legit contributions removed. --<a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel86</a> 18:35, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
