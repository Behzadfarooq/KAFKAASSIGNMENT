<p>This is a page about a researcher, but it doesn't state what the outstanding importance of this researcher is to be included in an encyclopaedia; that is, it seems non-notable. IMHO we allow Chiara Nappi to be here, we would have to maintain a page about every research professor of every university in the world. If instead Chiara Nappi is an outstanding researcher of her field, we need more references declaring why and how it is so. Being the page as it is, I suspect it's vanity. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclopia_3946.html" title="User:Cyclopia">Cyclopia</a> 03:26, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, she's an outstanding researcher. See, for example, <a href="http://www.onassis.gr/english/scholars/ite.php" class="external free" title="http://www.onassis.gr/english/scholars/ite.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.onassis.gr/english/scholars/ite.php</a> In my experience with Wikipedia articles about professors, the more one expands the article, the greater the evidence of notability, particularly at long-established and prestigious institutions. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 05:05, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the link you gave me, the only reference to Prof.Nappi is <i>"...while lectures were also given by distinguished Professors <a href="../../../i/g/o/Igor_Klebanov_a35f.html" title="Igor Klebanov">Igor Klebanov</a> (Princeton University), Ioannis Bakas (University of Patras), <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashoke_Sen_8cce.html" title="Ashoke Sen">Ashoke Sen</a> (Harish Research Institute – Chandra), Elias Kiritsis (University of Crete), Kostas Skenderis (University of Amsterdam) and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiara_Nappi_b1f0.html" title="Chiara Nappi">Chiara Nappi</a> (Princeton University)".</i> The outstanding character of Klebanov and Sen academic career (discoveries etc.) is well established in their articles: the curriculum of Nappi as read in the article seems to be that of a brilliant but not outstanding researcher. There is described she worked on this and that, but no outstanding advancement made by her is described. If there are, they should be added to the article (and the article kept). --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclopia_3946.html" title="User:Cyclopia">Cyclopia</a> 11:15, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"brilliant but not outstanding researcher"&#160;???? so.. according to your parameters, only Einstein and a very few other scientists deserve to be on Wikipedia???

<dd>If you can describe a well known (from the community) and important scientific discovery or theory that puts her above the average of her field, I'm fine.

<dl>
<dd>I fear Prof.Witten must be seriously worried of your love for Prof.Nappi. Jokes apart, your additions to the article are useful (at least now it's more clear what are the research fields in which she works). However, I'm personally still not convinced: <i>One of the major contributions of Dr. Nappi to modern astrophysics was the use of the Yang-Mills theory’s Yangian symmetry to D=4.</i> - can you explain to people not in the field why is this a <b>major</b> contribution?&#160;; <i>Dr. Nappi was deeply involved in finding a relation between approaches to integrability in the Superconformal Yang-Mills theory</i> - did she found this relation? why is simply working on this relation important (Thousands of researchers work on protein folding, a basic problem of molecular biology, but this doesn't make all of them notable.)? The same questions apply for the other contributions listed. The problem is that even I could write a page about myself and by carefully choosing words I can look at least as an important researcher as prof.Nappi. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclopia_3946.html" title="User:Cyclopia">Cyclopia</a> 22:29, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You really need a good psychologist.. so to talk about your personal problems.. and the fact that you die of envy for those who, in their life, have succeeded, while you obviously haven't. Perhaps.. if you spent less time in front of a PC and more in a Lab doing some research, you too could become famous.. what do you say? BTW: today it's sunday.. you dont have friends to go out with? oh.. I see.. that's why you hate the whole world.. Go out, in the real life, and make some friends!

I don't mind that much about it (it just makes me laugh to hear "get a life" from someone that spent the whole day editing the wikipedia page of an astrophysic professor), but it's bad for Wikipedia to have users personally harassing other users. It's a waste of time and energies (mostly yours). As for succeeding in my work, I'm pretty happy given my age and career, thanks. As for my real life (despite it shouldn't be your concern) I'm happy to tell you today I'm at home because in the two preceding days I had even a bit too much real life&#160;:D.

<dd>Question: the fact that you, "not in the field", might not understand in what proportion the scientists who worked on the Quantum theory, Relativity and the M theory singularly contributed to the creation of these cornerstones of modern physics, means that we must delete the pages of all those people?
<dl>
<dd>A lot of people worked on these three fields. Many are notable; many more are not. There are surely borderline cases -the world is not black-or-white. If I go, for example, reading the page about <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Witten_3887.html" title="Edward Witten">Edward Witten</a> is obvious to me why he's on our encyclopaedia, even if I'm not in the field. This is true for also other less known scientists. For prof.Nappi, this is far from being obvious instead (IMHO). That's why it should be extensively explained, if really she's that outstanding contributor to physics. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclopia_3946.html" title="User:Cyclopia">Cyclopia</a> 23:32, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"I'm personally still not convinced".. and who cares? who are you to judge and censure a page? even more if you understand nothing about astrophysics.. why do you criticize? I am scared of people like you.. the day you are given a little bit of "power", you use it to feel powerful and destroy everything that you dont understand or that you feel might make you feel uncomfortable.. People like you are dangerous.. because you know that you "mean" nothing to the world and therefore, as soon as you get some power, you use it to destroy the others..just to feel a little bit important.--<a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_mcandrews_eaae.html" title="User:J mcandrews">J_mcandrews</a>

<dd>If I was like you describe, I would just have deleted the page. Instead I'm putting it on vote here, looking for an open discussion with my peers and to reach consensus. Now consensus is <i>against</i> my proposal, but I don't mind that much: I'm willing to accept the verdict of the community. It's you that are verbally assaulting me.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with Cyclopia. You could make this kind of "Keep" argument for virtually every single university professor in America. The entire point of being a professor is that you get paid to do research into your specialty, which usually means that if you're any good you come up with new findings. This is only encyclopedia-worthy if your new findings have a great impact on society, not if you're just making a slight tweak to some theoretical framework. — <i><a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a></i> 22:14, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
