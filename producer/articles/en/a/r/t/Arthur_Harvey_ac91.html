<p>Major <b>Arthur Harvey</b> was born in <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edom%2C_Texas_facc.html" title="Edom, Texas">Edom</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusk_County%2C_Texas_5e46.html" title="Rusk County, Texas">Rusk County</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">September 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>. He was a writer, businessman, oil pioneer, family man and a veteran of both World War I and II.</p>
<p><a name="Life_prior_to_World_War_II" id="Life_prior_to_World_War_II"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Harvey_ac91.html" title="Edit section: Life prior to World War II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life prior to World War II</span></h2>
<p>He enlisted in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> and served with the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._9th_Infantry_Regiment_ed5f.html" title="U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment">9th Infantry Regiment</a>, <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._2d_Infantry_Division_afe8.html" title="U.S. 2d Infantry Division">2nd Infantry Division</a> in which he received <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_stars.html" title="Battle stars">battle stars</a> at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Saint-Mihiel_97a9.html" title="Battle of Saint-Mihiel">St. Mihiel</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Champagne_7f2d.html" title="Battle of Champagne">Champagne</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/u/Meuse-Argonne_Offensive_23d6.html" title="Meuse-Argonne Offensive">Meuse-Argonne</a>. Based on his military records he was active from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> until <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> and he was promoted from <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_%28rank%29.html" title="Private (rank)">private</a> to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">sergeant</a>. During the war, he made friends with a young woman, Marta, in the village in Germany near which he was stationed. After World War II he sent gifts to aid her and her family during the rebuilding of Germany. He always received thank-you letters from her, written in English, telling him a little about her family. He wrote her once and said in it that when he was a bombing officer during the war he always thought of her when they would go on a bombing raid. After World War I he remained in the reserves, being promoted to <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_lieutenant.html" title="Second lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_lieutenant.html" title="First lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to enlisting, Arthur worked in the lumber business, handling a canthook on the skidway of a small East Texas saw mill for $1.50 a day. Another early job was pushing a wheelbarrow filled with mortar to help build a brick plant near <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrison%2C_Texas_28c8.html" title="Garrison, Texas">Garrison, Texas</a>. This job also paid $1.50 a day. This was six-day work, but he had to spend fifty cents a day seven days a week for board. He then got a job picking cotton for fifty cents per hundred pounds of cotton -- with free board. He made enough profit to make a good start toward growing a crop of his own in East Texas.</p>
<p>After his discharge from the Army, he returned to Rusk County and married Elizabeth Gage of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Laneville%2C_Texas_af7f.html" title="Laneville, Texas">Laneville, Texas</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>. He farmed in Rusk County for a year, and he realized late in 1920 that his savings were gone and his farming prospects were not good. He then took the job of a substitute railway clerk in <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston.html" title="Houston">Houston</a>. He and his wife resided at 706 Smith Street with their daughter, Elizabeth Inez Harvey (born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>). This address, 706 Smith Street, is where the Federal building is now located in downtown Houston.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, Arthur Harvey had reached the top salary possible as a railway mail clerk. When he had gone as far as he could go in the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_Office_4bd6.html" title="Post Office">Post Office</a>, he felt he had to open up more opportunities somehow. He found out that the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Service_5a55.html" title="Internal Revenue Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> offered very good possibilities, but to go there he had to take a demotion, which meant a lower salary and they had to sell their house.</p>
<p>When he was first working for the Post Office after World War I, his job was to toss the bags full of mail off the "mail car," a freight car in which the postal workers were sorting, bagging and delivering mail. He memorized the sequence of the towns to which he would be tossing mail bags. After he went to the IRS he needed to study for exams, which he took just as fast as he was eligible. To do this he carried small cards in his suit jacket pocket with the information noted on them. He would study these whenever he had a few minutes, and even when he was in his 70's he used those "flash cards" to learn Spanish. He passed all the IRS exams and moved right up the ranks and became a highly ranked auditor, eventually writing the manual on what constitutes criminal fraud in tax matters. That manual was still in use many years later (Joyce Neville, July 10, 2006).</p>
<p>He then began working for the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bureau_of_Internal_Revenue_2ea5.html" title="Bureau of Internal Revenue">Bureau of Internal Revenue</a> in 1926. He handled many fraud investigations for what is now the Criminal Division of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Service_5a55.html" title="Internal Revenue Service">Internal Revenue Service</a>, being stationed in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a> and <a href="../../../t/y/l/Tyler%2C_Texas_2e3c.html" title="Tyler, Texas">Tyler</a> and working throughout the nation. While working for the IRS, he audited some oil men, and in that way began to learn something about the oil business. After intense study (the oil business was new at the time), he had a chance to make an investment in a percentage of royalty in a little piece of real estate which soon became famous as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_East_Texas_Oil_Field_d120.html" title="The East Texas Oil Field">The East Texas Oil Field</a>, home of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spindletop.html" title="Spindletop">Spindletop</a> and other historic <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_gusher.html" title="Oil gusher">gushers</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his wife, Elizabeth Gage died in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a> and he was remarried to Sylva Irene Vogelsong of <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanicsburg%2C_Pennsylvania_597a.html" title="Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania">Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania</a> in 1929. They had two children: Arthur Herbert Harvey (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>) and Sylva Anne Harvey (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>).</p>
<p>With the money he had saved from oil royalties while he continued to work for the BIR/IRS, he was able to drill his own well in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>. He chose <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marion_County%2C_Illinois_c588.html" title="Marion County, Illinois">Marion County</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, for his first operation, which resulted in the discovery of the <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonti.html" title="Tonti">Tonti</a> oil field, which has produced several million barrels of oil. The center of this field was owned by Mr. Harvey. The Tex-Harvey Oil Company was set up to handle the development of this field (which was later sold).</p>
<p>Arthur continued to drill wells as the money came in from his Illinois boom. He took many chances and came up dry on nine different ventures until the tenth, which he drilled in <a href="../../../a/n/d/Anderson_County%2C_Texas_2db0.html" title="Anderson County, Texas">Anderson County, Texas</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, which brought on the discovery of the East Long Lake field, all of which was now owned by the Harvey Company.</p>

<p><a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> soon came, and Arthur Harvey volunteered again for military service and was commissioned a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Forces_8bec.html" title="United States Army Air Forces">Army Air Forces</a>.

Harvey came out of World War II a <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">major</a>.</p>
<p>Major Harvey returned to the United States and resumed active management of the "Tex" Harvey Oil Company, of which he was president and sole owner.
