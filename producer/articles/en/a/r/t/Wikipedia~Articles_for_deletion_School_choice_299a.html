It's like calling the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_debate.html" title="Abortion debate">abortion debate</a> article the pro-choice movement or the pro-life movement and presenting only one side. Despite its age, it does not even have an "oppose" section to go along with the "support" section. Finally, its references are filled with think tanks, which, no matter whether they are liberal or conservative, only excel in producing garbage posing as reseach and analysis. They make industry trade associations look like reliable, impartial sources by comparison. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:25, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. POV forking is when someone copy-pastes an article at a different title and starts editing it to make it present a different point of view. Such articles are usually extremely similar to the original and very newly created. I am absolutely <i>not</i> convinced that this article is a POV fork. First, this article was created on 13 September 2001, making it one of Wikipedia's oldest. If it does duplicate other articles, I think it is the other articles which are at fault, not this one. Second, there are sections here which I cannot find in either of the articles cited as being duplicates, for instance the section on magnet schools. Finally, neither <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_voucher.html" title="Education voucher">education voucher</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">alternative education</a> will cover that there are some school districts, such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Schools_f611.html" title="Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools">Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools</a> which have school choice even though the parents can choose to send their child to another "normal" school and not alternative education schools. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:41, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, If I'm being blunt, the article is a complete disaster of POV pushing, poor writing, laughable attempts at forming arguments and pretty much reads like it was written by someone (or several people) who declined the choice to go to school. All of those problems though can be solved through <b>Merciless editing</b>. As <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> has stated above, this is a veryold article in Wikipedia terms and is not technically a POV fork. The best bet here is to go through the article and edit out or rewrite all the junk. This absolutely is a valid topic that can support a good article; it's just waiting for someone to come along and write one.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Sjakkalle, it should be possible to present this in a balanced way. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 17:50, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> needs editing, but that is not a reason to delete. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 00:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The first version of <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_voucher.html" title="Education voucher">Education voucher</a> had as its entire content "The topic of education vouchers is a quite distinct one from <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_choice.html" title="School choice">school choice</a>, q.v." - on this evidence, the two are different topics, but if one is a fork, it isn't this one that is a year older than education voucher. <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_voucher.html" title="Education voucher">Education voucher</a> is also a daughter article of <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_choice.html" title="School choice">school choice</a>. The first non-redirect version of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">Alternative education</a> to contain anything more than a stub template (from January 2006) was "Alternate education is an umbrella term referring to a number of approahces to the education of children other than standard classrooms, such as <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_schools.html" title="Alternative schools">Alternative schools</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeschooling.html" title="Homeschooling">homeschooling</a>." Again we see that that article is both newer and a different topic. Article is clearly <b>not a fork</b>. It is incomplete, it ignores forms of school choice such as that in the Boston, Massachusetts public schools where parents get to prioritize among existing public schools (as part of the desegregation effort), independently of the existence of charter and other private schools. If it is currently POV, that is not reason for deletion - it needs to be hopelessly and inevitably POV. This is clearly a topic about which a NPOV article could be written - so go write it. And as to the claim that it is entirely favorable, the "Criticism" section contains arguments against - it is the successor to the "Arguments Against" section that was created in March 2004. In my conclusion the only true portion of the nomination is "very controversial school choice concept" - it is neither a fork nor 100% advocacy. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:28, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> as <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_voucher.html" title="School voucher">School voucher</a> and <b>merge</b> any extra content from <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_voucher.html" title="Education voucher">education voucher</a> into it. "School voucher" is the neutral term; "school choice," like "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_tax.html" title="Death tax">death tax</a>" and "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-to-work_law.html" title="Right-to-work law">right-to-work law</a>," is a propaganda term. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:36, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> content but needs to be combined somehow with the myriad other articles about the same subject. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 20:56, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can understand people having a problem with the Support and Criticism section, but I spent a good amount of time creating the data and definitions part. AFAIK, no other entry in Wikipedia provides a definition of the different kinds of School Choice out there. One specific example would be of Tuition Tax Credits, which are different from Vouchers. Also, this article tries to provide pertinent examples of each kind of School Choice. By contrast, the Education Voucher doesnt even have a reference to the Milwaukee School Voucher program which is the largest such program in the USA. I am sorry if I am a litle defensive, but I think that the info (if not the Pro/Con sections) is valuable and unique. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougRisk_2661.html" title="User:DougRisk">Ian Lewis</a> 16:59, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>-POV can be clean up and it has useful information that would be a loss to delete.<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne27</a> 05:30, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
