<p>This was nominated for deletion in July 2005 (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hadiths_related_to_Mut%27ah_017a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hadiths related to Mut'ah">the first nomination</a>), but it passed. Since that time, this article has been tagged with a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} template. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the article could ever have that template removed. As the nominator from the first AfD said, Wikipedia is not a source for <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadiths</a>, but that's exactly what this article is. It doesn't read very well and, as it has existed for the past fourteen months, is far from encyclopedic. A couple external links or a few paragraphs in another article (perhaps <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikah_Mut%E2%80%98ah_e429.html" title="Nikah Mut‘ah">Nikah Mut‘ah</a>) may work, but I fear this article is unsalvagable. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 01:11, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

And it is evident from the article that it goes to great lenght in providing scholarly opinions and interpretations of those specific hadith. It is well sourced and a notable subject, quoting from the most prominent Islamic scholars. Yes, it needs to be cleaned up, and has not been done so in a long time since the topic is highly scholarly and hence, it lacks a large number of people editing on it, but that is not a valid reason to delete an article. I did made some improvements right before the afd, and ill make some more. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 12:17, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Scholarly input aside, this article makes no sense at all to someone unfamiliar with the subject. It has been listed as needing cleanup for a very long time. If someone could please rewrite according to the manual of style, and with sufficient context that a non scholar can understand it, I might consider a keep vote. As it sits, I cannot determine even if the subject is notable enough to have an article in Wikipedia.

<dd>Leaning that way-- not paper. Still thinking about it. I think the problem is the question of the notability of the subject. We have two editors far more knowledgeable than I on opposite sides of the discussion. JD raises an intersting point, but I think the article has potential to rise above that criticism. We still have some time to sort this out. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 20:40, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is more than so, it is mainly built on scholarly comments of the hadith. It could be argued that this is not the right place to dump hadith, but this is definitly the right place to present scholarly views on notable and controversial topics, and you can not present the scholars view without presenting the subject of the views.

<dd>No it is not. I know, since i am working on it. And the information in it <b>is</b> already usefull for those familiar with the topic.

<dd>You mean per "there is to many hadith and this should be deleted", arguing that <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha%27s_age_at_marriage.html" title="Aisha's age at marriage">Aisha's age at marriage</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hadith.html" title="List of hadith">List of hadith</a> should also be deleted, no mater how many scholars are quoted, or per "no cleanup", ignoring the cleaup i have made so far? Or is it something more in line with the comments of user:Islamic?

<li><b>Delete</b> - If the article still hasn't been made satisfactory since the first AfD, it shouldn't be on here.

<dd>It is not strange to an article to be hard to grasp for the average reader, just take a look at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carminati-McLenaghan_invariants_a76d.html" title="Carminati-McLenaghan invariants">Carminati-McLenaghan invariants</a>, that article gave me 0 (zero) information. This is a higly specialized and scholarly topics, and you need to be familiar with mutliple terms and names to fully grasp all the content. That is hard to eliminate given the nature of the topic, but it has been considerably cleaned up and is still being done so.

<p>Guys, i know this article is having a hard time, its hard to comprehend the topic, but its due to its scholarly aspect, its controversial and some people rather have <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo.html" title="Status quo">status quo</a> and pretend the controversy is not there, rather pretend that Shi'a are just stupid for not accepting the majority view, and rather pretend that Shi'a can not possibly have any arguements. And there are very few people editing it, but is that really grounds for deletion? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:40, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
