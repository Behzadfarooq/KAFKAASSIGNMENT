<p>Banshee Worx was founded in May 2003 some 2 months after the ending of Lightning Records which was the company that took care for the Bonzai brand and imprint since 1992 until early March 2003. Now things changed and Banshee Worx was formed by Fly (owner and founder of the Bonzai trademark), Marnik (former International and A &amp; R from Lightning Records) and 2 artist/producer/dj’s who were also part of the Lightning Records artist roster, namely: Yves Deruyter (Belgium’s finest DJ) and Laurent Véronnez (aka Airwave) (one of the biggest upcoming talents for the next years to come!!!).</p>
<p>So, nothing much has changed, a new entity has been formed and the same driving forces behind the succes of the Bonzai imprint will continue to serve the universe with the greatest trance music with artists like Airwave, Yves Deruyter, Push, Plastic Boy, Quadran, Lolo, DJ Fire, Fire &amp; Ice, Solar Factor, Cape Town, Philippe Van Mullem , ... and many new ones to come.</p>
<p>Almost 3 years have passed since the launch of Banshee Worx and we are still expanding, dedicated and secure, our little group of labels and artists. With the continuously descending physical music market we have been devoting a lot of time in developing our on-line activities. Not only do we keep a weekly updated webstore running (including customized soundcarriers) but also launched the Bonzai Digital Network, where we offer all cd- and vinylreleases + digital only releases for digital download at fair rates both via our own downloadshop powered by Audio Jelly and a range if digital download partners including the number one worldwide downloadshop iTunes Music Store, Beatport, ID &amp; T Dance-Tunes, Track It Down, Deeep.Net, ...</p>
<p>In addition to support the wide range of labels we handle, with an average of 6 to 8 physical releases a month and additionally all releases in digital format + exclusive digital only releases, we have created the iPOOL, a dedicated website that delivers both promotional music and the iPool Supreme Membership that delivers music via a unique podcast link.</p>
<p>What would the use be of all these investments without……NEW ARTISTS&#160;! Since the company start we have signed a bunch of new and old talents such as, DJ Elof, Vincent Kriek, Jamez, Vlad Dzyatko, Will Holland, Rob Styles &amp; DJ Danjo aka PRIMER, Solid Slide, Björn Small, Armandi, Liquified, Sunquest, Reminisence, NIB, Antidote, Ljungqvist, Soldout, Daddy, Latigidi, ... Undoubtfully this list is incomplete and unfinished taken in consideration the amount of good stuff that’s rocketed our direction.</p>
<p>And the story continues in 2006 ...</p>

KEA is an algorithm for indexing electronic full text documents with keyphrases, representing these documents' main topics. Keyphrase indexing provides useful metadata for storage and accessing electronic documents. In academic papers, keyphrases are assigned by the authors, in digital and conventional libraries professional indexers assign keyphrases manually, usually using a reference (e.g. Library of Congress Subject Headings). Blog authors assign content tags to their article, which is another form of keyphrases.</p>
<p>KEA is being developed at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, Hamilton. The current version allows to specify a controlled vocabulary, from which keyphrases should be chosen. KEA's results are close to those achieved by professional human indexers. It combines machine learning methods with natural language processing.</p>

<p>Brennan Battle was born in Northern Rochester, New York on February 23, 1989. His Mother Karla Battle was an Information Systems worker in the Corporate office of Circuit City, while his father, Cleo Battle, was involved in the Conventions Bureau in Syracuse. Brennan had one older brother, Kelvin Battle.</p>
<p>Brennan was brought up as any normal kid, except for the occasional robbery or forced move from apartment to apartment. Brennan never took notice of these things until his family moved to Virginia in 1995. He started Elementary school at J.A. Chalkley Elementary where he was above average and was placed in many advanced classes throughout elementary school. During Middle school he regularly attented the gifted classes where he was chalenged even more; however, still maintained his prestige. Without a doubt, he made it to high school. He was involved in the social affairs of school and the work that it entailed. Then there was a shift, in the 11th grade, Brennan started the I.B. program. He challenged beyond all belief. Even though the course was rigorous and brought about many dissapointments. He discovered himself and what he wanted to do in college. He became a dedicated filmmaker. He continued to be a voracious film-goer/watcher and continues to draw story boards and shoot short films.</p>
<p>With film on his side, Brennan was also a dedicated track and cross country runner. Starting in 7th grade he joined the track team. From there he was being noticed and set aside from the rest as being unique and above average. He continued to run track over the summer for AAU. He started cross country in 9th grade and has won many medals and honors. During his track career he showed significant improvements and successes. He ran the 800, the 1600 and the 4 x 400 relay. He particularly enoyed the 800 more than the others due to his high successes in these areas. He continues to run and train and compete in track events.</p>

For many years people have tried to harness, and in some cases harvest the phenomenon known as the Spreah. The Spreah is a very elusive creature and typically dwells in the caverns of the Johnson residence where he frequently ingests vast amounts of cheese whiz, Star Wars Battlefront, and of course, 36 gigs of pornography.</p>
<p>Poaching the Spreah</p>
<p>Poaching the Spreah refers of the ancient art of beating the Spreah senseless typically with the fist in an open field or padded area. Most poachers of the Spreah prefer to land their punches near the arm. However, some poachers of the Spreah prefer hitting the knee area in the hope that one day the Spreah will become immobile and his fleet of foot will no longer save him from the inevitable beat down he deserves 3-5 times a week.</p>

<p>2+2=4 It is a very well known fact. But is it true? Yes, it is. It has been tested and finally we can say without a doubt that 2+2 does indeed equal 4. Such mathmaticians agree with this such as Albert Einstein, Benjamin Frankin, and Jeffrey Levine. There is no arguing it anymore. So go to your math teachers and tell hand them this document and they can no longer fail your essays describing reasons why 2+2 equals 4. If you still don't believe it then we'll give you proof. For example, I have 2 apples, I go and get another different two apples, when I put these apples together (2+2), I then have four apples, so we can conclude 2+2=4. Now there is no more arguing that irefutible evidence. Thank you for all those who helped make this possible.</p>

"Ken Allen" was the name given to a Bornean orangutan at the San Diego Zoo. He became one of the most popular animals in the history of the San Diego Zoo because of his many successful escapes from his enclosures.</p>
<p>Ken Allen was born in captivity at the San Diego Zoo in 1971. During the 1980s, Ken Allen gained worldwide attention for a series of three escapes from his enclosure, which was believed to be escape-proof. During his escapes, Ken Allen would peacefully stroll around the zoo looking at other animals, and never acted violently or aggressively towards zoo patrons or other animals. Zookeepers were initially stymied over how Ken Allen had managed to escape. They began surveillance of his enclosure to try to catch him in the act, only to find that Ken Allen seemed to be aware that he was being watched for that very purpose. This forced zookeepers to go "undercover", posing as tourists to learn Ken Allen's escape route, but Ken Allen wasn't fooled. Moreover, other orangutans began following Ken Allen's lead and began escaping from the enclosure. Zoo officials eventually hired experienced rock climbers to find every finger, toe, and foothold within the enclosure and spent $40,000.00 to eliminate them. Ken Allen's ability to "outwit" his keepers, as well as his docile demeanor during his escapes, resulted in fame and adoration from zoo patrons, and numerous fan clubs, bumper stickers, and songs were created as a tribute to the wiley orangutan.</p>
<p>Ken Allen developed cancer and was euthanized in December 2000, according to the San Diego Zoo's website. He was 29 years old.</p>

Jun Makimura potrebbe sembrare una autrice sconosciuta ai meno esperti. In realtà anche coloro che non sono propriamente appassionati di shojo manga avranno senz'altro sentito nominare almeno una volta la sua opera più famosa, "Attacker You!", nota al pubblico italiano con il titolo di "Mila e Shiro, due cuori nella pallavolo". Nata il 22 gennaio (non ha voluto, come la maggior parte delle sue colleghe rivelare l'anno di nascita), ha debuttato nel 1974 con la storia "Kaedama star wa otoko no ko" ("La star Kaedama è un ragazzo") pubblicata dalla Kodansha, con la quale ha pubblicato quasi tutti i suoi manga. L'autrice è un'abilissima disegnatrice e tutti i suoi personaggi sono molto aggraziati, mentre per l'aspetto narrativo ha spesso preferito appoggiarsi a uno sceneggiatore. Le sue prime opere sono raccolte di storie brevi che la Makimura pubblicava su Nakayoshi. Ecco così che nel 1976 abbiamo "Elux no shiroi hana" ("Il fiore bianco di Elux", che raccoglie ben 5 storie brevi), nel 1978 escono "Hadashi no oojo Marietta" ("Marietta, la principessa dai piedi scalzi", che ne comprende stavolta 3) e "Apple Pie Story" ("Storia della torta di mele", credo sia un racconto unico), nel 1979 abbiamo "Ginga no princess" ("La principessa della galassia", con 3 storie), mentre nel 1980 è la volta di "Ooedo rhapsody" ("Rapsodia del grande Edo", comprendente 3 racconti). Nel 1980 Jun pubblica la sua prima storia in due volumetti, "Sue wa Hakase ka hanayome ka" ("Sue è la moglie di Hakase?") mentre nel 1982 esce "Kung Fu Lady", in un unico tankobon. Nel 1984 inizia la pubblicazione di "Choo no yooni" ("Come una farfalla"), un manga sportivo sceneggiato da Shizue Sawada in cui assistiamo alla crescita della protagonista Chihiro-chan, impegnata ad affermarsi nella ginnasta ritmica. Il manga è stato raccolto in 2 volumetti, e ne esiste anche un seguito in 3 tankobon usciti a partire dal 1986 con il titolo "Choo no mau hi" ("Il giorno in cui la farfalla danzerà "). Il 1984 è anche l'anno in cui esce il primo dei 3 tankobon di "Attacker You!", l'opera che consacrerà al successo la Makimura. Sceneggiata da Shizuo Koizumi, è la storia di You Hazuki (da noi Mila) che, trasferitasi in una nuova scuola, si iscrive al club di pallavolo portandolo a raggiungere numerose vittorie grazie alla propria abilità di schiacciatrice. La Makimura si è ritirata dalle scene per circa una decina d'anni, rifacendo capolino nelle librerie nipponiche nel 1994 con "Shiroi hado no yooni" ("Come una bianca colomba"), mentre da un paio d'anni ha iniziato a disegnare saltuariamente per collana Harlequin Series della Emerald Comics, la stessa in cui lavorano anche CHieko Hara e Yoko Hanabusa. In particolare abbiamo "Joonetsu wa tsumi" ("La passione è un peccato", su storia di Penny Jordan) e "Yume no Koukai" ("Il marinaio del sogno", su soggetto di Roberta Leigh). Come si può facilmente intuire, si tratta di storie dedicate a un target più adulto, riprese in parte anche dalla collana "Xme" pubblicata in Italia, che presenta romanzi stile Harmony disegnati da autrici famose+</p>

<p>the equation for accretion rate by a planetary core is given by:</p>
<p>Mdot = pi * R^2 * sigma * omega * Fg</p>
<p>where Fg is the gravitational focusing term which is dependent on the ratio of velocity of the planetesimal to escape velocity from the accreting planetary core and also the inclinations and eccentricities of the particles in the protoplanetary disk. Numerical simulations have shown that this equation give an accurate value for the rate of accretion for a non-migrating (i.e. orbital radius in fixed) planet.</p>

<p>LMPcoloursmall.jpgFounded by Harry Blech in 1949 as the UK’s first chamber orchestra, the London Mozart Players (LMP) is regarded as one of the finest ensembles, bringing together outstanding musicians from the UK and abroad to perform music of the highest quality. Internationally renowned for its live performances and CD recordings and particularly known for its definitive performances of the core Classical repertoire, it also has an innovative approach to music-making and gives many world premières, especially of British composers.</p>
<p>The LMP has performed with many distinguished conductors, including Sir John Barbirolli, Sir John Eliot Gardner, Sir Charles Mackerras, Sir Roger Norrington and Sir Georg Solti. Former Music Directors of the LMP include Andrew Parrott, an acknowledged expert in the field of early music, Matthias Bamert, Jane Glover and Harry Blech himself. Currently titled conductors are Sir James Galway OBE (Principal Guest Conductor) and Nicolae Moldoveanu (Associate Guest Conductor), with the actor Simon Callow CBE as the LMP’s Theatrical Advisor.</p>
<p>Concerts take place around the UK as well as at the orchestra's home, Fairfield Halls in Croydon, Surrey.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the orchestra plays more than 'just Mozart', although in Mozart's anniversary year, 2006, the LMP has performed his music at nearly 130 venues across Britain and in Europe.</p>

<p>Battle of Beaufort The Battle of Port Royal Island, Feb. 3, 1779, was little more than a hot skirmish, but it gave flagging Patriot morale a needed boost.</p>
<p>The British had landed a raiding force of 200 men and a howitzer on the island and although no attempt was made to capture Beaufort or assault Fort Lyttleton guarding it, the militia garrisoning the fort promptly took to their heels. This left the fort’s commander and his 20 men, all Continentals, no alternative but to spike the cannon and abandon the work.</p>
<p>He later was court-martialed, but completely exonerated since it was impossible for 20 men to defend the fort. No date for the landing or loss of the fort has been found, but it probably occurred about the end of January 1779.</p>
<p>About this time, 300 Charleston militia infantry supported by two field-pieces of the Charleston Artillery Battalion were dispatched to counter this British invasion of Palmetto State territory. The troops marched as far as Port Royal Ferry across Whale Branch, about 10 miles north of Beaufort, and set up camp on the mainland side.</p>
<p>There, on the night of Feb. 1, they were joined by their commander, Gen. William Moultrie, hero of the Battle of Sullivan’s Island on June 28, 1776. Moultrie found his men in hot debate over whether to cross the river which presumably would lead to fighting and the possibility that someone might get hurt.</p>
<p>Fortunately, about this time a small group of Beaufort militia, considerably braver than those who had left the fort, arrived at Moultrie’s camp and persuaded the Charleston men to cross the river and help defend the town.</p>
<p>Consequently, Moultrie left a guard for the camp and set out to cross Whale Branch. Today, a modern bridge whisks a car across the tidal stream in less than a minute. Moultrie, using the civilian ferry which probably was little more than a flatboat, began crossing his "army" during the morning of Feb. 2. By sunset he had 300 men and his artillery on the island and set out for Beaufort.</p>
<p>He arrived at the outskirts during the night, rested his troops for a few hours, then marched into town at sunrise, Feb. 3.</p>
<p>Leaving the troops to set up camp, Moultrie and his staff went junketing</p>
<p>— they rode out to view the abandoned fort. While there, a messenger arrived with news that the British, who apparently had been inactive since landing, were now headed for town and only five miles away.</p>
<p>Moultrie sent an officer on a fast horse racing ahead to alert the troops who were in ranks and ready to march by the time the general came galloping into town.</p>
<p>Another scout now reported that the British were fast approaching, so Moultrie hurriedly started his small army moving toward the enemy.</p>
<p>After marching about two miles, he received a third report — the British were not so close after all. They were still four miles away.</p>
<p>Granted more time, the general slowed the march and began looking for a favorable battleground. Before long, he found an excellent site, formed his troops, then sat back to await arrival of the enemy.</p>
<p>After an hour, no Redcoats had arrived, but a new report indicated they had changed their route and were now headed toward Port Royal Ferry.</p>
<p>Fearing his camp would be captured, Moultrie ordered his men into column again and set out in pursuit. He had gone about three miles and reached the vicinity of modern Grays Hill when another scout galloped up. The Redcoats were returning from the ferry, the scout reported and were less than a mile away.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the British had reached the ferry, but found the tide low and the ferry unable to operate. Consequently, they had given up the idea of attacking the camp and headed toward town.</p>
<p>Moultrie now looked desperately for the best available site for fighting and picked a swamp that would give his men cover. He headed for it only to discover the Redcoats already were in possession.</p>
<p>Halting about 200 yards from the enemy, the general formed his troops in a line across the road with the two fieldpieces, both 6-pounders, in the center. A third gun, a little 2-pounder which belonged to the Beaufort militia, he emplaced on the right protected by some woods. This piece was manned by the captain, who formerly commanded the fort, and several other officers, all voluntarily serving as privates.</p>
<p>The Americans opened the battle with fire from the two center artillery pieces, then Moultrie ordered both his wings to advance nearer the swamp and, as he put it, "...the firing became pretty general...."</p>
<p>The battle was the reverse of most Revolutionary War engagements —the Americans were in the open and the British snugged down amid bushes and brush at the edge of the swamp.</p>
<p>Before long, Moultrie found that his men were getting the worst of it and ordered them to take cover behind trees. The battle had now been going for about 45 minutes and the dreaded cry, "no more cartridges," was raised along the American line.</p>
<p>The artillery also reported that after firing about 40 rounds from each piece, they were almost out of ammunition. Faced with impending defeat, Moultrie ordered the guns withdrawn and the infantry to fall back, keeping pace with the artillery. This was a particularly dangerous maneuver with undisciplined militia who were prone to seek safety in flight at the slightest hint of retreat.</p>
<p>However, Moultrie was lucky — the Redcoats had started a quiet withdrawal just before the Americans. With no pressure against them, Moultrie’s untrained militia performed like veterans.</p>
<p>The mutual retreat left victory a tossup. But Moultrie, whose troops were a little slower, was last on the field and claimed credit for the battle which has come down in history as an American victory.</p>
<p>In retrospect, both sides did pretty well under the circumstances. The British, only 200 strong, obviously planned only to threaten Gen. Benjamin Lincoln’s supply line between Purrysburgh and Charleston and were in no position to fight the hordes of militia that could be aroused against them. Outnumbered three to two, these professionals held their own despite bad luck at the start of the battle. Their only artillery piece, the howitzer, was put out of action by a shot from one of the American 6-pounders.</p>
<p>The Americans, although untrained militia, stood in the open against the British regulars, a rare occurrence during the Revolution. They also, even if subject to argument, did hold the field at the end of the battle and thus, technically at least, were the winners. The Americans also accomplished their mission of driving off the enemy for the British left Port Royal Island and returned to Savannah.</p>
<p>Eight Americans were killed and 22 wounded. British casualties are difficult to ascertain, but were said to have been heavy. However, all sources of this information are American and may be inclined to exaggerate. Moreover, since the Americans, fighting in the open, had relatively light casualties, it seems doubtful that the British, with greater protection, would have suffered more. This is especially true since neither side seems to have made any real attempt to close and get down to serious fighting.</p>
<p>Consequently, American statements that the British lost all of their officers are probably wishful thinking and perhaps exaggeration of the two they did lose.</p>
<p>These officers were exhumed from shallow graves on the field and reburied by the Americans with full honors in St. Helena’s Episcopal Church cemetery. Certainly, had there been others, they would have been similarly honored.</p>

'the_auctioneer', or what is often referred to as auc, in the third person. the_auctioneer is a gamer; he plays the likes of DotA (a popular war3 mod), counterstrike-source and many other reputable titles. His notoriety comes mainly from his extremely high level of 'ownage' on the various South African servers. His favourite weapon choice in source™, is either the shotgun 12-guage or as is quite often the case, the more classic Nighthawk (or 'deagle'). 'the_auctioneer' is also very well known for helping other people, which has become well known in South Africa as auc's n00b tech support.</p>

<p>Ronald T. Raines (b. August 13, 1958 in Montclair, New Jersey) is an American chemical biologist. He is the Henry Lardy Professor of Biochemistry and a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>
<p>Raines received Sc.B. degrees in chemistry and biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, doing undergraduate research with Christopher T. Walsh. He received A.M. and Ph.D. in chemistry at Harvard University with Jeremy R. Knowles, the title of his doctoral thesis being “Energetics of Enzymatic Catalysis: Triosephosphate Isomerase”. He was a Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco with William J. Rutter. He joined the faculty at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1989. Raines has contributed broadly to the chemistry and biology of proteins. He demonstrated that mammalian ribonucleases can become potent cytotoxins and potential cancer chemotherapeutics. Raines discovered fundamental attributes of the collagen triple helix, enabling him to assemble triple helices that are stronger and longer than any found in nature. He developed the traceless Staudinger ligation as a means to couple synthetic peptides and thus synthesize proteins. Raines has been the research advisor of more than 25 doctorates and more than 20 postdoctorates. He is an author of more than 200 research papers, and an inventor on more than 10 US patents.</p>
<p>Raines has received the Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry and Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, the Emil Thomas Kaiser Award from the Protein Society, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Society of Chemistry. Raines is a founder of Quintessence Biosciences, Inc.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-28_f4c8.html" title="Edit section: Brandir Ribbon Rack">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brandir Ribbon Rack</span></h2>
<p>The Brandir Ribbon Rack is a revolutionary design for a bicycle rack that combined both functionality and aesthetics, garnering industry approval and widespread success. The characteristic design of the rack features a single, continuous piece of undulating metal that allows for storage of multiple bicycles. The design of the Brandir Ribbon Rack originated from wire sculptures created by David Levine in the 1970's. In November of 1978, a friend of Levine and ardent bicyclist, G. Duff Bailey, saw Levine's sculptures and informed Levine of the potential use of the design. Soon thereafter, Levine began mass marketing his invention and the Brandir Ribbon Rack received multiple awards and general industry acceptance.</p>
<p>In November of 1982, Levine discovered that another company, Cascade Pacific Lumber Co., was selling a product similar to the Ribbon Rack. Levine tried unsuccessfully to secure copyright protection for his design. In 1987, the landmark supreme court case, Brandir International, Inc. v. Cascade Pacific Lumber Co., was handed down. The ruling effectively denied copyright protection to the Brandir Ribbon Rack. In reaching its conclusion, the Court examined and clarified the legal principal of conceptual separability, settling on a test set forth in a law review article authored by Professor Denicola. The court found that, where design elements reflect a merger of aesthetic and functional considerations, the artistic aspects of a work cannot be said to be conceptually separable from the utilitarian elements. Accordingly, the Brandir Ribbon Rack was not protectible by Copyright Law.</p>

<p>Chatpoint is a number of different chatrooms. The mostly used Chatpoint is Chatpoint NL (The Dutch version of Chatpoint). the newest version of Chatpoint would be Chatpoint USA (CPUSA), where it is all English rooms.</p>
<p>Chatpoint differs from any other chatroom because it is an avatar chat, wh you get to create your very own little man/woman an can move them around the screen to sit next to the person you wish to chat to.</p>
<p>Chtpoint is watched and patrolled by moderators who try to keep the chat as clean and as friendly as they possibly can.<br />
There is an order of ranks within Chatpoint,the ranks are colour coded, and change the colour of your name tag, which determins what kind of chatter you are;<br />
<br />
If your colour is...</p>
<p>Orange - You are a guest to Chatpoint<br />
Yellow - You are a Chatpoint member<br />
Purple - You are a Chatpoint VIP member (which you pay for and gain benifits)<br />
Green - You are a moderator in training<br />
Blue - You are a full Moderator<br />
Dark Blue - You are a Senior Moderator<br />

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-28_f4c8.html" title="Edit section: Louis G. Mangini">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Louis G. Mangini</span></h2>
<p>Louis G. Mangini, born 1934, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York. Father, Giuseppe Mangini, who died tragically in the 5th Avenue Draft Riot in 1942, was an ardent supporter of nuclear proliferation and the elimination of all pan-Asian peoples and cultures. Mother, Lucinda Girbaldi, raised Louis until he attended west point in 1961. He graduated with honors and was shipped to Africa to maintain peace in the volatile Cape Horn region. Upon his return from Cape Horn, where he successfully held a workers rebellion at bay using brutal tactics promises of salvation, he started writing poems and participating in fundamentalist right-wing community initiatives in Brooklyn. After the death of his mother in 1966, Louis applied for and received a job working as a mail carrier in Manhattan, which he used as an affront to disseminate anti-Asian literature and coupons for non-Korean supermarkets. After he was exposed in 1968, a summary hearing was help in front of the Post-Master General, resulting in the revocation of Louis' mail-carrying license and pension. Devastated, he re-enlisted in the USMC and was transferred to Saigon with the rank of Brig. General. Accounts of Louis' time in Vietnam vary. Most soldiers in his command regarded him as a reserved and dignified man, who harbored an irrational hatred for both north and South Vietnamese alike. Other accounts of the Brig. General's behavior in Saigon are at best eccentric and at worst criminal. It was reported in “Our Side”, that Brig. Gen. Mangini personally killed or ordered the killings of up to 750 women, children and homosexuals. After his commission in Saigon was up, Mangini returned to Brooklyn where he continued writing poems and handing out literature, until one seasonably warm afternoon in late October, 1981 when a young teen of Thai descent posing as a masseuse, shot Mangini 5 times in the groin, rendering him unable to walk.</p>

<p>To Write Love On Her Arms (TWLOHA) is a charitable organization on its way to non-profit status. It was started in March 2006 by Jamie Tworkowski and a few others to help Renee Yohe, a 20 year-old drug/alcohol/cutting addict who was on the path to destruction. They created a fashionable shirt to sell at local churches and events in Orlando, FL to help pay for her rehabilitation. Tworkowski, a former employee of Hurley, Inc., and a writer for Relevant Magazine, wrote a short story depicting Renee's story. The story is printed on the inside of every shirt.</p>
<p>The shirt caught on in the Summer of 2006 as many popular bands began wearing the shirt at their concerts. Some people who have seen wearing the shirt or bracelet - Jon Foreman (Switchfoot), Paula Abdul, Dustin Kensrue (Thrice), Keller Harbin (formerly of The Chariot), Ryan Kirkland (Between The Trees), James Likeness (Copeland), Hayley Williams (Paramore).</p>
<p>The organization is beginning to expand to all over the globe, providing the means to help those in need of freedom from addictions.</p>
