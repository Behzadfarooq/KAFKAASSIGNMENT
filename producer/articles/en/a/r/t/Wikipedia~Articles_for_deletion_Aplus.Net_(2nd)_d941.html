<li>then they renamed it with the comment '(moved Aplus.net to Aplus.Net: Company name was capitalized incorrectly.)' back to the original article. It all seems a bit slimey to me. Personally, I've got nothing against companies in general, but in this case, I'm unclear what the advantage is for the wikipedia for having this article, and allowing this kind of stuff.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 17:49, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and salt</b>. Absolutely not. See <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, "Advertisements masquerading as articles". There is nothing substantive or encyclopedic here, just a laundry list of accomplishments and awards. Look at the author's contributions - they are all either working on this article, or spamming other articles with links to this one. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 17:34, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>I would say KEEP.</b> This simply an informational page about a company that is large enough and has created enough notable products to be featured in Wikipedia. The fact that the company has been featured in such large publications means that they are doing something important that will benefit the Wikipedia community.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would disagree with the “Conflict of Interest” point. I do not see exactly what part of that policy the articles breaks. I am assuming some users may think this is self promotion but the wikipedia policy is</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Examples of these types (self promotion) of material include:</dd>
<dd>1. Links that appear to promote products by pointing to obscure or not particularly relevant commercial sites (commercial links).</dd>
<dd>2. Links that appear to promote otherwise obscure individuals by pointing to their personal pages (vanity links).</dd>
<dd>3. Biographical material that does not significantly add to the clarity or quality of the article.</dd>
<dd><br />
I do not think the article breaks any of the above rules.

<dd>to me this article is written in very neutral point of view. Wiki-enforcer
<dl>
<dd>there are some curious omissions however, it strangely doesn't cover the sleezoid google bombing techniques that push the company way up in the google ranking, described here: <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=328399" class="external autonumber" title="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=328399" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.sumoc.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=1955D666-5004-2066-B7D2E4F4216F6CD7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sumoc.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=1955D666-5004-2066-B7D2E4F4216F6CD7" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?threadid=263081" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?threadid=263081" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Under the wikipedia rules, this would clearly need much more coverage in the article, including detailed description of how this works and why this means that the very high google ranking may be unjustified for the company. It's unclear that the article would end up in a positive light at the end of the day for the company.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 21:42, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as spam. This is one of the better written advertisements I've seen, but it remains nothing more than an advertisement none the less. Few of the links under "recognition" actually talk about the company itself. The rest are included because an employee of the company got a one line question/answer in an unrelated article. The entire section is basically nothing more than name dropping in an attempt to add legitimacy. The blatant linkspamming does not help their cause at all. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 00:17, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Notability seems to be better established, but I still don't see this meeting <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. The citations provided are rather trivial - just a one sentence blurb from the marketing director. In order to keep, I would like to see articles featuring the company and their contributions to the web hosting industry. With all the awards that they claim on their website, I would think this would be easy. I tried searching CNET, but found no mention of the Editor's Choice award and didn't go further than that. <b>Keep</b> if the awards can be verified. I'd also support <b>Speedy Delete</b> under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G11" title="WP:CSD">G11</a> unless it is substanstially rewritten in a NPOV manner since the article seems rather spammish to me. <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 00:48, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The page may be able to be encyclopedic, but certainly not in its current incarnation (or last).

This is all very distasteful. Clearly the author's intentions are dishonest per research by <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a>. It's a possible that the company could conceivably meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but the author no favours by using tactics like what we have witnessed.

I find that even the use of the word "Recognition" as a paragraph title is NPOV. "Ranked by" doesn't mean squat if you're not ranked #1 in a basket of important criteria, judged againts solid competition: so what if it's ranked by Netcraft? What is more, the Tier 1 Research ranking is unimpressive. I strongly suspect if we re-wrote the article and added references to the google bombing (which although are from blogs, are objective and easily reperformed), the author will beg us to delete the article&#160;;-) <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:05, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
