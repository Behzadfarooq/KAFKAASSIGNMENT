Arthur William Hodge</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Arthur William Hodge</b> (1763 - 1811) was a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a> farmer, member of the Council and Legislative Assembly and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_slave_owners.html" title="List of slave owners">slave owner</a> in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Virgin_Islands_8844.html" title="British Virgin Islands">British Virgin Islands</a> who was <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanging.html" title="Hanging">hanged</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">8 May</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1811.html" title="1811">1811</a> for the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> of one of his slaves.</p>
<p>It has been asserted that no other slave owner was ever executed for a murder of a slave in the history of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_West_Indies_f0ac.html" title="British West Indies">British West Indies</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> It has also been claimed that Hodge was the first <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white person</a> to have been <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">lawfully executed</a> for the <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">killing</a> of a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black person</a> or a slave,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> however, this is clearly not accurate.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hodge was born in the British Virgin Islands, but he studied at <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriel_College_8d11.html" title="Oriel College">Oriel College</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> and served in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a>. His wife was a sister-in-law of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquess_of_Exeter_683a.html" title="Marquess of Exeter">Marquess of Exeter</a>. He was described as a man of great accomplishments and elegant manners.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Upon his father's death, he returned to the British Virgin Islands to assume control of the family's plantation.</p>
<p>Hodge was executed for the murder of a single male slave, named Prosper. However, during the trial evidence was presented against Hodge in relation to the death several of his slaves, Tom Boiler, Prosper, Cuffy, Margaret and Else.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> However, it was the death of the last, Prosper, that resulted in Hodge's arrest, trial and ultimately his execution.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> (Restrictions on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Similar_fact_evidence.html" title="Similar fact evidence">similar fact evidence</a> were less consciously observed in colonial courts.) Subsequent estimates have suggested that between 1803 and 1808 Hodge may have murdered as many as sixty of the slaves who worked on his plantation.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hodge had certainly previously had over 100 healthy negro slaves on his plantation, but according to Daniel Ross, a witness at the trial, upon the death of Hodge's wife,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> there were no longer enough slaves to dig a grave for her. Ross was to further testify that he could not remember all the names of the negroes who had died in consequence of Hodge's cruelty.</p>

<p>Hodge was not well thought of on <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tortola.html" title="Tortola">Tortola</a> on account of his <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_in_the_British_Virgin_Islands_9a90.html#Treatment_of_slaves" title="Slavery in the British Virgin Islands">cruelty towards slaves</a>, and the cruel death that Prosper suffered proved to be the proverbial final step too far.</p>
<p>The main evidence given at the trial relating to the death of Prosper was given by Perreen Georges, a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_people_of_color.html" title="Free people of color">free woman of color</a>. She testified that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I was present when he [Prosper] was laid down and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flogging.html" title="Flogging">flogged</a> for a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mango.html" title="Mango">mango</a> which dropt [sic] off a tree, and which Mr Hodge said he should pay six <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shilling.html" title="Shilling">shillings</a> for;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> he had not the money and came to borrow it of me, I had no more than three shillings; he said to his master that he had no more money; his master said he would flog him if he did not bring it; he was laid down and held by four negroes, on his face and belly, and flogged with a cartwhip; he was under the last better than an hour; he then got up and was carried up to the hill; and his master said he should be flogged again if he did not bring the other three shillings; he was tied to a tree the next day; and the flogging was repeated; he was licked<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> so long that his head fell back, and he could not bawl out any longer; I supposed he was faint; I then went from the window, as I could not bear to see any more of it."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The assaults took place on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">2 October</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a> and the following day.

It then took three and half years for Hodge to be brought to trial, not least because he fled from his estates and had to be arrested by warrant. However, this is only a partial excuse; the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indictment.html" title="Indictment">indictment</a> was only issued <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">11 March</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1811.html" title="1811">1811</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_William_Hodge_df87.html" title="Edit section: The trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The trial</span></h2>
<p>The evidence against Hodge was strong and credible. In a small community like Tortola, most were well aware of the goings on at the Hodge plantation. Hodge's defence was not strong. The two strongest prosecution witnesses were Stephen McKeough, a white man who regularly inspected the Hodge estate, and Perreen Georges. Hodge tried to discredit them by alleging that McKeough was a drunk, and Georges was a thief, but both persons would have been well known enough by the <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury.html" title="Jury">jury</a> that the accusations did not stick. Hodge wisely sought to make no unfounded accusations against Daniel Ross, who also testified against him, as he was a <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_of_the_Peace_ad6e.html" title="Justice of the Peace">Justice of the Peace</a>.</p>
<p>Hodge called his sister, Penelope, and a witness described as an "old black woman" to give testimony to his innocence, but reports suggest that their evidence was one-sided and not regarded as credible.</p>
<p>As is customary in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a> legal systems, the defendant was allowed to address the jury before they retired to consider their verdict, and Hodge said this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"As bad as I have been represented, or as bad as you may think me, I assure you that I feel support in my afflictions from entertaining a proper sense of religion. As all men are subject to wrong, I cannot but say that the principle is likewise inherent in me. I acknowledge myself guilty in regard of many of my slaves, but I call God no witness to my innocence in respect to the murder of Prosper. I am sensible that the country thirsts for my blood, and I am ready to sacrifice it."</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, the jury were also charged with the words of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hetherington_97b3.html" title="Richard Hetherington">Richard Hetherington</a>, President of the Council of the Territory:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"...the law makes no distinction between master and servant. God created white and he created black creatures; and as God makes no distinction in administering justice, and to Him each is alike, you will not, nor can you alter your verdict, if murder has been proved - whether on white persons or on black persons, the crime is equally the same with God and the law."<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_30.html" title="April 30">30 April</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1811.html" title="1811">1811</a>, the jury retired to consider their verdict at about half past six in the morning. By eight o'clock, they returned with a guilty verdict. However, a majority of the jurors recommended mercy for Hodge. However, such recommendations are not binding, and the presiding judge, Chief Justice Robertson, pronounced that Hodge should be "hanged by the neck on Wednesday the 8th of May following, until he was dead, on a spot near unto the common prison."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_William_Hodge_df87.html" title="Edit section: The execution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The execution</span></h2>
<p>Governor <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Elliot_c04b.html" title="Hugh Elliot">Hugh Elliot</a> was compelled to commission a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a> to prevent reprisals "in a conjuncture so replete with party animosity". He also imposed <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_law.html" title="Martial law">martial law</a> every night from sunset to sunrise between the handing down of the verdict and Hodge's execution. Finally, he ordered the HMS <i>Cygnet</i> to stand by to support the civilian authorities in case needed. Elliot may have been motivated by a sense of self preservation - he had been the primary mover behind the arrest and trial of Hodge, and clearly many in the community would have been deeply unhappy about the conviction and proposed execution of a white man for the death of a negro slave.</p>
<p>In the week that followed Hodge was allowed to "make his peace with God", and was attended constantly by two ministers of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_church.html" title="Methodist church">Methodist church</a> at St Christophers. On the appointed day, he was led out at the jail. He addressed certain individuals whom he singled out in the crowd, and asked them to forgive him for injuries which they had received at his hands. He then addressed the crowd generally and asked them to forgive him. Then Arthur Hodge was hanged.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_William_Hodge_df87.html" title="Edit section: The law">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The law</span></h2>
<p>At the time of Hodge's trial, slavery was still legal, although the actual trade in African slaves had been abolished by the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave_Trade_Act_1807_e944.html" title="Slave Trade Act 1807">Slave Trade Act 1807</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> Africans who had previously been sold into slavery would not <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emancipation.html" title="Emancipation">formally be freed</a> until much later, in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1834.html" title="1834">1834</a>, under the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833_eddf.html" title="Slavery Abolition Act 1833">Slavery Abolition Act 1833</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, slave owners would often proscribe rules of conduct for the handling of slaves to remove fears of arbitrary or excessive punishments, but these were not binding in law.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> During his unsuccessful <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bail.html" title="Bail">bail</a> application, Hodge's own counsel argued "A Negro being property, it was no greater offense for his master to kill him than it would be to kill his dog," but the court did not accept the submission. Indeed, the point was dismissed without any serious discussion.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Part of the answer to the question is probably found in the fact that the boundaries of the legality of slavery were in fact little explored under the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a>, and it does not seem implausible that slavery could be permitted under the common law on the one hand, but for it to constitute a crime to kill a slave on the other.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> However, most cases dealing with the status of slaves are well documented and well considered (see generally, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_at_common_law.html" title="Slavery at common law">slavery at common law</a>). Hodge of course did not have any opportunity to appeal in the eight days between his conviction and execution.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that Hodge was hanged for essentially political reasons. There are several reasons why this might be.</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of slave uprisings had occurred in the British Virgin Islands, including a major one in May of 1790 at the Pickering plantation. The hanging of a notoriously cruel slave owner might have been thought of as a sop to help maintain control of the remaining slave population, who had grown restless as a result of the passing of the Slave Trade Act. If this was the intent, it was not effective, as major rebellions broke out subsequently in 1823 and again in 1830, and a major planned revoled was uncovered before it broke out in 1831.</li>
<li>The Governor of the day, Hugh Elliot, was a professed <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionism.html" title="Abolitionism">abolitionist</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> Reports suggest that Elliot personally supervised the proceedings against Hodge, although, as the trial was conducted before an independent judge with a sitting jury, it is unlikely he could have influenced its outcome. He would also wished to have been very careful - as much as he may have disliked slavery personally, he was as aware as anyone else in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> that an economic collapse would be likely in the region without slave labour. But it is noteworthy that nearly three years elapsed without anyone choosing to pursue Hodge at law, until Elliot took up his appointment.</li>
<li>The third, and possibly most likely suggestion, is that the Territory was considered at the time to be beset by lawlessness. Elliot was reported to have been struck by the "state of irritation ... almost of anarchy" in the Territory. Arresting a significant local figure like Hodge, putting him on trial and executing him would have been a decisive demonstration of authority in an attempt to restore better legal order.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>It is difficult to support or refute such arguments, but given the well documented wanton cruelty of Hodge, and the recognition of the shamefulness of the slave trade generally, none have ever suggested that Hodge was the victim of a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage_of_justice.html" title="Miscarriage of justice">miscarriage of justice</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Ramifications" id="Ramifications"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_William_Hodge_df87.html" title="Edit section: Ramifications">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ramifications</span></h2>
<p>The ramifications of the execution of Hodge are difficult to gauge. Some historians suggest that the "case stirred up feverish feelings in the islands, and even echoed to the outside world ... it was revolutionary for the times: this was an unprecedented trial, where a white man was proven guilty for the murder of a black man and sentenced to death."<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> Whilst the trial and execution would unquestionably have come as a shock to the slave owning communities in the British West Indies, it does not appear to have had any immediate effect wider than that of Hodge's own plantation. It has been remarked that there were probably many slave owners in the West Indies who were quite as excessive as Hodge,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> but there does not seem to have been a rush to put them on trial, or on their part to moderate their conduct. There appear to be no other records of any slave owners in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_West_Indies_f0ac.html" title="British West Indies">British West Indies</a> being tried for the murder of their slaves.</p>
<p>Within the British Virgin Islands themselves, outside of Hodge's estate, slaves were generally considered to have been treated relatively well, which is perhaps not surprising in light of how valuable they had come since the abolition of the African slave trade. Nonetheless, although the slave's lot continued to be an unhappy one until the general manumission in 1834, at least within the Territory a clear line was drawn in relation to the treatment of slaves.</p>
<p>The trial itself has something of an impact on the Territory's finances. The trial was reported to have cost the Territory nearly six hundred pounds sterling, and to have cost Hodge's estate nearly nine hundred pounds sterling, both extravagant sums for the time.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<li id="_note-5"><b><a href="#_ref-5" title="">^</a></b> Reports from the trial suggest that Hodge was a deeply sadistic and disturbed man. Margaret and Else died after boiling water had been poured down their throats. Jupiter was whipped to death, as was Tom Boiler and his brother, another slave named Simon Boiler, for whom Hodge was not tried. Moreover, reports of cruelty to his other slaves came out of the hearings, including abominable treatment of Bella, a small <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulatto.html" title="Mulatto">mulatto</a> girl of about 8 years of age, who was Hodge's own offspring with one of his slaves, Peggy. Testimony was also heard as to a number of other mulatto children (also assumed to be Hodge's offspring) were held under water until they lost consciousness, then revived, and the process repeated.</li>
