<p>Very few google hits relate directly to the subject (there are other things with the same name). And while the article (parroted straight from the group's website) refers to this as a center, it is hard to say that this is more than a subset of another group without independent existance. The sources cited on it on the article page are mere mentions of the subject, or a mention of affiliation. This has real problems with notability and verifiability. <a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 23:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Catalyst Project is an active organization that facilitates anti-racism trainings around the country. The fact that they are currently operating and have been for several years makes them worthy of an entry. I understand that not many results come up from a Google search, but my understanding is that Google ranking alone should not be the basis for a deletion. As for copyright violations, I do not believe they would sue because the description of their organization on Wikipedia is similar to the description on their own page. Is there anyone here from the US activist community with familiarity with anti-racist organizing?

So I created the disambig page, only to get whacked ("almost a request for information") for having the temerity to suggest that these might be one and the same person (being as it just so happens that the Dhanalakshmi's public career seems to have taken off after the disappearance of the BCCI guy; and that he seems to have been involved in at least one other vaguely scandal-prone bank, ICICI, in the intervening time.) Since I couldn't reference that assertion, I tried separating the two, now I'm getting whacked for making this distinction. Anyway, the BCCI guy page is now referenced, and I'm happy to leave the Dhanalakshmi guy as red ink; if these do turn out to be the same person, then this is probably referenced in the non-English press somewhere and sooner or later, someone will eventually make this clarification. Until then, it seems useful to have separate bio pages (with no unsourced comments relating the two), and a dismabig page.

<dd>I think the point here is that its not notable. Yes its correct but how is it noteable? Does the cosomolgy play a major role in the book? As per <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFACT_e22d.html" title="WP:FACT">WP:FACT</a> major characters/places should have articles, not minor ones. I find it hard to believe the structure of the cosmology has is of major important to the story of LotR but would be for other books of middle earth maybe.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 03:18, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Another point here is that the article is being improved all the time. I am extremely uncomfortable with the way this was nominated so soon after creation. Wikipedia articles should not have to be written fully formed, and some on-wiki development is both natural and helpful. I understand that articles have to pass a notability barrier, but that can't be fully evaluated until the article has stablised after the initial editing following its creation. The AfD could have waited a week. Wikipedia would not have imploded if the AfD had been delayed by one week. And to answer your question, yes, the cosmology is relevant to the overall strucutre of Tolkien's writings, which go far beyond just LotR. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This article is not a plot summary. It should end up being an article that describes, using reliable sources, what the author said the names meant, what language they are, and where they are mentioned in Tolkien's works. Its notability comes directly from the notability of the article <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, which it should be considered a subarticle of (the Middle-earth article is too long for this to go there).

Twenty-six seconds after the article was created? Then slapping a 'not many pages link here' tag on it? How many <i>newly created</i> pages DO have alot of links to them? Then calling 'original research' on something which had <i>thirty-six</i> references in the initial stub? All very strange. The 'What Wikipedia is not' claim is within the bounds of reasonable (deletionist) interpretation, but I don't agree... Wikipedia also is not PAPER. Meaning that it can be the equivalent of a 'Mammals encyclopedia', plus a 'Star Trek encyclopedia', plus a 'Pokemon encyclopedia', and yes... a 'Tolkien encyclopedia'. Indeed, it already IS all of those things... as evidenced by the numerous existing pages of Tolkien articles which this one linked <i>to</i>. The benefit of this article is in laying out the various terms and their relationship to real world equivalents where possible. I also wanted to explore the possibility of merging some of te shorter pages on individual items into this one. I'd only made ONE edit to the page so far... there's alot left to do, but I don't see how that stub was anything like a candidate for deletion. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 01:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I know what you mean. A lot of fiction stuff slides in. Only notable 'major' things are meant to get an article, yet if you look at LotR stuff and Harry potter even minor characters get pages and then these pages are argueed as if they are major characters even when they are blatently minor. Either way this article is more of a list and it would be much better to start with deletion of 'Ea' and 'the Void' articles since they fail WP:FICT as non major.

<li><b>Delete</b> per there's no chance in Hell there's been a scholarly study of "Middle-earth cosmology." And, yes, it is original research if it's all being sourced from the books themselves, because that's using primary sources to write the article. It ceases to be original research when we're citing what somebody else has written about middle-earth cosmology in a reliable source. Seriously, though, sourcing everything about Tolkein's works to Tolkein's works is somehow supposed to demonstrate notability? I rarely invoke the word cruft, but this is dangerously close to being such. GassyGuy 19:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>To quote the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> policy, "Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." In short, you are mis-using the term 'original research' in a way that would invalidate <b>everything</b> on Wikipedia. Every article is an 'original compilation' of referenced materials... but that is NOT original research, its the <b>correct</b> way to do things. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>As I am, thus far, the primary 'author' of the page I take exception to that accusation and would invite you to provide some <b>basis</b> for it.

<li>I think the problem might be the first six entries, which haven't been referenced yet. I would hope that Lee Vonce read further than those six entries, and saw that the rest is well-referenced. But I can understand why someone not familiar with the subject matter might think that the first six entries are speculation by fans, not assertions of the author. Sticking in references and selected quotes from the 'Ambarkanta' material might help. Currently <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambarkanta.html" title="Ambarkanta">Ambarkanta</a> redirects to the HoME volume it is in, but it would be good to have an Ambarkanta section in the Middle-earth cosmology article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

There aren't that many interpretational references out there because Tolkien emphatically states his work was not alegory.

<li><b>Declined speedy</b> as there's an assertion to permission here. That said, permission would still need to be sent to the foundation if this is kept.

<li><b>Questions (and answers) from the author about notability</b> The subject is free software. Well. I think that a voice about a free software product is always notable, due the nature of the subject! I can't find difference, for example, between WebErp and APbyAS or PMbyAS, or MFbyAS, unless the ranking in SourceForce or Freshmeat. The publication on Wikipedia is unavoidablement publicity and promotion. And then all product of this type have rights. This is my conviction (and the rest of the world of the free software). Try to ask to Free Software Foundation. &#160; &#160; <b>(italian)</b> &#160; Stiamo parlando di software libero. Ebbene, Secondo me una voce su un prodotto di software libero è sempre degna di nota, data la natura stessa dell'oggetto. Io non vedo differenze, ad esempio tra WebErp e APbyAS, o PMbyAS o MFbyAS, a parte il ranking di SourceForge o Freshmeat. La pubblicazione di una voce su Wikipedia è inevitabilmente pubblicità e promozione. E allora tutti i prodotti del tipo software libero ne hanno diritto.

<dd>I think that a couple of your questions above were directed at me, so I'll try to answer. We determine notability by out <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">notability guideline for software</a>. One of the things that can make something notable is being included in a major operating system distribution, because then presumably many people will be aware of it. And one piece of software having an article doesn't guarantee that a similar piece of software will have an article: we judge each article independently, on its own merits. If certain other software packages aren't notable under our guidelines, it's likely that they'll be nominated for deletion as well, in time. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 00:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry Soporific, but I disagree, not for you&#160;:-), but for the terms espressed in the guidelines. <b>First</b>: the distros contains personal, desktop, technical solutions and similar. Distros never include business, ERP, groupware, and similar for a number of "notable" reasons. <b>Second</b>: Debian Popular Context is not neutral, but sectarian. It is strong dipendent at the type of language and OS used (Linux obviously) and forget (or reject), for example, solution in MySql, Php, Apache. <b>Tird</b>: I come back to my first reason: Software is a thing, free software is another thing, very different, that have the right to a specific treatement. <b>.....</b> Escuse me, but I am a 65 years old man with over 40 years of experience in information thecnology and i am in the abit to tell what I think (unfortunately in italian, because for the english I need alwais my dictionary near to me). <b>Conclusion</b> For me the solution is an alternative: a) to include all of the free software of wich we have notice, whith the respect of other guidelines; b) to esclude all.

<li><b>Keep</b>. These seem like valid stubs to me. I'm not sure whether "notability" is the right criterion to judge mathematical abstractions by.

<dd>Well, mathematicians do actually write about mathematical abstractions, even if only a dozen specialists care about those abstractions--those dozen people might well write a dozen papers each on their favorite abstractions, making them pass the notability test.

<dd>Curiosity isn't sufficient reason to keep it. And certainly math terms should need to be notable--otherwise, I could make up my own math terms that only I use and add them. It's certainly a pretty common practice in math to make up a new term to describe whatever you're talking about, whenever there isn't one that describes it well. But we shouldn't have articles on those terms unless they're in common usage. Similarly, we shouldn't have articles on topics that nobody writes about. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 00:09, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I'm aware of polygon naming conventions. I thought it might just be useful to have a chart, but I suppose the one already at polygon does a fair enough job combined with the naming conventions.

<li><b>Delete all unless references provided to demonstrate notability</b> There are an infinite number of polygons, so obviously we can't write individual articles about every single one. More importantly, the articles provide no references showing that these specific polygons are notably mentioned in outside publications. All articles, including mathematical ones that are otherwise accurate, need to provide references to establish the information is not only correct but notable enough to be talked about. Now if these articles can find outside, verifiable mentions and uses or mathematical discussions about one of these specific polygons, then go ahead an do an article about it and include that information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:59, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Many of the articles on abstract polygons like this have already been deleted. While notability may be a difficult thing to prove in and of itself, this article is useful intellectually because of its place as one in a series (and I mean that as <i>seperately</i> from the polygon article). I came to the Hexagon page wanting to know if a three dimensional construct was possible only containing hexagons (a soccer ball has pentagons in it). Instead I got side-tracked by the polygons series box at the bottom of its page. After reading about Pentadecagon and the like I wondered how quickly polygons visually descend into simply appearing as circles. It only took two clicks on the Pentacontagon and Tricontagon articles to read the stubs and satisfy my curiosity. Given the articles already exist and noone is proposing to add hundreds of other intermediate shapes, I feel keeping short stubs on polygons at 30, 50 and 100 sides has value in and of itself. 193.129.65.37 07:05, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep or merge</b> The comment (way, way) above stating that there's nothing worth merging in this article is incorrect. The illustrations are helpful, for instance in showing when polygons become visually indistinct from circles (see comment by 193.129.65.37). That may mean these articles need merging into polygon but their pictures shouldn't be lost from Wikipedia. Perhaps someone versed in human psychology could come up with an "XXX-agon" article saying "for the majority of human beings this is the last shape visably distinguishable from a circle, in which case I'd vote to delete or merge these pieces into that. Until an XXX-agon article appears I think the current arrangement works just fine. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 07:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Both you and the IP user above you are arguing essentially that they are useful because they show you how quickly the polygons begin to look like circles? It doesn't seem like a thing that merits an article, to me. It might possibly be worth mentioning on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">Polygon</a> that many-sided polygons were used to approximate pi, due to their being nearly circular, with a link to <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">pi</a>.

<dd>I don't know what the IP user's arguing but he influenced me in my opinion vis-a-vis the illustrations have merit. To quote myself: "these articles need merging into polygon but their pictures shouldn't be lost from Wikipedia". If the consensus is that the articles should be delted, I'm happy with that but I don't think the illustrations should be lost. And the Polygon article (which is a bit "listy" at present) could do with more pictures. I still say <b>merge</b> the pictures, or failing that <b>keep</b> the article. I agree with you, certainly, that "many-sided polygons were used to approximate pi" should definitely be in the polygon article.

<li><b>redirect</b> the WP standards are useless in this case. Any geometric figure is notable, if there is something to say about it. But in his case there isn't much.

This will even be possible once Google finishes scanning all the books, but the sort of book that might have this will be nobody's priority. Apparently we have none in hand today, and next year we have two. So, it isn't notable now, but it would be then. Multiple nontrivial published works. There are many gradations in that, but the standards don't recognize them. Rules of thumb are approximations, and have to be treated as such. A statement that "someone would have written about it" is meaningless without an operational definition, and the available technology to see that is not available. We deal with that by saying the default is "not notable"--which makes the notability of something dependent on the amount of work devoted to the article.</li>

<dd>While I agree in principle that these need to go (I nominated them, after all), your reasoning isn't sound. If there really are books of which this is the subject (even just a single section specifically devoted to it in a few books would probably be enough) then we need to keep the article. Its notability isn't dependent on the books being easy to access. When I nominated them I did so in part due to lack of any online, easily-accessible sources that would prove notability, but mostly because my experience tells me that it's likely that no sources exist--electronically or in print--that could prove it to be notable. If I thought that there were print sources, I would have gone to the library and found them, rather than nominating the articles for deletion. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 00:26, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One does not expect books about topics like this. I do not think any of the sources for hexagon for is a book about hexagons. (and similarly for everything beyond there), in the sense that a book on trigonometry is a book about the properties of triangles. I could not agree more that the material will be difficult to find. Almost all detailed scientific &amp; mathematical subjects will be of this nature. What is usually looked for on WP seems to be a significant mention in a book--not just a list of terms, but a discussion giving information from which an article could be written.

<dd>I think you misunderstand me somewhat: I do not know of any book called "Hexagons: Their Story" or such, but I do know that hexagons are mentioned quite frequently in literature--in particular, crystalline structures take the form of regular polygons (in some way; I am no expert on crystallography), hexagons included. See <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexagonal_crystal_system.html" title="Hexagonal crystal system">Hexagonal crystal system</a>.

Mathematicians (and scientists in general) turn out a stunning amount of text in the course of a year. It's rarely difficult to find at least some mention of any topic, however noteworthy it may or may not be. Well, that's enough.

<p>This article represents the Shia point of view which sharply contradicts with the foundation of the faith of the mainstream (Sunni) Islam. Worldwide Sunni Muslims (comprising 90% of world Muslims) believe that this list is nothing but a fabrication by the Shia sect. This is not new; this has been going on for centuries. This online encyclopedia is NOT the proper place for those kinds of extremely controversial issues, especially when they represent points of views of a minor sect (Shia) of the global religion of Islam. Of course the Shia scholars will continue to claim that their views and deviant beliefs are supported by Sunni references and sources. However, all they have been doing over centuries is misinterpreting those references, taking them out of context and twisting them to support their views. They've had a historical enmity towards the 3 rightly-guided Caliphs of Islam which are revered by over 1.2 Billions Sunni Muslims and have been revered for the past 14 centuries, while Sunnis never carry any sort of enmity towards the sacred figures revered by the Shia such as Ali ibn Abi Talib or Fatimah. There is not one single Sunni Muslim or Sunni scholar that will accept the Shia interpretations of the references otherwise, if they do, then over a Billion Sunni Muslim will convert happily into Shia. Therefore, further attempts to quote the so called Sunni sources to support those Shia views should be discredited and not to be accepted a valid argument in any way. According to Sunni Islam, this list does not even exist. Ali, Fatimah and all those Sahaba enlisted in this list have given their full allegiance to Abu Bakr and to believe that they were at odds with him is totally absurd. Again WIKIPEDIA is NOT the proper place for those minority views. Thank you TrueWisdom1 02:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)TrueWisdom1</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> And the Roman Catholic view is that the Protestant Reformation is bogus, but we are not going to delete all articles about Martin Luther, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and other protestant religions and religious personages. The Jewish view is that the Christian scriptures and religious beliefs are bogus, yet we will probably be keeping them. Wikipedia is not the source for Truth, just for things notable enough that people write about them. Articles about a religion must be written in a non-point of view way, so they never say "The truth is.." but instead say "Followers of the religion believe that....". It would be completely appropriate to add to the article reliable and verifiable sources which claim that each and every one of the "Sahaba" gave "bay'ah" to "Abu Bakr" so as to make the article NPOV. This could be integrated throuout the article, or incorporated in a "Criticism" or "Alternative views" section if that works better stylistically. A big problem is that ancient religious doctrines and disputes are unlikely to have very many sources for such issues which are independent of the followers of the religion, and there are unlikely to be any surviving manuscripts of first hand accounts. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:51, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> The book which has been reviewed by <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo_%28magazine%29.html" title="Neo (magazine)">Neo (magazine)</a> and <a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6944.html" class="external text" title="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6944.html" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> on <a href="http://www.icv2.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.icv2.com/" rel="nofollow">ICv2</a>, one of the most respected Pop Culture news sites there is. It is more notable than a lot of other self published press if you ask me. I've not put keep, because I am not sure if I can keep a neutral head about this, being an online acquaintance with the authors (much more so Jay Navok than Sushil K. Rudranath, though I do run across him online too from time to time) and therefore I could well be biased. However I have to ask doesn't it being reviewed by print magazine which one can come by easily (in the UK, perhaps a little harder in the US but quiet achievable) say something for it's notability? --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracieLizzie_a424.html" title="User:GracieLizzie">GracieLizzie</a> 10:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Multiple independent reviews would make it notable. I don't know icv2 but it seems like it counts as one. I don't think the Neo review exists online and I havn't access to a print copy but I don't doubt it exists. My feeling is that only exceptional print-on-demand books should be kept - its far too easy to sell a few copies to yourself and buy some reviews (not saying thats what happened here!).

<dd><i>Question &amp; Comment</i> when you say publication, do you mean only in print stuff? Would website mentions like ICv2 count? What about the tour connected to the book? While it was a very small one-off tour it got mentioned on Anime News Network and the Japanese site AnimeAnime. To be honest I do respect this AfD and see where it is coming from but I don't think WoL is not notable. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracieLizzie_a424.html" title="User:GracieLizzie">GracieLizzie</a> 22:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Nardiman originally tagged this page as db-spam, apparently without actually reading it, then changed his mind after I spoke up, and now he proposes it for deletion.

<dd>Speedy deletion, yes. I agree, the speedy that the article had was out of line, and you did right with the hangon. The Deletion process *is* working correctly.</dd>
<dd>I'll break it down for you. IF your article is both notable (which it may or may not be) and verifiable (which means you would have added sources) then deletion nominations are a joke. Take <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starwood_Festival_bc88.html" title="Starwood Festival">Starwood Festival</a>. Horribly written spam sounding article. But it has plenty of sources, from places that have nothing to do with the festival directly. Books, newspapers, mainstream blogs, etc. You say that the Council of Magical arts is important , and the article claims that it's one of the larger pagan thingies (festivals, what have you) in the world. WHY CAN'T YOU PRODUCE A SINGLE INDEPENDANT SOURCE? You haven't got anything that even demonstrates a shred of notability.

<dd>Here's the thing... JChap says that published books that mention CMA in lists of festivals is not significant, but you have to realize that CMA has been holding these festivals twice a year for 27 years! Yes, CMA does not sponsor a chair at a university, or fund research into <i>why hamsters have no hair on their tongues</i> but what they do is what they do... 2 festivals a year and 4 journals.

<dd>The question is whether the posts are reliable (and Cuhulain did not write any of the posts cited in the article). The posts contain the personal experiences of attendees of the festivals and are not an attempt at doing any sort of reporting (and I don't think they were intended as such).

<p><b>reset indenting</b> A newspaper or magazine publishes information of interest to their readers, and which they believe will sell papers. A website of the longevity and quality of The Witches Voice publishes articles, essays and news items of interest to their readership, which they believe will generate traffic and fulfill their stated mission.

What I responed to, regarding Kerr Cuhulain, was your disparaging tone when you referred to witchvox as <i>a place where witches go and write posts about organizations they are involved with or events they attend</i>. I find it really amazing that a project that seeks to use the Internet as a tool to create this vast encyclopedic reference is so inherently dogmatic in its distrust of the medium it lives in. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillWSmithJr_9db3.html" title="User:BillWSmithJr">Bill W.

<dd>No one's being dogmatic or disparaging. slate.com is frequently cited here (to take one of many examples of online publications that are considered reliable sources). The reason that the three posts cited in the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Magickal_Arts_6ed4.html" title="Council of Magickal Arts">Council of Magickal Arts</a> article we are discussing do not qualify as reliable sources is that they were obviously written to convey a personal experience, rather than as part of a concious attempt to collect and report objectively on information, such as would be undertaken by a journalist, academic or professional author. There's nothing wrong with writing about one's personal experience, of course. Such writing does not fall within the definition of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, however. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 23:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you know how many new articles that , on first glance, "look okay" are spam? How many are created and never touched again? Thousands. Literally thousands. If I come back to the average article in a month's time, it's still going to be crap. Example that you can relate to: Free Spirit Gathering. Not a source in sight, and it's been here since April. It is NOT biting or violating AGF to ask that you follow the policies. Was it speedy tagged too quick, maybe. But your article reads like vanity spam. I'm sorry, but it does, and that's what I suspect got such a rapid response. I'm not going to nom Free Spirit Gathering for deletion, but there are plenty of articles like that "under the radar", and saying "Well, you can't kill spammy looking unsourced articles" isn't right. When I make a new article, even a stub, I always include at least two sources. And if I can't THEN I DON'T MAKE THE ARTICLE. Try it. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 05:32, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> I thank Butseriouslyfolks for the correction. I located the source for the article and inserted it; it is an online version of two standard reliable sources considered as reliable as the DND. The portion online indicated additional children but did not include the name, so I added the second son on the authority of the reference here. I have also added context--go check the article again. She was closely related to the English Royal family. There is an interlocking series of these articles for the Royal family and its close relatives, of which this article is a link. There is no reason for the chain to be disrupted. It can be said that the chain needs to be looked at again and many articles done more carefully, but that is true of many of the articles in WP. if not all of them. I I have just notified the previous 3 editors on the page of the AfD, using the standard templates, which do not indicate any suggestion of how to vote. <s>(The nominator really should have done this, but failed to.

<li>these works are the standard sources--all historians use them, except for really specialized work. further can be added, but this gets into specialized literature and unpublished material very fast.

<li>I think that's ok. For better or worse, history has essentially ignored the deeds of the women of that era, rendering most of them non-notable.

<dd>I cannot agree with the implied suggestion that any great-grandchild of any king should be included solely because of her relation to the royal family, without any requirement that the subject be notable in the subject's own right. Wikipedia is not a directory of members of the extended royal family. Giving her husband a royal connection may be the most significant act history has preserved from her life. Her husband's article would also be the logical place to refer to the couple's children.

<dd><b>Right</b> in this case the dynastic relationships are critical in English history of the period--and they are furthermore the basis of Shakespeare's history plays. It is not easy to clarify the relationships without discussing the women as well; especially in connection with their dowries of landed property and their second or third marriages, the heiresses all throughout the middle ages &amp; early modern period were central to the formation of major family fortunes.

<li>Actually, if you read the St. Louis Dispatch review of <i>Passing,</i>--linked at Jane Dark--there is not only a book with a chapter about Dark/Clover pen name phenomenon, but the review calls it the most interesting chapter. But I think I'm still in favor of the merge (frankly, I don't understand the difference--does merge mean Jane Dark article will be there with a redirect to Clover, or will all the Jane Dark content be in the Joshua clover article?--like I said, I don't "get" AfD, sorry if that is stupid question, and for coming back to add my comments if they don't make sense.) Clover noted in <i>Passing</i> that when he was "outed" as Jane Dark, he lost the sense of her as a separate/independent voice...but still used the pen name. So, there is a way in which "Jane" was a separate voice/different writer from Joshua-the-poet, and that <i>has</i> been noted in a book. But I wouldn't say that is really the case now--the voices are merged at the current Sugarhigh! at least, so it makes sense that the articles could be merged. Unless the idea of Jane-as-separate- voice is deemed to have historical value. Because there are so many Village Voice articles by Joshua (more than 200) and only a slim minority of those are noted at his article--on "serious" subjects--and there are also a sizable chunk of VV articles by Jane--on "pop" subjects-- that could make the Clover article messy if merge means all the articles are in one place.

<li>Maybe to add clarity: Jane's published articles are only about popular culture (whereas Clover's are both pop and serious). And for a few years, no one knew that Clover was Dark. That would be the argument for Jane as separate? Now, it is not a secret that Dark is a pen name of Clover--there has been a book about it, and the Academy of American Poets notes that Dark is a pen name of Clover. Sugarhigh! was a column written by Jane Dark for the Village Voice, but is now the name of Clover's blog (which he writes un-secretly as Jane Dark, and about subjects both pop and serious.)

<li><b>Merge and redirect.</b> There are evidently only a few paragraphs' worth of information to be written about Jane Dark in the forseeable future. There is no reason not to merge them. Any details of the relationship between the two personas can be explained in the Clover article, and are more easily explained together in the same article than by asking readers to fllip back and forth. We don't have separate articles on <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Carlos_2bab.html" title="Walter Carlos">Walter Carlos</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Carlos_7363.html" title="Wendy Carlos">Wendy Carlos</a>, on <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currer_Bell_a2e9.html" title="Currer Bell">Currer Bell</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Bronte_2ca9.html" title="Charlotte Bronte">Charlotte Bronte</a>, on <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_French_05bf.html" title="Paul French">Paul French</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, etc. Under the naming convention articles go under the most common name; if "Jane Dark" were far more famous than "Joshua Clover" then the merge would go the other way. The case of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Bachman_2ecc.html" title="Richard Bachman">Richard Bachman</a> is the exception, not the rule; I'm not sure it's justified, but if it is it would be on the basis of Bachman being so well known and the Stephen King article being so long, neither of which apply here. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:16, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It also provides a compelling example of why this kind of split is a bad idea in the long run. The two articles differ on as fundamental a detail as why the pseudonym was used at all. According to the King article, it was to produce more books without appearing to flood the market under a single name. According the the Bachman article, it was primarily an effort to duplicate his success and ensure that his readership was not simply a fluke. In my mind, the King article (at 38k) is not so bloated that a merge of the salient points from Bachman would hurt; some of the accessory details that are book-specific should probably be merged to those articles instead. Regardless, while that'll need to be discussed on the respective talk pages, I think it makes the point clearly for the discussion at hand. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 15:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect because once the silly list of links to a dozen individual columns is tripped out we have one short paragraph, clearly well short of the amount of data which would justify a fork even if the main article were as large as Stephen King's (which it ain't).

This is just one of my <i>personal</i> criteria for notability. I don't know yet how it will turn out. I personally regard someone as a "real" author if they have a book with an Amazon sales rank of 200,000 or better.

I was hoping I could instantly say he's notable on the basis of authorship, but, by my criterion, not quite. These are "real" books, though; I own one of the books in the BFI series (not his).

<li>Jandek's actually a good case of when a pseudonym perhaps should be the article title. Although there's somewhat reasonable agreement that Jandek is Smith, there have obviously been other contributors to some Jandek pieces, and the entire career has been a marked attempt to avoid identification or recognition under the artist's real name, with no official confirmation of his identity ever provided. Those attributes distinguish Jandek from this case, where there is no question as to the author's identity (and confirmation by the author himself), and where notability and public recognition have been established under the real name as well. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Comment: Yeah, but the majority of those employees are behind the scenes people. Of course they shouldn't be notable. But he's a regular on-air performer on the OVW show. There's a difference there.MikeH411 20:24, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just because he is in OVW, doesn't make him that notable. As said before: many people have been employed by OVW over the years... all aren't notable. I think people just need to wait more (to see if the person becomes notable or not) before creating articles on all these OVW wrestlers. Yes, many do make it to WWE... but many don't, and end up fired. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:01, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not notable. Just being in OVW is not notable. People can pay to enter and get trained.

<li><b>Comment</b> There's such a huge difference between paying "to enter and get trained" and receiving a a developmental contract from the largest wrestling promotion in the world that I'm surprised you'd even use that as a claim against notablity. They don't give those out to every Tom, Dick, And Harry on the indy wrestling scene. Also, paying "to enter and get trained" doesn't get you put on the OVW roster, nor does working a one off show for the promotion, for that matter. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVladamireSteelwolf_c290.html" title="User:VladamireSteelwolf">Vladamire Steelwolf</a> 13:54, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Um <i>Forward</i> is a venerable and famous Jewish newspaper, probably the most famous Jewish publication in the USA. I'm not sure if it's descended from or related to the old <i>Vorwarts</i>, which was a famous Jewish paper published in Yiddish (and which published the works of Isaac Bashevis Singer and great deal of assorted rabble-rousing back in the day. Anyway, if the <i>Forward</i> really does think he's one of the 50 most influential Jews in the USA, that's plenty notable enough for me. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:22, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Minor Filippino actress of the 50's (although that would be hard to figure out from the current sub-stub). Her career, as far as IMdB knows <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2175905/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2175905/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, consists of six films and only one where she has the lead role.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - bad writing (or machine translation?) is not grounds for deletion. However, the article needs serious help. I'm not sure how notable even a lead actress in a 1950s Philippine movie really is - how many movies were made in the Philippines then, and how many people watched them? - but I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt on this one. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 20:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, my worry is that we have absolutely no indication whatsoever about the notability of these 6 films themselves. IMDb now includes pretty much anyone that was ever released anywhere.

As far as anyone can tell, this is a very minor actress from the 50's who had one lead role in a film whose importance is not established. That's pretty much all we can say and it seems that this is just a directory entry.

While you are at it, you may need to remove about 50% of all Computer/Software/Technology articles, as most of them are mainly defined by their websites or their own PR generated releases. Frankly, I think many of the definitions for "what is notable" need to be re-written for many specific niche areas, and technology is one of them.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't understand why when people put up articles explaining what something is that is manufactured by some company, it seems like there is immediately this committee that jumps up and yells "Too Commercial! Abuse of Wikipedia!" I say if this serves to explain this device and this can be linked in another article, then it should stay. I am often annoyed when I'm surfing Wikipedia and reading about an organization or company and they mention some product and I'm like "What the heck is that?" and then I see a dead link on Wiki and nothing on Google because the company got rid of the product page ages ago. I'm not suggesting Wikipedia become an archive of abandoned product, I'm just saying sometimes its nice to have a little additional explanation. Let's not forget the concept of Eventualism, that perhaps at some point this article <i>could</i> become more fleshed out and valid.--<a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkcana_127a.html" title="User:Arkcana">Arkcana</a> 02:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as nonsense. How is it a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greedy_algorithm.html" title="Greedy algorithm">greedy algorithm</a> if it just ends up listing all possible paths? The order that you list them in does not affect the efficiency at all.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's not nonsense: one can list all non-repeating paths via a simple backtracking process. And less-blind path listing algorithms (e.g. that list paths in order by length) can be useful in circumstances when one wants to optimize something more complicated than a simple sum of edge lengths. However I don't see the point in describing bad algorithms and I get zero hits for Ndoiska or Ndoiskas in both Google and Google Scholar so the name appears to be either a neologism or an unintelligible misspelling. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 23:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not aware of a rule against putting a song in Wikipedia. My only concern is that it be a really good, notable and famous song, such as <a href="../../../w/e/_/We_didn%27t_start_the_fire.html" title="We didn't start the fire">We didn't start the fire</a>, and this isn't that.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It is a released single by a well-established and popular band among the teenage set. It is also the title track to the CD. Looking over a number of bands, many singles do have entries, even though most are short. On balance, it should be kept.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 09:55, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>No one seems to agree on what exactly should be done with what was originally <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_FieldTurf_installations_a3eb.html" title="List of FieldTurf installations">List of FieldTurf installations</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_FieldTurf_installations_%282nd_nomination%29_8ec1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of FieldTurf installations (2nd nomination)">This AfD</a> in December reached the consensus to categorize.

We ultimately ended up with two conflicting opinions from the discussions, and two articles listing FieldTurf installations (one which mimics the appearance of a category, created after the consensus on CfD; <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_FieldTurf_installations_a3eb.html" title="List of FieldTurf installations">the other</a> which was the original, un-redirected after the CfD).

<li><b>Keep Both</b> Okay here is my thoughts. First I run the <a href="http://www.mihsfbstadium.com" class="external text" title="http://www.mihsfbstadium.com" rel="nofollow">Michigan High School Stadium Site</a> as such I have a lot of original research available. Next I have links to a lot of the turf companies in the country. I do have an opinion that not all turf is the same, each company makes slightly diffrent turf. Some wear faster than others along with the way they are placed and what they use. My thought process is that we could provide a page for each 20+ turf companies that lists all of thier installations. Next we provide a link from the list of stadiums by turf to the individual company turf installation pages. The listing on the list of stadiums by turf should only be colleges and professional stadiums. Right now I would sign up to do this project but I am trying to finish out the Michigan Freeways and Highways. Once that is fleshed out I can then concentrate on this if everybody here is willing to end this debate. --<a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihsfbstadium_80f5.html" title="User:Mihsfbstadium">Mihsfbstadium</a> 14:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete both</b>. If this material is really encyclopedic, as some have tried to point out, the material can be merged into the parent article for the material. If kept, are we also saying it is OK to have lists of stadiums by type of real grass? Or lists of stadiums by clay type? How about lists of stadiums by rodeo dirt composition? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 00:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>uhm your recent post here does not seem you understand what is going on. First the majority of stadiums use either Grass or Artifical turf unless its tennis and that is not what we are talking about. Second it seems to me you want to ridicule the lists that a lot of fellow wiki members put a ton of effort into. --<a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihsfbstadium_80f5.html" title="User:Mihsfbstadium">Mihsfbstadium</a> 00:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently non-notable, only sources are his own corporate websites, YouTube or myspace, and half of the links are dead. No google hits for "Johnny 'johnnyD' Nguyen" and googling for simply "Johnny Nguyen" leads to many people and myspace profiles.

<p>You obviously have something against the guy just because he has accomplished so much more than you in your pitiful lifespan. All of the sources can be verified. Look at the Kelly Hu and Grace Park videos on the credits--they've just been uploaded. He is listed as producer in the end credits. Also, as for Fast and Furious 3, he is a tea hair in the movie. Look at the screenshot I posted. He's right there next to one of the leads. How dare you say otherwise. IMDB is going to update the page soon, because info was recently submitted for Johnny to be in the listing, credited or uncredited.</p>
<p><br />
His OWN corporate websites? Are you smoking crack? There is only one corporate website we made and it's a myspace. All the others were created by third party people we're associated with... Parc Landon, Thirteen Minutes, Rival Entertainment... contact them all. I dare you. By all means, I invite you to ask and verify Johnny's authenticity. Half the links are dead? Name which ones and I'll fix it. Oh, you can't? Probably because you're lying then. And ask all those people on myspace profiles if they know Johnny and they'll tell you he's a genuine guy that they love to work with.</p>
<p>Don't be jealous--you're just a hater. All his affiliations can be verified by simply calling the places and seeing if he works there. He works very hard for what he has attained, including teaching children sing in a choir, for church services every sunday. So know your info before you start speaking blasphemy. In fact, if you keep at it, I'll make sure of it that our lawyers hear of this slander and defamation of character.

<li><i><s>Comment</s>Autobiography and self-promotion are not the routes to having an encyclopaedia article. The published works must be someone else writing about the person. (See Wikipedia:Autobiography for the verifiability and neutrality problems that affect material where the subject of the article itself is the source of the material.) The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself have actually considered the subject notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it.</i></li>

<p>It is notable. He did not write this himself--it is not self promotion. I am writing about him, because his achievements are note-worthy. Jujube, you're just another hater. Pathetic rebuttal? DO YOUR RESEARCH. Make some calls around, instead of sitting at your computer all day, doing nothing but insulting other people. Make calls to Universal--ask if Johnny was in the cast of Fast and the Furious 3.</p>
<p>Ouro, insufficently sourced? I linked everything. Your claim is just a inefficiently backed up statement. It's fallacy at its best. Make a phone call or two and see if I'm lying. Call Rival Entertainment and ask if Johnny works there. Call Parc Landon. Call Thirteen Minutes magazine. If you people can't do that, how can you people call yourself researchers on Wikipedia? It's just disheartening when you the world is reduced to people who can't even do research outside of the "INTERNET" to finagle their sources. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.136.82.207 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.136.82.207.html" title="User talk:24.136.82.207">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.136.82.207_a944.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.136.82.207">contribs</a>) 13:38, 22 January 2007.</small></p>

<dd>24.136.82.207 - Firstly, you should sign your comments by typing "~~~~" (without the quotes) at the end. Second - you're only looking at one part of the policy - in full, the statement is that:</dd>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries <b>except</b> for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media reprints of the person's autobiography or self-promotional works.</li>

<dd>The dispute is not whether the subject of the article actually exists, or has actually held the positions and done the things claimed. Even if the article content is entirely true, the subject still appears to fail the main criterion of notability - namely <b>multiple, <i>non-trivial</i></b>, <b>independent</b> published works. Most of the published works I found were of the "reprint" or "trivial coverage" variety (as noted in the above criteria).

<dd>To the first poster: Remember that importance and notability are not the same things. People can be very important, to a few or to many people, without having notability or enough verifiable sources to be encyclopedic material.

In order for information to be verifiable per the guideline <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> the information must be accessible.

<li><b>Delete</b> The filmography has large movies - and no evidence he was in any of them. Checking the biggest three movies on the list, he does not show up in the IMDB listings for Dodgeball, the Hot Chick or Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. In fact, for someone apparently with so many appearances, he has no page at all on IMDB. Google does not reveal any evidence that he was in these movies. Frankly, I believe that entire section is a hoax designed to invent notability for an article that is designed to promote a nn individual. This is spam masquerading as an article.

Tony Fox, I've taken down his filmography section because that seemed to be of major dispute. But as you can see, he was in the Fast and the Furious 3. I even posted a screenshot from the film with him and the film's leading star. What else more do you want? But anyways, I took the filmography down so no more disputes can arise from all this.</p>
<p>Wintermut3, sorry about all the choice words--it's just that I spent a long time writing that article on Johnny and everything was true, so when you got on my case, I went off. As for the dead link, click on them again, and as you can see to the right, if you click Kelly Hu and Grace Park, that will lead to their interviews. As well, Johnny's name is listed in the end credits as PRODUCER.</p>
<p>Ohconfucious, that is a different Johnny Nguyen. He's primarily an actor that one of my friends has worked with. This is JohnnyD that we're referring to. 24.136.82.207 21:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>True, it doesn't give full out character descriptions right there, but it does have links to many of them. From there the article states the important events in the series from a realistic standpoint, rather than just experiencing them in a game. It's not a plot summery. True it does include many aspects of one, but they usually include bits of character descriptions, even if this is as simple as '-this made John irate, causing him to-". This article is a great reference, for both players and non-players to see what actually happens in the game instead of writing it off as just 'drive around and kill people'. I don't want to make a huge thing out of this. True it's not the traditional article, but it is encyclopedic and helpful. It's been around awhile and I know people have turned to it, and done a lot of work on it. I think it should stay. <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 20:37, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just because a lot of work has been put into it doesn't mean it automatically belongs on Wikipedia. What you said is exactly what I pointed out: Wikipedia is not the place to store information according to what's useful to you. As it stands, the timeline is a list of trivial information that would not interest readers outside of the series, and is more appropriate on any of the sites already mentioned in this debate. Timelines are not exactly popular on Wikipedia, and some might argue that they're not encyclopedic.

<li>And you're putting words in my mouth because I never mentioned anything about this information being useful to me, therefore it belongs.

<p>This list is so broad as to be completely unworkable and unmaintainable. If we're just looking for a list of musicians with wikipedia articles, categories are better for that. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdavidw_0345.html" title="User:Adavidw">adavidw</a> 09:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Unless you want to delete all 117+ lists, you don't have enough of a reason why this one should be singled out.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 10:36, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For what it's worth, if it came down to it, I <i>would</i> want to delete all 117+ of those lists, though I don't have any current plans to do so. This is just the one that stood out to me most because of the kinds of articles that are getting added to it, which points out another problem with most lists.</li>
<li>It seems that if you have a list of <i>foo</i>, it attracts editors whose sole purpose is to get their favorite <i>foo</i> on the list. Editors must think a list is a symbol of importance or something, so a list just sits there and attracts non-notable articles, or encourages articles to be created on non-notable subjects just so they could be put on the list. Or, worse, they just put a name on the list of someone who doesn't even have a Wikipedia article. If they're not notable enough for Wikipedia, why should they be on a list of <i>foo</i>? Unless, of course, the scope of the list is "all notable and non-notable <i>foo</i> that ever existed or ever had any association with <i>foo</i> ever", in which case you get the problem that it's inherently impossible to make an accurate list with the scope that broad. Then, the editors that come to add their favorite person go away, and nobody sticks around to maintain the list, remove the bad references, check new addtions to see if they should actually be added, or reorder when appropriate. If there was any argument that a list of things is usable (which I'm not conviced there is), that argument fails when stuck up against the natural state of lists like these, full of chaotic formatting, and scores of items that never should have been added.</li>
<li>I'm convinced that the only people who ever even see lists like this one are the editors adding their favorite items to it, and not anyone that's using it for any form of reference or research. I understand the argument that a list can do things that a category can't by adding useful information about the list entries. However, that only works if people can find the useful information among the rest of the crappy entries, and if someone sticks around to make sure the list stays in a useful state. The natural state of lists works against that.</li>
<li>Take this list for example: To be useful, we'd have to settle on a question of scope. Is it "all new age musicians ever"? That's too broad and we couldn't hope to be accurate. Is it "all new age musicians who are notable enough to have an article on Wikipedia"? If so, we can more accurately present that information as a category. Is it "some representative notable new age musicians, enough to give someone unfamiliar with the genre an idea of who's doing this work"? That's a workable scope, and if there was an existing list like that, I could understand the argument that this list should be kept. To be workable, though, you'd have to keep the number of list entries down to maybe 20 or so, and if you do that, you're essentially making a value judgement about who's important enough to be on the list. That'll then bring out the editors who want to make sure their favorite Venezuelan synth player's on the list since it's obvious to them that the list is a list of "the best new age musicians evar". So you've got to make sure there are good editors keeping the list focused, or it quickly devolves into something like the current state again.</li>
<li>Now, having said all that, I'd love it if someone could tell me a real-world example of how this specific list was actually useful to them or how their Wikipedia experience was enhanced by this list, rather than theoretical pie in the sky examples of how useful lists could be in a perfect world. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdavidw_0345.html" title="User:Adavidw">adavidw</a> 19:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Editor of the house newspaper of the Seventh Day Adventists. Some house newspapers are notable (the Watchtower, for example) but this does not seem to be. A couple of publications, but by his own press so not indepenent. No secondary sources. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:49, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Seventh-day Adventists have hundreds of periodicals and I can see a case why many of the lesser known and regional periodicals would not be significant, but this is the main periodical for a religious group that has a membership of over 15 million with an estimate 25 million worshippers every week. This periodical is just as significant as the "Watchtower" and is pivotal to understanding what Adventism is all about. Kenneth H. Wood was also editor of this publication during a particularly tumultuous time in Adventist history. What is on the page is pretty much common knowledge to any Seventh-day Adventist, but it certainly needs to be expanded. I have put a lot of work lately trying to get Adventist information on Wikipedia and we need to continue expanding it, adding sources, etc. Kenneth H. Wood has also written over 30 books and written hundreds of articles, interfaced with leaders of other religious faiths, and is therefore a key Adventist representative and deserves to be kept on Wikipedia so that it can be expanded, sources added, etc. I noticed that the user Guy has listed a number of my articles for deltion, this one is very important. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewalkingstick_cb57.html" title="User:Thewalkingstick">Thewalkingstick</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThewalkingstick_109c.html" title="User talk:Thewalkingstick">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thewalkingstick_a591.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thewalkingstick">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. Disagree with deletion rationale. The legacy of Love and Rage continues to this day in the North American anarchist community (which is admittedly small but notable given their large participation and leadership in nearly every significant activist cause in the US). The various splinter groups formed <a href="../../../n/e/f/NEFAC_ff15.html" title="NEFAC">NEFAC</a> (and also went to revitalize the <a href="../../../i/w/w/IWW_6770.html" title="IWW">IWW</a>) and the other side went on (among other things) to form the Phoenix Anarchist Coalition (part of the Southwest Anarchist Convergence).

<li><b>Keep</b> Anarchist activism and organizations are, by nature and intent, less documented by mainstream sources. Love &amp; Rage was small compared to the community, but clearly one of the most important legacies of the late-80s, early-90s. If the anarchist movement is notable enough for WP as it would seem obviously to be, then one of the major developments within the movement over a decade is worth keeping. Come on now. Go delete some Pokemon characters. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Gillis_c510.html" title="User:William Gillis">William Gillis</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliam_Gillis_d21d.html" title="User talk:William Gillis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_William_Gillis_2694.html" title="Special:Contributions/William Gillis">contribs</a>) 04:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Another reason to leave the article intact until further improvements can be made is that there are fourteen articles that link to this one (more, if you include user pages). Also, the suggested merge of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Anarchist_Bowling_League_0961.html" title="Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League">Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League</a> into this article would provide more context, and consolidating the references list would solidify the notability a bit more. As far as I can tell, all of the information in the article is accounted for in the citations, so besides merging the articles, all that would need to be done is to link up the relevant claims to their sources. Pretty straightforward, but a bit time consuming. If I get a chance, I'll haul my ass on down to the library and find some prettier sources. In the meantime, there's no reason to delete a useful, widely-cited article just because it needs some tidying up. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 15:15, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What is the basis for the large stigmatizing tag on the top of the page? No one has even provided notice to legitimately interested editors. No one claimed this was an election. If you have a reason for place it there please explain. Any claim of "single purpose accounts" is also baseless. Every participant of this discussion, on both sides, has hundreds of edits on dozen (or more) topics. No account is new. No one is an annon IP. The tag only serves to chill speech.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I added it, as I have seen done in similar cases. And yes, if you look at the discussion upthread, there seemed to be some thought it was an election, and a little canvassing has been done, in this or related articles. But anyway, I think you all are treating this too confrontationally. I have no vested interest in the outcome of this debate. I saw articles that seemed to my eyes to meet the standard, and I acted to bring the community in on it. I trust everyone participating is similarly disinterested.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 00:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's not so much that I have a problem with this particular article being nominated for AfD... Other articles I've contributed to have gotten deleted without a peep from me, because I feel there were proper attempts to suggest improvements on the article before it was deleted. As I pointed out above, there are steps one is expected to take before nominating an AfD. But I'm an inclusionist, so that's my bias. Oh, and the accusation of canvassing is a bit of a stretch. If you'll read WP:Canvassing, you'll see that Edivorce's actions passed all three tests: it was a <i>limited</i> cross-posting, the message was <i>neutral</i>, and it was <i>bipartisan</i>. With the exception of my admitted confusion about the five-day rule, I'd say those who argue for keeping have been pretty much by-the-book. I certainly have tried to back up my arguments with the proper WikiPolicies. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 01:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wehwalt, I don't question your good faith. Didn't mean to bruise. I just want to give pause before the work of other editors is destroyed. I think this is a serious step to take. The article isn't trivial and deserves full and complete fair process.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 02:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is getting it. And then some, due to the delay in resolving AfD discussions. But please, Aelffin, do not say that I didn't follow the procedure, when the only external sign of whether I followed a procedure is whether I chose to place a prod on the article. As it happens, I did touch second base before nominating. Since my thought was, and is, that this is not a notable organization, improving the article would not help. It remains a small, defunct group, and though you have said that it has had influences on other groups, this is not clear. The sources relied upon have real problems with WP:RS. At this time, I don't know if there is more to say, let's let the administrators do their work.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 02:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wehwalt, I am certain that you are acting in good faith, but when the only indication of your attempt to improve the article is slapping it with a deletion nomination, I feel that you are walking the line between not following procedure and merely being very heavy-handed. You asserted and continue to assert that the the sources are problematic without making a case as to why they are problematic. Please don't think I am singling you out. I think it's a common problem among editors, and I have argued this point elsewhere on articles I had nothing to do with. It just seems trigger-happy. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 03:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This makes no sense. The line you cite was meant to deal with things like, say, a local scout group that was part of a broader movement. It was not meant to encompass things like this - one notable political group competing for election to a notable national body. It may be gone now, but it's interesting for historical reference. Quite simply, how is this in any way a chapter of the National Union of Students? This makes no sense. But whatever.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to see this relisted for further discussion. Basicly, this AfD got little attention until an editor contacted all editors who ever edited this article and notified them of the AfD nomination. While that is not an illegitimate technique, I am not quite sure that is how AfD is supposed to run. I suggest relisting to allow for a further consensus from the WP community.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 11:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There is nothing improper about notifying editors who's work, and history, is threatened to be destroyed by deletion. Many seeking Deletion improperly complain about <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVASS_3bfe.html" title="WP:CANVASS">WP:CANVASS</a> being violated. This is wrong. What is at stake here is notice and opportunity to be heard for editors, <i>who are volunteers of a non-profit</i> having their work tossed out. I did not invite stranger to the article to meddle. I did not invite my "peeps." I invited all participants in editing the article. In fact, because by placing the AfD tag you technically "contributed" to the article, I invited you too. Without notice and an opportunity to be heard for interested parties any discussion process is hopelessly flawed. You are not entitled to a "do-over" because you don't like the results.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 13:25, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to add that listing the article as an AfD wasn't proper in the first place, because as far as I can tell, no attempt was made to take any of the steps listed in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> section <i>Before nominating an AfD</i>, and none of the criteria listed on <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> were cited as grounds for deletion.

<li>Under <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">Deletion Guidlines for Administrators</a> the correct action if any doubt exists is to not delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> That big tag at the top of the page should certainly make editors feel welcome. It seems to me to be intended to chill speech.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. The arguments to keep are very poor in comparison with those for deletion. Nobody has succesfully refuted the chief reason for deletion - that the list is subjective and there is no accepted single definition of what to be 'tall' means. Note I have discounted (and noted) a few arguments lower dowen the AFD, as they are based on no arguments applicable to Wikipedia policy or guideline. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just know this is going to end in tears, but... The definition of "tall" is completely arbitrary (where is the reliable secondary source for <s>6'3"</s> <s>6'4"</s> 6'5" as being "tall"? - seems to me we just plucked a figure out of the air; originally it was 6'3", then 6'4", then 6'5", then a bit of an edit war). Add to that the fact that the list is completly overwhelmed by basketball players, unsurprisingly, and you have an essentially useless list. You can't find the people who are genuinely notable as having been unsually tall. Tall-for-today is different from tall-for-the-12th-Century; <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_I_of_England_530d.html" title="Edward I of England">Edward I of England</a> (Edward Longshanks, no less) was renowned for his height, but these days 6'2" would be unremarkable. It's also crammed full of external links (great for SEO spammers, not so useful for us). Would support retention as a list of people considered unusually tall for their time and/or context, with reliable sources for that, but a 6'5" basketball player is pretty unremarkable, whereas a 6'5" actor is unusual. I could go on but you get the idea: this is essentially a combination of a list of pretty muah <i>all</i> basketball players, a list of men over an arbitrarily selected height (based more on trying to get the numbers down than any realistic external definition), and a very few entries who are genuinely notable for exceptional height, such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Wadlow_1478.html" title="Robert Wadlow">Robert Wadlow</a>. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Addendum, with apologies: a valid point is made below which I failed to take account of. Whatever value we were to come up with as an <i>n</i>th percentile of population height, the values proposed thus far are or appear to be specific to the United States. Here is a list of average heights by country:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Australia: 5' 10", 178cm</dd>
<dd>Brazil: 5' 6.9", 170cm</dd>
<dd>China: 5' 6", 168cm</dd>
<dd>France: 5' 7.7", 171.9cm</dd>
<dd>Germany: 5' 8.2", 173cm</dd>
<dd>Holland: 6' 1", 185cm</dd>
<dd>Italy: 5' 8.0", 172.8cm</dd>
<dd>Japan: 5' 6", 168cm</dd>
<dd>Sri Lanka: 5' 4.5", 163.9cm</dd>
<dd>Sweden: 5' 8.5", 174cm</dd>
<dd>United Kingdom: 5' 10", 178cm</dd>
<dd>United States: 5' 10", 178cm</dd>
<dd>Vietnam: 5' 3", 160cm</dd>
</dl>
<p>So: a 6ft Japanese is unusually tall, a 6ft American is completely unremarkable. 6'5" is quite normal for a Dutchman, noticably above average for a Briton (and even there, the average height varies between London and Liverpool or Yorkshire). An average height Dutchman would be a giant in Vietnam. Any list based on any absolute value of height is irredeemably flawed. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yet this list of tall men in on the English wiki, and the people noted on it are almost all from the English speaking world, primarilt the USA and the UK.

<dd>If we could find the 99th percentile of height for the nation with the tallest average height, than limit the list to that, I think we'd be limiting to men who are tall by any standard.

<dd>Actually I think the only way it can be fixed is by making it a list of men who have been reliably identified by multiple sources as being exceptionally tall for their occupation, time or country, and where their height forms a significant part of their claim to fame. So we might have the <i>tallest</i> basketball player, Robert Wadlow, Edward I, maybe Andersen. Then all we have to do is show that the selection criteria (men, and being identified as tall) are not arbitrary.

<p><b>Note</b> If you average all those average heights around the world as above average hieght is about 5ft 9. Now I don't know what world everyone is in if you are solid 6 ft 4 inch man walking down a street anyway in the world you will be notably above average. I noticed that in medical books and everything height-weight chart goes up to 6ft 4. However trivial the lists are (beleive me there are more trivial lists on wikipedia( but again a matter of opinion) they do provide statistics. SOurced and everything they look fine as it was before but only limit basketball players to the very fmaous. If you are not interested in the page then just don't visit it -wikipedia caters for thousands of different interests. If you want to be stricter why not change it to List of men over 2 metres? 6f6.5 starting point? <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 17:53, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your passion swayed me, as did the fact I had doubts about further restriction from the get go, so I put back those 6 ft 5 to 6 ft 7. The 6 ft 4 people had been removed awhile back as the list was getting too long. The stricter basketball section is getting some complaints though, if not by you perhaps, and I'd considered lowering it to 7 ft and over. The problem is I could find no justification for that. The 221 cm figure was at least based on a site about tallest basketball players. I'd also considered dumping it as an independent section, but I'm not feeling up to that as it'd be a good deal of work. I really shouldn't be here considering I only slept four hours and feel ill.

<li>Twice, actually - the other time was in 2005. And one was a bundled nomination, so it has only really been properly considered once in 2006, back in September. And I don't think you adressed the substantive point either: where is the reliable secondary source for 6'5" being considered tall; what do we do about people who are considered tall by reliable sources but don't meet the 6'5" criterion; what do we do about people who are over 6'5" but not considered remarkably tall as a result (e.g. basketball players)?

A lot of time and energy gets expended by users who'd rather be non-involved but who want what articles we have to at least be sourced. Everyone who's on this list who's otherwise notable can have their height mentioned on their own article page, and everyone who's notable only for being tall can probably be linked to from <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigantism.html" title="Gigantism">gigantism</a>, or a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_gigantism.html" title="List of people with gigantism">list of people with gigantism</a> can be created <i>if absolutely necessary</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is true that tall is a relative term, so the article avoids that by objectively listing, with sources, known notable people who have heights in the top of the top percentile. It happens that a lot of basketball players are tall - so what? That's to be expected. The nom's points can be mentioned as controversy in the lead, and you can add a section that lists notable people widely considered to be tall in their respective eras.

<li>Your link doesn't establish that any particular percentile is considered "tall". Why that percentile and not another? I'm not asking for you to set the limit as high as you think is reasonable. I'm pointing out that you can't set the limit. You are just choosing arbitrary numbers. Why is the 99th percentile better than the 98th or the 95th or the 64th for example? Who says any one of these particular choices are "tall" and whatever's below is "not tall"? I'm not even asking "why should we believe them" yet, I'm just asking "<b>who</b> says"?

<dd>We talked about this on the article talk page, and I understand and appreciate your motivation in wanting the extra adjectives to limit inclusion in the list. And "very tall" <i>would</i> be a psychological deterrent to some otherwise zealous editors. But it's not something that we could actually uphold with any of the policies on Wikipedia. Such an approach would easily be cast aside by the first eager editor who wanted to add their favorite footballer and knew the ins and outs of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. So it's unfortunately unsustainable. I think that Guy's nomination, to simply delete the article, will solve all the problems.

<dd>Halbared, the site you linked to says: "<i>Judging by government safety regulations and industry's standardized sizing, everyone 6ft4 and over is considered statistically irrelevant. When allocating space for car, bus, train and plane passengers, and considering life-jackets or other emergency equipment, people over 6ft4 are ignored completely.</i>" Now, I do not see any external citation of this actually being true, so I'm not going to grant 6' 4" just from this link to a "tall people" website. But, it's a good idea to consider your argument in the abstract. If not 6' 4", there is surely <i>some</i> height that is statistically ignored by government and industry regulators, one can safely expect. However, I do not believe that this hypothetical height is of any use to us in deciphering what "tall" shall mean. Regulators are bound to an economic trade-off. There is a certain height that they will consider economically infeasible to build for, however, this is a market-imposed limitation and it is clear that there is a conflict of interest involved; they could set it higher and take the safety of more people into consideration, but they feel that they can "get away with" writing off these few people and saving a few bucks.

<dd>Mel, that is an exceptionally good point. Even if we were to apply the <i>n</i>th percentile, that will vary from nation to nation; how do we work out the proportional ethnicity to see if a 6'4" half-Japanese Sumo is unusually tall? Or do we simply build in a criterion that gives an immediate advantage to the Dutch at the expense of the Japanese? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:47, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not "giving an advantage." Being on the list shouldn't be a source of pride, shame, or anything for any nation. If the Dutch have more people in the highest brackett of human height that's just how the statistics break down. However I'm not convinced that's even true. There are far more Japanese people than there are Dutch people in the world and therefore it's probable they have had a greater number of people with gigantism or unusual growth.

<dd>"Tall" is a term of comparison. If a person is in the highest bracket available, the 99th percentile, then they are in the highest percentile of "tall" measured. Still if you'd like the standard could be raised further. The Italian Wikipedias version of the list has 201 centimeters while the Dutch has 229 cm. These are perhaps overly strict, but I did not find a deletion history for either so they apparently work by being so.

<li>At least twice, it is claimed that the article violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Of the seven actions listed there that qualify as original research, the fourth--"It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms"--is relevant to this discussion. However, equating 6'3", 6'5", 6'7", etc. with <i>tall</i> is surely not an original idea--it has been done before, it will be done in the future. Any given cut-off point for <i>tall</i> is not original research; it is simply arbitrary. For a person, tall is defined as "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tall" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tall" rel="nofollow">having a vertical extent greater than average</a>". So, if the average height in the United States is 5'10", then someone who is 5'11" is tall (when considered at the level of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>). Since Wikipedia should not be <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">biased</a> toward any particular nation(s), it seems to make sense to define "tall" in terms of the average global height.</li>
<li>However, a definition of <i>tall</i> that includes 50% - 1 of the population of the world (same applies if it's just a country, city, village, etc.) would make the list useless (or, at the least, VERY incomplete). For that reason, it makes sense to use a high percentile, like 99% or 99.5% or 99.9%. Yes, it is arbitrary! No, it's not original research! In many of the social sciences, results are considered statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. It's an arbitrary choice, but one that is used by <b>consensus</b>. Just because a cut-off point is arbitrary, does not mean it is not useful. I think this could work if the first line of the article specifies something of the sort: "This is a list of men who, in terms of their height, are in the 99th (or some other number) percentile globally".</li>
<li>Finally, and this strays from this AfD somewhat, if the list is kept, perhaps it should include only individuals who currently have articles on WP. Again, it's an arbitrary inclusion criteria, but I don't see anything wrong with that as long as that criterion is reached through consensus. Also, this would address the concern raised in the comment above by <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">User:Edison</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I originally had no particular interest in this article or its AfD, but felt compelled to write this lengthy comment after seeing the reasons for the proposed deletion. To any inclusion criterion, there is (almost) always an alternative. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_%28people%29_789e.html" title="WP:Notability (people)">notability guideline for biographies</a> is only one of many that could exist. However, it specifies an <b>objective</b> criterion for inclusion ("primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.") and has <b>consensus</b> support. I think this issue should be discussed in the article's talk page. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This list and related ones (<b>List of [tall/short] [men/women]</b> - strike as applicable) are totally subjective.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The most common reason for deletion I'm seeing is that any inclusion criterion for the article would be "arbitrary". However, all you really mean by that is that there are a great many alternatives. <b>So what?!?!</b> In that sense, every WP policy and guideline is <i>arbitrary</i>, as there are many possible alternatives to them. For example, instead of not allowing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, WP could allow it. There is nothing wrong with an arbitrary criterion for inclusion, as long as it is reached by <b>consensus</b> on the article's talk page. So far, such a discussion (to establish consensus) has not taken place. Also, my original vote/comment is about 10-12 votes above. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Er, yes there <i>is</i> something wrong wiht an arbitrary criterion, reached by consensus or not. What we are saying here is that 6'7" (today - it was 6'3" before) is "tall".

<dd>I don't understand arguments like this. Average height is verifiable. So is everyone's height in this article. Original research was not involved. The act of carefully and continously re-evaluating whether or not include a piece of information in an article (in this case debating a cut-off height) is very different from what we know as "original research." Using discretion and building consensus and particiapting in the gradual evolution of what each article should and should not cover is a good thing. What you call "subjectivity" is the stuff of building a good article. The article only becomes inappropriate if we start filling it with POV statements; unsourced, unverified or libelous material and idle speculation.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 15:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Who cares if a Vietnamese guy thinks 6 ft 2 is a giant and a Dutchman thinks it is a midget? I don't know what world you are in but if you walk down the street in any country at 6 ft 4 inches you are going to be way above average height. You are all missing the point. The list as it is now is rubbish who cares about the basketball players? . If the list stays as it is now delete. It was absolutely fine before! 6 ft 4 is a clear starting point in any place even average height in Holand is about 6'1. The list was intended to note the people in the public eye well renowned who are notable for being tall. Forget most basketball players unless they are well over 7 feet.

<dd>I thought the changes I made helped make it more certain that the people listed have a tallness that is significant to their fame or notability.

This article has to go, no matter how well sourced it becomes." In cases like this, whining that a certain adjective must have a precise, independetly verified definition arrived at through scientific rigor is a fruitless semantic exercise, inimical to the subjective nature of language itself. NOR applies to "new definitions of pre-existing terms;" it does not preclude the variable, reasonable interpretation of very common adjectives. Trust people to build consensus; they'll decide what tall means, and the meaning will fluctuate from time to time, as well it should.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 15:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Almost a model list since it sets rational parameters and requires references for inclusion.

Since even the nom admits that the subject is valid (but apparently doesn't like basketball players), there is no good policy reason to delete and none has been suggested in the nomination.

<p>This article is a duplicate of the subject of <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">dating sim</a>. Please do not close this AfD simply saying we can keep both articles, because we cannot have two articles about the same subject! I recommend Wikipedia choose the term "dating sim" simply because the titles of Wikipedia articles are not meant to reflect fandom jargon, but rather the most commonly used term. A brief overview for those who don't know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The term "dating sim," meaning a video game focused around romance, has been in use in English since the 1990s. It is an English translation of the Japanese term 恋愛ゲーム <i>ren'ai geemu</i>. Dating sims have overlap with <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishoujo_games.html" title="Bishoujo games">bishoujo games</a>, meaning Japanese games involving cute girls, and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novels.html" title="Visual novels">visual novels</a>, a medium similar to text adventure.</li>
<li>The term "dating sim" is commonly used in video game literature to describe any kind of romantic game, regardless of whether it is a simulation or text adventure, because that's simply the term commonly used in English. For example: <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22dating+sim" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22dating+sim" rel="nofollow">Google News</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22dating+sim" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22dating+sim" rel="nofollow">Google Book Search</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22dating+sim" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22dating+sim" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a></li>
<li>The term "ren'ai game" is a neologism. It is not Japanese; that would be "ren'ai geemu." It is not English; that would be "romance game." And it is not used in reliable English sources <i>at all</i>. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?as_brr=0&amp;tab=pn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22ren%27ai+game" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?as_brr=0&amp;tab=pn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22ren%27ai+game" rel="nofollow">Google News</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22ren%27ai+game" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22ren%27ai+game" rel="nofollow">Google Book Search</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22ren'ai%20game" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22ren'ai%20game" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a></li>
<li>The <b>publishers</b> of romantic bishoujo games in English refer to them as "dating sims," even if they involve neither dating nor simulation, because "dating sim" is the term most commonly used in English. For example, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Image%7EKana_cover.jpg_db14.html" title="Image:Kana cover.jpg">Image:Kana cover.jpg</a>, <a href="http://jbox.com/" class="external free" title="http://jbox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jbox.com/</a>, <a href="http://www.peachprincess.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.peachprincess.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.peachprincess.com/</a> (click through to front page - NSFW)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I recommend this article be deleted as a neologism, or at least redirected to <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">dating sim</a>. The main content of this article is some stuff I wrote in the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_game.html" title="Anime game">anime game</a> article which was recently moved here by other people without my knowledge; I recommend it be moved somewhere else before deleting. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 17:40, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- <i>The Pickup Game</i> on Newsgrounds is considered a dating sim in engish but wouldn't be considered a "ren'ai game". Also, The Pickup Game is actually about teaching guys how to pick up girls. It makes mention of the "3 second-rule" which is a term that orginates from the <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_Method_fa65.html" title="Mystery Method">Mystery Method</a>.

<li>I have no idea what you're talking about. Could you cite some reliable sources, such as printed publications, for your uses of the term "dating sim" and "ren'ai game" in the context of the "seduction community"? Also, how does this invalidate the term "dating sim"? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 00:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can you cite a reliable source on the definition of the term Dating Sim, that it must have romance? You might be able to say how popular a term is by google results but you can't say what defintion it has by those results. The Pickup Game is not focused on romance. It is focused on picking up girls. Counter Arts 02:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>So, which reliable source calls it a dating sim? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 03:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, that game has over 1 million views on newgrounds alone. It also recieved an daily third place award on that site. It is listed as "dating sim". In my opinion, a lot of other people consider that a dating sim as it teaches how to pick up girls. Counter Arts 03:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the Badger Badger movie were referred to as a "dating sim" on Newgrounds would that invalidate this AfD too?

<li>Hm... The example of the cover of Kana is odd, since my copy doesn't contain the word "Dating Sim" at all. It's missing that flag at the bottom mentioning it. (See the cover on g-collection's site.) A quick survey of my collection shows Peach Princess using the term "Dating Sim", G-Collections using "Erotic Bishoujo Adventure", Hirameki using either "Interactive DVD", "Visual Novel", and whatever they're calling Piece of Wonder, LIBIDO using "dating game", Okashi Studios using "ren'ai game", and JAST-USA using "Love-sim". I personally think there's a distinction between "dating sim", which describes a mechanic, and "ren'ai", which is about content. <a href="../../../p/y/t/User%7EPytom_91d0.html" title="User:Pytom">PyTom</a> 22:44, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The sole attempt at even using context or justifying this article existence is: "An interest in this subject might relate to the topic of heightism, which is argued to play some role in many tall women's lives." It might. It might not. It might be better to give appropriate examples in heightism than to randomly list tall women and leave it to the readers to make the connections. As it stands, it's just an arbitrary collection of women who happen to be tall, "tall" being arbitrarily defined. GassyGuy 19:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The tallest female humans are unusual enough to deserve an article. Each claim should have a reliable source. The only 2 issues I see are whether it should be limited to women who are otherwise notable, and how high the bar should be set. Someone 2 standard deviations taller than average is not very tall, since if heights were normally distributed, out of 3 billion women there would be about a million and a half to be listed in the article if they did not have to be otherwise notable. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:27, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - <b>This text is copied from the AfD for List of men</b>. Although I have reservations about the article as it currently stands (incomplete, insufficiently documented, etc.), the reasons for proposing deletion do not convince me.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The article does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Of the seven actions listed there that qualify as original research, the fourth--"It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms"--is relevant to this discussion. However, equating 6'3", 6'5", 6'7", etc. with <i>tall</i> is surely not an original idea--it has been done before, it will be done in the future. Any given cut-off point for <i>tall</i> is not original research; it is simply arbitrary. For a person, tall is defined as "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tall" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tall" rel="nofollow">having a vertical extent greater than average</a>". So, if the average height in the United States is 5'10", then someone who is 5'11" is tall (when considered at the level of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>). Since Wikipedia should not be <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">biased</a> toward any particular nation(s), it seems to make sense to define "tall" in terms of the average global height.</li>
<li>However, a definition of <i>tall</i> that includes 50% - 1 of the population of the world (same applies if it's just a country, city, village, etc.) would make the list useless (or, at the least, VERY incomplete). For that reason, it makes sense to use a high percentile, like 99% or 99.5% or 99.9%. Yes, it is arbitrary! No, it's not original research! In many of the social sciences, results are considered statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. It's an arbitrary choice, but one that is used by <b>consensus</b>. Just because a cut-off point is arbitrary, does not mean it is not useful. I think this could work if the first line of the article specifies something of the sort: "This is a list of men who, in terms of their height, are in the 99th (or some other number) percentile globally".</li>
<li>Finally, and this strays from this AfD somewhat, if the list is kept, perhaps it should include only individuals who currently have articles on WP. Again, it's an arbitrary inclusion criteria, but I don't see anything wrong with that as long as that criterion is reached through consensus. Also, this would address the concern raised in the comment above by <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">User:Edison</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I originally had no particular interest in this article or its AfD, but felt compelled to write this lengthy comment after seeing the reasons for the proposed deletion. To any inclusion criterion, there is (almost) always an alternative. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_%28people%29_789e.html" title="WP:Notability (people)">notability guideline for biographies</a> is only one of many that could exist. However, it specifies an <b>objective</b> criterion for inclusion ("primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.") and has <b>consensus</b> support. I think this issue should be discussed in the article's talk page. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Professor Pham did not create any article on Wikipedia and the article does not contain any 'puff' but pure facts.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason that I created this biography because last week, I wrote an article about the Manufacturing Engineering Centre (MEC), some administrator put a hyper-link under 'Professor Pham' and suggested that information is required. So I completed it by putting in prof Pham's biography from the MEC web site (the contents of which I am responsible for).</p>
<p>My emphasis: <b>Professor Pham did not create any page on Wikipedia</b> as he would not have the time. I am, Paulette (alias 'Sweetpea2007'), the author for the MEC article and his biography.</p>
<p>By the way:</p>
<p>1. Check your facts before defaming someone of self-promoting, puffing ...</p>
<p>2. A correction: from his biography 'He was made an OBE' (not CBE as stated in the above discussion).</p>
<p>3. To some people, someone's achievement is always a 'puff'.</p>
<p>4. I have removed the article myself as I have no time for further arguments.</p>

Bye!</p>

<p>Prod patroller bumping from PROD for further consideration. Prod rationale was "NN-religious movement". It has a claim of notability, but I can't find anything that I'm sure is a reliable independent source talking about it, so has anyone noted it? I asked another editor with more expertise in this topic area, and they were also uncertain. So I bring it to the community for evaluation. The article explicitly claims to be part of a larger association, so I think it is a congregation rather than a denomination. I find no sources in Google News, and nothing I consider reliable in Google Web.

<li><b>Keep pending references provided in articles</b> Per above it sounds like they are probably notable. However, references to establish notability must be provided <i>in the article</i>. Schi mentioned a bunch of potential published sources to cite, but I didn't see any of them listed in the article itself. So my recommendation is keep but only if the article is cleaned up to put the references for verification within it. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your arguments are unique and interesting.If we show news articles as citations then you say Indian news papers lack journalistic standards.If we show government sources then you say it is not valid source.If we show sociologists,politicians,prime minister using these words then you keep mum.If sociologists don't back up the term then why they are using these words.You can see Yogendra yadav defining the term in one of the FAQ.<a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/5704._.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/5704._.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>.You can also see that he has estimated upper caste population as 33%.If there is no definition and there is no basis for classification then how sociologists like him have estimated population?Even if we assume Indian news papers lack journalistic standards,why others are using the word frequently.You are also agreeing that sociologists like srinivasan have used these words. Why does he use it if he does not back up the term. How words used for many decades will become neology?</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the suggestion that "I should open my eyes". Look at the pdf sourced from the Ministry of Minority affairs. Browse to page 5 (26 of the pdf), where it is mentioned in the second point of the third bullet of B: <i>Hindu — General Category/Hindu-Upper Castes (these two terms are used interchangeably)</i>. Now this pdf is a report by the Prime Minister’s High Level Committee, in other words the credibility of the source cannot be disputed. It satisfies the verifiable clause, and the meaning of "upper caste" is clearly and unambigiously defined there. I don't find any other fault with the article, as you claim. I am now completely convinced that this nomination is <u>in bad faith</u>. I won't waste my time justifying a well known and supported fact.

<dd>Forward caste or Upper caste definition is nothing to do with varna system. Why do you confuse with the word Shudra which is part of varna system.There are forward castes from all four hierarchies. There are backward classes from all hierarchies except brahmins.(West Bengal govt. has declared Tyagi caste as OBC which is supposed to be Brahmins.??)

<dd>That may be true, but the labelling of previously socially disadvantageous castes as "backward" has little to do with the current status, but rather politics, and political lobby groups. So, in India today, if you are born into a caste that used to be once oppressed, you are labelled as belonging to the "backward caste", even though you may be financially and socially well off (called the "creamy layer").

<dd>The word used for residual caste is GENERAL Caste in any govt gazzette not Upper/Froward caste as you are proposing.It wd be better to do away with usage of this term.further on non indian issue do you think ambroodey, Baka and others are so because they are logging in from offshore. <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkonoblast_af21.html" title="User:Ikonoblast"><font style="background:white" color="black"><b>&#160;Ikon&#160;</b></font></a></span>|<a href="../../../i/k/o/User_talk%7EIkonoblast_7131.html" title="User talk:Ikonoblast">no-blast</a> 13:16, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh yes, the sources you have cited are not reliable because they are <i>loosely</i> connecting General category ppl to Forward caste.<i>No theory exists</i> which calls these gen. catagory ppl as Forward or upper in any sense.Media sources are not relied upon in any reserach work, infact it will surprise you to know that very same ppl whom you have quoted will loathe from using this word in their research work.BTW Yogendra Yadav is not a sociologist he is a statiscian, who formulates theory on quota and reservation for govt and also does trend analysis during elections, playing with stats.So what makes him notable is data and its analysis not sociological concepts, even though he boasts of being a senior fellow in centre for developing societies, his role is that only.<span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkonoblast_af21.html" title="User:Ikonoblast"><font style="background:white" color="black"><b>&#160;Ikon&#160;</b></font></a></span>|<a href="../../../i/k/o/User_talk%7EIkonoblast_7131.html" title="User talk:Ikonoblast">no-blast</a> 11:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One more interesting argument.Prime Minister's high level committee report is not reliable!!.Sathish deshpande along with Yogendra yadav pioneered research paper given by me is working as professor of sociology in Delhi universiy.(Citation quotes that).Why Oxford university's department of sociology is inviting Yogendra yadav for its research work?<a href="http://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/research.html#crest" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/research.html#crest" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>.Beyond this,I don't want to argue whether Yogendra yadav is sociologist or not?</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This person is nowhere near notable.

<p>this article is pure sepculation as no official information on the album has been released, and is becoming an edit war. The person who created it even gets hostile on his talk page when things he does wrong are brought to his attention. there is already an article for the upcoming album at Kelly Clarkson's Third Studio Album which contains the poper tags and title.</p>

<li><b>Keep unless something significant has changed since last two debates</b> Has anything about the article significantly changed since the previous two debates? If not, I'd recommend Keep on procedural grounds since the last two debates resulted in Keep results per the admins. These afd discussions have to have some sort of closure to be meaningful. So unless something has significantly changed since the last two debates, this should be kept. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:06, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>non-notable game made up in school one day. Only source is a website created by game's originators. Has been edited exclusively by vandals and single-purpose accounts.

<li><b>Keep</b> This game was not "made up in school one day". It has been played for about 5-6 years, and when the idea of attempting to make it known more widely came up, a website was made, and a Wikipedia article was started. Now that this article is pending deletion, I am going to try and keep it up, but I don't know how to edit the page to add the sources, and references etc. If someone could please do that for me, that would be great. The source/reference would be <a href="http://www.scattertennis.com" class="external free" title="http://www.scattertennis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.scattertennis.com</a> and it woul;d be greatly appreciated if this article was kept up. It would mean the expanding of Scatter and make the game known to people throughout the World Wide Web. --ScatterTennis P.S. Also, I know that Scatter is not big now, but we plan on hosting many tournements over the next few years (first is on March 24th 2007), and that may increase the game's notability. So I don't think it would be such a bad idea to keep the article up. 20:21, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was seconds away from putting a {{db-bio}} tag on this article, but then I reasoned that the claims of extraordinary intelligence could be, very broadly, construed as an assertion of notability, albeit one that drastically fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li>Shira: I have Wikified the article. It is only a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a> at this time, and as such all your citations of Wikipedia policies do not apply. Bet Shira is an important Conservative synagogue in Miami and as such it intersects with many other related subjects. If this synagogue can't get an article about itself then I would say <i>no</i> synagogue in Florida, or anywher in the USA would get an article. What makes a synagogue "notable" in the eyes of the world in any case? Size? Age? Membership? Or that they were all burned down in Germany on <i><a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristallnacht.html" title="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a></i>? There are no real fixed criteria here so kindly stop treating this as if we need to expect synagogues to be like "<a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral%2C_New_York_b6ec.html" title="St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York">St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York</a>" to get articles about them, 'cause it aint gonna happen, the Jews are just too small a group. Soon editors will tell us that Jews don't deserve articles on Wikipedia 'cause the paltry <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_population.html" title="Jewish population">Jewish population</a> of 13 million Jews is "not notable" in relation to the world's 6 billion other humans. So I would say you need to watch out before you spout all those "WP"s. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I didn't nominate <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micah_Caplan_3fe4.html" title="Micah Caplan">Micah Caplan</a> for deletion; I nominated <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bet_Shira_2289.html" title="Bet Shira">Bet Shira</a> on its own, and <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">User:Jayrav</a> added Caplan to the AfD (see the edit history). I agree that the two should not have been nominated together. I came across Bet Shira when I was <a href="../../../n/p/p/WP%7ENPP_2bb0.html" title="WP:NPP">newpage patrolling</a>, and, based on Wikipedia policy (<a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> (and the proposed policy <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONG_d5cd.html" title="WP:CONG">WP:CONG</a>) and prior precedent, I felt it didn't merit inclusion in Wikipedia, as there was (at the time) no evidence that it was notable outside of the local area. Judging by the many Delete votes on the AfD, a lot of users agree. Although you've wikified the article, there's still not enough sources to demonstrate notability; the only external links are to the synagogue's own website. If, however, you can demonstrate (through the use of further reliable third-party sources) that the synagogue is influential and/or well-known outside its local area, then I will change my vote. I'm not saying it's automatically not notable, but at the moment there's a lack of sources to prove its notability. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:46, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hi Walton monarchist89: Thank you for your thoughtful reply. You do not seem to understand the nature and workings of synagogues that do not function like churches and thus whatever is written in <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONG_d5cd.html" title="WP:CONG">WP:CONG</a> cannot really apply. It's <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apples_and_oranges.html" title="Apples and oranges">apples and oranges</a>. The Jews are a tiny people relative to the rest of the population, and only a minority attend synagogues today, so usually the synagogue is itself a reflection that Jews are notable in that locale from a religious and cultural perspective. Any synagogue represents the accomplishments of its membership (as well as its local and broader communities) at reaching a variety of notability criteria. This is a discussion that will need greater clarification. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>I've added 2 quotes to the article, so it is no longer "mostly based on one BBC story".</li>
<li>The title is unacceptably POV; something like "Politics of Climate Change" would be better.</li>
<li>The article is currently too one-sided (and I made it even worse).</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Warming_8f17.html" title="Global Warming">Global Warming</a> is the wrong place to merge this. <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Warming_controversy_3c66.html" title="Global Warming controversy">Global Warming controversy</a> would be more appropriate.</li>
<li>The debate on whether Climate Change has been oversold will, IMO, grow in importance. I suspect we'll end up having a separate article on the topic within a year or two even if we merge it now.</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The author seems to be onto something, but it's unreferenced; the article is mostly lists, and the beginning reads like an OR or copyvio essay, and it smells like it may be a POV-fork. However, if the author can provide citations (and show that he's not plagiarizing the initial essay), and clean up the lists somewhat, this might be a pretty worthwhile article. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 20:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> or a <b>Strong Must be Rewritten</b> - There is already a List of philosophers born in the twentieth century (and those other lists aren't worth having). The article should be deleted or, if it is to be rewritten the rewrite should go like this:</li>

<dd>- all the lists should be stripped out (the article could have 'also see' links to appropriate lists),</dd>
<dd>- the article should be re-named as "Summary of 20th-century Philosophy's History" (or something like that) and be written with appropriate references.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. At least as article history is concerned, this would appear to be legit: this has a history of edits going back to 2004, and moreover the earliest text is obviously the ancestor of what is now here. A lot of its history seems to revolve around edit warring about whether <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a> is enough of a philosopher to stand in this company, though, but there's enough there to convince me that this is not a POV fork. It certainly isn't very good, and should be sent to cleanup, but that's not grounds to delete this. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 21:14, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but revise</b>. The intro needs to be rewritten to make it more wiki-styled, and the article as a whole could use more of a general-audience-appropriate overview of the topic, but the topic itself definitely seems notable enough to be worth keeping. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillHarper_f5ce.html" title="User:WillHarper">WillHarper</a> 21:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but needs cleanup and expansion. The only equivalent we have seems to be <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_philosophy.html#Contemporary_philosophy" title="History of philosophy">History of philosophy#Contemporary philosophy</a>, which is just a paragraph, and this is already pointed to as a subarticle of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Western_philosophy_373b.html#19th_to_mid-20th_century_philosophy" title="History of Western philosophy">History of Western philosophy#19th to mid-20th century philosophy</a>. I consider this an essential article so it's a pity the state that it's in, but that calls for improvement, not deletion. <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_philosophy.html" title="Modern philosophy">Modern philosophy</a>, according to that article, should cover the Renaissance to the 18th century, but redirects to the paltry <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th-century_philosophy.html" title="19th-century philosophy">19th-century philosophy</a>. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:40, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> to make this article passably correct and unbiased will necessarily make it into the equivalent of two or three volumes. It will either have to be too brief to be true, or too long to be useful. The field is just too large for century-based categories after the 18th century. it takes a few hundred years to filter out the best from the worse to get down to encyclopedic value in the age of a century. I mean you couldn't even do an encyclopedic entry of 20th century ango-american philosophy, not to mention the rise of philosophy in australia, etc. etc. and french and german philosophy? it is a delete as it can never be much more than the list and the list is best done elsewhere. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 01:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete/Redirect</b> - The sheer number of weapons available in the game is one of the features that sets it apart, but this article is badly written, incomplete, and reads like a game guide.

<li>Come on guys, the article's a few weeks old. Besides, what's wrong with a game guide? It's not a walkthrough, and there are many similar articles on Resident Evil, Halo 2 etc etc. Pictures are not yet available due to te recency of this game, and we do not yet know the total number of weapons available (the article mentions 'around 250 weapons'). I say don't delete, but it's fair to say I'm biased. but I can tell you I've not copied info from other sources. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERacooon_a319.html" title="User:Racooon">Racooon</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/c/User_talk%7ERacooon_a645.html" title="User talk:Racooon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Racooon_e0b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Racooon">contribs</a>) 09:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact the article hasn't been improved is something to be discussed within the article. The comedy troupe is quite notable in Canada and as noted in the article even had their own TV series.

<li>You've either misrepresented or misunderstood the original AFD conclusion; there was a <i>duplicate</i> article on this comedy group at a title with a marginally different spelling (the Wikiserver does not treat "in" and "In" as the same thing in a title). <i>That</i> article was nominated for deletion, and the final result was to <b>redirect</b> the <b>other</b> article <b>to this one</b>. There has <i>never</i> been a proposal to redirect the article anywhere other than its current spelling, and the deletion nomination <b>failed</b> because people felt they <i>were</i> sufficiently notable for an article. At any rate: they <i>are</i> a fairly well-known group in Canadian comedy, and they <i>do</i> get a reasonably good number of Google hits. An unverifiable claim is not, in and of itself, a legitimate reason to delete an entire article if <i>other</i> parts of it <i>are</i> verifiable; it's only a legitimate reason to remove the specifically unverifiable parts. And for what it's worth, <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kidsintheh/kidsintheh.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kidsintheh/kidsintheh.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> <i>does</i> make at least a passing reference to the Trolls as an example of Canadian television comedy; whether that by itself is sufficient to verify the television show claim is certainly debatable, I grant, but the verifiability of the TV show claim is not, in and of itself, a deletion criterion. <b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:18, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Thank you all for your comments. Yes, I accept that it looks like a "how to". However, it is difficult (for me at least) to write an article on this subject without including some "how to" information. That is, to explain this subject it is necessary to describe a situation in which it is used, which inevitably tells someone how to implement the technique. However, the "how to" part is not detailed. Your suggestions are welcome. For example, would it be sufficient (or even a step in the right direction) to change the sub-titles to, "Description", "Example" and "Where It Is Used"?</dd>

<dd>Because <i>Black box testing techniques</i> is logically a subsection of <i>Black Box Testing</i>, and not v.v. It also makes sense to have articles with titles that reflect terms that people are likely to search for. The whole field of software testing includes techniques from unit testing of modules of code using white and black box techniques right up to testing usability, security and accessibility, which is a very broad spectrum of different topics, and it seems to me that the best structure is to have <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_testing.html" title="Software testing">Software testing</a> as the most general article, with articles for the more-specific areas beneath this, then detail about specific testing techniques applicable to those areas beneath these. If we attempted to describe all software testing techniques in a single article, which would mean adding an awful lot more techniques to the list in this article, we would undoubtedly end up splitting it anyway because it would get too large. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichig_ca92.html" title="User:Michig">Michig</a> 17:48, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This article contains very useful definitions of various testing techniques which are not described elsewhere on the Wikipedia, the information should be retained. Suggest it is just a matter of where to place this information. What if some of these techniques are applicable to both white and black-box testing? JPFitzmaurice 10:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would suggest that individual techniques have their own articles (as several already do), and if they apply to more than one area of testing they can be linked from multiple articles as required.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichig_ca92.html" title="User:Michig">Michig</a> 10:53, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> — despite having just done a cleanup of the article! I was considering nominating it here and Interiot has made the decision for me!&#160;;-) Editors may wish to check out the article's talk page for a description of why the article was created, and it seems like a noble, but inappropriate, motivation. The article isn't just potentially limitless and subjective; it's also likely to be PoV and wrong from time to time, on the basis that it's likely to be hard to prove that some feature or other is considered rare <i>everywhere</i> in the world. If the article is kept, the word "rare" will have to be better defined. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 21:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Reason this page created - some automotive designs and accessories disappear and are generally forgotten or are completely unknown to younger generations. Many such features may have been been individually desirable but not as parts of packages. Others have become obsolete as they have been superceded by newer technology. While there might be some description of some items on other pages, this page could be a bit more like an endangered and extinct species page.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I created the page however after reading the discussion above have to agree that it was misguided. My aim was to gather some of the more creative and often practical but generally unknown designs used in the industry (yes all highly subjective terms). Moreover, I have to admit my original use of "obsolete" is much like "extinct" - again subjective - white swan thinking. User: Albertasunwapta</li>

Oh well, feel free to wipe this one out. User: Albertasunwapta
<ul>
<li>"Death by natural causes" isn't necessarily precise, but it's a term of art used by emergency responders and statisticians, it has something of an understood meaning that's used in government publications, and so has reliable sources to back it up.

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no benefit is copying a long directory of TV repeaters out of an FCC database to make a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Thank you, <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a>, for bringing this to my attention. I am the author of all of these lists, so I will provide my defense. It has been customary to include a list of translators in each television article; however, the Salt Lake City television market is unique in that their primary stations have anywhere from 50 - 120 translator stations, as opposed to fewer than 25 translators in any other market. When I initially began adding the translators, it quickly became clear that the list was too unwieldy for inclusion in one article. I sought the advice of fellow members of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Television_Stations_c595.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Television Stations">WikiProject Television Stations</a> and was advised that the best way to do this would be as a separate list that the main article would reference. I believe that it is appropriate to keep the list of translators, as is the custom for TV articles, and it is appropriate to keep it as a subarticle, as it was never meant to be a standalone article, but rather an adjunct to the main article. The data is authoritative, having come from the <a href="http://svartifoss2.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101129393&amp;formid=303&amp;fac_num=68889" class="external text" title="http://svartifoss2.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101129393&amp;formid=303&amp;fac_num=68889" rel="nofollow">FCC</a>, but is not in an easily referenced source in its original form. Also, while <a href="../../../k/t/v/KTVX_64a9.html" title="KTVX">KTVX</a> doesn't provide a list of translators on its website, the other stations do. The FCC data is self-reported, but it is not advertising; it is instead a mandatory report as part of their license renewal application. I welcome input on how to better present this information, but firmly believe that the information is relevant and notable, but too bulky for inclusion in the main article. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 05:34, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Also, I will not have access to an Internet connection for the next couple of days and so, will not be available to respond to questions, so although AfDs are generally resolved after five days, I request a couple of additional days so that I can answer questions before any action is taken in this matter.

<li><b>Comment</b> dhett has expressed difficulty in reaching the internet for the next couple of days, so we should wait, but here are my thoughts right now. <b>1.</b> Even if the data are kept, they should be trimmed to a format like <i>City, State (callsign)</i>, since the channel number is the same as that in the callsign, with the text linking to the corresponding FCC page. <b>2.</b> I still don't see why we can't just mention a few of the more notable translators -- if a store has only a couple of locations, then we would list all the locations, but if it has over 100, then no one would argue we should keep them all. <b>3.</b> If other stations' websites list their translators, then we should simply link to that. If they don't, see point 2 (someone could also set up a webpage or publish the info somehow). <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 15:17, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the rampant spirit of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, I second Bearcat's suggestion to <b>suspend AfD for at least 5 days</b>. This will probably permanantly table the deletion, but if—upon closer inspection and discussion at <a href="../../../k/t/v/Talk%7EKTVX_56ae.html#Merge_notice" title="Talk:KTVX">Talk:KTVX#Merge notice</a>—we determine that the sub-articles irredeemably violates policy on original research or something else, we can reopen this AfD. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 01:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have most if not all of the facts available, which are not much different from how they appeared before the nomination, and it's not clear that this discussion is going anywhere anyway. I thus would like this deletion process to take its course. We can always <i>extend</i> a discussion. I also believe the merge discussion can take place simultaneously. I just want everyone to contribute their thoughts, because before this deletion discussion no one was saying much at all, as evident in that merge discussion. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 01:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It should also be noted that one centralized deletion nomination is a better place to discuss this issue than having various separate merge discussions. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 04:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...which is why I left notes on all of the pages directing them to the centralized merge discussion that was already in progress. It's not clear to me whether this violates wikipedia policy or not, and I think discussion will be served if we remove the pressure of imminent deletion, especially since the primary contributing editor will have limited access the next few days. I would like to keep the deletion option open, but if no other editors agree, I'll have to vote keep to cement the fact that there is no consensus.

<li>Cool Hand Luke, I've said more than once that this discussion should be extended. I'm not trying to rush this through, only saying that it's attracted more posts than the merge discussion, which had three participants I think. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 22:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There was a pageful of commentary on the notice before you nominated it (which, by the way, was before anyone thought to ask the original contributer about it). I don't mind the nomination, but in light of the good faith and effort that <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">User:Dhett</a> put into properly presenting this info (by asking the relevant wikiproject)—data which is <i>always</i> included for other stations as a matter of policy—I think that the only decent response is to ask for this nomination to be withdrawn. I accordingly vote <b>keep</b> and look forward to discussing this further on the talk page. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 19:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I also believe now that the TV WikiProject had erred in their advisement to Dhett, which resulted in his continuing to work on the admirably long lists.

<li><b>Keep with Clean-up</b>. I'd be happy to assist with the clean-up. I believe this list is useful; someone who was looking for this information should be able to find it, without having to query endlessly at a government database. People often cite <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for these types of lists, but my own encyclopedia at home (World Book) contains many lists, albeit not specifically for lists of translators. I'm not sure why there's a need to link to each query, and I think the tables can be reduced (or at least prettified by removing the ALLCAPS). Many Wikipedia TV station articles have information on translators, as this was a compromise between those who wanted no mention of translators and those who wanted full articles on each translator. In the case of Utah station translators, this information becomes huge because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tvmarkets.gif" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tvmarkets.gif" rel="nofollow">Utah has only one market and is a rather large state</a>.

<dd>Given Dhett's source of this information, it would take an unusual view of original research to conclude that this page violates WP:OR. The fact that it's hard for a novice to navigate fcc queries shows that this tabulated data is quite useful. I don't want to dump 100 translators into all the Salt Lake TV station articles, but this information merits inclusion. The only question remaining is how to go about formatting it. The original subpage scheme seemed like a good compromise, but I think policy strongly frowns on it. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 21:56, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My main argument has always been that this is trivia, as indicated by the fact that not even the station's website mentions translators.

<dd>I estimate that the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah_81c5.html" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a> television market consists of around 2.5 million people, 2.3 million in Utah alone. Of those, only approximately 1.5 million live within range of the primary stations' broadcast signal. That means that the stations' translator network serves around a million people, or 40% of the market. That is hardly trivial. The stations' websites don't mention their history either; does that make the stations' history trivial also? No, translator information is relevant and encyclopedic; I think our challenge here is to find a better way to present it. Your suggestion above has a great deal of merit and is a good start. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 09:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is my understanding of WikiSource that this material would be quite inappropriate there, as Wikisource is dedicated to "exist to archive the free artistic and intellectual works created throughout history, and to present these publications in a faithful wiki version so that anyone may contribute added value to the collection." As these lists are neither artistic nor an "intellectual work" in most senses of the phrase, I don't think this material would last long there. Commons is supposed to be a repository of media files. Again, I'm not sure this list qualifies for that. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 23:26, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That's not exactly a true statement. The translators are appropriate in the station article, as they are in almost all other articles for stations with translators. The only reason these translators are in a separate subarticle is due to the size of the list - putting the translator list in the separate subarticle keeps the main article readable and of a manageable size. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 09:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Other stations' pages have translator info available, thpugh usually on the same page as the article itself. The reason why the Utah stations have separate pages for translators is that there are so many translators on the air within the Salt Lake market -- which consists of all of Utah, plus portions of Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona and Idaho. If they're placed on the same page, the article gers too big and cluttered. Therefore, I'm for keeping them as they are now. -- azumanga 06:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- I'm back; was away longer than I'd expected to be. Naturally, I strongly disagree with comments that TV translator information is not encyclopedic. This is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Paper" title="WP:NOT">not a paper encyclopedia</a> so there is no reason why the articles shouldn't include translators, as they are relevant. I also contend that <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a>'s <a href="../../../c/v/s/CVS_Corporation_ccff.html" title="CVS Corporation">CVS Corporation</a> analogy is not relevant here; television stations are not the same as drugstore chain (or any other corporate) franchises, as each station must be specifically licensed by the federal government and that no change can be made to any station without that change being specifically authorized and licensed. Also, these are not simply lists of locations; each station listed contains a link to the FCC website, which has further information about that translator, including its broadcast coverage area. None of the translators is any more important than the other, so listing only a handful is not feasable either. I do however appreciate Xiner's thoughtfulness in listing his ideas on how the article should be treated. His first idea, removing all information except city, state and calls could work using multiple columns in the article, thereby reducing the size of the information. As soon as I have opportunity, I will try that in my own user space. I believe it will be a reasonable compromise, and allow the lists to be merged back into the main article without making the main article unreadable. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 08:49, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, you should be able to fit a few translators in one row that way. As for FCC approval, CVS stores would have to abide by local zoning laws and acquire consumer agency licenses...I still don't think it's a big deal, but like I said, I think this will end up a discussion about how to merge the stuff. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 17:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Compressing the data into a table doesn't actually help the page's size for download over dialup. In fact, the table html makes it bigger.

<li>The comparison was actually between the example and just merging the existing table into the main article, not between the example and the main article without the translator info, but thanks for the feedback. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 22:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I know, but rearranging the table doesn't save bandwidth. If you view source on the independant article, the table consumes about 26k, so dumping it into the article would add that much for those who care (really not a terrible amount anyway). The version you've arranged on your user space (<i>prior</i> to adding links, mind you) is 20k. Making the table wider and shorter won't save much bandwidth. Most of the savings if from abbreviating the verbose links. I wish I didn't say anything though, because your table is great—it won't overwhelm the article. I think download time is not an issue. It adds about two second to the article on dialup. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 03:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another vanity article by an alleged actor who has appeared as an extra a few times, and as an unnamed character in a DVD sold on its producer's website. It goes out of its way to give "sources" but they're basically the IMDb, which takes submissions from the public (in cases such as this they're basically always written by the subject). There's been a lot of this sort of vanity going around. See also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Frank_Croteau_f7e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Frank Croteau">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Frank Croteau</a> for a recent AFD of a very similar article. <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:48, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as usual fiend has to lie to get his way! Pretty much everything Mr. fiend has reported above is a lie. He claims that the only source is IMDB lie. He says that he was just been an "extra" a few times - lie. He has held major roles in at least five films. His book is being sold at Amazon as well as at least one of his movies in which he gets second billing. This supposed "unnamed character" is a lie as well. The article on Michael Kaplan is nothing like the deleted article on Frank Croteau. Kaplan is much more notable. As an admin. fiend should be made to tell the truth and no longer lie and use shadows and mirrors to fool people into voting the way he wants. Michael Kaplan is an actor who has appeared in many independent films a couple have aired on televion. He has also been included in some documentaries. I bought one of his films The Deserter in Newbury Comics. I beieve his notability is established hence the reason for beginning this article. He is well known among military enthusiasts too. And no I am not Michael Kaplan nor am I a member of his family or a friend of his, since this would be the next accusation that fiend will try if his predictability continues. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 03:20, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Excuse me Calton, or should I say fiend, since you two sound so much alike, but "bad faith" doesn't come into it. He is lying, and he has to know he is lying because he is forming his lies in such a way to get a result. Just like you are lying too in the very same way. So close to Rfiend that it makes me wonder. For you to make the statement that his films are "barely a cut above home movies," is a falsity. Have you ever seen any of the films he has appeared in? If not, then how can you and fiend make these same "home movie" accusations? If you have then tell us which ones. I own one of these films on DVD and it is in no way a home movie. It doesn't even have a low budget indie feel to it and looks very professional. And of course, you don't think it meets wpbio because you always seem to agree with fiend from my previous experience with you. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 16:27, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can anyone tell me how much information needs to be out there in order to keep a page like this active? Are you looking for one verifying article, ten of them or more? Or am I simply way off on what makes this verifiable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/t/b/User%7ECtbrons_d389.html" title="User:Ctbrons">Ctbrons</a> (<a href="../../../c/t/b/User_talk%7ECtbrons_df35.html" title="User talk:Ctbrons">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ctbrons_2075.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ctbrons">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Generally speaking, we're looking for <i>multiple</i> articles in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Color Africa should be the focus of the article, not merely mentioned or listed within it, and the article can't be a press release or based on one. Two such articles would be the absolute minimum, and the more the better. Four or five would be excellent. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:21, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I find a good way to think of it this: A wikipedia article should be catered for the researcher, if the article puts all the useful information from a number of good sources together, it is of help to a researcher because he/she doesn't need to go looking at all of them. If it is merely giving the same information as it's one source, the researcher could just look there instead and the wiki article is a little superfluous, if you see what I mean? <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 11:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I am not ready to promote a particular direction, but this is a tough one, listcruft can be a problem and normally I would be happy to delete it, but GT is a powerful force in the automotive enthusiast world especially among young people. Being featured in the game helps cars achieve cult status, and this is really not just my personal opinion(if I need to I could dig up some car magazine sources). I remember reading once that Gran Turismo was responsible in part for the popularity of cars like the <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazda_RX-7_d5ce.html" title="Mazda RX-7">Mazda RX-7</a> and Trueno Sprinter in America as well as the popularity of American <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle_cars.html" title="Muscle cars">muscle cars</a> and <a href="../../../t/v/r/TVR_25e2.html" title="TVR">TVR</a> in Japan. It should not be deleted without careful thought. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J. Leivick">Daniel J. Leivick</a> 03:31, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Gran Turismo is an important part of popular culture, and the above point is a good one. Inclusion in Gran Turismo is important to car manufacturers, to the extent that Nissan even released a special edition of their <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nissan_350Z_0780.html" title="Nissan 350Z">350Z</a> called the Gran Turismo Edition <a href="http://www.tuningmag.net/?name=nissan-350z-gran-turismo-4-edition" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tuningmag.net/?name=nissan-350z-gran-turismo-4-edition" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>/<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 19:25, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - While GT has substantial influence in the real world industry, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not the place to promote</a> that influence. As a list of cars, this article has no encyclopedic value. The impact of GT on the car industry can be explained on the respective game articles; GT being popular does not justify the existence of a complete car list on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 03:45, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
