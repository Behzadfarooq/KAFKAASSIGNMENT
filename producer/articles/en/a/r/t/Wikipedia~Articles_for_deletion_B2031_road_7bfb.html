<li><b>Delete</b> - in my opinion there is a rough consensus, though certainly not unanimity, in the discussion on B-roads.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is a highway article. We do keep California County Routes in the USA... --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschen7754_0301.html" title="User:Rschen7754">Rschen7754</a>
<dl>
<dd>From the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_California_County_Routes_b00b.html" title="List of California County Routes">List of California County Routes</a> it looks that a typical California county is served by maybe six County Routes and that many of these routes do serve more than one county. When comparing this with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_road_numbering_scheme_69aa.html" title="Great Britain road numbering scheme">Great_Britain_road_numbering_scheme</a>, the equivalent to a US county route seems a three-digit A-road. B-roads are short roads (typically 10 km or less) connecting one village to the next, never a main throughfare. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 19:53, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Highway" in the UK refers to <b>any</b> road or even footpath (see <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html#Nomenclature" title="Highway">Highway#Nomenclature</a>). I doubt even the most ardent inclusionist would want to keep all UK highways. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?/!"</font></a> 07:50, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, it's absolutely correct to point out that "highway" is a generic term in the UK, and really this is just a country road that runs through a few minor English towns, mainly Caterham.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't count myself an "ardent inclusionist" but since the current article is completely encyclopedic I don't see why we should consider deleting it. It does no harm by existing and the information it provides is correct. I'm certainly in favor of deleting nonsense, vanity and whatnot from Wikipedia, but this road and most roads in England have been around for centuries.</dd>
<dd>Look at <i>any</i> road atlas of the British Isles. A general road atlas that omitted a single B road would not be worth buying. If an atlas purporting to represent driving conditions in England misses out roads like the B2031 then it's not going to sell very well, because it's a small country and that's what you're going to be driving on once you get off the trunk roads.</dd>
<dd>Here we track geography down to footpaths and bridleways, and <b>yes</b>, those are also considered notable. All public footpaths and bridleways are recorded in the UK. Every single public thoroughfare is recorded, and therefore intrinsically notable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:19, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a road atlas. All title deeds are officially recorded in the U.S. Does that mean that every private house and plot of land is notable and should have an article? I don't think so. And I certianly don't think we ought to include articles on every bridle path in the UK, and by extension, everywhere else in the world. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:42, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Title deeds are primary sources. If you used those to write an encyclopedia article about a private residence, it would fall under "original research" and be deleted. On the other hand, with highways, there are plenty of secondary sources that can be used to write an article on them. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:19, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not what <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> means. If I go to the county records and see that the state bought a road from the county on some date, that's not original research. Original research is drawing conclusions from that, such as the assumption that the state bought the road because of a bribe. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 04:46, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree with the assertion that the entry is "encyclopedic". An encyclopedia is not a grab-bag of data, it is data digested into information. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 08:17, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Regarding Tony Sidaway's thoughts, I too believe that long distance footpaths are notable, however, B roads are not. Some long distance footpaths are nationally maintained by <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Trails_35cb.html" title="National Trails">National Trails</a>, and are of interest to both tourists and ramblers, covering many areas of natural beauty. They aren't that numerous either.

<li><b>Delete</b> - B roads are none notable. They are NOT the equivolent of state highways in the US, just as counties are not the equivolent of states. State highways would be A roads.
