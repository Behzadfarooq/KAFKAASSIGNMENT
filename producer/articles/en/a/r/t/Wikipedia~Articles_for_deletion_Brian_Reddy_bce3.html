<p><b>Delete</b>: completely bogus and dubious Googled reference - Pete C <sup><font color="DarkRed">(talk)</font></sup> 14:53, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I must protest, this is my first article that I have written, and is entirely true. I don't understand what the problem is. I'm quite bewildered by all this actually. Thanks, Paul Fitzgerald.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I fixed 4 typos in the article, which looks legitimate, but I'm not familiar with the alleged material (Irish television?), so I don't know whether this is hoax content as alleged. <b>No vote.</b> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:42, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>FYI, any address with 134.226 as their starting two quads are computers in Trinity College Dublin. Just because someone else used a PAC (Publicly Accessible Computer) in college to post other articles or blank other's doesn't mean this is false.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure. Just as someone showing up on here &amp; posting just one comment under an IP address (as you just have) isn't necessarily trolling.&#160;:-/ - Pete C <sup><font color="DarkRed">(talk)</font></sup> 20:16, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>A reference for the article has now been posted (<i>Devils and angels&#160;: television, ideology and the coverage of poverty</i>, Devereux, Eoin (1998), Luton&#160;:University of Luton Press/John Libbey Media). The book does appear on the internet, however, whether it mentions Mr Reddy and associated television show would need to be verified. A copy of the book is not held at my local library (the National Library of Australia) and therefore I cannot verify. I think this is now a matter for the Irish Wikipedians to comment on - to date all comments of logged in users have been that they have not heard of Brian Reddy or the show. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 22:07, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

I just came across this webisit now. The prgram most certainly existed, and I think I should know, Dickie Hickson, the shows host was my father, The house used to be covered in Bolg memoribilia. The show was a huge success, and is relatively well known in Ireland despite what some people have claimed above. I wonder whether or not they are hoaxing you, as I think I can confirm fairly convincingly it exists.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time, and I urge you to vote to save this important site. Joe Hickson.</p>

<dd>* Dude, you're scamming - plain and simple. You're also the same person that <a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> referred to earlier - I just checked the edit history on this page. Anyone any doubts, look at the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_page.html" title="Talk page">User_talk:134.226.1.136</a> and its edit history for this anonymous user (who now calls himself Joe Hickson). Nope - not buying it. Bogus all the way.

<li><b>Delete</b> hoax created by a bored student of Trinity College in Dublin. He also created a few others, such as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Brennan_c3cb.html" title="Paul Brennan">Paul Brennan</a>, which got speedied as patent nonsense. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 16:02, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I got Reddyb speedied already today. Same IP address - Pete C <sup><font color="DarkRed">(talk)</font></sup> 16:11, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am an academic of Trinity College, and despite my IP address (I am on the college network) am of no connection to any of my fellow contributors from Trinity. I am a 51 yr old professor of medicinal chemistry, and thus old enough to be in the 'Bolg' generation. I can confirm to you unequivocally that the programme did exist. Although, I must say I am not quite sure where the Cold War analogy comes from. Overall, however, a wonderful addition to this great encyclopaedic reference. I hope to research, and add more to this article in the future. Please retain it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of whether your statement above is true or not, shouldn't you be posting with your own account rather than using a so-called communal Trinners IP addr, especially one as tainted as it is right now? Furthermore, the Reddy article is still bogus, IMHO. Just like the Reddyb one you posted yesterday that got speedied. In short; give up - the game's over - Pete C <sup><font color="DarkRed">(talk)</font></sup> 17:01, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am unaware of any such Reddyb article, how dare you accuse me of creating such</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address most certainly did! If you want to dissociate yourself with that IP, then get yourself a username, as suggested, otherwise people such as me will continue to make "mistakes" like this. At the very least, you should sign and date your comments, as has also been suggested. I still cannot believe Trinners is so restricted in IP ranges that the entire college - professors 'n' all - have to <a href="../../../n/a/t/NAT_e0ce.html" title="NAT">NAT</a> through the one IP addr - Pete C <sup><font color="DarkRed">(talk)</font></sup> 17:24, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
