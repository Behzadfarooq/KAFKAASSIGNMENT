<p>This is a tough one. I vote <b>weak delete</b>, and let me go into why. First of all, wikipedia can't put on its site everyone who commits murders. Poor people commit murders every day, and there's absolutely no mention of it on Wikipedia, but some kid whose parents can afford a video game system, and all of a sudden, there's upper-class white outrage. And that's what the article basically consists of, that outrages, asking us to be outraged, <i>plus</i> the normal criminal set up. Now, there is the 60 Minutes stuff, but this stuff isn't fleshed out. Was it merely mentioned as a lead in to a segment, or was the entire segment based on this one kid? I think there's no way of knowing, because I didn't see the show. There are 1.6 million hits on google on it, but it appears difficult to quantify how many are really this Devin Moore... but again, even if there is a large number of internet hits, who gets on the internet? people who can afford it.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 04:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree this is a grey area, but please realise that the incident might be more significant to United States society than a simple murder (as crass as that sounds), as it could be used to justify limitations on civil liberties such as free speech. Honestly, I was surprised when I read this article - I live about 15 minutes from the police station where this happened, and I heard plenty about the killings shortly after they occurred. However, this is the first I have heard about a video game connection. I was aware that there was at least one alleged "GTA murder" in the national media but had no idea that it and this local case were one and the same. As far as I can recall, there was no mention whatsoever in the local media about the game connection, at least not around the time of the shooting. In other words, the video game "defense" seems pretty contrived to me, and it might be a good idea to see how much credence is given to this defense by the courts, legislature, ESRB, etc. If this is just yet another cop killing in Alabama which happens to have idiots running the defense and spouting potentially harmful ideas about the dangers of free speech and media, then it doesn't belong in an international encyclopedia, as bad an incident as it was. If, however, we later see changes in the law or the entertainment industry based on this case (which seems unlikely), then it might be worthy of mention as a social phenomenon. So perhaps delete now, but include it if it becomes a bigger issue? -Barry K. 24.116.114.143 19:24, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is a really tough one. I'd say that this could be <b>merge</b>d into the controversy section of the article about the video game that inspired the murders, because ever since the murders, the game has gotten a very bad reputation. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 19:31, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No sources or references, and since this is a living person, remember Jimbo's admonition: "don't place a citation needed tag on it - <i>remove the information entirely</i>". Furthermore, the vast majority of the Google hits in a search for his name are not about this person, but rather about the NCAA football player of the same name. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 01:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I added three references. Despite the fact that there's another person by the same name, these weren't too hard to find.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Triple cop murderer and prisoner on death row provoked by seeking to live out virtual-reality. The article is verifiable. Although he didn't inspire a song such as <a href="../../../i/_/d/I_Don%27t_Like_Mondays_%28song%29_b69e.html" title="I Don't Like Mondays (song)">I Don't Like Mondays</a>, I think this case will be remembered and cited as a prominent case of VR inspired violence, and so it probably warrants a separate article from <a href="../../../v/i/c/Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_Vice_City_7738.html" title="Grand Theft Auto: Vice City">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:11, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, information is verifiable and notable. The many google hits (I only get 1.5 million and only 40,000 with quotatation marks) on his name should be evident enough of his notability. That his actions resulted in a case against a video game for putting an idea in his head is significant, and it could end up being a landmark case. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 05:07, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: That's not true. A search for "Devin Moore" and "Grand Theft" together gets me 17,300 hits, and taking "Devin Moore" out of quotation marks gets up to 33,000 (the 1.5/6 million figure was way larger than it should be because there are plenty of instances where both occur and neither the NCAA football player nor the killer are mentioned). — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 05:30, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Even if the statement by <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">User:Wikipediatrix</a> is true, how is that a reason for deletion? For example - if you search for "Ted Kennedy", I expect that the most matches by far will be for the US Senator. However, there is also <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Kennedy_%28hockey%29_7eb2.html" title="Ted Kennedy (hockey)">Ted Kennedy (hockey)</a>, longtime NHL star and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Should we delete the page on the hockey player because the Senator happens to be better known? <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 23:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
