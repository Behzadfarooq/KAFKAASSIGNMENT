<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. My reasoning is thus: of the four references, two are by Ruthy Alon, one is an interview with Ruthy Alon in Feldenkrais Journal, a publication of dubious impartiality, and the fourth is a reference that, in my opinion, is dubious: <i>Aspray TJ, Prentice A, Cole TJ, Sawo Y, Reeve J, Francis RM. Low bone mineral content is common but osteoporotic fractures are rare in elderly rural Gambian women. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. 1996 Jul;11(7):1019-25. (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8797124" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8797124">PMID 8797124</a>)</i>. I don't <i>know</i> that the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research on Gambian Women doesn't contain significant references to Bones for Life, but I am suspicious. Secondly, we have to be very careful about letting spam into the Wikipedia. Granted the article has been rewritten well, still. It's spammish history shows that it was not written by a disinterested scholar but by the very people who stand to benefit from the inclusion of the article. That's another point against the article. Thirdly, I did not find the Keep arguments to be strong as regards to notability. If Alon was a top figure in a recognizedly important medical field, that would be one thing. Being a top figure (claimed, anyway) in the less notable Feldenkrais Method is insufficient to establish notability. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:28, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article is an attempt at rewriting Bones for Life -- Wellness through Movement Intelligence to remove most obvious violations of WP:SPAM.

<li><b>Please note significant new reference</b> DBOLTSON has now included a reference 5-page interview with Ruthy, largely about Bones for Life in the Feldenkrais Journal (the primary "trade publication" of the Feldenkrais Guild of North America). The editors of that journal are highly qualified to judge this kind of article (they are experts put in place by other experts), so it should be considered as authoritative. The reference is currently a bit hard to track down, but the author is seeking permission to include the text on-line. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKineticScientist_5eaa.html" title="User:KineticScientist">KineticScientist</a> 19:32, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Still waiting for that apology. Don't appreciate your continued complaints about me either. I ran my own searches and everything I found would fall under WP:SPAM. The article has three very poor references by wiki standards, which support only a single section of the article so far. The bottom line is that so far the authors have not actually cited what they are using for references, or they are simply writing original research. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 01:35, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

Given this works's newness (having evolved only over the past 10 years) it is understandable that reference material is limited, but due to its pedigree and growing recognition (having taken root in 19 countries on 5 continents, with over 500 teachers worldwide) it would seem an oversight for it not to be granted some acknowledgement, if only for the sake of completeness. References to Bones for Life -- as written up in newspaper articles worldwide -- are in the process of being gathered (I trust Hebrew is acceptable). Speaking from personal experience, this work, based on solid biomechanical, ergonomic principles is most credible -- not to mention effective -- and deserves further attention by your readers inquiring into cutting edge approaches to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Medicine_e2df.html" title="Alternative Medicine">Alternative Medicine</a> and <a href="../../../n/c/c/NCCAM_1148.html" title="NCCAM">NCCAM</a>.

<dd>Note here what's happening: the main author, DBOLTSON, is trying to find sources AFTER writing the article. He's caught up in proving what he's writing is true, ignoring Wiki policy that he should be be writing directly from sources he has on hand. He's doing original research. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 14:42, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Or, in a more gentle light, after making a contribution which falls somewhat short (though is perhaps currently acceptable), DBOLTSON is trying to bring it up to the highest possible standards. Doing this article properly is hard, and DBOLTSON (and I, in any supporting role I've played) are just learning the ropes -- ignorant perhaps, but not purposefully 'ignoring'. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKineticScientist_5eaa.html" title="User:KineticScientist">KineticScientist</a> 14:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Obviously, the problem here was the article was identified as problematic from it's very creation. While there are assertions that the article is acceptable from some editors, the explanations, when they exist, consist of more comments like DBOLTSON's above: long on claims and short on sources. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 19:24, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The skepticism here is wonderfully healthy and challenging! Thank you, everyone! Please bear in mind that, just because one does not believe in something -- understandably because one has not experienced it for himself -- does not mean that (1) it does not exist and (2) it is not a valid approach, worthy of consideration. Please excuse my enthusiasm for Bones for Life (which prompted me to create this entry in the first place) while we amplify the resource section in order to substantiate its growing worldwide recognition, and approach WikiPedia's high standards for inclusion. Being too close to a subject can often blind one to its flaws; being too far can often blind one to its merits. With everyone's contributions, I trust we can find a more objective middleground! --DBOLTSON 23:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What does this have to do with the article being considered for deletion? The POV is a bit overly promotional, but it's the violations of WP:SPAM, WP:NOR, and WP:V that are of concern. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 19:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But let me be more specific about what I am asking of you.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding WP:V: You got the references you requested and also tonnes more links through google. I'd like to know specifically why you consider the 7 new references on the page to be inadequate. There are references to widely published and translated books, a medline article, interviews, and sundries. It's been established this is a notable person in the field. There are some 700+ google matches including many impartial interviews to be sorted through. Why do you consider all this to be inadequate?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding WP:SPAM: I am requesting more information because it isn't clear what you are calling spam. You are working to fix the article on the discussion page, so clearly at least some of the article has merit in your eyes. Which parts do you have a problem with and why? I've noticed on other articles that you seem to consider all external links anywhere other than scientific journals to be spam, which is not the usual spam threshold on wikipedia, especially on alternative therapy articles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding WP:NOR: Everyone on the article talk page has agreed the article could be more wikified and it's worth working towards fixing that. The founding editors are new to wikipedia and it's obvious they need a helping hand. All users are clearly indicating the article has some merit, and even you have been making comments on the talk page. So why is this grounds for deleting the article? If you believed the entire article violates WP:NOR why would you be suggesting improvements on the article talk page?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>WP:SPAM: I don't recall seeing any contention that DBOLTSON's original article was spam. My only concern now with this policy is that the new article, if not deleted, resolve the problems of the original article. Additionally, WP:SPAM lists an important issue, which I see as more WP:NOR: "Therefore, it can never be correct to add a link or reference to References sections if nobody editing the text of the article has actually referred to it." I don't think the article has solved the SPAM issues because of the NOR issues.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>WP:V: I think the editors have made very good progress providing verifiable references, though there still appears to be very heavy reliance upon Alon's book and her website. I think Aspray(1996) should be removed because there appears to be no connection between it and this Wiki article. Alon(2005) should be removed because, as I understand, it is only an abstract - the actual research paper has never been published. Still, I think these issues are minor, other than how they relate to the WP:NOR issues.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>WP:NOR: (see the above quote from the WP:SPAM article) From my perspective, the article is original research with some references added that were never used as source material. I personally like the recent addition of the "Working Theory", though this not actually specific to Bones for Life and so could be moved to another article. The Research section should be removed, since it is based upon an abstract of an unpublished paper. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 02:00, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Spam</b> Reads and probably is still spam. If after a supposed rewrite its still pretty much, I'd say it may be unfixable, and thus not for wikipedia. It seems like one of those random medical ideas that aren't well constructed or proven, where there's a collection of loosely related medical content that is original research to collect it into the medical idea presented. In summary, the program is not well established, and its spam for bonesforlife.com. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 01:21, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Significant rewrite:</b> Okay, I've done a considerable rewrite of the article removing advertising style language and culling unecessary fluff.

I believe there really is some encyclopedic content here. With a couple more citations and ensuring the article doesn't bloat I think it's a reasonable addition to wikipedia. Please note I commented out some of the notability evidence at the bottom of the article in order to streamline the treatment. Let us know your thoughts on the new article. Best wishes.

<dd><b>Comment</b> <i>A beautiful rewrite</i> -- very succinct and clear (and objective). I see you well understand and appreciate what we are trying to communicate, and you do so expertly; your generous expenditure of time and effort is thoroughly appreciated -- <b>Thank You</b>, Anon 58.178.194.85<b>!</b> I will get to work on sourcing the Tel Aviv study, which was cited in Ruthy's own (unpublished) Proposal to NASA (I have a copy) <i>Bones for Life Strategies for Effective Rehabilitation of Bone Strength within Protection of Vulnerable Joint and Connective Tissue.</i> [Text from Page 4, supported by Appendix 20, page 31] -- Or might this be useful in and of itself? As far as criticism of the work, I think it is too new to have any commentary or detractors (especially given its focus on safety, and its general harmlessness, not to say effectiveness). It really is distinct from the Feldenkrais Method -- in aims, and in approach -- and ultimately merits unique filing, IMO. --DBOLTSON 18:06, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
