<li>This is extremely premature considering this article was only just recreated some hours ago. Please give sufficient time for this article to be expanded on. CentrOS 09:16, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nah. Personally I think your evidence is strong enough that at best the article will be kept and expanded, and at worst it'll be merged and redirected into <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">Podcast</a>. But having the AFD discussion now will get that out of the way <i>before</i> you spend any significant amount of time expanding it (afterall, it'd suck if you spent a week or two expanding it, only to have it deleted again). BTW, my general feeling is that it should probably be merged into <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">Podcast</a> with <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godcast.html" title="Godcast">Godcast</a> redirecting there. (i.e. - give Godcast it's own section in Podcast for now). —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 13:09, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I think Femmina was referring to the lack of proper formatting of the external links inside the article body (see <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#How_to_link" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External_links#How to link</a>) and the "coming..." part. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 13:03, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It has already been shown that this is no longer a neologism. When Business Week, The Guardian, CNN and countless others are using the term in headlines, the term has clearly entered mainstream usage and is not a neologism. Let the article have sufficient time to be expanded so your vote will no longer be ill-informed. CentrOS 09:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Religious beliefs or lack thereof must not be used to determine the important of an article. Godcasting is a social phenomena and rightly deserves a record in the Wikipedia. CentrOS 09:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If the problem is that "Godcasting" is a not yet established neologism, it could be moved to Religious podcasting or Religion and podcasting, and moved back later if the term spreads.

<li>Maybe I can't read as good as I used to, so help me here– I see two "undelete and relist" and a lone "relist" (so effectively three people asking that it be relisted on AFD). One was an "overturn/undelete", and two were "keep deleted". And as I said above, this gives CentrOS a chance to see if it'll even be kept <b>before</b> he spends time trying to improve it. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 17:11, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I looked into this. Firstly alexa collects info via their browser toolbar. Podcasts are not downloaded or even searched for via a browser but by a podcatcher such as iTunes. An alexa rank is therefore of little use in determining their value in this case. CentrOS 05:52, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This was recreated as the result of a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>, and therefore not a #G4 speedy (as explicitly set out in #G4). --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 20:13, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, there are sources.

<li>lol christianity what, that's not what I was talking about. Nobody cares how many lycos hits it got in December, that's not something that belongs in an encyclopedia article, and I presume it isn't some kind of all time internet record that is notable by itself. The whole article is basically talking about how popular it is, it has like 2 lines of information apart from that. Which could be merged into another article. The article simply has no substance. Imagine if all articles on wikipedia were 80% about how many search engine hits something has and where it was mentioned in the press. Tapir 22:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The article has just been created, and as I have asked repeatedly for time to write a good entry. The reason the figures are there and predominant right now is because it was initially questioned wether Godcasting has sufficient interest to warrant a full article. i have clearly shown there is, now let me fill in with more content please. CentrOS 22:24, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point is that you should prove notability in the talk page or on the VfD, just like people do in other articles that are voted for deletion, not just dump it all in the article itself to hide the lack of useful information. Tapir 22:34, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Article consists almost entirely of references scraped together in an attempt to show how big, important, and deserving of a Wikipedia article "Godcasting" is.

<li><b>Keep</b> with rewrite. Bear in mind as you consider my opinion that I'm the guy who coined the term. It's been in use, however, since the end of October, 2004 (only a few months after "podcasting" was coined) and is now widely accepted by both the media and the general public as the term used to refer to any type of religious podcast. And while it's true that news.google.com currently points to only 10 active references in the media as someone else pointed out (two of which are CNN and UPI), it has been referenced in hundreds of online and print articles over the past 14 months, starting with TIME Magazine in 12/04. So while I agree with those who argue that the entry needs to be rewritten from its current form, I don't buy into the argument that the term remains a neologism.

<li>Well, assuming he's referring to CPatchett, it's the very first sentence after his 'vote'. But that's neither here nor there, as he's made no contribution to the article.

<li>For what it's worth, I sort-of agree; as mentioned above, I think this should be merged/redirected into <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">Podcast</a> with it's own section perhaps (depends on what the editors at <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">Podcast</a> support I suppose).

<li>Zoe, I've already said a disproportionate amount on this particular article, but I find this comment close to indefensible. What does it matter what an editor chooses to contribute to? If he'd done some copyediting or edited established articles that would have nothing to do with the worth of this article. Agenda?

<li>Gee, I don't know, telling people that their votes to keep the article deleted don't count, then when those voters object, they're told "eat me?" <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:41, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's not evidence of an agenda (apart from trying to keep your own work on Wikipedia if you think it doesn't violate policy, which I would have thought we all have), that's ignorance of process and incivility.
