<p>I have no real opinion on the notability or other merits (or lack thereof) of this project, although "47 contributors" is not exactly indicative of a high notability. This renomination is motivated by guideline compliance: per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, "The article itself must provide proof that its subject meets one of [the notability] criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section". This article neither formulates a claim to notability (valid per WP:WEB or otherwise), nor does it back up any such claim with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. In fact, it has no non-primary sources of any kind, making it also subject to deletion under <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>/<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as applied concurrently with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</p>
<p>This situation has not been alleviated since the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wikinfo_9784.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wikinfo">first AfD discussion in July 2006</a>. The prevailing argument then was something like that: Wikinfo is notable because it is a notable Wikipedia fork. This is unpersuasive, because it involves <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reasoning.html" title="Circular reasoning">circular reasoning</a> and has no bearing on the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It was also argued that WP:WEB doesn't apply because Wikinfo is "notable not as a website, but as an open source project fork of a very notable project". This also fails to persuade, because whatever its content or subject, Wikinfo is still a website and as such subject to WP:WEB.</p>
<p>Those wishing to argue that the article should be kept because Wikinfo is of significance to the Wikipedia project or to (some of) its contributors, please consider: In the light of <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>, this should not be a consideration when assessing the notability of <i>encyclopedic content</i>. If the text is somehow relevant to our project (which it may well be), it should be moved to the Wikipedia: namespace.</p>
<p>Since the first nomination seems to have been initiated by a vandal's sockpuppet, I should probably also mention that I am not she or he, and have not been in any way involved with this article until reading it by chance, today. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:13, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've found any AfD concerning a Wikipedia fork or other Wikimedia project inherently gets a lot "Of course it's notable, I've heard of it!" votes, which seem obviously biased, and this site is another one that simply does not seem to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I encourage people to remember that we don't keep articles simply because we can relate to the subject, but because they meet established and agreed upon inclusion guidelines. Please present evidence that Wikinfo has recieved meaningful third party coverage. Blurbs and mentions here and there really do not an article make, and all I've found in searching 2 good academic search engines are a small number of blurbs that say no more than "Wikinfo is a fork of WP". --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 20:32, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Move</b>. As a contributor to the article, I have an obvious conflict of interest, and I appreciate the nominator's notification to me about the AfD. But the circularity counter-argument honestly doesn't persuade me. Fred Bauder's Wikinfo effort to fork from Wikipedia with a different point of view inevitably borrows some of Wikipedia's own notability. I would note that we have articles on <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a>, a predecessor to Wikipedia which doesn't even exist any more, and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>, a planned fork of Wikipedia that doesn't even exist yet. Of course, the nominator might argue that we should get rid of those articles as well, or move them to the Wikipedia namespace. I would reply that these articles also borrow their notability from the relationship to Wikipedia, as do articles on criticism/parody sites like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitruth.html" title="Wikitruth">Wikitruth</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a>. As for the possible move to Wikipedia namespace, I wouldn't have any objection for all Wikipedia-related articles, as long as a newbie coming to the encyclopedia was directed to the article after simply typing Wikinfo into the box. But this might start overloading Wikipedia space with items that look exactly like what they are: general-interest encyclopedia articles. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 20:39, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Edit-conflict...While I know that Google searches get discounted in these debates, I was rather surprised to see the size of Wikinfo's search footprint. This effort to fork from Wikipedia with a different editorial approach has been widely noted and discussed on the web. So it's not just a case of the article borrowing notability from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 20:47, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> By extension of your argument, every fork, mirror or copy of Wikipedia would be notable by way of "borrowing" notability. So how about I start an article on the copy of the Wikipedia database I downloaded today? Humor aside, obviously any subject must have some notability <i>of its own</i>, which is precisely what is utterly non-apparent in this case (but maybe you could remedy that by adding these web sources you mention to the article?). As to <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitruth.html" title="Wikitruth">Wikitruth</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a>, their notability is not at issue here; we don't keep articles just because others have not (yet) been deleted. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 21:06, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. To be honest, if you downloaded and started updating a complete copy of the Wikipedia database, your effort <i>would</i> be more notable than <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>, which doesn't even exist yet. Anyway, your suggested compromise of a move to Wikipedia space seems workable. After all, the distinction between article space and Wikipedia space means nothing to most casual users of the encyclopedia. (Truth to tell, it doesn't mean much to me. I really don't care if I see "Wikinfo" or "Wikipedia:Wikinfo" at the top of an article, as long as the article is accurate and comprehensive.) I would only suggest that <i>all</i> wikipedia-related articles—which after all borrow their notability from the parent project, because almost nobody would ever have heard of <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitruth.html" title="Wikitruth">Wikitruth</a> if Wikipedia weren't such a big presence on the Web—also be moved for consistency's sake. Otherwise, we get into endless hair-splitting exercises as to which Wikipedia-related projects have somehow achieved enough notability on their own. Also, casual users should be re-directed to these articles when they type "Wikitruth" or "Wikinfo" into the box on the main Wikipedia page. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 21:36, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>None of this has adressed whether there's been third party coverage by reliable sources. Notability is only "inherited" if people care enough to write about a site because of it's relationship to a notable site, e.g. some in the media wrote about WikiTruth because of it's relationship to Wikipedia. These basically ammount to arguments that Wikinfo is notable <i>to us</i> but not really to anyone not in the community, which is textbook bias. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 22:52, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>As I said, I was surprised by the number of web comments I found on Wikinfo. See <a href="http://develop.consumerium.org/wiki/Wikinfo" class="external text" title="http://develop.consumerium.org/wiki/Wikinfo" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://lorenzen.blogspot.com/2004/02/wikinfo-this-is-another-volunteer.html" class="external text" title="http://lorenzen.blogspot.com/2004/02/wikinfo-this-is-another-volunteer.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.bruceeisner.com/new_culture/2004/09/wikinfo_a_new_i.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bruceeisner.com/new_culture/2004/09/wikinfo_a_new_i.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://lp.greenparty.ca/tiki-index.php?page=Wikinfo" class="external text" title="http://lp.greenparty.ca/tiki-index.php?page=Wikinfo" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/hamlet/" class="external text" title="http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/hamlet/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for instance. I'll admit most of these are brief mentions that only define the site, quote its mission, and offer a few comments. But it's not like the site has gone unnoticed. Once again, the nominator's proposed compromise of a move to Wikipedia space is fine with me, along with a redirect. Seeing the article at "Wikipedia:Wikinfo" instead of just plain "Wikinfo" wouldn't bother me at all. Beyond Wikinfo, I think we might avoid a lot of storm and stress if we did similar moves on many other articles which are only notable because Wikipedia is notable. We might even save <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Beesley_5b39.html" title="Angela Beesley">Angela Beesley</a> some heartburn. As an aside, I recently did a lot of work on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>, an article which is notable <i>solely</i> because Wikipedia is notable. There's another obvious candidate for a move to Wikipedia space. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 00:08, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But there's been meaningful criticism of Wikipedia published by reliable sources, hence we have something to write the article on... so that article isn't simply notable because it's about Wikipedia. I think you're missing the point... we include articles on a given topic because there's published, reliable information to use... not because we like the topic, or personally feel it's important, and so on. Keeping or deleting articles based solely on how important something is to us is inherently going to lead to bias. Most websites are somehow tied to something that's notable (e.g. a forum for fans of the TV Show <i>Lost</i>, or a chat room discussing the C++ programming language), the existance of many of these sites has probably mentioned on a blog or two, but that doesn't mean they get articles. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 00:19, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I guess I am missing the point, because there's plenty of published, reliable information on Wikinfo. I just reread the article, and it all looks like reliable, published information to me. I mean, we're not talking about a hoax or an unknown subject here. Whatever anybody may think of Fred Bauder as a Wikipedia admin and arbcom member, I don't think he's running a spurious or unverifiable site. If some of the third-party comments are to be believed—and I see no reason why they shouldn't be trusted as honest expressions of opinion, whether I agree with the opinions or not—some observers think Wikinfo might have a thing or three to teach Wikipedia. Anyway, why don't we just compromise and move the article to Wikipedia space? Then we can sidestep all the abstruse arguments about notability, which so often trail off into subjective opinion and metaphysical distinctions. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 00:32, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Blogs and so on are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>... the only thing I've found published in anything other than random websites have just been blurbs. I've never encountered Mr. Bauder or Wikinfo (beyond just seeing his work on ArbCom, which incidently I appreciate) so I am not attacking the site or him or anything, merely trying to uniformly apply concepts of article inclusion standards, as I've done before with other articles. As for the move, I don't really oppose that if people want it. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 00:44, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Okay, we agree! Let's move the article. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 00:50, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Could you clarify your bolded opinion, then? If we're going to move the article to projectspace, we're going to delete the page in articlespace, as we don't keep cross-namespace redirects. Your current post says "Keep or move" which amounts to "Keep or delete". --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 01:11, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with what W.marsh and Sam Blanning said. I just would like to point out that just moving it to Wikipedia:Wikinfo isn't going to help very much, especially because of the no-cross-namespace-redirect thing, but also because we ought to find it some useful place in the context of the Wikipedia: namespace. My proposal is we move it to <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_Vwxyz_6ff9.html#Wikinfo_.28wiki.29" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks/Vwxyz">Wikipedia:Mirrors_and_forks/Vwxyz#Wikinfo (wiki)</a>, where the appropriate formatting changes can then be made. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 06:27, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Okay, move it to the mirrors and forks list in Wikipedia space. A casual user will probably never find the material. But the search function is picking up <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_Vwxyz_6ff9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks/Vwxyz">Wikipedia:Mirrors_and_forks/Vwxyz</a> on the third page of a Wikipedia space search for "Wikinfo", so a determined user will be able to find the information. I'm not sure why this stuff has to be tucked into such an out-of-the-way corner, but I don't object to the proposed move. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 09:04, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One more point: over a hundred articles in the main space link to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>. Often it's the acknowledgment tag: "This article incorporates material from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> article", or "Adapted from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> article." We probably don't want all those links going red, which would look pretty strange in acknowledgement blurbs. So we'll have to make sure there's a link to <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_Vwxyz_6ff9.html#Wikinfo_.28wiki.29" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks/Vwxyz">Wikipedia:Mirrors_and_forks/Vwxyz#Wikinfo (wiki)</a> once the information is moved there. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 13:59, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> There seems to be a campaign to remove both this article and <a href="../../../g/e/t/GetWiki_cbd5.html" title="GetWiki">GetWiki</a> from Wikipedia. I say "campaign" because both these articles have been nominated at around the same time. I believe the reasons are obvious, but I will leave it to others to figure for themselves why this is happening. I have explained my reasons for keeping at the other (GetWiki) <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_GetWiki_e666.html#.5B.5BGetWiki.5D.5D" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/GetWiki">AfD</a>. IMHO, these actions have been made in extremely bad faith as this particular article was nominated just a number of weeks ago and the result was an <b><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wikinfo_9784.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wikinfo">obvious keep</a></b>. This AfD should be thrown out at once and the nominator sanctioned. Metaspheres 10:02, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> before making any such accusations, thank you. What happened is that I read the GetWiki AfD, clicked on the Wikinfo link someone provided there, noticed that it failed WP:WEB and decided to nominate it for deletion also. No sinister conspiracy against you here, whoever you may be, I'm sorry to say. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 11:30, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per my belief that this is a historically important wiki. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> is a guideline, not a suicide pact. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 23:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The consensus of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wikinfo_9784.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wikinfo">first AfD discussion</a> was: failure to fulfill <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not relevant, as this article is not primarily about a website but about an important fork of an important project. This has not changed. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 03:26, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a> isn't even up and running yet, but it has its own page.

<li><b>Delete</b> - There are no reliable sources for this. Just because you've heard of something doesn't mean it meets the requirements for verifiability and reliable sources. Until someone provides an outside source, I don't see how this can be kept (no, blogs and trivial links are <i>not</i> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>). Never before have I seen such a large number of editors have no regard for verifiability. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 14:55, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> per consensus. It is a notable piece of history concerning Wikipedia itself, and the significant user <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/t/GetWiki_cbd5.html" title="GetWiki">GetWiki</a> is also up for AFD, which is connected to this history, and having the two as one article would still preserve this piece of history. <a href="../../../i/n/m/User%7EInmatarian_fe79.html" title="User:Inmatarian">Inmatarian</a> 17:36, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And that's the whole problem with this AfD - the people voting "keep" are confusing notability within the Wikimedia projects with actual, real-world notability. While I won't dispute the notability of Fred Bauder or Wikinfo in the context of Wikipedia and associated projects, there's probably a reason we don't have an <i>encyclopedia article</i> on Fred Bauder - it's because per <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>, we don't just translate Wikipedia importance to real-world (or encyclopedic) notability. It's very regrettable that few of the people contributing to this discussion are addressing this problem. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 05:23, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, then we agree that it's an important piece of Wiki's own history and should be kept, just that it needs to be seperated from <i>Real World</i> information and placed within Wiki's own internal information. I guess that means a Rename, perhaps to Wikipedia:Wikinfo. <a href="../../../i/n/m/User%7EInmatarian_fe79.html" title="User:Inmatarian">Inmatarian</a> 17:20, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
