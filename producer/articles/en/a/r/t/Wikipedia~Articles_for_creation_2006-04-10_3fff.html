<p>The Pashtuns (also Pushtun, Pakhtun (Persian: پختون) (Urdu: پشتون ), ethnic Afghan, or Pathan) are an ethno-linguistic group living primarily in the North West Frontier Province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, and the eastern and southern parts of Afghanistan. They also constitute almost half of the total population of the Baluchistan province of Pakistan. Additionally, smaller colonies can be found in the Northern Areas of Pakistan as well as Azad Kashmir. There are thought to be about 3 million in the city of Karachi, 1 million in twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi and an additional million in Lahore. There are twice the number of Pashtuns living in Pakistan compared to Afghanistan. There are smaller communities in Iran and India, and a large migrant worker community in the countries of the Arabian Peninsula. The Pashtuns are typically characterized by their language, their pre-Islamic indigenous code of honor and culture Pashtunwali, and adherence to Islam. The Pashtuns are the world's largest segmentary lineage (patriarchal) tribal group in existence. The total population of the group is estimated to be over 40 million, but an accurate count remains difficult to verify as there has not been an official census in Afghanistan since the 1970s, while in Pakistan, due to the migratory nature of many Pashtun tribes as well as the practice of secluding women, exact figures are to hard to attain</p>

<p>The state was established in 1724 by the Afghan Sardar Dost Mohammed Khan and (His Brothr Sarder Mir Ahmed Khan), Sardar Dost Mohammed Khan was a commander in the Mughal army posted at Mangalgarh (which lies to the north of the modern city of Bhopal). Taking advantage of the disintegration of the Mughal empire, he usurped Mangalgarh and Berasia (now a tehsil of the Bhopal District). When Dost Mohammed Khan's nephew assassinated the Gond Queen Kamalapati's husband, he executed his own nephew and restored the Queen's little kingdom back to her. The Queen gave him a princely sum of money and the Mouza village (which is situated near the modern Bhopal city). After the death of last Gond queen, Dost Mohammed Khan took and seized the little Gond Kingdom and established his capital 10 km away from modern Bhopal, at Jagdishpur. He named his capital as Islamnagar (meaning the city of Islam). He built a small fort and some palaces at Islamnagar, the ruins of which can be seen even today. After few years, he built a bigger fort situated on the northern bank of the Upper Lake. He named this new fort as Fatehgarh (the fort of victory). Later the capital was shifted to the current city of Bhopal. Early rulers Although Dost Mohammed Khan was the virtual ruler of Bhopal, he still acknowledged the suzerainty of the declining Mughal Empire. His successors however, acquired the title of "Nawab" and declared Bhopal an independent state. By the 1730's the Marathas were expanding into the region, and Dost Mohammed Khan and his successors fought wars with their neighbours to protect the small territory and also fought among themselves for control of the state. The Hindu Marathas conquered several nearby states, including Indore to the west and Gwalior to the north, but Bhopal remained a Muslim-ruled state under Dost Mohammed Khan's successors. Subsequently, Nawab Wazir Mohammed Khan, a general, created a truly strong state after fighting several wars. Nawab Jehangir Mohammed Khan established a cantonment at a distance of one mile from the fort. This was called Jehangirabad after him. He built gardens and barracks for British guests and soldiers in Jehangirabad. In 1778, during the First Anglo-Maratha War, when the British General Thomas Goddard campaigned across India, Bhopal was one of the few states that remained friendly to the British. In 1809, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, General Close led a British expedition to Central India. The Nawab of Bhopal petitioned in vain to be received under British protection. In 1817, when the Third Anglo-Maratha War broke out, a treaty of dependence was signed between the British Government of India and the Nawab of Bhopal. Bhopal remained a friend of British Government during the British Raj in India. In 1818, Bhopal became a princely state in British India. Bhopal state included the present-day Bhopal, Raisen, and Sehore districts, and was part of the Central India Agency. It straddled the Vindhya Range, with the northern portion lying on the Malwa plateau, and the southern portion lying in the valley of the Narmada River, which formed the state's southern boundary. Bhopal Agency was formed as an administrative section of Central India, consisting the Bhopal state and some princely states to the northeast, including Khilchipur, Narsingarh, Raigarh, and after 1931 the Dewas states. It was administered by an agent to the British Governor-General of India.</p>
<p>A princely state is any state under the reign of a prince (so a principality taken in the broad sense). The term refers not just to monarchs of sovereign nations, but also various high nobles (often vassals) heading lower, often feudal, polities; they may really rule, or be reduced in power, as under colonial indirect rule, sometimes becoming mere figureheads.</p>
<p>In English, the term "princely state" generally only refers to a historical native state of the British Empire under an autochthonous princely house, while the term principality is preferred for analogous western feudal units.</p>
<p>Historically there were hundreds of native states of the former British India and in some other parts of the British Empire (mainly under the chartered British East India Company). These states were mostly brought into the British colonial sphere of influence by the East India Company, and after 1858 formally under the British crown, which assumed the role of paramount ruler and the title of Emperor of India as political (not dynastic) self-declared heir to the Padshah i-Hind of the former Mughal dynasty.</p>
<p>Unlike the British Provinces of India — such as Bengal, Punjab, Bombay, Madras, Central Provinces, United Provinces, etc. — which were ruled directly by the British government, rulers of princely states had treaty arrangements directly with the British Monarch. These treaties allowed a degree of local autonomy and each state had its own laws, languages, holidays, ministers, and princely ruler, but each was under British protection and so was essentially a vassal state.</p>
<p>At the time of independence in 1947 a few hundred (various sources give significantly different numbers, depending on various criteria and probably incomplete listing) such states existed in British India. Nearly 680 states were represented in a special chamber of the Indian legislative assembly called the Chamber of Princes.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-10_3fff.html" title="Edit section: Princely status and titles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Princely status and titles</span></h3>
<p>The Indian rulers bore various titles — including Maharaja ("great king"), Badshah and Raja ("king"), Nawab ("governor"), Nizam, Wali, and many other. Whatever the literal meaning and traditional prestige of the ruler's actual title, the British government translated them all as "prince," in order to avoid the implication that the native rulers could be "kings" with status equal to that of the British monarch.</p>
<p>The least prestigious Hindu rulers often used the title Thakur or its variant Thakore.</p>
<p>More prestigious Hindu rulers -mostly existing before the Mughal Empire, or having split from such old states- often used the title "Raja," or a variant such as "Rana," "Rao," "Rawat" or "Rawal." Also in this 'class' were several Thakur sahibs and a few particular titles, such as Sar Desai.</p>
<p>The most prestigious Hindu rulers usually had the prefix "maha" ("great", compare for example Grand duke) in their titles, as in Maharaja, Maharana, Maharao, etc.</p>
<p>There were also compound titles, such as (Maha)rajadhiraj, Raj-i-rajgan, often relics from an elaborate system of hierarchical titles under the Mughal emperors. For example, the addition of the adjective Bahadur raised the status of the titleholder one level.</p>
<p>The Sikh princes (a syncretic religion, mixing many elements from Hinduism and Islam; politically concentrated in Punjab) usually adopted Hindu type titles when attaining princely rank; at a lower level Sardar was used.</p>
<p>Muslim rulers almost all used the title "Nawab" (originally the title of an amovable governor under real Mughal rule, but soon tending to hereditary succession whenever Delhi/Agra lost effective control over the province) with the prominent exceptions of the Nizam of Hyderabad &amp; Berar, the Wali/Khan of Kalat, and the Wali of Swat. Other less usual titles included Darbar Sahib, Dewan, Jam, Mehtar (unique to Chitral) and Mir (from Emir).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-10_3fff.html" title="Edit section: Nawab">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nawab</span></h3>
<p>Nawab (Urdu: نواب ) was originally the subadar (provincial governor) or viceroy of a subah (province) or region of the Mughal empire.</p>
<p>The term is Urdu, derived from the Arabic word naib, meaning deputy. In some areas, especially Bengal, the term is pronounced Nabob. This later variation has entered the English and other foreign languages, see below.</p>
<p>Since most of the Muslim rulers of the subcontinent had -like most otherwise titled Hindu (maha)radjas and other princely states- accepted the authority of the Mughals at the height of this empire the term Nawab is often used to refer to any Muslim ruler in the subcontinent. This is technically imprecise, as it was also awarded to others and not applied to every Muslim ruler. With the decline of that empire, the title and the powers that went with it became hereditary in the ruling families in the various provinces.</p>
<p>Many Nawabs later accepted British rule. Under later British rule, Muslim Nawabs continued to rule various princely states of Awadh, Bahawalpur, Baoni, Banganapalle, Bhopal, Cambay, Jaora, Junagadh, Kalabagh, Kurnool, Kurwai, Palanpur (Pakistan), Pataudi, Rampur, Sachin, and Tonk. Other former rulers bearing the title, such as the Nawabs of Bengal, had been dispossessed by the British or others by the time the Mughal dynasty finally ended in 1857.</p>
<p>The style for a Nawab dynasty's queen(s) (usually his consort, and Islam is polygamous) is Begum (not specific). Most of the Nawab dynasties were male primogenitures, although several ruling Begums of Bhopal were a notable exception.</p>
<p>Before the incorporation of India into the British Empire, Nawabs ruled the kingdoms of Awadh (or Oudh, encouraged by the British to shed the Mughal suzereignty and assume the imperial style of Badshah), Bengal, Arcot and Bhopal.</p>
<p>A few of the Muslim rulers who were tributary to the Mughal emperors used other titles; the first Nizam of Hyderabad was given the alternative title Nizam ul Mulk, usually translated as Governor of the [Mughal] Kingdom.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-10_3fff.html" title="Edit section: Nawabzada">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nawabzada</span></h3>
<p>This style, adding the Persian suffix -zada which means son (or other male descendants; see other cases in Prince), (etymo)logically fits a Nawab's sons, but in actual practice various dynasties established other customs.</p>
<p>For example in Bahawalpur only the Nawab's Heir Apparent used Nawabzada before his personal name, then Khan Abassi, finally Wali Ahad Bahadur (an enhancement of Wali Ehed), while the other sons of the ruling Nawab surprising used the (hindi!) style Sahibzada before the personal name and only Khan Abassi behind.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, rulers who were not styled nawab yet awarded a title nawabzada.</p>
<p>In colloquial usage in English (since 1612), adopted in other Western languages, the corrupted form nabob (never officially awarded, but homophononous with the Bengali pronunciation) was erroneously used in stead of Nawab, but also since 1764 to refer to commoners: a merchant leader of high social status and wealth, or a capitalist. It can also be used metaphorically for people who have a grandiose style or manner of speech, as in Spiro Agnew's famous dismissal of the press as "nattering nabobs of negativism.</p>

<p>In British India in feudal and colonial times, Sahib was also a formal style, used on its own or as an additional title, for native aristocrats, including rulers of some princely states and/or certain members of their dynasties.</p>

<p>(This list may well be incomplete; gun salutes mentioned are as in 1947, some may be the result of one or more promotions)</p>
<p>Maharaja Jam Sahib was unique to the rather major princely state (13-gun salute) of Nawanagar Maharaja Raj Sahib of the rather minor Gujurati salute states of Dhrangadhra-Halvad (13-gun salute) and Maharana Raj Sahib of Wankaner (11-gun salute) Maharaja Rana Sahib of the rather major princely state (13-gun salute) Porbandar Thakur sahib was significantly rarer and higher than Thakur (often below the status of princely state, never a gun salute), being used for several minor salute states (9 guns, the lowest class in India, until independence excluded from the style His Highness): Dhrol, Limbdi, Palitana and Rajkot</p>

<p>In various dynasties, members of certain genealogical rank were awarded various combinations of additional styles, in se not their rank, which may include sahib. This could even happen in a Muslim dynasty, e.g. sons of the ruling Nawab of Junagadh used Nawabzada before their personal name, then Khanji and the father's name, finally Sahib.</p>
<p>Again this could be combined titles:</p>
<p>Sahib-i-Jah "Lord, or Possessor of Dignity" was a title of the ruling Nawab of Baoni.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="Sahibzada" id="Sahibzada"></a></p>

<p>This derivation using the Persian suffix -zada(h), literally 'son (or further male descendant; compare Shahzada) of a Sahib', was also (part of) the formal style for some princes of the blood of Muslim dynasties, e.g.:</p>
<p>the sons of a ruling nawab of Arcot(the head of the family; political pensioners, the only princely title still recognized by the Indian Republic) are styled: Sahibzada (personal name) Khan Bahadur (so not the more logical nawabzada!) in Bahawalpur, in Pakistan, the younger sons of the ruling Nawab/Amir are styled: Sahibzada (personal name) Khan Abassi; but the Heir Apparent: Nawabzada (personal name) Khan Abassi, Wali Ahad Bahadur in Baoni, the younger sons and other male descendants of the ruling Nawab, in the male line, were styled Sahibzada (personal name) Khan Bahadur, while the Heir Apparent was: Nawabzada (personal name) Khan, Wali Ahad Bahadur; either could be personally promoted to Nawab in Bhopal, the grandsons of the ruling Nawab were styled: Sahibzada (personal name) Khan, while the Heir Apparent was the Wali Ahad Bahadur, the younger sons: Nawab (personal name) Khan Bahadur in Jaoroa, more distant male relatives of the ruling Nawab then the sons (who were Nawabzada) were styled: Sahibzada (personal name) Khan in Khudadad, Tippu Sultan's Muslim empire, the grandsons and other male descendants of the sovereign Padshah bahadur were styled: Sahibzada (personal name), until in 1860 the colonial Indian Government extended to them the existing style for sons of the ruling Nawab: Shahzada (personal name) Sahib in Malerkotla, where the Heir Apparent was Nawabzada (personal name) Khan Bahadur, the younger sons of the ruling Nawab were styled: Sahibzada (personal name) Khan Bahadur in Savanur, where sons of the ruling Nawab were Nawabzada, the other male descendants in the male line: Sahibzada (personal name) Khan Sahib, and the more remote male descendants of the ruler: Sardar (personal name) Khan Sahib. This could be further combined, e.g.:</p>
<p>in Hyderabad, the great, mainly Muslim state of the Nizam, every son of the ruler was fully styled Walashan Nawab (personal title), Sahibzada Mir (personal name) Khan Bahadur; in the case of the Heir Apparent, all this was followed by The Prince of Berar, with the style of His Highness, normally reserved for ruling princes with at least an 11 (later 9) guns-salute; in Loharu, where the Heir Apparent was Nawabzada Mirza (personal name) Khan, both the younger sons, and male descendants, of a ruling Nawab, in the male line, were styled: Sahibzada Mirza (personal name) Khan. in Murshidabad (present title-seat of the royal house of Bengal), the other sons and male descendants of the reigning Nawab, in the male line: Sahibzada Sayyid (personal name) Mirza; in Sachin, the grandsons and other male descendants of the ruling Nawab, in the male line were styled: Sahibzada Sidi (personal name) Khan Bahadur, while the Heir Apparent was Nawabzada Sidi (personal name) Khan Bahadur, Wali Ahad Sahib, and the other sons: Nawabzada Sidi (personal name) Khan Bahadur.</p>

This is not suprising considering that she has obtained Grades 1, 2 and 3 in English Classical Singing.</p>

<p>Nuala Fennell (born: Dublin, 1937) was a former T.D. (member of the Irish Parliament) for Fine Gael in Dublin South and the first ever Minister for Womens' Affairs in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>Prior to entering political life, she worked as a journalist. She is a founding member of AIM (a family mediation, counselling and legal advice service) and Women's Aid, and she has been to the fore in many areas of social campaigning. She has also conducted political workshops in Africa and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>A strong feminist and a leading light in the Irish womens' movement of the late 1960's, she entered politics in the 1970's, along with other idealistic feminists such as Monica Barnes and Gemma Hussey. Elected Fine Gael TD in Dublin South at the General Election of 1981, she was subsequently re-elected in both the February and November elections of 1982. Appointed Minister of State at the Department of An Taoiseach with special responsibility for Womens' Affairs by then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald in November 1982, she was always hampered in her brief by a miniscule budget forced on her by the enormous economic strains the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition had to deal with in the mid-1980's. A huge national debt, massive unemployment and the 'Troubles' in Northern Ireland meant that womens' issues were often eclipsed.</p>
<p>Nuala Fennell identified herself with the 'social democratic' wing of Fine Gael and the ideology of the Taoiseach, Dr.FitzGerald. This was broadly centre-left and in contrast to the 'christian democratic' or small 'c' conservative wing of the party (dominant up to the mid 1980's) as espoused by former Taosieach, Liam Cosgrave and social conservatives such as Oliver J.Flanagan and Alice Glenn. She was strongly supportive of FitzGerald's 'Constitutional Crusade' to make the Republic more attractive to Ulster Protestants and opposed the proposed constitutional amendment to ban abortion in 1983. She supported attempts to end the Republic's ban on Divorce and was bitterly disappointed when this was rejected at a referendum in 1986.</p>
<p>In 1987, Nuala Fennell lost her seat in Dublin South and Fianna Fail returned to office with a minority government led by Charles Haughey. Her junior ministry for Womens' Affairs was abolished as part of an extensive programme of budget cutbacks needed to establish 'fiscal rectitude'.</p>
<p>She made a comeback in the General Election of 1989, taking the last seat in Dublin South, but decided to retire from politics in 1992.</p>
<p>Nuala Fennell established Political Communications Limited in 1993. She is currently Chairperson of the Irish Parliamentary Society, the organisation representing former members of parliament.</p>

<p>When Berkely talks about perceotual relativity as a reaction to Locke's ideas of things having all perceotual qualities in themselves, then what he means to say is that every human being percieves anything according to his or her own subjective opinion. Someone who is small might see a large thing as extremely large while same thing might seem to be smaller to an even larger being. This is how he proposes that sensory qualities do not lie in the things in themselves rather they lie in the mind of the perciever!</p>

<p>Graham High School, located at 1 Glynn Carlock Drive in Bluefield, Virginia, is the high school for the Bluefield, VA area. Graham High School relocated to its current location in the late 1950s, following a fire at a previous location in Bluefield, Virginia. Graham High School is most widely known for its athletic successes. The Graham High School football team, coached for 32 years by the late Glynn Carlock, captured state championships in football in 1989 and 1995, as well as making an appearance to the state championship game in 2001. Additionally, Graham High School won the Virginia State football championship in 1962. Graham High School athletes, under the mascot G-Men (for Government-Men), also have competed at the state level in several other sports and academic competitions, including State Drama, Forensics, and the YMCA Model General Assembly. Graham High School is one of four schools in Tazewell County, Virginia. The other schools in Tazewell County include Tazewell High School, Pocahontas High School, and Richlands High School. John O'Neal is the current principal of Graham High School. Deidra Hill is the assistant principal and Doug Marrs is the current athletic director.
