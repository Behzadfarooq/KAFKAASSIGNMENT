<li>you should first look into the new concept before you call this pseudo. I offer a new unification mechanism that explains for example the spacetime dynamics that bring QM packages. I offer a strong and bulletproof engineering mechanism as an alternative to uncertainty. On holons: for the first time someone develops a "real" concept on the CREATION of holons and you want to delete it. That's really scientific inquisition. Why not delete every thread on holons? If you judge it self-promoting tell me which parts and let's discuss what to delete.User:Mu6</li>

<li>Tarquin, can you tell me about Einstein's deformations of spacetime? Can you tell me about the difference between closed and open-end strings ... and explain me WHY gravity is not embedded into a open-end strings. It should. I offer a real - ONE postulate - unification system. Have you checked my website? Do you judge without checking? You call yourself a scientist? Then you check it. <a href="http://www.mu6.com" class="external free" title="http://www.mu6.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mu6.com</a> . Then tell me about my illogic. You just voted for ignorance. About acceptance by other scientists ... how much ... before it is truth or accepted? I wrote about 150 patents and I am only interested in reality. Some of my creation sold more then 150 million pieces. How much creations you have made? If you consider yourself being a real scientist, don't act with prejudice and ... go and check that website!&#160;;-) User:Mu6
<ul>
<li>That's a bit rich, a qualified political scientist trying to pull rank on Tarquin over physics. Check out Mu6's understanding of superstring theory, displayed <a href="http://www.mu6.com/stringtheory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mu6.com/stringtheory.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. He points out the fatal problems with string theory: "Have you ever heard the 'sound' of an un-connected violin string? I mean a string that is NOT connected to the wooden violin body? No sound, nor vibration at all!

A growing number of people judge it very important, also some people in microtubulines in brains. Also some famous Buddhist very closed to the Dalai Lama are very intrigued about my new approach. You tell me what consciousness is? Explain me. If you can't - or need QM HUP - I understand that ignorance is important to you. You want to ban me from WIKI? OK ... Wiki is not the world.

<li>Mu6: Does this theory allow one to make any testable predictions that other theories do not? Have any articles about it been published in peer-reviewed journals? In what way does the theory relate physical measurements to one another, or explain them? What can you <i>do</i> with it? <a href="../../../t/u/a/User%7ETualha_bd83.html" title="User:Tualha">Tualha</a> 23:13, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete. Original research. It also seems that mu6 is the originator of this idea, if this is his website <a href="http://www.mu6.com/reincarnation.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mu6.com/reincarnation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mu6.com/reincarnation.html</a> .--<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximus_Rex_f7db.html" title="User:Maximus Rex">Maximus Rex</a> 23:54, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tualha, (1) testable predictions. There are. I put a (non-public) webpage: <a href="http://www.mu6.com/prediction.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mu6.com/prediction.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mu6.com/prediction.html</a> about the non-spherical orbits of electrons. That's an anomaly. It show that something special is going on. Nobody really explains. My approach may give a solution. For the rest my approach confirms everything that is realized by experiments in Standard Model. On the level of String/M-brane theory is confirms that all is just vibration but I throw out all illogic. Strings are just little tubes produced by the membrane which then couple to new units. Then you get QM packages. Linde will call them monopoles, some will call them islands, and other will call them condensates (BEC). But these are all other names for the same. It are building-ups of the spacetime membrane. So Bohm's implicate order is explained but also QM and GR (General Relativity). It's essentially the same concept. Another prediction is that Voyager 2 and 1 will stop somewhere. They are not photo particles but earthly bound matter, and the Voyagers are not powered anymore. Another prediction would be the Alain Aspect tests on slides. The emission of photons or electrons is ruled by the moment of transmission. There is no something like photon with a free will or 'knowing' something from the other. They are just 'made' at the same moment and governed by the same gravitational field. No magic at all.</li>
</ul>

<dd>(2) No peer reviews. My interest in this field is no business related, neither making promotion into the scientific world. I am in other business. My major job is inventing puzzles but also solving puzzles, and the universal interconnectivity is one of them. I know the logic is bulletproof. If I would have the material of such unbreakable membrane I can build a universe myself ... and you could also!</dd>
<dd>(3) In what way does the theory relate physical measurements to one another, or explain them? Don't know if I understand well. Measurements are relative since the total system is continuously in motion. When we measure - in our degree of reality - it is correct. Reality exists between the actors which have the same level of resonance. The importance of my approach is that "gravity" is finally explained in a simple way. Gravity is the expression of the stretchability of the spacetime membrane. Till now people said: an object creates gravity! That is of course wrong. Gravity is an embedded property of an object. An object is restructured spacetime membrane and thus when we measure a relationship between two object it is the spacetime layer between them that is deformed (in Einstein's expression).</dd>
<dd>(4) What can you do with it? I can do a few things with it: explain LIFE, explain CONSCIOUSNESS, explain GRAVITY ... solving an essential problem in phylosophie (Nothing becomes locally someting), explain the creation of holons ... but of course everybody can do that ... as leading String theorists say: ... in 50 years!</dd>

<p>An example of Wiki's quality, please enjoy:</p>
<p>""Holon</p>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
<p>[edit] Holon is a city in Israel, on the central coastal strip, just south of Tel Aviv, and part of the metropolis known as Gush Dan. It has about 200,000 residents. Holon has the second biggest industrial zone in Israel after Haifa. The city hosts about half of the Samaritan community.</p>
<p>Mayors of Holon since its proclamation as a city in 1950:</p>
<p>Dr. Haim Kugel 1950-1953 Pinhas Eylon 1953-1987 Haim Sharon 1987-1988 Moshe Rom 1988-1993 Motti Sasson 1993-?</p>
<p>Holon's leading basketball club, Hapoel, returned to the National League (2nd Division) after dropping down two leagues in the two preceding seasons, from Ligat HaAl (Superleague) to the State League (3rd Division).</p>
<p>Holon's leading soccer club, Zafririm, has been roaming between Ligat HaAl (Superleague) and the National League (2nd Division) since 1990.</p>
<p>Holon used to host the annual Storytellers Festival, now held in Givatayim. It also hosts the Yeme Zemer (days of singing) festival annually."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is the above inaccurate in any way? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 01:01, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mu6 also selectively fails to cite the line at the bottom saying "for the philosophical concept, please see <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holons.html" title="Holons">holons</a>", which points to the appropriate article. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 01:04, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>That must be a cache problem on my computer Karada. On the history page of Holon you will see that I ADDED the link to holons, but that was afterwards deleted by someone. So I tried to INFORM the visitors in a correct way.</p>
<p>But the real scientific revelance of holons is surely expressed by: (quote): Holon's leading basketball club, Hapoel, returned to the National League (2nd Division) after dropping down two leagues in the two preceding seasons, from Ligat HaAl (Superleague) to the State League (3rd Division).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uh, hello *waves arms* - that article is about a city. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 01:16, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And HOLON is also a term in conceptual thinking about organizations and holism. Therefor I added a link to "holons". Someone deleted that and afterwards adapted my link. That's OK to me. That wasn't self-promoting. That was just an important informative link.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We probably should disambig those somehow, and change <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holons.html" title="Holons">Holons</a> to the singular. After this is settled, preferably, and it can be done in a stable fashion, so to speak. I note that <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holons.html" title="Holons">Holons</a> does have google hits, and the concept seems to exist outside of Mu6's theory. <a href="../../../t/u/a/User%7ETualha_bd83.html" title="User:Tualha">Tualha</a> 01:31, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's your baby, Tualha. Do the things you have to do. The holistic idea started about 80 years ago in South-Africa by a general called Jan Smuts. It was just an idea about interconnectivity. Later it was developed to holons as containing previous information. But till today ... there is NO concept behind. No mechanical design. That's what I offer. And it's not just a free idea ... it can be build in reality. More ... it is holistic reality. And that is a concept that goes more deeper and father then Wheeler, Smolin, Witten, Penrose, etc. I show it with logic and images. Pure logic. One postulate. QM has 20 or more, String has 20 or more ... to explain ... we don't know. I need only one ... and offering you what Uncle Albert was looking for. And ... you don't understand ... and refer to guru's like Wheeler, Smolin, Witten and Penrose. This is amazing to me ... you guys don't use your own independent thinking. Don't trust your own logic. Mama .. can I have a candy? Papa ... can I sing my song? Jezus ... become adult!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I do trust my own logic, and I can recognise nonsense when I see it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 01:56, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So Evercat you checked my website? Where is the non-sense? Please explain. If you don't explain to me ... that will show that you (1) didn't check my website or (2) you don't have arguments. So tell me about the non-sense, and maybe tell me also what gravity is, and what consciousness is and how life started. I am sure you figured out all these answers already. Probably the answer is God or G-d.</p>

<p>Thanks Evercat, at least I know you checked my site. 10 point extra! When spacetime couples the orientation of what tube is active or passive will be essential on the number of layers that will incorporated. That seems against common sense but just looking to the images will show you that. The difference between matter and energy is just a difference in density (the number of layers of spacetime membrane). The more layers ... the more mass a holon gets. The more layers a holon gets the less flexible. Mental taugths are just holons of different - less dense - structure. There is a general conservation of energy, and they are also vibration. The idea of hyperspaces is a general accepted approach (cfr. Michio Kaku).</p>

<p>Mu6: Regarding Pelastration, I am just informing you that you can post your theory at <a href="http://www.internet-encyclopedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.internet-encyclopedia.org/" rel="nofollow">www.internet-encyclopedia.org</a> or <a href="http://www.everything2.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com/" rel="nofollow">www.everything2.com</a>. Internet-Encyclopedia is very similar to Wikipedia but with different policy, and Everything2 is a discussion board or encyclopedia with lots of freedom. I have checked Internet Encyclopedia's policy and I think your theory will be welcomed there if written in a more or less encyclopedic style (you can copy-paste the current version or any older version of Pelastration and edit it as you like, as it is under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>). By the way, there is a great magazine specialized in alternative science and similar areas such as parapsychology, named Nexus, its website is at <a href="http://www.nexusmagazine.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.nexusmagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">www.nexusmagazine.com</a>, and maybe you can publish your theory there. Another website that may like to include your theory is <a href="http://www.kheper.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.kheper.net/" rel="nofollow">www.kheper.net</a>. As you see, there are still users who vote to delete the article, so it may be eventually deleted.

<dd>For your information my formal vote about the Pelastration is: NEUTRAL. (feel free to delete it or keep it, I support the quick resolution of the argument and I want everyone to be happy in the end, whatever the solution is). <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptim_ff75.html" title="User:Optim">Optim</a> 17:30, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I realise that it's frustrating to cope with deletionist prejudices. The idea appears to be nonsense, though I'm not in a position to fairly evaluate it. That being said it's difficult to understand why the proponents of scientific purity approach these subjects with such paranoia that every trace of these subjects must be throroughly censored. These ephemeral topics are a part of the social history of science, idiosyncratic as they may be. That, and not the theoretical specifics being promoted is what makes them valuable. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 20:12, 2003 Dec 21 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I used to argue the same thing, once upon a time. But policy is policy -- it's a pre-prepared consensus which allows us to make decisions without endlessly bickering about each case. I suggest you take your anti-deletionist campaign to meta and the Wikipedia namespace, rather than harassing people who attempt to apply the policy on a day-to-day basis. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 01:56, Dec 22, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal essays, that state your idiosyncratic opinions about a topic. We're reporting on what is in the canon of human knowledge; unless you're unusual, your idiosyncratic opinions aren't part of this canon. See Wikipedia:No original research.</li>
<li>Primary research. If you have done primary research on a topic, publish your results in normal peer-reviewed journals. Wikipedia will report about your work once it becomes part of accepted human knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article appears to violate both these points, so - delete. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 23:50, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks you all for spending your time here. Special thanks to you Optim for the good advise and your reactions. I want to point although something that you maybe have not noticed, which is that "pelastration" is a physic mechanism that is NEVER described in science. The mechanism is never described in Topology, you can check 'CAPS' which the most resembling topological concept. The mechanism is never described in mathematics. You don't have to be a rocket-engineer to see that. So some 'deletionists' on Wiki will delete a new development in science, a new entry in the canon of human knowledge.Mu6</p>

<dd>Yes, I'm afraid Wikipedia often deletes new entries in the canon of human knowledge. That's because Wikipedia isn't intended as a primary knowledge source, it's just a rehash of other sources. You need to publish your theory. To do this, you should probably start by writing about a small part of your theory in a bit more depth. I found your website to be very shallow, dealing a huge number of issues, but with each issue only very briefly. Producing a mathematical model for the proposed effect in the simplest case and comparing it to known experimental and theoretical results would probably be a good start. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 01:56, Dec 22, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
