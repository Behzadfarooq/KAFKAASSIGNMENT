<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>.

If there were a rough consensus, it should be fairly easy to spot with this much participation. Alternatively, I could lump the merges with keeps and look at it that way; then it becomes an editorial decision not a deletion one. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:09, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Biblecruft. There is nothing specifically notable about this verse. It comes part of the way through a large genealogy, which is notable as a whole but not in fractions. The division of the bible into chapters and verses is a somewhat mediaeval invention and so there is nothing significant, religiously, about this verse in particular.</p>
<p>The only content of the article is two translations of the verse, a few sentences repeating who is listed in it (as if you couldn't tell from either of the preceeding two translations), and a brief comment that Rahab is spelt as Rachab, and is in an odd position - a comment that would much better fit in an article on the genealogy as a whole.</p>
<p>This is all it is ever likely to contain. --<b>User talk:FDuffy</b> 14:12, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.s. This article was apparantly put up for AFD before. The result was 18 Merge, 12 Keep, 7 Delete, 2 Keep or Merge, 1 Transwiki, 2 votes by new users, and 1 anonymous vote. This was declared to be without consensus.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as unencyclopaedic. This appears to be a commentary or concordance. Is the creator proposing to create a similar article for every passage in the Bible?

<dl>
<dd>This may be a stub, but there is still considerable room for expansion. The article contains no discussion on the various translations of this verse, and the arguments between translators. The Rachab issue is only given brief mention, while volumes have been written on the subject. There is also no discussion of the apocryphal traditions that have developed around the figures known only from their place in the genealogy. It is also useful since we have every other of the first 200 verses in the Gospel of Matthew, and it would be confusing and off-putting to readers if we only had the first 190 articles, and had unexplained gaps every once and a while in the middle. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 15:02, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>This "some cruft exists, therefore no cruft may be deleted" argument has never seemed particularly persuasive to me. Please explain what it is that makes the verse <i>Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse.</i> anything other than trivia? For example, it almost certainly does not appear in the list of set Gospel readings under Anglican Church, since I have never heard it read out. Are any hymns based on this, as is the case with Ps.23? Is it well known to a lay audience, like John 8:1-11? Is it liturgically important like 1 Corinthians 11:23-26? This is a <i>single</i> verse in what appears to be one of the <i>least</i> important sections of Matthew's gospel, and it seems to me there really is nothing encyclopaedic to say about it! - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 15:40, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Previous AfDs have indeed resulted in either keep or no consensus votes for <i>those</i> verses. Moreso, the discussion on bible verses as a whole achieved a consensus of keep only because, as I read it, it was decided that the nomination was inappropriate for AfD and instead needed to be discussed as a merge at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_Bible_verses_33ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge/Bible verses">Wikipedia:Merge/Bible_verses</a>. Where there was no clear consensus, but there does seem to be a general idea that while some Bible verses <i>are</i> notable enough to have their own articles, each case needs to be judged separately. In other words, the previous votes say that there is a precedent for keeping Bible verses if they're notable. A list of begats is not notable, not encyclopedic (although valid as part of a more general Biblical genealogical article) and not capable of generating more information than this tiny stub. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 16:03, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The votes were generally in favor of <i>not</i> keeping an article on every verse of the Bible but only the notable ones, of which the votes were leaning toward only considering relatively few verses notable. There was a pretty even split on creating a wiki-Bible. <i>Therefore</i>, it seems to me that these questions are still open, that nominating a Bible-verse article for deletion is appropriate, and discussion about trans-wiki-ing it is valid. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 03:11, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Talk about subjects like the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a>, not the verses one by one. The verse structure is a mediaeval construct. Often the books were divided into verses and chapters simply in such a way as to get a nice or significant number of them, like 50 (n.b. one of the gospels, I believe it is Mark, has <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_of_the_beast.html" title="Number of the beast">666 verses</a> in total), rather than trying to respect the original sentence divisions. The only reason they weren't deleted/merged half a year ago is because the closing admin was biased and chose to count the vote as a keep despite the fact that twice as many people voted to delete and/or merge the articles than did to keep them. --<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">Victim of signature fascism</a> 01:47, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Do the "keepers" really want Wikipedia to eventually contain the entire text of the Bible in many translations and versions with an article-worthy analysis of each and every one. And then what?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, whoa whoa whoa, guys, I'm not religious at all, but the Bible (and the New Testament as part of the Bible) is the most obsessively studied and interpreted and commented upon book in human history. Every single verse has been subjected to endless hair-splitting and analysis by theologians. There is more than enough material out there for a lengthy, informative article on any bible verse. Are Bible verses less notable than individual characters from video games? I think not. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:24, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Two wrongs do not make a right. Wikipedia is by nature inconsistent; we're here debating <a href="../../../5/_/_/Matthew_1%7E5.html" title="Matthew 1:5">Matthew 1:5</a> and nothing else. Moreover, it's not just a question of whether the verse "deserves" an entry, it's what is genuinely useful. Merging verses that aren't particularly notable in themselves into topics creates articles that are more useful to the reader. (Moreover, nothing on Wikipedia is set in stone. If in a few months' time a merged article covering various verses is bulging at the seams, we can consider splitting it then. For now, merging is clearly the most useful step.) <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 10:31, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There has probably been enough commentary on every single verse of the Bible to fill a very long article. Even if merged version are also useful, some people will find these single-verse entries valuable, especially as they are fleshed out further. Can't articles on longer merged sections co-exist with single-verse articles? And if there are people willing to create them all, having an article for every verse has an aesthetic appeal that piecemeal single and merged articles would lack.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 23:52, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Merge</b> and <b>Redirect</b></s> with no prejudice against recreating once there is more content. I don't have a problem with keeping articles on minor individual bible verses <i>once they have been written</i> but while the content is so meager it is best kept in a larger article with a redirect from here. Once the content of the larger article has grown enough to warrant a separate article then it can certainly be created. That seems to me the most useful way of arranging the information we have. I find this problem interesting because I'm often wondering about the best way to split the content of the <a href="../../../e/d/d/Edda.html" title="Edda">Eddas</a> and such into Wikipedia articles. We basically already have an article for every verse of the <a href="../../../y/n/g/Ynglingatal.html" title="Ynglingatal">Ynglingatal</a> and we'll eventually probably have an article for every verse of the <a href="../../../v/%C3%B6/l/V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1.html" title="Völuspá">Völuspá</a>. Maintainability is a worrying problem, though, and maybe deletionism really is the way to Nirvana.
