<li>I'd like to point out that list of stutterers has not been deleted. In addition, such lists <i>can</i> be quite useful- it isn't the least bit inconceivable that some 13 year old kid has to do a school project on stuttering, and list of stutterers provides him or her with an invaluable resource. ditto for this article. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> [[User_talk:Heah|(talk)]] 23:39, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. This was originally part of the too large <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">LSD</a> article, and was given its own entry to cut that article down. Given the social upheaval and cultural change that LSD is strongly associated with as well as its place in pop culture, having a list of notable people who have commented on the LSD experience is virtually nothing like a list of people who have gotten stung by jellyfish. For many of these people, LSD changed their lives; many of these people are notable persons who have had great influence on modern culture. <b>I agree verifiability is a problem</b>; rather than deleting the article, names should be removed to the talk page unless cited as is done in other similar situations, such as the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mescaline.html#Famous_Users" title="Mescaline">Famous users</a> section of the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mescaline.html" title="Mescaline">Mescaline</a> article.

<ul>
<li>OK, so why are people without verifiable sources in there at all? Surely they should have been deleted long ago. If the list is as you state, surely the fundamentals of WP require that the collaborative project takes a firm grip on something with such obvious potential to go out of control? And why this list, rather than "people whose LSD experience has been widely discussed" or "people whose lives were heavily influenced by LSD" (which might have some merit, but still leaves the question of how heavily, and why).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This list was fairly recently split off from the LSD article. That's what the list was, a list of people who had commented on the lsd experience, and when it got too long it was given its own article. It wasn't done by me or anyone else i know. <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwertii_f6e2.html" title="User:Kwertii">user:Kwertii</a> moved it on June 13th. There's obviously lots of problems with lots of articles on wikipedia, and if you have problems, you should fix them. If you feel that many of the users should have been removed from the list, go ahead and do it. We all have things to do. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> <a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeah_0915.html" title="User talk:Heah">(talk)</a> 19:54, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Having a list of notable people who comment on the experience, but then having to put the names on the talk page due to lack of verifiability, makes absolutly no sense. I'm not certain what a celebrity could add to the description of an LSD trip that a person off the street could not state just as fluently. In other words, besides the fact that these people are celebrities, why should they be singled out for their descriptions? <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 23:44, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Cleanup</b>. Many of these people are living and to name them without citation is essentially accusing them of having broken the law. However, I see nothing wrong with the basic premise of the list. If these are verifiably people who have spoken about their own experience then the list could be a useful research tool. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 23:55, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Such a list (unlike a list of people who have taken, say, aspirin) is useful when on a controversial topic subject to much spin and disinformation, but indicate the source for each entry, otherwise it is just useless gossip or libel. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 01:07, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists split from pages are usually much more valid than ones created whole cloth. This list appears verifiable, useful, and maintainable. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 03:23, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b>. There is a category <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category.html" title="Category">Hallucinogen researchers, users, and proponents</a>, population 31. It isn't an <i>exact</i> overlap with this list, but close, since it includes "users". I don't know if that has any bearing on the subject or not. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:47, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with the sentiment that a list of famous people who have commented on LSD experiences is of more interest than a list of famous people who have commented on being stung by a jellyfish. Generally speaking, people don't often mention being stung because it's merely a minor inconvenience, whereas LSD trips usually have more far-reaching, profound effects on one's life. If some of the assertions are false, let the subjects remove themselves from the page; otherwise, the topic was of enough interest to me to click on the link, and I'm sure many others would be interested to know Steve Jobs's opinion on the drug. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDontknockmysmock_6c68.html" title="User:Dontknockmysmock">Dontknockmysmock</a></li>
<li><s><b>Undecided</b></s> the title sucks, the concept is flawed (the list is pretty pointless without the context of why they commented and what comment they made), false additions may be actionable so <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is crucial, but in the end there are some people (like <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_K_Dick_3e06.html" title="Philip K Dick">Philip K Dick</a> who are known for having experimented with, and talked about, LSD. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:42, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just followed up a sample; they vary from Bill Bailey, whose "comments" are mainly jokes (and pretty much universally thought not to be among his better ones), to Dick Feynman, who professed to be embarrassed about it. Apparently. (I don't remember that from his books) So without context this is appears to me to be a <i>seriously</i> pointless list. How would people feel about a list of people who tried smoking when they were at college, but didn't really take to it? The ones that made a big deal of it, like Timothy Leary (immortalised in song by the Moody Blues) are well enough known. I am struggling to see the point of this article. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:51, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> it is. Here's why:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>For what value of "comment"? Would "I never had an LSD experience" count? Where on the scale from "none of your business" to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Leary_7ce7.html" title="Timothy Leary">Timothy Leary</a> is the cutoff point? What did Syd Barrett <i>comment</i> about LSD? As far as I'm aware he is a recluse, and while he was not a recluse I don't recall him being coherent for long enough to make any comment, so <i>what was the supposed comment</i> in this case of this extensively-documented figure?</li>
<li>For what value of "notable"? Are only people with blue links included? No. Nor is there any guarantee that normal WP standards of notability are being applied. If only <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> candidates are included, why not a category so that authors on the person's article know they've been included and can verify the information?</li>
<li>For what value of "experience"? As medication? As experiment? As life-changing influence? As "me-too" experimentation back in the 60s?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>But most of all, whatever the level of verifiability and original research involved, that does this article <i>actually</i> tell us about either LSD or the people involved? In what way does it add to our understanding of Bill Gates to have him lumped in with Philip K. Dick? Does this finally explain Microsoft Bob? Not as such: all it tells us is that Gates is a baby boomer. It is every bit as relevant as list of people who admit to having worn flares (in fact, to a first approximation, it's the same list).</dd>
<dd>If this article told me about the LSD experience and how it defined the writing of PKD then it might be interesting, but that's not what it is. This list is indiscriminate and always will be. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:42, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It tells us much more about cultural connections between people and their culture. the 60s was a time of great upheaval, and a list such as this can help to show who changed, how things changed, and etc. LSD and what people think about it has ramifications far beyond cleaning my drier of lint.
<dl>
<dd>Not really. No more than experimenting with smoking or E does, anyway. The list doesn't who changed, how things changed or anything like that: I'm pretty sure we already cover the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> in a much more encyclopaedic way.

<li><b>Delete</b> as unencyclopedic or else start working on list of notable people who have discovered dryer lint in their laundry. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 13:16, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This makes no sense as a list; it's unclear (since "comment" means very different things to the different people on this list), unverifiable, and possibly libellous. Either <b>rewrite</b> as Notable comments on the LSD experience, including fully sourced accounts of the comments people have made and no names not attached to particular comments, or, if no one is willing to do that work, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 18:00, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The "LSD experience?" The reference reminds me of stuff that I overheard more than 30 years ago from people I thought took too many drugs back then. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 08:42, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the revised version, which at least says where the comments were made. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 13:59, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is what the wiki is all about. But why isn't Leary on this list? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:02, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The list must have sources but it should really be kept up as Wiki provides the one place that people can compile such a list. Otherwise, such knowledge will be scattered to the four winds of the Internet.
