<dd>And asking for "independent sources" for notability is a bit much and sets a dangerous precedent. I am certain you will be proven wrong by the many voters.<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourtney_Akins_7935.html" title="User:Courtney Akins">Courtney Akins</a> 02:24, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, that's not a dangerous precedent. Its how Wikipedia works. Please read the central <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guideline that helps us decide which articles should be included in the encyclopedia. You should also read our core policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> that requires all information added to articles be verifiable. Finally, you should know that this is a discussion, not a vote. Even if you get a lot of your friends to "vote" keep here it doesn't matter unless you can back up the opinions from Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Please read <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> for more details. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 02:30, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - as per Gwernol. If you're going to spend your time and energy debating the community instead of editing the article to meet the verifiability and notability guidelines, then the article justly deserves deletion. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 02:38, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Suppose this was real, what makes it notable or above the bar from any and all other pornographic films? If we had an article on every pornography the site would crash. This is a reason for the guidelines so that we can have something managable to work with. This is an unsourced article that really doesn't tell us why this it is exceptional.

<li><b>Week keep</b> I am not sure about notablity but as far as verifialbe, the movie itself a source. When there is an article about a telvision episode we don't require the article to cite a newspaper or magizine that talks about the show - the actual show is the source. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 10:57, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Because many TV shows have articles for their episodes, the current <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> policy sets itself up for a serious violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> because of the precedent that would be established here if this content is deleted (some of which has been recognized as top-500 by a retail website). Just something to think about; some here seem to be applying policy more forcefully to this article than they would elsewhere; Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> censored. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 20:34, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It cannot. We <i>do</i> require articles about television shows to cite sources. It's true that many of them don't, but Wikipedia is a work in progress and compliance with the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy is uneven. This is to be expected. Wikipedia is inconsistent. If you want consistency, work on a command-and-control encyclopedia. Meanwhile, if it is true that there are articles on television shows that cite no sources other than the shows themselves, then someone needs to get to work on those articles and cite sources. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Check my contributions; I'm not here to make money from an article—I'm choosing to spend energy improving content rather than deleting where if possible. The two movies in the top 500 are criteria enough to have the Red Light District label article per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> which ought to be the relevant notability essay here, and let me remind you that notability is not policy or guideline; it is an essay and should not be sufficient evidence for deletion in and of itself. Previous keep votes have established verifiablity, and hopefully the verifying links will not also be removed. External links point to information not included in the article; over time these will migrate to references.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd be keenly interested to see what part of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> talks about merit and notability. As far as the top 500, this makes the entry at cduniverse.com more than a simple price listing (it is also denoting popularity) which means that it is a non-trivial published work. It's not concrete proof of notability, but it can't be ignored without thought.

<dd>Which of those sites is the one that that says that, as you put it, "this movie series is a very important and notable series in the annals of contemporary pornography?"

Not even any <b>user ratings.</b> You ask us to believe these movies are important, yet apparently no imdb user has bothered to rate it. There is only a single external review, in DVD Talk, and <a href="http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=14872" class="external text" title="http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=14872" rel="nofollow">the review</a> says nothing about its being of any importance in the annals of contemporary pornography. It says basically that it is an "oral only film" and that people who enjoy such films will likely enjoy this one. It notes that the film isn't very grainy, and that the lighting could have used a little work but "it's not really bad." How does this add up to an important porn film? It hasn't even been reviewed seriously. For some of the films in this series, imdb lists <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0352920/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0352920/" rel="nofollow">no reviews at all</a>.</dd>

<li>That makes no sense. If it is only a "plot summary" (where is the plot summary here, by the way? Does describing the focal sexual act of the films qualify as a plot summary?), then the solution is not to delete it but to add other things besides a plot summary. In fact this article already includes other things. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:58, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, for pornography, describing the focal sexual act often (and in this case) is a plot summary. If there are parts missing, then it is even less than a plot summary. There is no sourced analysis; the only line that qualifies as achievements is lacking citation. So as I see it, without a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source</a> verifying something to the effect of the work's achievements, impact or historical significance within the article, it fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. As mentioned above, the onus of providing sources lies on the editor who adds content; not on the editor who questions the content added. It is easy to say that the solution is to add other things; saying it won't change the article. I've tried to come up with sources for others' work and fix the article rather than delete it, I can't.
