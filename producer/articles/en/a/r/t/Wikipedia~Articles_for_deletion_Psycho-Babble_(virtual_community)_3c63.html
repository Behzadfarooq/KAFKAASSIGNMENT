Excluding Google hits that link to the researcher's vast archives of his forum members' posts, few other sites link to this forum. Some therapists discourage their clients from visiting Robert Hsiung's forums <a href="http://www.dr-bob.org/babble/social/20060108/msgs/597305.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dr-bob.org/babble/social/20060108/msgs/597305.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>; perhaps a therapist's couch -- not Wikipedia -- is the appropriate place to discuss the merits of this forum. This article demonstrates the difficulty of trying to maintain an open-source encylopedic article about Internet forums where members can persistently mobilize to effect content of the article about their forum. Though most of the content was contributed by forum members and by the psychiatrist who owns the forum, a member of the forum continues to argue here against independent edits, claiming contributions from independent editors dominate the article. Regular Wikipedia editors have better things to do than persistently reviewing, mediating and arbitrating controversies that inevitably arise from promotional efforts such as this article. I have better things to do than trying to balance promotional articles about a psychiatrist's experimental on-line therapeutic models.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The content you cite was contributed by a member of the forum the article describes<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psycho-Babble_%28virtual_community%29&amp;diff=30980499&amp;oldid=30959599" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psycho-Babble_%28virtual_community%29&amp;diff=30980499&amp;oldid=30959599" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, but <i>it is not correct</i>. Compare the citation you linked ostensibly verifying the forum as the second most-popular mental health site with the actual Alexa pages for most popular mental health sites <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=1269529" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=1269529" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> and for the top 10 mental health self-help sites <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=26645" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=26645" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Psycho-Babble is not among the top 10 mental-health self-help support groups <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse/general/?&amp;CategoryID=28974&amp;mode=general&amp;Start=1&amp;SortBy=Popularity" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse/general/?&amp;CategoryID=28974&amp;mode=general&amp;Start=1&amp;SortBy=Popularity" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, nor among the top 10 support groups <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=376" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=376" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. The category among which Psycho-Babble was ranked second includes only 20 other sites <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=492330" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=492330" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Ranked among the broader group of 53 mental-health support groups that include "stress" the forum falls to third<a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=492330" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=492330" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. Among 401 listed health support groups, Psycho-Babble ranks 8th, but with an overall traffic rank of 86,486th, it falls far behind the leader, which is the National Institute for Diabetes and Kidney Disease site, which is not the topic of a Wikipedia article. The site is not ranked along with self-help groups, or self-help support groups, perhaps because it is administered by a medical doctor. The top mental health self-help support group outranks dr-bob.org/babble 11,406<b>:</b>86,486, and outranks by 11,406<b>:</b>24,164 the top site in the category of 20 sites in which dr-bob.org/babble ranks second. I suspect none of the more notable mental health, self-help or support sites listed by Alexa is the topic of a Wikipedia article.</dd>

<dd>I'll again correct the article to reflect the fact that the site is second among a narrow group of 20 sites, but my continued concern for the article's accuracy does not temper my strong vote for its deletion. The most popular mental health sites are associated with well-known organizations, such as that of the American Psychological Association. The 10th most popular mental health site, with a rank of 27,689, far outranks Psycho-Babble, today at 86,486th. A member of Robert Hsiung's forum selected its standing in a subset that comprises less than 1 percent of the sites listed in Alexa's mental health category and represented it as among the most visited of all mental health sites. Unless Wikipedia plans to include non-vanity, NPOV articles about the 100,000 most visited Web sites that use the Alexa toolbar, Psycho-Babble fails to rise to a level of notability except among a minor category in which many similar sites do not seek to be listed. Second among 20 hardly comprises notability, though inclusion of the claim to suggest second-among-5710 offers notable evidence of promotional editing contrary to facts. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveReader_b1b6.html" title="User:ProveReader">ProveReader</a> 23:00, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Thanks for clarifying that, ProveReader. I was working, from memory, from an older version of WP:WEB; the criteria have become stricter (a good thing, IMO.) Thanks also for pointing out the selective nature of that linked alexa ranking; going to the "top in all mental health" list <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=1269529" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=1269529" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, I can't even find it listed in the top fifty. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 01:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Could I present my point of view? I think Psycho-Babble is notable. Not the #1 site on the web, but notable. I'm not sure how to make a case for that without running the risk of sounding promotional, but here are a few thoughts.
<ul>
<li>There aren't many online communities that have been sustained for 7 years and grown to 17,000 members and 600,000 posts. I think that's noteworthy. Especially, perhaps, given its mission of peer support and education in mental health.</li>
<li>I think rankings also make it clear that it's not a typical message board. As mentioned before, it's ranked #8 of 401 (in the top 2%) in the <i>Health &gt; Support Groups</i> category by Alexa <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=191" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=191" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. It's also ranked #4 of about 2,500,000 when you Google <i>effexor xr</i> (an antidepressant medication) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=effexor+xr" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=effexor+xr" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> and #1 of about 116,000 when you Google <i>therapist self-disclosure</i> (an issue in psychotherapy) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=therapist+self-disclosure" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=therapist+self-disclosure" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. It's not Wikipedia &#160;:-) but I think that breadth of information is notable, too.</li>
<li>I'm biased in favor of the site, but others are biased against it. For example, see that blog that ProveReader repeatedly links to <a href="http://dr--bob.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://dr--bob.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. And judge for yourself, from the history, whether the edits I've made have had more positive spin or hers have had more negative. If it would be helpful, I'd be happy to respond to her comments one by one. But I'm not here to make accusations, just to ask you try to be neutral and to consider both sides. <a href="../../../h/s/i/User%7EHsiung_199b.html" title="User:Hsiung">Dr. Bob</a> 11:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The availability of archives effects <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_optimization.html" title="Search engine optimization">search engine results</a>. AOL and Yahoo have long hosted many non-archived support groups. Usenet, established 26 years ago, is home to numerous long-standing on-line support communities. Dr. Hsiung is not recognized as a published expert in on-line support group history. A recognized author for the University College London Center for Health Informatics says on-line support groups have at least a 24-year history, lists some non-qualititive support group directories and says directory placement is an incomplete, user-defined means of ranking groups <a href="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:t7Y0A6XDq8AJ:eprints.ucl.ac.uk/archive/00001406/01/Online_support_groups.pdf+%22Online+support+groups:+An+overlooked+resource+for+patients&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:t7Y0A6XDq8AJ:eprints.ucl.ac.uk/archive/00001406/01/Online_support_groups.pdf+%22Online+support+groups:+An+overlooked+resource+for+patients&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. We have no data to show that few on-line communities are as old as dr-bob.org/babble, but plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest otherwise. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveReader_b1b6.html" title="User:ProveReader">ProveReader</a> 18:44, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
