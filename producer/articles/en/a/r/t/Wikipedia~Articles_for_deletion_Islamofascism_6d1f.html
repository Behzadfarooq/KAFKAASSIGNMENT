<li><b>Extreme Keep</b> <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslamist_0c12.html" title="User:Islamist">Islamist</a> has been involved in snarky POV edits/vandalism of this page. He keeps removing wikiformating and link descriptions from the related links section. User:Islamism is trying to clobber <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, since he objects to the term. He creates an objectionable article for the bogus neologism <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a> (153 hits) and then claims that the article on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, a real word with 62,500 hits, must share the same fate (Merge and Protect/Deletion) as his obvious VfD fodder since the two words have a similar construction. There is a big difference between a term with 62,500 hits and one with 153 hits. There is a difference between a term which is used noted authors in influential publications vs a neologism tossed about on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiwar.com.html" title="Antiwar.com">antiwar.com</a>. <b>This is pure bad faith VfD.</b><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>This article got split out of the list of political epithets because because the section gradually grew in size to the scope of an article. The term islamofascism may have once been an epithet, but over time it has evolved into a word describing the concept of violent totalitiarian islamism. As a notable word/concept it deserves its own comprehensive and NPOV article. If the final decision is to redirect, I urge that it not be protected, because Islamofascism will once again grow big enough and notable enough to be split out, again. Sealing the redirect will prevent <b>tender love and organic growth</b><br />

<li>An interesting dilemma, given that I already voted to redirect <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a> to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>... but that was because the description for Judeofascicm was essentially the same as the negative connotation attributed to Zionism. I'd suggest a redirect for this also if there were an appropriate topic to redirect to, but what would it be? <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fundamentalism.html" title="Islamic fundamentalism">Islamic fundamentalism</a>? Problematic, as that could be used to describe those who simply ascribe non-politically to deeply held religous beliefs. The term <i>is</i> in use in popular culture, <i>and</i> has a meaning unique from any article to which it might be redirected, therefore I must vote <b>keep</b>, but with the admonishment that the article should acknowledge that this is an inherently POV term invented by persons with beliefs that are probably generally hostile to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 03:17, 2005 Apr 17 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The reason this article was taken out of list of political epithets was that its entry had grown out much longer than the typical single paragraph list entry. As is the article is about four paragraphs long with an extensive list of outbound links. As is the article needs some serious work to make it more encyclopedic, but thats what <b>tender love and organic growth are for.</b> <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 03:54, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Agreed, redirect</b>. An article on fascistic tendencies in both Islam and Judaism cannot have such a title so long as its use —among politicans, scholars, judges, journalists, etc.— remains limited as an epithet. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:41, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think there is good evidence that this term has grown out from being a mere epithet. it's mentioned in books, editorial pages and government officials. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 03:58, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, where is this evidence? Note that if they depict it as <b>"</b>Islamofascism<b>"</b>, than that denotes it being an epithet rather than a construct. <i>E.g.</i> "Christopher Hitchens, for example, describes Islamic extremism as “Islamofascism” and strongly favored Operation Iraqi Freedom." Source: <small>D.D. Walton, "The West and Its Antagonists: Culture, Globalization, and the War on Terrorism," <i>Comparative Strategy</i>, July/August/September 2004, vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 303-312(10).</small> <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 04:18, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Au contraire, we have many articles on epithets. See e.g. <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 20:28, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Agreed, redirect</b>. It's an epithet. As <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a> said in 1948, the word <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> itself has been so commonly overused that now it merely means "something bad". <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 20:11, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">nobs</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to list of political epithets, until such time as this concept develops into something more than just an epithet. The article must be proportional to the thing. Has only appeared in two books before <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. <a href="http://a9.com/Islamofascism?zx=q&amp;a=sbooks" class="external autonumber" title="http://a9.com/Islamofascism?zx=q&amp;a=sbooks" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> 05:38, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand why you might think that Islamofascism is a mere pejorative epithet; The term itself has a pejorative connotation. However it is a very common concept in <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservative.html" title="Neoconservative">neoconservative</a> circles, and since neoconservativsm is a notable political ideology, it's common concepts are also notable. May I suggest looking at.

Islamofascism is young article (having just been recently split out) , but I think that with tender love and organic growth it will stand on its own very soon. I might add that I have proposed an outline for this article in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamofascism_0d82.html" title="Talk:Islamofascism">Talk:Islamofascism</a> <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 06:51, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Delete</s>. <b>Redirect</b>. I agree that <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslamist_0c12.html" title="User:Islamist">Islamist</a> (<a href="../../../i/s/l/User_talk%7EIslamist_3e0d.html" title="User talk:Islamist">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Islamist_4a24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Islamist">contribs</a>) has behaved badly regarding this (blanking the article and making it a redirect), and has been pushing a very clear PoV in a number of related articles — but that's irrelevant. This article, the one on <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a>, and any other of the same kind, are simply ill-disguised attacks on racial or religious groups; they invent a term and a concept to go with it, and then use it to smear those groups. The claim by Meelar that it should be kept because some right-wing writers have written about 'Islamic totalitarianism' fails if only because it confuses totalitarianism with fascism.

<li>I agree. Sorry, I did the same thing as Islamist, because I misread the page, not realizing it was on VfD. Islamofascism should do whatever Slogan 'Islamofascism' does, and since it's a redirect, it should be a redirect too.

<li><b>redirect</b> to an article named something along the lines of Islamic Theocratic Intolerance. I am on the border here. There is an obscene amount of historical evidence to give legitimacy to this term, <i>c.f.</i> the definitions of "fascism" at <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>. Through <i>every</i> period of history since the historical (a term I use in an attempt at compromising deference to the Muslims who insist that Islam goes back to the creation of the World) inception of Islam, <i>i.e.</i>, the time of the Prophet, pbuh, <i>every</i> characteristic of fascism has, at one time or another, characterized the <i>majority</i> interpretation of the Prophet's teachings. That said, however, in <i>every</i> Muslim realm where shari`a has not held political supremacy, the same characteristics have been, without a single exception of which I'm aware, <i><b>absent</b></i> from Muslim rule. So, the <i>facts</i> seem to me to indicate that there exists Islamofascism on the theocratic level, but not on the Islamosecular level, and so it seems to me that the term Islamofascism is too all-encompassing. It makes it sound as though all Muslims are fascists, which is simply not the case. From what I am preached by my Muslim friends, the teachings of the Prophet, pbuh, are also non-Fascist. I don't think the Wikipedia should play the role of inventing or supporting politically or emotionally charged appellations. It is my observation, that the term Islamofascism is used primarily by right-wing pro-Israel American Christians (NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT, to quote <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Seinfeld_0ee4.html" title="Jerry Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>) more than by anyone else, to describe the exact phenomenon which I'm describing...but that doesn't mean that the term is exact or definitive. That point should be made VERY CLEAR in the prélude to the article as renamed according to my proposal. I hope people will consider my input carefully, and change their votes accordingly if they agree. We can take up a vote on an appropriate name afterwards, if need be. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:47, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to clarify my "redirect" vote. It is not a genuine "redirect", it is a <b>keep</b>, but <b>rename</b>. "Islamofascism" should be a redirect to something, I don't know what, perhaps Intolerance in Islam, as it is a subject about which voluminous amounts have been written. My opposition is to using what is really an epithet as the name for an article, especially when it denigrates people by association. I registered this same opinion in the discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_anti-Semitism_1a23.html" title="Arab anti-Semitism">Arab anti-Semitism</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Far too many people on the Left are inclined to make excuses for Islamic fundamentalism. They accept its misogyny so long as it doesn’t target Western women. They accept its fascism so long as it is anti-American fascism. We now have a Stop the War coalition led by Islamic fascists and Marxist-Leninists, and much of the Left is silent about it. Acknowledging the horrors of Islamic fundamentalism would sully their consciences, which they want to keep clean for the battle against America ... Much of the Stop the War coalition now actually supports a fascist resistance movement and ignores their Iraqi comrades entirely. You have to look back to the Hitler-Stalin pact for a historical parallel. The concept of fascism is being lost. It’s something you hear about on the history channels. But Islamic fascism is still fascism ... <b>Islamofascism</b> has been ripping through the Arab world, often supported by America, and it should be the Left’s worst nightmare. <a href="http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2004/03/30/nick_cohen_vs_the_awl.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2004/03/30/nick_cohen_vs_the_awl.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:14, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> Last time I checked, the article discussed the usage of the term and separated it clearly from those who the term is used against. Since this term is used a lot these days, it deserves a discussion on its usage, origins etc. It is however most important that we make sure that this article doesn't deviate from that. If links to religious or political ideologies are needed, it should be stated clearly that "islamofascism" is a term usually (mis)used against those. If there are people who would object to the mere existence of the article, well... don't look it up. Where I come from there are people who are personally offended by practically our entire manga section (often for religious or semi-religious reasons), yet the deletion of those articles would bring, indeed, a tear to my eye. Although I don't feel that way about this article, I still think it's a bad idea to delete it, just because people are offended by it. Just make sure the article is as "clinical" as possible and it will all be allright. One could even mention in the article that a lot of people have objections to the term. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerbrant_7d11.html" title="User:Gerbrant">Shinobu</a> 22:08, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> Many supporters of deletion, I suspect, are shy of the forthcoming exertion to come with the article in question. This vote of mine is not without ambiguity; however, I <i>believe</i> the content is being unjustifiably threatened, but in parallel does not warrant its own special article. At first, I voted to keep the article, but after contemplation, I changed my vote. It suits a journal, but not an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete, Redirect, or Keep</b> depending on if its NPOV and can be so maintained.

Many here I suspect are newbies, and hence dont have the concept of NPOV under their grasp. Others are yet POV warriors seeking to push or repeat an agenda. If its written in an NPOV way, keep. But the mere existence of this kind of article lends its proponents to claim it like it was theirs to define, forgetting the basic fact that its just a <b>word,</b> and a POV word at that. Theres nothing wrong with POV word articles, as long as the articles themselves are not POV. Judging by many of the comments above, it would seem that there is a basic ignorance of that distinction.

<p>You can, of course, create any number of words using the formula: <i>X</i> + Fascist tendencies = <i>X</i>ofascism. How about 'Graecofascism'? 'Sinofascism'? 'Hindofascism'? The trouble is, having created the term, it's also easy to create a concept to go with it, and then to create a history. You don't even need to go outside the facts; there'll always be, in any nationality, race, or religion that's been around for a while examples of people or groups acting badly. The term 'fascism' is being used in such a Usenet/school-debating-society way that that's all you need. Wikipedia isn't here to invent new concepts, nor to parrot whatever nonsense the U.S. neo-cons have come up with as they flail around trying to find reasons to attack other countries. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:45, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course, Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Hinduist, Buddhist, etc. 'fascism' are a frightening reality, involving <i>...'the most heavenly exctacies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimantalism'...</i> [towards] <i>a new high-tech Dark Ages.</i> But I have yet to see the oh' shorthand used in any serious exposition (from within revolutionary currents, at least, where I've seen such concepts elaborated on at some length). <i>E.g.</i> <a href="http://rwor.org/future/web.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://rwor.org/future/web.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 21:45, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the article is developed, it's becoming more and more distasteful (and many of the comments made by those who want to keep it betray an ignorance of the issues here, as well as a disturbing emotional tone). We're told, for example, that some Islamic leaders allied with fascists in the second World War, but no mention is made of the fact that the fascists in question were Christians, and the purely pragmatic, non-ideological nature of the contacts is not properly explained. There's in fact no indication that any of the Muslims involved held any sort of fascist belief. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:36, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm arguing this in two places – here, and on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamofascism_0d82.html" title="Talk:Islamofascism">Talk:Islamofascism</a> – and the result is sometimes a bit disjointed. It seems clear that al-Husseyni was ideologically involved with Nazism (just as some English aristocrats, royals, and politicians were), but any general Arab support for Nazism shouldn't be attributed to so-called Islamofascism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's the logic, folks: I identify a Nazi-sympathizing Muslim. Islam therefore has a fascist dimension. Hmmm. Does the failure of the Catholic Church to vigorously and explicitly oppose Nazi crimes against Jews justify an entry for Catholifacism?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suppose that what's offensive about this article (and the comments of some people on this page) is that, whereas we talk about Italian fascists, and Spanish fascists, and Greek fascists, etc., rather than Christofascists, when it comes to the Muslim world it's OK to lump all the Islamic countries and groups together. The turning of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a> into a redirect presumably involved a recognition of the same fact in that case; there are of course Jewish fascists (Jews are no more immune to human stupidity and nastiness than any other group), and many people have seen the actions of certain Israeli politicians and parties as having fascist aspects — but it's wrong to use the general, smearing, and to my mind bigoted term 'Judeofascism'. Why on Earth can't the same reasonableness be applied here? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:41, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like your reasoning here, but the thing is. If the use of the term was reasonable then it would not belong in List of political epithets. The question for me is weather or not the epiteth merits an article and if such an article can possibly in the current enviornment be NPOV. I think the answer to the first question is yes, this term is used enough that someone will likely look it up here. The second question is what will they find? I voted to re-direct because that seemed the safest waty to make sure they found somethign reasonable. If the article could be keep about the epiteth and NPOV I would have voted to keep. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 09:01, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>There is no such thing as Islamic/Islamo Fascism</b></p>
<p>For those of us learned in Middle Eastern history, it is clear that fascist-derived ideologies and Islamism have always been violently opposed (see:<a href="../../../h/a/m/Hama_Massacre_c745.html" title="Hama Massacre">Hama Massacre</a>). The fascist-derived ideologies in the Middle East such as the Kateab Party, the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_party.html" title="Baath party">Baath party</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Social_Nationalist_Party_6900.html" title="Syrian Social Nationalist Party">Syrian Social Nationalist Party</a> have been almost entirely supported by Christians or minority groups in the Arab world that feared Islamism. The founder of the SSNP was a Christian, as the founder of the Baath was Greek orthodox. The Kataeb was founded by Bachir Gemayel, a Maronite Christian militant. All these ideologies were officially secular but had mainly Christian support. Islamic fascism is a contradiction in all senses of the word. Islamism has no ideas about racial superiority either. That is why it is utterly ridiculous to have an Islamic fascism article.</p>
<p>My views on this article are that it is a way for WalkingEagles and Klonimus to insert their own judgement into an Anti-Islamic term that should frankly be listed under political epithets. Just because neo-cons have started using this term more does not make it factually or historically correct.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a> 16:31, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yuber, you remind me of the texas farmer who was the best shot in the west. First he would shoot, and then he would paint a bullseye. I'm not playing a game with you about weather Islamofascism exists or not. It doesn't matter if the term is as you claim "factually or historically correct", it matters that it is being widely used to mean a specific concept. And therefore must be documented in an encyclopedic encyclopaedia.</dd>
<dd>At the moment I have to say that I agree with the general direction of the Islamofascism article. It was a mistake on my part to combine <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a> (Fusion of Islam and fascist political movements) with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> (term to describe totalitarian Islam, and groups that support it.). I think the current split is a good idea, and the two articles can crosslink. I do wish the whole thing could have been done with less rancor, which would have been the case if people hadn't been so quick to delete materiel they found objectionable. . <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 17:53, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are either deliberately ignoring, or somehow failing to understand, my point. I suspect it's the former. But, just in case .... I am not talking about sanitized article titles like the ones you propose above, but rather something <b>patently offensive</b> -- just like Islamofascism -- as the title for an article. You're not talking about calling the page something vaguely intelligent like Political trends in Islam, but instead insisting on a single, foul-sounding coinage that lumps 1 billion people together with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. My question is, if bloggers made a similiarly offensive, similarly paranoid neologism about Jewish people show up on Google, would <b>that offensive term itself</b> be appopriate as the title of an article? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 02:39, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I voted <b>redirect</b> to list of political epithets but I see the case for a keep vote provided the page documents the use of the epithet and only provides links to more appropriately titled articles for discussion of the content. In an ideal world, editors could actually keep to such a policy, and so an article on Yusuf's hypothetical epithet would be good for Wikipedia, but too many editors are too gummed up with hormones and propaganda not to opine on the content, so redirects are better.

<li>I'm gonna be bold, answering, as one who did not vote for "keep", in a forum in which the requestant has not requested my input: Islamofascism is a term that has come to be accepted in journalistic circles, if only "outside CNN", as a descriptor of fascistic tendencies exemplified by the leadership of certain (sadly, the vast majority of) Islamic régimes. Wishing the term into oblivion is neither intellectually honest nor encyclopedic. That said, you'll note, my vote was to redirect the content of this article to Islamic Theological Intolerance or something equally descriptive. The concept within modern Islam is, not only present, but <i>prevalent</i>, and in certain circles, <i>predominant</i>. The term "Islamofascism", however, as derogatory as it might sound to the vast majority of Muslims, is one that has gained a not-insignificant currency in the Journalism of the West. The <i>only relevant question here</i>, if I might be so bold, is whether or not this term should be the TITLE of an article, or a redirect to an article describing the phenomenon. My contention is that Islam has inherent tendencies that permit the interpretation thereof in favor of Fascism, but that the term "Islamofascism" should be applied exclusively to such groups as follow this interpretation, which is, unfortunately, gaining sway within the muslim world. As such, any such article should concentrate on these groups, rather than dragging down the erstwhile phenomenal accomplishments of Islamic Civilization (which OK, here's my bias, is nothing more than the preservation and encouragement of the achievements of civilization overtaken by muslim warriors, but that really has nothing to do with the discussion at hand). To say, however, that fascism is not a(n unfortunate and predominant) trend within modern (vocal) Islam, is neither historically nor intellectually honest. I wish it were otherwise, perhaps more than most muslims, in fact, but the fact remains, Islam in "this day and age" has been coöpted by the dominance and influence of Wahhabism and Allawitism, both of which are quintessentially fascist, sadly. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 10:49, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When you say that fascism is descriptive of 'the vast majority" of Islamic regimes -- I hope you don't consider Egypt, UAE, Indonesia, Turkey, etc. to be members of this universe of "Islamic regimes"? Do you? That there are Muslims within a secular government does not make it an Islamic regime!</dd>
<dd>Which "Islamic regime," specifically, do you consider to be fascist? If your answer is, say, Saudi Arabia, how does the fact that Osama Bin Laden is a bitter enemy of the ruling monarchy enter into your calculus? Does that mean that the ruling family are Islamofascists, but Bin Laden, by opposing them, is anti-fascist? Are you sure you don't mean to say that some governments that rule over Muslims are <i>authoritarian</i>?

I personally have no opinion if they are fascists or not, but I think a good case could be made for both sides. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 01:32, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yusuf, you seem to be missing the point that <b>Wikipedia does not exist to pass judgement, only to document</b>: that means that we are documenting the claims that surround the useage of the term <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascist.html" title="Islamofascist">Islamofascist</a> without passing any judgement over its existance or nonexistance, pejorative nature, moral value of those who use the term, history of use, etc etc.<a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 01:32, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you and I simply disagree on this.
<ul>
<li>If it were as you say, we would have an independent main article on the word "Nigger," and we don't.</li>
<li>Why don't we? Because it's patently offensive.</li>
<li>Now then. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two examples I thought of, too, that might conceivably be called "Islamic regimes."</li>
<li>But -- reality check -- the claim was that a <b>majority</b> of these "Islamic regimes" were fascist, and <b>that is simply not factual, unless "fascist" means "objectionable to the speaker" or some such ridiculousness.</b></li>
<li>Factuality is apparently not a big deal for you, which is fine, but if you believe, as you appear to (with others on this page) that there is some "trend" toward fascism in Islam, then I submit that it is incumbent upon you to explain <b>why</b> you believe this, and to use the words "Fascism" and "Islam" as though they had consistent meanings. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 01:44, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When you say that fascism is a "trend within modern (vocal) Islam," I assume you mean fascism, the real thing, as opposed to fascism, the "boo" word that carries no actual meaning beyond "you're a bad guy." So presumably you are saying that there is a sect within Islam that embraces <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">corporatism</a>? I'm unfamiliar with this sect or its proponents. Can you please be a little more specific about it?

<dd>a) That's a "trend within modern (vocal) Islam"? Where's the trend?

It seems that this is going nowhere! I just wonder how come a NPOV of a few right-wing writers (I say a few) could turn into a 1-0 in the propaganda war and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1405605,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1405605,00.html" rel="nofollow">How the right played the fascism card against Islam</a>! I just wonder indeed how come two articles of the same nature (talking about this one and the other shamefull non-sense fictitious <i>Judeofascism</i>) could have different fates! How come <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a> got already a status of <i>pending deletion</i>?!! Because of google hits?! Is this the main argument? (If yes is your answer, then refer to the end of my intervention below). Who spends most of his time discussing the phenomenon of Islamofascism on forums and blogs? Aren't they people who got an anti-islamic agenda?</p>
<p>In this list of pejorative slogans <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/List-of-pejorative-political-slogans" class="external text" title="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/List-of-pejorative-political-slogans" rel="nofollow">at Nationmaster.com</a> both expressions are listed and explained without any POV. So wouldn't be the same in Wikipedia? Worse indeed. Some users have already started <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a> and claim both articles mean different things!! . So explain to us how different they are please! It is clear that there is a difference between <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_mama.html" title="Big mama">Big mama</a> and <i>Big Mama</i>, between <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">bin Laden</a> and <i>Bin Laden</i> ("He's one of them bin-ladens") as refering to Arabs.</p>
<p>If we follow this trend we will end up having duplicate articles confusing readers and ourselves.</p>
<p>I still believe this article <b>have to be kept</b> but also <b>have to focus on the pejorative nature of the term</b> instead of claiming non-sense things relating state controlled business to fascism without any single reference! Do we have to include countries like France into that category?!! A break please!</p>
<p>Do we have to start an article called Americofascism (or whatever you name it) because of Guantanamo camp? It will be a total non-sense kind of article though I will give you this argument:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Islamic fascism" offers you 17,500 barrels of oil.</li>

<dd>Unlike some people on wikipedia, I can change my mind. I carefully reconsiddered what my understanding of the facts of the matter are and came to a new conclusion. Islamism and Fascism are distinctly separate idea's however many Islamist movements are inspired by fascists and may share elements of fascism. My current understanding is that <b>Islamofascism is a notable neologism used to describe sub-types of Islamism that share certain attributes (Anti western, pro Jihad, and seeking to create totalitarian Islamic societies)</b> At this point I don't think Islamofascism as a concept is deeply connected to fascism. How ever many Islamofascists, are inspired by people like the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Mufti_611d.html" title="Grand Mufti">Grand Mufti</a> who are undeniably fascist. In some countires the government is <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, or is influenced by Islamofascists (<a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>.

<p>Unfortunately, Brandon, this "patently offensive epithet" is just that--it is <i>not</i> a scientific term, and is therefore not bound by the need to fulfill any criteria whatsoever, other than its ability to get people to latch onto it. At the same time, however, there are three problems with what you're trying to do here. (1) You're basically trying to browbeat people into agreeing with your point of view by arguing in terms that really have, unfortunately, nothing whatsoever to do with the merits of the article. (2) You're using this logical subterfuge to cloud the issue: there is a phenomenon in the muslim world which this word was specifically coined to describe (which, frighteningly, has more in common with Hitlerian and Goebbelsian Nazism than it has to do with the more readily recognized forms of Spanish and Italian fascism). And (3) you've turned a VfD discussion into a freeforall. Stick to the subject matter. You've succeeded in derailing the relevant discussion (the de/merits of the article), and turned it instead into a discussion of how those who wish to keep the article, with whom you've been very unprofessionally adversarial, should really be doing original research instead. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 13:15, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I understand what you're saying, but I would ask you in turn how you would pursue a discussion of the "merits of the article" if it was <i>your</i> faith or nationality that had been targeted by an article's <b>patently offensive</b> underlying assumption/implication.</dd>
<dd>Let's begin here: Would you agree with me that it is possible that the reason some people want this article to stand independently is in order to lend some kind of legitimacy to a blatant religious slur?</dd>
<dd>With respect, the "merits" of such an analysis as appears in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> are not what we should be most concerned about. (And as a side note, I think my edits have substantially improved the "merits" of this particular piece, which should count for something.)</dd>
<dd>With regard to your points on the "phenomenon in the Muslim world" that you find disturbing. Let me draw a parallel.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The Cosa Nostra has for many years appropriated the <i>trappings</i> of Roman Catholicism in its rituals, meetings, initiations, etc.</li>
<li>The Cosa Nostra has also undertaken many loathsome crimes, including assassination, drug dealing, mass murder, extortion, etc.</li>
<li>Are members of the Cosa Nostra "Catholic"? Interesting question we could debate at length.</li>
<li>Do the actions of members of the Cosa Nostra represent a "phenomenon in the Christian world" that we would find disturbing? I think not. Rather, they are thugs.</li>
<li>Their actions represent a "phenomenon in the thug world," definitely disturbing, but not to be confused in a million years with Christianity or its teachings.</li>
<li>If someone were to write an article about, say, Catholic doctrine as reflected in Mafia hits, would you expect a Catholic to patiently discuss the reasoning in the article? Or would you expect that Catholic to tell you forthrightly that the very existence of the article was <b>patently offensive</b> and did not belong in WP? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 14:43, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Brandon, as I've pointed out previously, I think this should be a redirect, either to an article that deals with racism, anti-semitism, anti-westernism, or whatever, in the muslim world, or simply back to list of political epithets. I agree it's patently offensive, and while anti-semitism and anti-westernism are rampant in the arab world, there are other articles that deal with this already. The Islamofascism article had the potential to be a decent article at one time, but there are related issues, no matter how remotely, that are too close to the hearts of too many of us for it to long remain an NPOV article, unforunately. Deleting it altogether, however, is a bad idea, however, IMHO, because it will open up the slate for someone to start this whole machlochet again.

<p>I see that the issue is getting out of hand and being deflected to personal attacks instead of being a responsible discussion. We don't care too much about <b>keep</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>merge</b>, but we do care more about being reponsible. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">User:TShilo12</a> claims that <i>there is a phenomenon in the muslim world which this word was specifically coined to describe (which, frighteningly, has more in common with Hitlerian and Goebbelsian Nazism than it has to do with the more readily recognized forms of Spanish and Italian fascism)</i>. Are you serious??! Is this the point you are trying to <i>inject</i> into the article? Is this the <i>agenda</i> behind your support to keep the article? If yes, then I would really <b>Reconsider</b> my earlier <b>keep and merge</b> vote.</p>
<p>If your personal comments are based upon the <i>Grand Mufti</i>, than this excerpt is worth reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>...The most damaging development in this respect was itself the result of western meddling. When the Mufti (religious leader) of Jerusalem died in 1921, the recently appointed British Governor, Sir Herbert Samuel, took charge of appointing a successor, inventing the new title of ‘Grand Mufti’.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>When the local electoral college of pious Muslims voted for a moderate and learned leader and placed at the bottom of their list Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a young man in his twenties, given to fanaticism and hatred of the Jews, the Governor was initially content and confirmed the appointment. However, at this point the Hajj’s powerful family, backed by right-wing extremists, launched a fierce campaign of denigration against the electoral college, accusing its members of treacherously conspiring with the Jews to appoint one of their own party.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sir Herbert, who was himself Jewish, sought the counsel of E. T. Richmond, who acted as adviser on Muslim Affairs, and who was an extreme anti-Zionist. Richmond persuaded Sheikh Hisam al-Din, the man who had already been confirmed in the post, to stand down. He then convinced Samuel that the best way to restore order was to concede to the agitators by letting the Hajj become Grand Mufti. This was in spite of the fact that the Hajj had already been imprisoned by the British in 1920 for his role in fomenting vicious anti-Jewish riots.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The British themselves were thus responsible for turning an electoral process upside-down in order to install an extremist Palestinian leader. This abuse of power would have fateful consequences not only for the future of Israel but also for ordinary Palestinians who were now subjected to a leader they had not chosen but for whose ill-judged actions they would, in the years to come, repeatedly be held responsible...</i> -richard webster, <a href="http://www.richardwebster.net/israelpalestine.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.richardwebster.net/israelpalestine.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Statesman_f7c0.html" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_29.html" title="November 29">November 29</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>If that happened <i>yesterday</i> and explained today, what about <i>today</i>? Which relation is there between the muslim world which this word was specifically coined to describe (which, frighteningly, has more in common with Hitlerian and Goebbelsian Nazism than it has to do with the more readily recognized forms of Spanish and Italian fascism)?</p>

<dd>And no, nothing I said had anything to do with where the (deposed) "Grand Mufti" spent the bulk of WW2. What I'm referring to are the blood libels that fill the official state-run newspapers of such "moderate" countries as Egypt and Qatar, as well as the laws in such wonderful countries as "our friend" Jordan, prohibiting the sale of land to Jews, a "crime" that is punishible by death. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 17:27, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One other minor point tho...I would have said "Arab antisemitism" if it were limited to the Arab world, but, sadly, it's not.

<dd>Just because there has been a confusion between the explanation given for your <b>keep, but rename</b> and your comments relating the phenomenon to Nazis. I am with keeping it though I will not be against renaming it or even redirecting it. IMO, the problem is the potential duplication (i.e. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a>). But anyway, let's deal with this first.

<li><b>Agree</b> No concensus on any outcome. But the article iteself is constantly undergoing work. This suggests that its subject is notable and encyclopedic. And hence the final closure should be '<b>No Consensus-Keep</b>. Most of the arguments presented for deletion amount to an "appeal to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a>" noting that article covers a subject which may be offensive to some muslims.

<li>There's no such thing as <i>no consensus-keep</i> — it doesn't even make sense.</li>
<li>To say that most (or even many; indeed, <i>any</i>?) people have voted against merely because of political corretcness is absurd and insulting (and indicates that you have either not really read or not understood the arguments. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:15, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is not objective to delete articles such as Americofascism while keeping others such as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. I might as well create an article called <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a>. I see alot of hypocrisy with the people voting "keep" for this but "delete" for "americofascism". This is a <b>HATE</b> article, propaganda, and a hodgepodge of misconceptions and allegations.

<li>I'm afraid that you eem to have missed the point of the process. When you vote and give your reasons, that's when you say what you want to happen. If a clear majority doesn't agree with you, then it doesn't happen. By entering the process, you agree to that. In this case, it's likely that an unpleasant, bigoted article will remain on Wikipedia; that's sad, but it's unrealistic to expect that Wikipedia will be more rational and moral than the outside world. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 23:00, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is a crude tally of votes (and, as many of them were a bit vague, it's not even guaranteed to be pin-point accurate even then). The admin who has the unenviable task of sorting out this VfD won't just count votes, but will look at the arguments offered, and try to come to some conclusion concerning consensus.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think the admins themselves should decide this, not some of these bigots. It is Wikipedia policy to be fair, objective, and NPOV. If you want to be objective, you can not delete an article called Americofascism (it looks like this will be deleted) while keeping an article called <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. It's <b>HYPOCRISY!</b>. If one wants to discuss the authoritarianism in Islamic societies like <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, one is welcome to add information, as long as its NPOV, factual, and without the word "fascism".

<dd>Ok, thanks for clearing that up. But if this article is kept on Wikipedia, I'm still going to be working on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a>. Until <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> is deleted, I will bring <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a> to perfect featured article status, although it currently does not exist yet. I hope we'll be able to come to a compromise in the following days, if not, expect <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a> to grow! I'm doing this in the name of NPOV, because I don't believe it's right to allow this clearly biased article to exist. So in the end if all goes well both <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> and all others of these ridiculous -fascism suffix articles will be deleted.

<p>No. You should read the page to which I gave the link.
