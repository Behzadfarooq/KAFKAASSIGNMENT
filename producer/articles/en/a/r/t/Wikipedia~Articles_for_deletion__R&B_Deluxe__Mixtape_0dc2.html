<li><b>Comment</b>. It is not one of a series of releases. This is an unofficial mixtape with only a few hits on Google.

<li><b>Keep</b> If it has a cover, I see no reason why it shouldn't have a page.

<li><b>Comment</b> The real test would be if this was put out / leaked by her or simply a DJ compilation. Some artists such as Jadakiss and Method Man, release music that the label would not permit on a standard album onto a mixtape. Is this a case of that or is this just a DJ compilation and can it be proven the artist released this with permission or at least may have been leaked by them. Ways to determine this would be original track of high studio quality, hints by the artist, promotion of the CD by the artist, references to mixtape only tracks by the artists etc. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 20:46, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - whilst some notable artist are involved, this album seems to be designed not to be released to the public at large, a common practice as Zer0faults points out. Except in very extreme circumstances, unreleased = nn. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 20:54, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Its actually not a extreme circumstance, I didnt mean it to come out that way. Mixtapes have become a way for artists to connect to their audience through means not permitted by their parent companies and recording labels. For instance rapper Mos Def released a track called bin Laden, kind of accusing the Bush administration of knowing about 9/11 before it happened, this kind of track would never be released on an album as the label would never hear the end of it. Sometimes artists use mixtapes because contract limitations or label supression. In a more relevant example artist Lumidee releases her music soley on mixtape now as she resented her label turning her album into a R&amp;B type album, she is a self proclaimed rapper and her mixtape music focuses more on that since she can do it without label pressure. Its oddly enough becoming quite popular as means of expression without the label getting a say. Method Man released an entire album by this method in order to circumvent a force he felt in his label was destroying his music, removing all songs related to his favorite producer. Kanye West has released tracks on mixtapes before their release to find out how they will be taken by the public. Mixtapes are not as they started as DJ mixes that were unauthorized etc. This album <b>may</b> be as legit as any other album this artist has released, just without the support of her label/recording company. That is why I think more information is needed before classifying this. Sorry for the long statement, I just dont want people not to understand what I was trying to say, this phenomenon is actually very popular. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 00:03, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> I am voting keep because this artist meets the requirements of WP:MUSIC. Its also in my opinion a valid release as her debut has not been released yet and I believe this mixtape as extensive as it is, is a means of self promotion for the artist without label giving the green light. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 00:07, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<ul>
<li><b>delete</b> I changed my vote after finding out more information and reviewing the track listing, this is a DJ compilation as its not artist specific as I was under the original impression. Mixtapes like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freshmen_Adjustment_40a8.html" title="Freshmen Adjustment">Freshmen Adjustment</a> by <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanye_West_f668.html" title="Kanye West">Kanye West</a> are artist specific so I think they are to be held to a higher degree. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 00:11, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Per Zero Faults. I think it is rash to judge notability too quickly, especially if one is not necessarily familiar with a specific artist or genre, but a DJ mixtape is clearly not notable. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 05:57, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> This mixtape was released in conjunction with Capitol Records and in coordination with LeToya and her management. It was also featured on Letoyaonline.com, rapmullet.com, and others. This mixtape has reached an international level, and has assisted in the promotion of LeToya Luckett. I know this because I was one of the people behind the release of this mixtape. Both this, and Brandi Garcia's release were structured as promotional releases for LeToya Luckett's upcoming debut solo album. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.121.125.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.121.125.69_99eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.121.125.69">contribs</a>).</small></li>
