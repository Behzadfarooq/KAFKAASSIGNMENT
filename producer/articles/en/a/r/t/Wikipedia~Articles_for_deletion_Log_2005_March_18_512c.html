<ul>
<li>An operation with no real-world uses. Is now 2 months old, but has not been updated since it was just one day old. Is this article useful in any real way?? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 00:01, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, with possible <b>Merge</b> of a sentence or two. Something about "the idea of quintation" might fit into the hyper operators article, but quintation itself (having only a few non-trivial cases) doesn't need an article. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilthecow_3225.html" title="User:Philthecow">Philthecow</a> 00:25, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> -- a lot of mathematics (especially a lot of the work done by the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourbaki.html" title="Bourbaki">Bourbaki</a> group) stands on its own with no real relation to the real world. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 00:47, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but with reservations. Article needs cleanup and expansion. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 07:03, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As with Binilnilium, this kind of operation could basically be extended forever. It should correctly be named <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentation.html" title="Pentation">Pentation</a> though (quint = Latin, penta = Greek, and since tetration = Greek...) Google indicates that the term Quintation is in fact more commonly used in music. Since the content is already present at <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyper_operator.html" title="Hyper operator">Hyper operator</a> (which lists the entire class thereof), this text should be <b>deleted</b> and changed to a <b>redirect</b> to whatever the musical term is relevant to. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:09, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This operation is not used in the mathematical literature (or anywhere else as far as I know) and the article gives no information beyond the obvious. <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> 12:59, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, interesting article. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 20:15, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> under the heading of totally irrelevant mathematics. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:23, 2005 Mar 19 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. Draw the line at heptation maybe. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:17, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why the arbitrary distinction? I could write an equally interesting article on ikosatation. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:18, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because we <i>need</i> an arbitrary distinction. 2 of these isn't really enough, but 20 would be overkill. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:57, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, the proper term is pentation not quintation. Given Wikipedia's policy regarding not adding non-peer reviewed material and that no peer reviewed material exists, this page shouldn't exist. If Wikipedia wants to change this policy then I'd be happy to add non-peer reviewed material. I'm giving a talk next month where I will discuss how to define pentation for complex numbers, so if folks want to read non-peer reviewed material, I can help you out, but I don't think it would be a good idea. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Geisler_fdad.html" title="User:Daniel Geisler">Daniel Geisler</a> 08:43, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is the etymology of the word "oxymoron"? If it's Greek, then "oxymora" is the correct plural. I doubt it comes from the word "moron". As to your jocular plurals, note that "conundra" is a correct plural for "conundrum" but "kettledra" is not a correct plural for "kettledrum". <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 15:36, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it's Greek. I love derivations like these, hence my jokes with them (also 'boxen', 'pentia' etc). For reasons that elude me, Latin words such as conundrum tend to keep their Latin plurals even in English, but Greek words get English -s plurals. There are probably exceptions to both, though, and double plurals like 'museas'. I guess this is similar to English dropping suffixes from nearly all classical authors (e.g. 'Homer' rather than 'Homeros'). And I'd love to have some dra in my room&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 16:09, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li><s>Comment.</s> It's not "Liden" but Leiden. An indication of notability is the vigorousness of its website (linked from the article): take a look at the front page, and the amount that has been added just in the last week or so. The article therefore may have the potential to become encyclopedic. And I haven't a clue why anyone would object to the fact that its name is not in English. Why should it have a name in English? (Would you prefer it if <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matsushita.html" title="Matsushita">Matsushita</a> were "Under the Pine Tree", or indeed if <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodak.html" title="Kodak">Kodak</a> were an English name?)

I can't even find membership statistics on their homepage, so I'm having trouble adding verifiable facts. No doubt I'm looking in the wrong place, but as I said, I'm no rowing expert.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>, preferable <b>undelete and revert</b> to earlier, more nicely formatted versions. From the deletion policy: <i>If an article is repeatedly re-created by unassociated editors after being deleted, this should be seen as evidence for the need for an article.</i> I see no reason to delete a set of harmless placeholders; they will be needed when the scientific community learns about the properties of these elements. Okay, we likely have to wait some time for the discovery of Binilnilium, maybe delete all with atomic number &gt; 130? <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 18:38, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> NOT rhetorical. 1) Are these elements known to be physically possible in any meaningful sense, or are they just a mechanical exercise in applying IUPAC rules and extrapolating mathematical sequences? 2) For which of these elements are there laboratories actively pursuing their discovery? There's a big difference between saying "the source of the diamondiferous kimberlite float that occurs 900 metres west of the Jericho kimberlite has not been discovered," knowing that there must be such a source, and saying "a method of squaring the circle with ruler and compass has not been discovered." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:14, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> (house matters first). These elements will <i>without question</i> be produced in one of the world's particle accelerators. It is only a question of when. For practical purposes, the larger the atomic number, the more difficult it is to create an element, so lower numbers are on the job card first. I see no need, however, of creating articles with <i>extremely</i> generic names for elements whose properties will not be fully known until they are actually brought into existence. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:32, 2005 Mar 19 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I beg to differ. It is not without question that the elements will in fact ever be created, because of the amount of energy required. There is already talk of creating an <i>orbital</i> particle accelerator, since the existing ones on Earth (e.g. CERN) aren't big enough. Since the costs of such would be, well, astronomical, I find it highly dubious to assert that binilnilium for instance will ever be created anywhere. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:45, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Even an <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_of_stability.html" title="Island of stability">island of stability</a> only goes so far, and for most of these I think we'd need a collider the size of the solar system. In theory, we can build an arbitrarily large collider, and use it to synthesize arbitrarily large nuclei, and so we should have an entry for every single possible undiscovered element, from 120 to 100000000 and every integer in between. In theory, every vanity page should be saved, expanded, and heavily interlinked, because everyone is notable for an arbitrary definition of "notable". The currently-accepted model of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleosynthesis.html" title="Nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a> says this is simply not going to get made, ever, not even if we bankrupt our entire civilization (for the broadest possible definition of 'we' and 'civilization'). If you come up with a better model of nucleosynthesis <i><b>and a compelling reason to accept it</b></i>, then MAYBE there'll be a reason to have an entry for binilnilium. This is not like eka-silicon, where we already knew about several elements beyond the empty space. <b>Delete</b>, delete them all, and do <i><b>not not not not not not</b></i> create Undiscovered chemical elements unless you've come up with a radical new theory of nucleosynthesis. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 14:44, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep any that could conceivably exist</b>. There are plenty of concepts in math and science that can never exist in real life, but they can be modeled by computers and can be used to determine things about the elements that really do exist. Bear in mind, some of the heavier elements that <i>have</i> been manufactured in the lab have only existed for nanoseconds before falling apart, and yet they are not kicked out. Also, who knows what we may discover in this universe - perhaps conditions in black holes or other such phenomena are conducive to creating these elements. What we <i>do</i> know is that if such elements are ever created (or found to exist somewhere), they will be bound by the laws of physics to meet certain characteristics. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">BD2412</a> 20:37, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

Does someone know who the inventor of the driveway is? Will we solve the age old question of why we drive in a parkway and park in a driveway?

<dd>Well, when the original poster said it was a misunderstanding, and the dog project clearly identifies it as a valid article, it's misleading and confusing to leave the vfd on an article that everyone knows is not going to be deleted.

<li>Not to get contentious, but has anyone asking for a redirect read the article itself? zeros and ones (all lowercase) was the BBS <b>name</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary.html" title="Binary">Binary</a> is a disambiguation page and nothing in there refers to a BBS by name or BBS's in general. And, no, it was never named "zeroes and ones". And no, I don't maintain that the BBS originated the slogan; it was named after the slogan and adopted it as its motto. — <a href="../../../x/i/o/User%7EXiong_2293.html" title="User:Xiong">Xiong</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/o/User_talk%7EXiong_bb60.html" title="User talk:Xiong">talk</a>) 02:18, 2005 Mar 20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We realize that the article is about a BBS. The point is that we do not believe it to be a <i>notable</i> BBS that should have its own article, or even be mentioned in Wikipedia. And you are correct, since binary is a disambig, we should probably redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_numeral_system.html" title="Binary numeral system">Binary numeral system</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 05:43, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm sure I'm missing the point. The BBS has nothing whatever to do with the binary numeral system. It doesn't make any sense whatever to redirect a user who is looking for information about the BBS to a page discussing binary*anything. If the article <i>is</i> deleted, there's no point replacing it with a redirect. Nothing points to it that does not point to it in the sense of a BBS name; check it out.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I seriously doubt that many editors will create a link of the form <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zeros_and_ones.html" title="Zeros and ones">zeros and ones</a> that desires to point to the binary system of notation. The more common form, when discussing the binary system, is ones and zeros (118K Google hits vs. 74K)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "notable", well, gee, we've got at least 22 distinct articles, each one profiling a single <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> character. I admit I know little about Pokemon, but just shooting straight from the hip, I'd be willing to agree that whichever 1 or 2 characters are most important within the Pokemon world <i>might</i> be sufficiently "notable" to pass the test. But all 22? Not to mention (literally) dozens of articles about every detail and aspect of the world of Pokemon, including several categories, subcategories, and sub-sub categories. This is not so much a set of articles <i>about</i> Pokemon as a wikification of the game itself; I worry about infringement. Personally, I would not like to be the one to defend <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regirock.html" title="Regirock">Regirock</a> in a VfD. But you don't see me over there tearing it down, either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I offer a bone to those who, I suspect, doubt the mere existence of zeros and ones. I believe it is still in operation; at any rate the domain is up: <a href="http://zerosandones.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://zerosandones.org/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. If you're wondering why there is no content on the page other than a pretty background, it's probably because they are inside discussing, among other things, hacking, phreaking, piracy, and all the other <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">3l33t</a> topics BBSs were known for. Like most former dial-ups, I suspect they've made the transition to the net, but you'd need a First Class client to connect. I'll see if I can dig that out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Searching for tracks of this BBS on the web may be very difficult. BBSs, taken together, were an extremely closed world in some ways. Many illegal things were discussed (and some done), plus an aura of danger, secrecy, and mystique was cultivated for its own sake. Each BBS maintained lists of other BBSs, but these lists were not published in other media (for obvious reasons). The rise of the net, with similar subcultures, coincided with and brought about the decline of the dial-up BBS; users made the transition, but few systems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While researching, I have come across a few more recent references to entities <b>named</b> "zeros and ones". If this article survives, I should like it renamed to zeros and ones BBS; <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zeros_and_ones.html" title="Zeros and ones">zeros and ones</a> itself should be a disambiguation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have no idea why this article upsets Wikipedians so much. I find it hard to believe it is just that we feel this BBS was insufficiently influential -- I'd be happy to reduce the claim if that would satisfy anyone. In some way, the article must touch a raw nerve or violate a taboo, and I do wish Somebody would be more explicit.</dd>

<li>When dealing with websites and BBS's, Wikipedia tends to only have articles on those that are notable. There are literally millions of BBSs on the web. Having articles for all of them would be unencyclopedic. Your analogy with Pokemon is falacious, because while Pokemon may not be important in the grand scheme of life, Pokemon is instantly recognizable to a large number of people, and therefore notable in its own right. The bottom line is that zeros and ones is not notable enough to merit an article in Wikipedia. Therefore the only options are to either delete it outright, or to redirect somewhere that it might do some good. Since <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zeros_and_ones.html" title="Zeros and ones">zeros and ones</a> is a conceivable search string someone might use when searching for the binary numeral system, I argue that we should redirect there. Hope this explaination is helpful. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 07:01, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It doesn't touch a nerve or violate a taboo with me. I've been part of the BBS scene and there are thousands of BBS'es, for many of which the claims you make about illegal discussions or happenings, or society impact, are equally valid. The point is that the BBS scene as a whole is notable and merits articles, but an individual BBS in general does not (along the same lines, we have articles on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> but not on each individual website). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 13:01, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've been in touch with Gil Burns, the zeros and ones sysop. He says the BBS (like so many of its time) is no longer running, but he has graciously sent me some of the old graphics, which I intend to unpack and add to the article.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think the discussions of blue boxes and occasional exchange of contraband were themselves "notable". Rather, it was the spirit in which these discussions were conducted -- often acrimonious -- and the philosophy which enabled the community to survive contention: <i><b>It's all just <a href="../../../x/i/o/User%7EXiong_Zeros_and_ones_BBS_962d.html" title="User:Xiong/Zeros and ones BBS">zeros and ones</a>!</b></i> While I don't assign credit to the BBS for originating the slogan, it did assume it as its name and put it forward at every opportunity; thus the BBS is a notable step in the slogan's etymology.</dd>

<dd>I <i>didn't</i> compare zeros and ones to Pokemon. I compared an article on zeros and ones to the article <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regirock.html" title="Regirock">Regirock</a>.

<dd>"Regirock was sealed away by people long ago....Its body is composed entirely of rocks." Well, that is certainly notable.

<li>I believe that live humans are more <i>important</i> than characters from pokemon. But not necessarily more <i>notable</i>. Regirock is instantly recognizable to hundreds of thousands of pokemon fans. Can you say that your BBS is instantly recognizable to hundreds of thousands of people? None of this is relevant, because an article must be notable in its own right. The fact that there exists an article that you think is less notable has no bearing on whether this one should be kept. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 18:51, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is what has happened to this article so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>This page was initially created as vandalism; most likely an attack.</li>
<li>I nominated for deletion. (see below)</li>
<li>During the debate <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">User:Remes</a> made a commendable rewrite of the article, but apart of him, only one person, yours truly, commented on it (I changed my vote from delete to weak delete).</li>
<li>The article was deleted.</li>

<li>I have now submitted this for deletion again for a new debate.</li>

<p>My vote is still <b>delete</b>. I know it may seem paradoxical that I keep voting keep on fictional Pokémon characters and delete on real people; but I think that fictional characters are often known to more people, and therefore more notable.

I'm not voting in this VfD, although I'm not going to be sad if it get deleted. It would be nice if someone who knew about academic mathematics could say whether his articles are notable or not, since I don't really accept a Google test as a reasonable gauge one way or the other in this case. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">Remes</a> 19:13, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have just rewritten this article as a stub about the real R.E. Lee DeVille. I have absolutely no knowledge of mathematics, so I can't say whether he's notable, although I doubt it, since essentially he's a postdoc at NYU. Someone who knows more about math could look at it and comment here about whether he's worth keeping in. Also, my stub is really inadequate, because I can't really understand his CV or his research interest statement. Again, someone who knows more about math could do much better than I did. Anyway, I'm going to withhold a vote at all now, because while this is no longer the attack or nonsense that it was before, I'm still not sure whether he's sufficiently notable or not. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">Remes</a> 22:58, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Still <b>delete</b> but weakened, Remes has made a valiant attempt at saving this page, and the page is no longer an attack (or perhaps a self-deprecating vanity?). I do not think that Deville passes the <i>average college professor</i> bar (I believe that has been the standard on whether to keep or delete such articles) for notability however, being an associate research scientist would suggest that he does not.

<li>Ah, I just typed that and got an edit conflict&#160;:) anyway if you see a copyvio, you should blank the article and slap a {copyvio} tag on it, then list it on the page indicated by that tag.
<ul>
<li>Comment: IMO the policy on what to do if a copyvio is already listed here is not terribly clear in some cases, but to now list this one as a copyvio seems a complete waste of time to me. It will not make deletion any faster, and will make it a lot more complicated. What's the point? Ideally, check for copyvios <b>before</b> listing on VfD, and list pure copyvios in the proper place and not here. In this case, the copyright owner will probably give permission anyway, and the VfD case is strong, so surely just VfD is the go.

<p>This operating system appears to be the creation of a single person as a hobby. Very few google references exist, other than Wikipedia or DMOZ mirrors, and other uses of the unrelated word "bugos". I don't think an operating system someone wrote themselves as a hobby that is historically insignificant, insignificant in terms of operating systems research, has insignificant production use, and which no one seems to have heard of, is sufficiently notable to warrant inclusion in wikipedia. Sure, its a cool thing to write your own operating system (I've always wished I had done it), and it takes some effort.

<li><b>Delete</b> <b>Non-Notable</b> Article was created by user Daniel C.Boyer in 2003 to promote Surrealist Movement in the United States. A Google Search yields over 19,000 hits for World Surrealist Exhibiton, note that those are keywords. The first page of hits on Google are for the Wikipedia Article and various encyclopedias. This, "1976 World Surrealist Exhibition" was only a local art event held in Chicago back in 1976 (that did exhibit over 500 artworks from relatively unknown, "surrealists") yet is not notable ebough to warrant any attention from the International Art Scene and Art Historians. This event was referenced in the book edited by Franklin Rosemont, "What is Surrealism", who was also organizer of self-promoted event. Note that the editor, Franklin Rosemont (a noted labor historian and self-described surrealist) claims to be the one chosen by Andre Breton to lead surrealism after his death. No credible evidence can prove that this man even met Breton. His event, "1976 World Surrealist Exhibition" was never acknowledged by art historians and surrealism experts like Mary Ann Caws. A very misleading article that should not be referenced as credible by students and researchers studying surrealism. Not Notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There is so much wrong with this it's difficult to know where to begin, but here's a shot:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Classicjupiter2 assumes bad faith on my part by saying that I created the article to promote the Surrealist Movement in the United States but fails to give any support for this bald assertion.</li>
<li>Classicjupiter2 states that this was a "local art event," but unless he is using "local" in a highly idiosyncratic way (every event takes place in some locale) it is certainly strange to describe something in which people from 31 countries participated as "local".</li>
<li>Franklin Rosemont never claimed that he was selected by Andre Breton to lead surrealism. I would challenge Classicjupiter2 to give me any source on this. He won't be able to because it never happened.</li>
<li>The World Surrealist Exhibition was extensively (if somewhat negatively) covered in the mainstream press.</li>
<li>Mary Ann Caws being an "expert" on surrealism is certainly open to debate. ("Too many gaps [in history of surrealism she acknowleges, i.e. post-1966] to establish credibility." I might also say, "Classicjupiter2, can you produce a picture of Mary Ann Caws? How do we know she even exists? Who is this person? Did she ever meet Breton and why don't we have a picture of them together?" but I won't.) --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C.

<li>How come this is the only one of the numerical prefix articles being put on Vfd?? Well, because most of the numerical prefix articles are stubs, a probable future of them would be to merge the info and re-direct it to the number article itself; that is to re-direct this article to <a href="../../../2/_/%28/2_%28number%29.html" title="2 (number)">2 (number)</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 21:09, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Because no-one has got around to the others, yet. Most of the articles in Category:Numerical prefixes are dictionary entries duplicating Wiktionary articles in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_prefixes" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Category:English_prefixes">Wiktionary:Category:English prefixes</a>. And Wiktionary simply does a far better job of these things. Wiktionary knows that the prefix is actually <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hecto-" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:hecto-">Wiktionary:hecto-</a> and not <a href="../../../h/e/c/Hecta-.html" title="Hecta-">hecta-</a> as Wikipedia has it, for example. Wiktionary also has etymologies, translations, and better word lists for these prefixes. <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_numerical_prefixes.html" title="Latin numerical prefixes">Latin numerical prefixes</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_numerical_prefixes.html" title="Greek numerical prefixes">Greek numerical prefixes</a> should (at the very least) be lists of interwiki links <i>to the Wiktionary articles</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:47, 2005 Mar 19 (UTC)</li>
