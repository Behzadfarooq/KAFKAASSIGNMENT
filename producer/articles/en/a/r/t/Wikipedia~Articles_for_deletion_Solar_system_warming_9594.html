<li><b>keep</b> My first gut reaction was to keep (but mainly just to offset a few above who are saying delete on political grounds) However, doing that is not good for Wikipedia, so I did a search for "solar system warming" and I was surprised at the number of references. A few described "solar system warming" as a term for the idea that global warming is caused by an increase in output energy from the sun. Secondarily the article has only been edited for two days -it clearly has been jumped on by some people with a very political stick. As far as I can see, it satisfies the main test of being a real term, the second test of being notable I'm not sure about, the argument that "it's not true" - if that were a valid argument then bang would go reincarnation, christianity, etc. It will do no harm to Wikipedia to leave it a few months to allow the editors to develop the article at which point we will know better whether it is worth keeping. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 09:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> Mike - if you do a google search for "solar system warming" - you do not find anything but blogs and occational political pages (at least on the 12 result pages on google) - so i really can't see that argument as valid.

<li><b>Response</b> Kim, not true. With a little effort you can find scientific works on the subject including the book I cite below. At this point, I do not know the level of scientific consensus on the subject but I do know that others have discussed the question. There is no reason why all of the evidence cannot be presented in this article, which is obviously interesting to many Wikipedia readers.<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 11:10, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article does need work, but it is far too early to delete. Many Wikipedia readers are interested in the subject of observed warming on other planets. The fact other planets are warming is not debated by anyone.

There is no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">published</a> evidence for a coordinated warming of the planets (of course they all warm for about half of their orbital period and then cool for the other half, as their distance to the sun changes). --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 10:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Response:</b> The book "Solar Activity and Earth's Climate" by Rasmus E. Benestad discusses solar activity and climate change on Earth and also looks at other planets in the solar system. The author writes: "We will glean some information from two other earth-like planets, Venus and Mars, as well as the Moon, and compare these to our own Earth. Both the planets have an atmosphere which exhibit similar features as well as different attributes to the Earth's atmosphere. If variations in the Sun produce changes in the Earth's climate, one may expect to see similar fluctuations in the brightness temperature on Venus and perhaps Mars." (page 4) <a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=bZm3efIPqF0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;sig=RHNXBaObTJZi9e8wXH6oUX3nhZM&amp;dq=Mars+warming+solar+irradiance&amp;hl=en#PPA4,M1" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=bZm3efIPqF0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;sig=RHNXBaObTJZi9e8wXH6oUX3nhZM&amp;dq=Mars+warming+solar+irradiance&amp;hl=en#PPA4,M1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This is just one example of evidence showing that the Sun's role in warming on other planets is a subject of scientific interest. The effort to delete this page is purely an effort to censor information rather than deliver information to Wikipedia readers. Stephan, your theory is interesting and may even be factual. I have not seen any citation to back it up and if the article is deleted, you will not have a place to provide me with a citation. It is important the article be kept.<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 11:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ron, that book is a useful resource, and, from what I can tell, at a glance, a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. But it does not talk about <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_system_warming.html" title="Solar system warming">Solar system warming</a>, but only some effects of solar variations on Moon, Mars, and Venus. If you read a sentence beyond your quote, you will see that the author acknowledges the lack of data about temperatures on other planets. I don't know what you call "my theory", the fact that planets warm and cool as they follow their elliptical orbit is not a "theory" (in either the scientific or the common sense), but indeed a fact. And btw, the book seems to fully accept and support the IPCC positions...--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 12:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Stephan, I did not mean to imply the book supported the article. I quoted it because it shows that this is a scientific question that has been raised and is worthy of discussion. Since the book is now five years old, the lacking time series for temperature may exist. At the very least, the temperature record is five years longer than it was then. Your "theory" has to do with planetary seasons. The fact seasons exist is a fact and not a theory. However, applying the fact to the observed warming is a theory. While the theory may be correct regarding some of the more distant planets and moons (which have very long orbits), it seems to be wholly unsatisfactory for Mars which orbits the Sun about every 2 years and has been undergoing warming for a decade or two. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 13:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> I've read in numerous books and seen in documentaries that planet climate change could be caused by stars' temperature fluctuations or the path the solar system takes through the galaxy.

The article needs work as it talks little about these theories and concentrates on observed effects on Mars, whereas I think it should concentrate on the theories themselves. But admittedly, it's still a stub. On another note, why should we keep <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda-Milky_Way_collision_33aa.html" title="Andromeda-Milky Way collision">this article</a> but delete this one, as both are proposed theories? <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcemuon_5e0d.html" title="User:Icemuon">Icemuon</a> 12:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a valid subject. This does have things writen about it. The fact that it is currently a bad article, and needs more sources doesn't mean it should be deleted. I only created it the other day as a stub, and it has already grown to this size. Obviously it is going to need a lot of clean-up, refference additions, etc... however, I do not think that it should be deleted. Also, conserning the Global Warming articles, I testify to the above, it does seem they have been hijacked by a few administrators, specificly <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>. I happened upon this when looking up <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_cooling.html" title="Global cooling">Global cooling</a>, and noticed that (at least at the time) it was writen like an attack that made the topic almost not readable, and mostly consisted of an attack on it with <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a>... and yet it was deffended by him and others. I do not know if it is the same way still. However, I feel that a more neutral-to-the-subject administrator should look into it. I'm not advocating anyone's position... just pointing out that the problem does seem to be real. Anyway, I suggest this article be cleaned up. If you want to take all the unproven things to the talk page, or just remove them, I would have no problem with that. I would have no problem if this was reduced to very little for now. However, the researchable and salvageable information should maybe be taken to the talk page until something can be done with this. Just some ideas.

<li><b>KEEP</b> This is a valid subject, and an interesting one to many WP readers.

The POV fork accusation cannot hold since Mr. Arritt, along with some regular acquaintances who have voted for deletion on this page, have kept this subject out of any global warming related article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Mr. Arritt, myself, and the other editors advocating deletion have done so for one reason only: to maintain some level of scientific credibility on Wikipedia (that was why I noted Rameses claims above). Wikipedia is not a forum for pseudoscience. I know the levels of debate surrounding the global-warming articles, but this is not related to them. It is merely nonsense. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 16:57, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Nice POV essay, although a bit short. I appreciate that you admitted your desire to "cleanse" Wikipedia of the stuff you disagree with. On the other hand, if Wikipedia is not a forum for pseudoscience, it is neither a forum for one-sided POVs. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 17:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: How is it nonsense? I can understand the page itself being a bit of a problem as it is, being only a day old; however, what makes the subject itself nonsense? It is certainly spoken of. It is certainly writen about. Not as much as <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Warming_8f17.html" title="Global Warming">Global Warming</a>, and maybe not as much as <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_cooling.html" title="Global cooling">Global cooling</a> but it is still a theory that is out there that an encyclopedia should cover. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadanYagci_70f6.html" title="User:SadanYagci">SadanYagci</a> 17:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Theories are like opinions and azzholes, everyone has one. Now the decision is which theory is notable enough to be encyclopedic content and which one is for the sole purpose of political debate on "message boards"? Do we include every message board theory created to discredit global warming or just the ones that are being actively debated in the scientific community? If it is an active scientific debate or theory, lets see the refs stating its an actual theory? --<a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_already_forgot_0fa6.html" title="User:I already forgot">I already forgot</a> 17:24, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Meta-Comment</b>: My statements above are not POV pushing. They are a statement of the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pseudoscience_f6ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience">ArbCom decision on pseudoscience</a>, which says that Wikipedia must be consistent with present scientific consensus. This particular article is nonsense for the reasons given for deletion by other editors here. Note also: everyone has been mis-using 'theory'. This implies consistency with existing data, which this article does not have (no, we will not have a forty-post argument about that, because that is not the purpose of this discussion). So 'theory' doesn't work. I need a word for such things, but 'nonsense' works well. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 17:36, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>reluctant keep</b>. It's not that the article is good, and it's not that the subject is well established, but nevertherless it is a notable subject, it was in the papers and so forth. Due to that, I think we should keep it and simply add the 10-20 references that would completely demolish it. It seems to me that most of the above arguments are based on a disagreement with the POV the article is currently largely slanted towards, but that just says that the article need more POV/information the other way to show how dumb it is. It's worse to not have an article on this topic than to have one, if it's well researched and referenced.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 18:34, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> My main objection is that they do not present a reliable source presenting the theory. I see here original research in the form of synthesis of weak sources while ignoring better evidence which refutes it. See <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_variation.html" title="Solar variation">Solar variation</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_constant.html" title="Solar constant">Solar constant</a> which are better articles addressing the output of the sun. Astronomical observation of the sun is a far more legitimate index of solar output than ice on the Martian pole melting. The article appears to be a POV argument lacking adequate sources based on an indirect index. It is like claiming low water pressure in the house based on a teenager taking too long in the shower, while ignoring a water pressure meter. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 18:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
