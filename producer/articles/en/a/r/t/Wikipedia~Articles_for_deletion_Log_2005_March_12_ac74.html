<li><b>Comment: Ephebiphobia</b> has 1,850 hits, which I think is the term the guy MEANT to write. As another note, it's also misspelled on <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">Phobia</a>, but not <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phobia.html" title="-phobia">-phobia</a>. Also, the page itself is fairly POV. Pay close attention to the "Pathological Forms" section, and you'll see what I mean. "Humiliating an underage adolescent in public"?

<li><b>Comment: Redirect to Ephebiphobia</b>. Ephebiphobia is the right word, and it has more hits in Google than Ephebophilia (which has only 950 hits - shouldn't be the case for deleting also this word&#160;?). Ephebiphobia has been mentioned so far in 15 news articles in the US alone, according to the Newslibrary.com, and there are other English-speaking countries. It is listed in the About.com official psychology glossary. The word is also listed in the NYRA (National Youth Rights Association) Glossary (see www.youthrights.net), whose website is affiliated to the Wikipedian system. It is also mentioned in several phobia guides across the net. It is the title of a Conference in Alberta, Canada, to be held next April, 2005. It fits Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion of words.</li>
<li><b>Content</b>. I've just created <b><a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebiphobia.html" title="Ephebiphobia">ephebiphobia</a></b> copying the previous content of ephebophobia. Anyone who dislikes part of the content has the opportunity to edit it. That's what Wikipedia is all about.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not about promoting newly-invented wrods. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 05:16, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This character is so minor that he is mentioned in exactly one sentence of the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, to state that he had been shot. I don't see how a character mentioned once in passing even warrants an entry on a list of minor characters, let alone a whole entry. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 00:55, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to discourage recreation. Do not merge unless perhaps someone feels like adding a "list of Orcs named by Tolkien". I am generally all in favor of Tolkien-related articles, but this is ridiculous. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 04:19, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep or merge. I'm curious to see how much LOTR fans can write about this obscure character. They can always redirect and merge it themselves if they can't expand it, you know. VfD doesn't have to do everything. It's a better approach to let something like this be handled by editors interested in the subject. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:16, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am interested in this subject, and the problem is that there is no room for expansion on this character. The character's entire role is to be mentioned. Nothing is said of who he was, what kind of orc he was, or even what he did. Again, the only time his name appears in the entire trilogy is to say, and I quote, he and another orc "ran through [the gate], but they were shot." Not a single other reference is ever made to him. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 12:31, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suppose. What about whoever started the article, or made that table at the bottom, what do they think? Personally I think a redirect to a list of similar minor characters could be a good idea, but I've never read the books or even seen the movies, so I'm not qualified to say, really. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:35, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I <i>am</i> qualified to say. There is really, truly nothing more to add. I'm not even convinced a list would be useful, but I suppose we could list Orcs somewhere. (It wouldn't be hard. There aren't very many of them.) -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 14:37, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: In the satirical game MUNCHKIN, there is a monster card "2,614 Orcs". I would consider that "very many of them" if they were trying to kill me and take a ring from me. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 16:31, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>OK, well, whatever you think is best. I'm sure a reasonable solution could be reached without involving an already massively bloated VfD. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:41, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On what basis is it self-promotion -- why do you believe a member of the Cantabria Surrealist Group created this? Or have you decided to strip the adjective self-promotion of all meaning by using it in a very vague way synonymous with non-notability, which is a very different thing? On what basis do you think the Cantabria Surrealist Group is a hoax?

<dd>You guessed wrong. Now, I never said the article was created by a member of that group, or that it wasn't notable. I said that it (in combination with the flurry of other surrealist articles) is a hoax, a stealth platform for ads. Please feel free to do whatever self-promotion you can, that's part of being an active surrealist and that's ok (Dali did it, after all), but not here please, since WP is not a promotional resource. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 05:46, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's becoming increasingly clear that you don't know what the word "hoax" means -- or do you really think the Cantabria Surrealist Group has no existence outside of the Wikipedia article and was created for the purpose of playing a practical joke on Wikipedia readers, or some other ulterior motive inclusive of the <i>nonexistence</i> of the group? <i>Give me a break</i>. Could you stop with these idiosyncratic attempts to strip words of meaning. Oh, and the period of Dali's greatest self-promotion was after he and surrealism parted ways, and is certainly not characteristic of surrealism. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> While, so far, I have listed each VfD surrealist article for deletion it is due to the fact that they 1) do not establish notability other than stating that they exist 2) give a very <i>brief</i> idea of where they are located and who their founders are and 3) provide you external links and nothing more, even though a few have been listed as stubs for <i>several months</i>. If we find one that is in the process of development, or, contains more than 1), 2), and 3), it will then be a different story. But, based on the pattern of blitz-submission of ongoing surrealist articles, I stand by my speedy delete vote for the majority of these articles that come to VfD. <a href="../../../t/y/g/User%7ETygar_df57.html" title="User:Tygar">Tygar</a> 09:18, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nothing more than a stark admission of anti-surrealist POV. Every article should be considered on its own merits, not as to whether it is part of a pattern. Clearly some of these groups could be notable and others not, none of them could be notable, or they all could be notable, but the notability of one should not be artificially linked to whether the existence of other articles is justified. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<ul>
<li>In the case of articles that are primarily the work of a single contributor, the nature of the past articles submitted by the contributor is relevant. For example, if an article is proved to be an actual hoax, other contributions from the same account will probably be deleted with only cursory due diligence. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a> is always available to correct any mistakes.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm now going to irritate everyone by vacillating. I've been brooding about this and have concluded that on the basis of Classicjupiter2's description and an inspection of Daniel C. Boyer's recent edits, the surrealist-related articles don't really rise to the level of vandalism. It's not as if they were being rapidly created in defiance of consensus, or anything like that. So I've decided to unprotect and revert the article and let VfD run its course. This doesn't mean I think the article should be kept, just that I think I was needlessly precipitous. Sorry.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I do see these "Surrealist Group" articles as vandalism (never mind if they've slipped through the cracks for awhile or if the odd one now and then happens to describe an existing group), and also noticed (when I checked it the other day) that <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<dd>I'm shocked... <i>shocked</i>... to see this blatant evidence of self-promotion by surrealists! (grin) More power to 'em, truth be told, 'cause surrealism can blow out the cobwebs now and again. Dali (to use an example everyone's heard of) had loads of talent in addition to being a shameless self-promoter and huckster. I'm not too keen on the ol' melting watch motif, but he did a couple of things in the late 40s (<a href="http://www.revilo-oliver.com/Kevin-Strom-personal/Art/Leda_Atomica.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.revilo-oliver.com/Kevin-Strom-personal/Art/Leda_Atomica.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://itf.fys.kuleuven.ac.be/~jordi/art/dali.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://itf.fys.kuleuven.ac.be/~jordi/art/dali.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) that I actually like. Whatever talent <i>these</i> guys have isn't the pith of it, though. WP's not for self-promotion, or advertising, or auto-bios, or stealth spam. Funny thing is, if they put some of this same energy into getting some real-world exhibitions, performance art, local press coverage or whatever, I'll bet they could weasel into WP by the rules (heh heh). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 06:13, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Read the <i>Manifesto of Surrealism</i> to see what Breton and surrealism thinks about "talent" ("Forget about your genius, your talents, and the talents of everyone else").

<li>Wyss's talk page will show Daniel's inability to prove anything factual concerning this matter. One of the best books recently written on Surrealism was by Kristen Strom, called, "Making History" (it came out around 2002) and it focuses mainly on the surrealist groups of the 20's and 30's. It shows you the pictures, writings, etc., etc., of group members together and seperate, but what I am getting at is, you have facts right in front of you, that prove that there were active surrealist groups. Upon researching surrealism from its beginnings up to now (2005), one needs to ask oneself, why so very little material on contemporary surrealists that can be easily validated, especially in this day and age of Real-Time Internet, Media, etc., etc., and all the reference material that you can get on the current, "surrealist" groups is mainly an article on Wikipedia, with two to four sentences.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You are at it again, with the "Real-Time Internet" [sic] &amp;c. You do realise that books, newspapers, magazines still exist, right? Why are you continuing to duck the question of why you discount them? What about the fact that at least one of the "surrealist groups of the 20's and 30's" (you give no reason whatsoever as to why you have picked these decades out of a hat) -- The Czech Group -- continues to exist today and has had an uninterrupted history since that time? Not that I agree with your characterisation; what you are mainly doing is excluding reference sources that go against you, based on a variety of ever-shifting excuses. Oh, I know, "too many gaps to establish credibility". --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 15:57, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Then why is there practically next to zilch online that the public can research regarding their: Exhibits, Documented Group Activity (in newspapers and any press. Breton and co. used to get tons of press back in the day, from the 20's up until the 60's) Protests, etc.,etc., etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>And the Chicago Surrealist Group, e.g. has gotten tons of press in <i>The New Yorker</i>, in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition in <i>Art News</i> &amp;c. Oh, but these are not legitimate sources because they are not online.

<li>Granted you have a menu of Geocities websites, self-made do-it-yourself websites like the bogus, "surrealcoconut" (that Boyer is also on) and PLENTY of Wikipedia articles, no less, that tell you that contemporary surrealism is an active movement, but why is there so much protest from their main promoter here on Wikipedia, Daniel C. Boyer? The reason is clear: Your exposure to the public is very rewarding if you have an article on Wikipedia, where it can be mirrored, replicated and placed on practically every single encyclopedia website on the net.

<dd>Daniel, as for The Chicago Surrealist Group, you or somebody should provide the references and sources that you keep on mentioning. Then I will change my vote on that article. As for all the other articles, you better explain why you are using the Wikipedia service to promote your friends. You still provide no evidence. Your friend, <b>Eric W.Bragg's statement on how to promote your surrealism online</b> certainly proves that your assertions on an active surrealist movement is a hoax. "...no need to rely on Wikipedia then". Busted!<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 17:37, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am hardly "busted" because of this latest entry in your pattern of mischaracterisations which it is difficult to see as other than deliberate. Bragg is essentially saying that one cannot count on Wikipedia articles to accurately discuss surrealism. Saying that his statements prove that "an active surrealist movement is a hoax" is such a reach (it might be a hoax, it might not be a hoax, but clearly his statement wouldn't control that) is hardly worth discussing. You are certainly aware of <i>Arsenal</i>, <i>Surrealist Subversions</i>, <i>WHAT Are You Going to Do About It?</i>, <i>S. U. RR.</i>, <i>Anologon</i>, the World Surrealist Exhibition, "Totems Without Taboos", &amp;c., &amp;c., yet if my guess is correct you will find some reason that all of these are fraudulent. This, however, will be nothing more than a (novel) POV, a POV to be discussed in the relevant article(s) but certainly not a basis for deletion. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<dd>What denial! I am not going to argue surrealism here with you Daniel. This is an open source encyclopedia that is based on the presentation of facts in the articles on here. You are busted. Eric W.Bragg's statement proves it, and that is just one piece of evidence. You had every opportunity to provide your evidence to back up your articles and the votes prove that they are a hoax. Granted, I will recognize the Chicago Surrealist Group as a group, but I see the obvious (again I really do not want to argue here), that it is a group of artists and poets that allege to be the chosen representatives of Surrealism. Mr.Rosemont (and his wife) both have built their artistic careers on the notion that they met Andre Breton, and if I was an historian, I would have much difficulty in believing them that they had direct contact with him. Granted, I believe that they went to Paris and that they attended an exhibition while Breton may have been present, but the "facts", presented in Rosemont's account is very vague and too many obvious gaps. Dan, if you were a role model of mine, (and if you were the greatest influence on me and my beliefs), and if we were writing letters to each other for 3 years, then I get the chance to meet my role model and hero(you), I certainly would document that in a picture for history no less.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Notice how Rosemont's reputation in the art world is only limited to Chicago, or am I wrong again? You love pointing out that I am wrong, but I see the obvious. Anyway, forget Rosemont and his group for the moment, the issue here is the promotion of your friend's groups and that is being examined here on this VfD by fellow Wikipedians. Why do I have to go through all the trouble to verify your articles? Why does it take a VfD to ,(all of a sudden), get you to start coming up with such informative answers that are still vague and really baseless? Dan, you keep on shifting the examination here? If you are going to promote your friends on here, at least give us something more than two to four sentences and practically next to nothing on a topic that is going to be mentioned in an encyclopedia no less! Dan, have you really read the feedback posted by the fellow Wikipeidans?</p>
<p>As for the Chicago Group, I will change my vote on the exception that I recognize them as a commercial outlet for retrospective surrealism from 1967 to 2003. Dan, have you noticed when the last time that Chicago upgraded their website? Anyway, the other articles are a hoax. These are your friends that only do all this as a platform for exposure. Look at your friends forum.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 21:38, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

I recommend that you get a hold of pictures(fast) of these people to try to save your articles, just to at least prove that they exist.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 21:38, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If anyone is even going to think about keeping this page it needs major work. It's written assuming the reader knows exactly who all the recurring characeters are, and most of the brief synopses are utterly uninformative. You know how sometimes a friend will try to tell you something really funny he saw on TV the other night, but screws it up so badly that it's not only unfunny but nonsensical? That's this article. I also wonder if this article is even accurate. There's an entry (a sketch I guess it's suppsoed to be) that only reads "1-800-EAT-SHIT". It says absolutely nothing, and is very possibly a prank. You can't say "shit" on TV, even after 11:30. A few hundred other articles written like this would be a travesty for wikipedia. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:00, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a list for the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a> episode articles currently on VfD. There's definitely a place for lists of sketches, characters, etc., but a list of individual episodes doesn't really serve a purpose. The big, crucial difference between SNL and most shows that have a lot of articles on WP is that on SNL, sketches and recurring characters are far more notable than individual episodes. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green">/s…™zl√¶k</font></a><a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak"><font color="green">À∫/</font></a> 09:27, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. But, expand the article to include all the trivial information that is in the Saturday Night Live Episode #### articles so this becomes one GIGANTIC article. Delete all the individual show-numbered articles as being borderline spam, pure triviality, or unencyclopedic/not notable with respect to the larger purpose of Wikipedia. If this gigantic page gets too gigantic because the information can't be condensed, then I would suggest "List of Saturday Night Live Episodes 1-500" and "List of Saturday Night Live Episodes 500-1000", or something similar, that doesn't result in the blitzing of short, show-specific, individual SNL articles. <a href="../../../t/y/g/User%7ETygar_df57.html" title="User:Tygar">Tygar</a> 10:25, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Having articles on individual episodes of SNL makes no sense. The reason we can have an article on an episode of, for example, Star Trek, is because Star Trek episodes have a central unifying plot.

<li>Using subst: expands the tag, so changes in diffs are easier to spot.

<ul>
<li>Which changes are easier to see? it is perfectly easy to see when a non-subst vfd-tag has been added or removed. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 15:46, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Really? Some people don't use the Edit Summary field for adding the tag, and vandals occasionally remove it usually without touching the edit summary. When you're looking at a diff, {{vfd}} doesn't stand out, whereas the removal of a whole bunch of lines does. Also beware of unauthorised changes to the template reflecting on every page that has it included directly. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 21:24, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not convinced; at least I am capable to see the removal of {{vfd}} in a diff. Vandalism of the template doesn't happen often enough, and is corrected quickly enough, that it doesn't convince me to use subst. Still seems like a rule for the rules own sake, so I will continue using {{vfd}}. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 08:42, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I maintain this is a dictionary definition. If someone comes across the word 'rich' and wonders what it means, presumably they are in need of a dictionary. If someone wants to look up 'wealth' in Wikipedia, they will search for 'wealth' not 'rich'. All the other meanings of 'rich', except perhaps "Richard", here are straightforward dictionary definitions. In the case of "Richard" this page, if kept, should simply be a redirect to that page. Furthermore, "richness" redirects to this page - this seems, if anything, the wrong way round to me. At any rate, it seems strange to have even a disambiguation page for this word.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I have nothing against disambiguation pages, but this is barely one. It offers a link to 'wealth' and 'Richard' (and nothing else - it defines some other uses). Who would enter 'rich' to look up 'wealth'? It seems strange to have an adjective (in all cases except <i>Richard</i>) as the title for an article, disambiguation page or otherwise.

<li>For a page to be a disambiguation page, there have to be more than one <i>encyclopaedia article</i> that could conceivably be at the title. There <i>aren't any</i> encyclopaedia articles by this title. The actual encyclopaedia articles are all under the name <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard.html" title="Richard">Richard</a>, which is itself a disambiguation page, and which also mentions "Rich". All that this page is actually doing is disambiguating between a dictionary entry and a redirect to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard.html" title="Richard">Richard</a>. <b>Redirect</b> to the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard.html" title="Richard">Richard</a> disambiguation page and link to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Rich" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Rich">Wiktionary:Rich</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Richard" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Richard">Wiktionary:Richard</a> from there.

<li><b>Comment</b>. While I agree it seems to be a dicdef disguised as a disambig (as opposed to a real disambig), there is an awful lot that links there. I was tempted to change <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richness.html" title="Richness">Richness</a> so that it redirects to <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">Wealth</a> instead of to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich.html" title="Rich">Rich</a>, but then it occurred to me that for me at least "richness" is more likely to refer to the creaminess and heaviness of foods like <a href="../../../e/g/g/Egg_nog.html" title="Egg nog">egg nog</a> than it is to be a synonym for <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">wealth</a>. But I don't see that richness in that sense is worthy of an encyclopedia article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Caltech Houses are unique and are NOT DORMITORIES. They were specifically modelled after various fraternities and Housing systems in Europe and America in the 1930s when the South Houses were originally built. While I admit that the detail on many of the House entries leaves much to be desired, I would like to mention that when Ruddock House was first nominated for deletion in February a friend of mine significantly updated the page so that it was much more detailed than many <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternities.html" title="Fraternities">Fraternities</a> and yet the administrator apparently couldn't be bothered to read more than the one bold word per vote to see that there had been votes in favor of deletion, then a major change, and then slightly fewer votes against deletion and to apply common sense (in my humble opinion) to refrain from deleting the entry. As Caltech Houses are probably most accurately Institute owned <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternities.html" title="Fraternities">Fraternities</a> with a close-knit and strong family atmosphere and not run-of-the-mill dormitories deleting all of these is, in the mind of those people who attend or have attended Caltech, on par with deleting every <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternity.html" title="Fraternity">Fraternity</a> because they are dormitories. As a side note, the Ruddock article was NOT recreated by a Rudd (a member of Ruddock House) but by a member of another House. While, yes, I cannot deny that it was probably stupid to put up the joke Ruddock House entry, said person was probably just wondering why there was no entry and put up something funny to insiders in hopes that we would put up something meaningful. Therefore, I believe these pages should neither be deleted nor redirects created/protected and that Ruddock's old page immediately prior to its February deletion should be undeleted. After Finals (now through next week) and the GREs (April 2) I will help update each of the 7 House pages with meaningful information. Furthermore, if for some reason you absoltely cannot wait that long, at least do not prevent us from recreating meaningful pages at that time. Finally, in response to the deletion of the old Ruddock House page, I propose a change in wikipedia deletion policy that before deleting a page that has had a major change made to it, there must be at least one vote for deletion after said major change (or some fraction of total votes or something). 131.215.172.30 16:15, Mar 12, 2005 (PST)</li>

<li>You wouldn't be saying merge if you had read the articles, because essentially all the information in the separate articles is actually already in the "Housing system" section of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caltech.html" title="Caltech">Caltech</a> article, with the exception of some pretty unencyclopedic information in the one or two of them that are more than a sentence. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 04:08, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> - The houses at Caltech are certainly more on par with fraternities than regular college dorms, and each has a unique history and lasting effect; however, fraternities are national organizations encompassing orders of magnitude more people than students in the Caltech houses. I agree with Spoon! that there are definitely things to be said about each house, but until such time (perhaps even a few days) as more meaningful and encylopedic content can be written (at which point they will then deserve their own articles), I propose that they be merged into a separate Caltech Housing System article. I believe a redirect would be inappropriate because some of the information in the articles (such as the histories in the Dabney and Blacker entries) would be out of place in the main Caltech article. -- Anonymous Caltech student, 01:11, 22 Mar 2005 (PST)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or merge into new "Caltech Housing" article. Seriously, it's not like a small clique of people is putting together personal homepages on Wikipedia; these Houses have years of history and thousands of members. Anyone looking for insight on life at Caltech should be able to get information about the Houses. Also, the information on these pages may not be directly relevant to the main Caltech page, so it seems a bit out of place to just dump this information back into that article. I could see a separate "Caltech Housing" option, though, if it were felt these pages didn't deserve an existence on their own. -- Caltech student 65.3.0.25 01:05, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

I am disappointed that I am unable to see the Lloyd and Ruddock pages which have been deleted, shouldn't old versions be accessible from their history pages?. I was tempted to vote to keep the pages as they are, but I do see the danger of vanity editing. I thinking having all House information on one page will help discourage that, and would also be a good place to collect history and traditions that are common to multiple Houses. --<a href="../../../t/i/s/User%7ETisco_8cdd.html" title="User:Tisco">Tisco</a> 01:25, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

While it is true that several of the pages are stubs, a number are reasonable and have bean growing for the past year or so.

<li><b>Keep</b> as separate articles, though creating a new <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_System_at_Caltech_addb.html" title="House System at Caltech">House System at Caltech</a> is not a bad alternative.

Just look at <a href="http://www.gdbg.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.gdbg.org/" rel="nofollow">gdbg.org</a>, especially the FAQ page - and that's all for just one Hovse! If anything this shows that these articles definately do have the potential to become encyclopedic. If the pages are kept, I would be willing to contribute some material myself, and to encourage others to do so as well. If there's concern that there still won't be enough material, a <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_System_at_Caltech_addb.html" title="House System at Caltech">House System at Caltech</a> article with sections for each Hovse would be preferable to total deletion or merging with the main Caltech article; if any section or the whole article becomes too large, the individual Hovse page could then be split off again. --JPS (Caltech Student, affiliated with 3 of the 8 Houses)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Guys, remember that being non-encyclopedic is not bounds for deletion. I quote from the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_Deletion_c9d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for Deletion">Guide to Votes for Deletion</a> article: "'non-encyclopaedic' is shorthand for 'Something that traditionally does not belong in an encyclopaedia, and doesn't fit the traditional definition of things that do'. This in itself may not be enough to justify a reason for deletion, unless the article is clearly a case of what Wikipedia is not. Note that some users use this term and 'non-notable' interchangeably." Also note that an article is not non-notable (i.e., is notable) unless "1. it is patent nonsense, or 2. it is original research, or 3. it is unverifiable, or 4. it is uninformative, or 5. the subject of the article is of <i>potential</i> [emphasis original] interest to only a small number of people (eg. 100 people), or 6. it does not otherwise belong in Wikipedia (as per <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not</a>)." Since there are more than 900 undergrads at Caltech at any one time, and the number of alums exceeds 10,000, these articles do not apply under clause 5; enough of the articles have content that deleting them all under clause 4 is inaccurate. I ask again: What grounds other than vandalism are there for deleting these articles? -- Caltech student 65.3.0.25 09:21, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b>. As a Caltech student, I agree that these fraternities (and yes, they are just another set of fraternities) are inherently unnotable. The fact that my fellow students so adamantly defend their inclusion is just a symptom of usual college-student self-importance. They've deluded themselves into thinking that anyone else cares about their silliness. Just look at the information in the article: nothing but bizarre, pedantic lists of traditions that, while important to a few college students, are hardly encyclopedic. Take this: "TTBOAI = the two being one and inseparable; Blacker tradition provides that whenever someone mentions "the Church and Hovse of Blacker", everyone else so responds." That belongs in an encyclopedia? -- Caltech student</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Last year, Peter C. Wayner, author of some well-regarded books on cryptography, and visiting computer science professor at Dartmouth, was teaching an introductory course for <i>non</i>-programmers. To give them the feeling of what an open source development project was like, he gave them the assignment of writing Wikipedia articles. The assignment clearly stated that they were to read <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> before beginning.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is estimated that about 350 articles were contributed, most pretty good and therefore unnoticed by VfD. For a typical example, see <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanditon.html" title="Sanditon">Sanditon</a>, an article about an unpublished Jane Austen novel.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, a relatively small fraction of the students created breezy pieces, written in promotional language, about minor campus activities. Perhaps thirty or forty of these were contributed, to the astonishment, dismay, and eventual disgust of VfD regulars. Many thought, incorrectly, that Wayner had advised or suggested the creation of these crufty articles. An animus against Dartmouth persisted to the degree that even articles about Dart<b>moor</b> in England have gotten comments about "the Dartmouth students are at it again."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The episode, while perfectly understandable, was not Wikipedia's finest hour. Let's try to put it behind us and not make snide remarks every time a Dartmouth-related article comes up. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:37, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another psychedelic trance project article created by <a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">user:Ld</a> from Germany. I recommend that its article be removed because it meets none of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Music notability criteria</a>. It has <s>457 google hits</s> 216.119.136.113 485 Lycos hits when searched with the word "trance", about the same number of psychedelic trance fanatics with computers. The individuals behind the artistic project, Stefan Lewin and Heike Fahrmeyer searched with the word "trance" get about 26 and 13 unique google hits, respectively. The project released two albums on Tatsu records, a label which has released a total of 15 albums (6 actual, 9 compilations). Magnetrixx's 4 labelmates with actual albums are also non-notable, each scoring less google hits than Magnetrixx, <s>except Oryx with 477 hits</s> (confusion with other Oryxs disrupted that search. With "psychedelic trance" gets 110 on Lycos). Neither Magnetrixx nor any of his Tatsu Records labelmates with actual albums are mentioned in the All Music Guide. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 22:05, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> No offense, Ld, but where is your evidence that they had more than two stops on their United States "tour" in 2004. And more than one stop on their 2003 United States "tour"? They may have toured other places, there's just no evidence for it on their website or the article. I would ask the wikipedians to judge the extent of their "touring" for themselves at <a href="http://www.magnetrixx.de" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.magnetrixx.de" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. They don't use the word "tour". It lists 18 dates for 2004, with two festivals, but including a birthday party and a Christmas party. Please don't add misleading information to the article to save it. Let the truth speak for itself. If you need more time to establish their notability, just say so. 216.119.136.113 23:30, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I did not create this article. It was created by 134.100.205.196 on 5/11/2004, and modified by several other people, including myself. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnetrixx&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnetrixx&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> for details. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 22:22, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Funny how you added a discography, external link and text about touring (calling it a minor edit) 16 minutes after it was nominated, though. You obviously take quite an interest. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 22:52, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>In fact, this is one of the side effects of VfD. When nominated for deletion, articles are often improved with additional information to prevent them from being deleted. In fact a while back I and several others helped improve the <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghan_Defense_Ministry_4739.html" title="Afghan Defense Ministry">Afghan Defense Ministry</a> in the same fashion to prevent it from being deleted. It is now an excellent Wikipedia article. If you see a stub that you believe is not useful, it may be worth to expand it rather than nominate it for VfD. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 22:59, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I understand that improvement aspect. You know, I was skeptical about there being only 0-3 trance articles that had a problem, like you said, but you were pretty on the mark--the creds of those artists that have articles in the List of psychedelic trance artists are pretty solid. I probably wouldn't have even nominated this group if I had had the latest flashplayer and was able to go to their site to see how extensive their touring was (their record label just gave a vague sentence). [<b>Comment:</b> Ld had made misleading statements again on the extent of their touring on the article page. The "touring" seems pretty minimal. I probably still would have nominated them 216.119.136.113 23:41, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)] If you have any info you want to put in about Fuzzion touring, I won't nominate them either. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 23:55, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I dont know much about Fuzzion other than that they have one hit track and a number of EP releases.

<li>I'm not very happy with this VfD.
