<ul>
<li>That would be unimaginative, if true. Reasonable criteria that would do so are relatively easy to imagine. ("Keep basic foodstuffs like <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peach.html" title="Peach">peach</a> and meals that have existed for over 100 years but not fast food restaurant menu items" would be one such criterion, for example.) I'm not convinced that that <i>was</i> the implication, however. It's certainly hard to read such an implication into the actual words there before us, which read more plainly as a straight dichotomy comprising "keep all articles about food" and "delete all articles about food", with no middle allowed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:11, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really don't think McDonalds has the <i>only</i> "fruit and walnut salad" in the world, so having their concoction under the title is basically an ad for their product. I mean, isn't <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf_Salad_6996.html" title="Waldorf Salad">Waldorf Salad</a> a fruit and walnut salad (with another ingredient or two)? This really should not stay as is, but some of this could be mentioned somewhere.

<li>After some thought, I'm starting to lean towards a <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf_Salad_6996.html" title="Waldorf Salad">Waldorf Salad</a> as the most notable form of a fruit and walnut salad. Since this is rather similar to Waldorf Salad, and clearly inspired by it, we could include a mention of it there and a link to <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_menu_items_790b.html" title="McDonalds menu items">McDonalds menu items</a> where most of this article could be moved (although it currently reads sort of Consumer Reports-like, which I'm not so sure is ideal). Such an article could also house the current contents of the likes of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Mac_9141.html" title="Big Mac">Big Mac</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken_McNuggets_ad63.html" title="Chicken McNuggets">Chicken McNuggets</a>, as well as others. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:34, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> R. fiend has a good point; this really should be moved to a McDonalds-specific title.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf_Salad_6996.html" title="Waldorf Salad">Waldorf Salad</a> contains mayo and celery, and also began as a <b>commercial</b> product, bearing the name of a famous serving establishment. This is a distinct salad, also a commercial product, sold by a merchant as famous (or infamous) today as Waldorf's was in the past. To me, the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf.html" title="Waldorf">Waldorf</a> precedent supports a keep, and I stand by my vote above. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:20, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This one has a mayo substitute, albeit no celery; it is clearly an adaptation of the other. And to compare a product that was released a month ago with something that has been around for a century is just plain ridiculous. The Waldorf Salad has entered the lexicon; McDonalds fruit and walnut salad has not, and likely never will. At the <i>very least</i> this needs to be moved to a McDonalds specific title and disambiguated, because having a general food item like this indicate a specific menu item at a spcific restaurant is basically promoting McDonalds. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:38, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As you'd expect, I don't find my contention "ridiculous."&#160;:) To my mind, McDonald's is (unfortunately) sufficiently powerful and ubiquitous such that any product they release, with major fanfare as a new marketing strategy centerpiece, is almost immediately notable (even if it fails -- see <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Coke_ee64.html" title="New Coke">New Coke</a>.) This article isn't advertising; it reflects the (sad) reality that these commercial product releases are notable in American life, pathetic though that may be. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:15, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I hardly think anything Mcdonalds sells in inherently encyclopedic (and just about every product they release is marketed with great fanfare). The notion that if someone advertizes something sufficiently it belongs in an encyclopedia is a flawed notion: it would make an encyclopia would be be just another ad. I'm sure it took many years for Waldorf Salad (something quite new) to become widely known and popular enough to warrant an inclusion in an encyclopedia, and I hardly think McDonalds stealing the idea 100 years later puts them on the fast track. I've watched quite a bit of TV recently, I'm sorry to say, and I had not yet heard of this new item. That's hardly surprising, as fast food chains put out about a new item every few minutes and it's easy to ignore them. I think this article is indicitive of the tendency for people to write articles on everything as it appears without any regard of greater significance, while disregarding more important things of the past. Nevertheless, I would not entirely object to much of the content of this article being mentioned elsewhere, but currently it's the equivalent of finding an article on the KFC bucket meal when one types "fried chicken". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:52, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sad to say that, together with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Adorno_ccac.html" title="Theodor Adorno">Adorno</a>, I do think that a powerful capitalist entity can make something encyclopedic just by advertising it potently and widely. Advertising works -- as any <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propagandist.html" title="Propagandist">propagandist</a> in history can attest. The article can be revised to mention the salad is a partial response to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Size_Me_b2c5.html" title="Super Size Me">Super Size Me</a> and its backlash.

<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't mind a separate article on McDonald's Coporate Response to Health Concerns, although with a much better title. I don't think that just putting this in a general menu article does justice to the circumstances surrounding its creation -- that McDonald's has been publicly embarrassed/pressured into altering their marketing. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 19:46, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. To be honest, I find the idea of articles on one month old fast food restaurant menu items to be absolutely idiotic. I'm sure McDonalds appreciates the advertising, though. McDonalds has a few items that are culturally important (for example Big Mac and Quarter Pounder) that deserve articles. The cultural importance of <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit_and_walnut_salad.html" title="Fruit and walnut salad">Fruit and walnut salad</a> is zero, and will probably remain zero forever. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 06:23, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: well, I am amazed to find that people have actually managed to rewrite this article to such a high standard. The current content should, of course, be kept. My one reservation now with leaving the article as is, is as per R. Fiend - this is a global encyclopedia, and <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_bd82.html" title="McDonalds">McDonalds</a> do not have the <i>only</i> Fruit and walnut salad. That is a generic term, and if the article is to remain, should be made more generic. Maybe what would be more appropriate is to move to a Fruit and walnut salad (McDonalds) page, and create a list of McDonalds menu items (as described above). Fruit and walnut salad could contain generic blurb about what one is, and mention McDo listing it, linking accordingly. I would agree with Quale, however, that this is ultimately rather un-notable, and free advertising for McDo as it stands... he's right that the cultural importance is probably zero. However, we're not exactly runnin out of space, so I see no reason to totally remove this content now it's been re-written... we just need to decide where to put it! <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 07:45, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

I'll create a disambig page at <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit_and_walnut_salad.html" title="Fruit and walnut salad">Fruit and walnut salad</a>... perhaps people might like to re-consider their votes now? I was certainly proved wrong in saying that there was "little chance for future expansion" <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 15:57, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
