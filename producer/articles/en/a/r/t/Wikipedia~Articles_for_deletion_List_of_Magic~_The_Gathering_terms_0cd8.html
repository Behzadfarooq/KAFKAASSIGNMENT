<p>Nothing but a list of unsourced slang. We're not a dictionary, let alone UrbanDictionary.

<li>It would appear that this article is what would be considered a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary.html" title="Glossary">glossary</a>, and a look through the corresponding Wikipedia category (where the article in question is listed) would turn up a lot of similar articles such as <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_terminology.html" title="Chess terminology">Chess terminology</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_terms_1cf4.html" title="List of Final Fantasy VII terms">List of Final Fantasy VII terms</a>. While I encourage you to take a look at the second and see what this article should probably look like (because it's thoroughly well cited and decently pruned, and because personally I think it's a similar level of notability), with regards to glossaries and AFD there doesn't seem to be a solid consensus. Several glossaries similar to this (with varying degrees of citations) have survived AFDs (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Slang_and_offensive_terms_for_police_officers_d64e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Slang and offensive terms for police officers">slang for Police here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Internet_slang_c89d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Internet slang">Internet slang here</a>). The appropriate discussion (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#What_glossaries_are_.28NOT.29" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia_talk:What_Wikipedia_is_not#What_glossaries_are_(NOT)</a>) has yet to pass into policy. I think the article can be improved and pruned, and that some glossaries are worth including. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Bound_30fc.html" title="User:Mr Bound">Mr Bound</a> 04:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The page you linked specifically states "Slang dictionaries, which contain mostly dicdefs and are not used to read an article (since we don't write in slang) are not glossaries under this definition." One of the two you linked survived on a no consensus with a lot of votes saying <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> for basically every reason. It's entirely neologisms, it's completely unsourced and unverifiable, and it is guaranteed to contain at least some OR simply because slang terms by their very nature are subjective to one group or another (and therefore any "meaning" given to them is original research subjective to the giver). I'd say speedy this article if at all possible -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:06, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Original research? I'm not saying every term on the page can be verified, but many can. Those that can't? Feel free to remove them. Still wouldn't be original research, as that's about advancing a cause, but whatever. However, the existence of the article itself doesn't violate any principles of Wikipedia that I know about. Magic the Gathering is a real game, it is notable, and it does have a common vernacular shared among its players. This can be verified from many magazines and articles. (Scrye for example has done it several times). How a list of words common to a subject violates Wikipedia policy, I don't know, but if it does, how about deleting <a href="../../../g/l/o/Category%7EGlossaries_5e13.html" title="Category:Glossaries">Category:Glossaries</a>? I'd especially include the Baseball jargon ones. Or maybe Transwiki them to Wikitionary, if they belong there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Being OR is <b>not</b> a deletion criterion, it is at most a reason for trying to improve the article. Moreover, this article has been cited by the game's manufacturer as a useful resource for players. Deleting it would put Wikipedia in the rather embarassing position of having people come here from WotC's site only to find the article they're looking for deleted out from under them. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 08:00, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Being original research most definitely <i>is</i> a deletion criterion, per our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy and our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. It is one of our most fundamental deletion criteria. And that people have been referred to an unencyclopaedic article is not a reason to keep an unencyclopaedic article. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a free wiki host</a>. If you want to make a case for keeping that holds water, rather than one that is in direct opposition to our fundamental policies, please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to demonstrate that this article is not original research, is verifiable, and is not a mini-dictionary of slang. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, speaking for myself, I added two sources rather easily. It's about as easy for the rest of the terms that should be kept, and dump the rest. So, OR as an argument for deletion is not that applicable here. It's a clean-up issue for this article, not an inherent problem with the very concept of it. The real question is, does a list of words common to a specific subject belong on Wikipedia. And I think the plethora of glossaries indicates that there is some acceptance to their inclusion in Wikipedia. If not, then we should be discussing that, then dealing with the articles like this. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, though vaguely possible article could be recreated in the future. If the article is to be saved (or for when/if the article is remade), I would recommend something in the form of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_slang_phrases_3009.html" title="List of Internet slang phrases">List of Internet slang phrases</a>- <i>all</i> entries must be referenced by a not-user-editable website, and at least two editors viligantly guard the article, ruthlessly deleting all additions that don't.

</ul>
<p>Keep it, because magicplayers will automatically fill in more details. Mtg is a game that is expanding in so many conceptual directions that no single individual or group can contain it all. I for instance can easily envision a mtg only wp. Besides, slang will be incorporated into wp no matter what is done to avoid it. Wp will be subject to I-wars (information-wars), and biased oppinions will collide while "fanatics" of certain ideologies try to textually wipe out other articles with "intolerant" contents. As a defence mechanism people will turn to slang so that articles with their oppinion are not found and "errataed" by the opposition.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - While nearly incoherent and devoid of any reference to actual deletion criteria, the above post raises one interesting point. <b>If</b> this article flunks this AFD, as seems likely, could I get access to the text of it somehow?

<p>Purple, yes I may seem incoherent, but only because I assume others posses the same knowledge as myself. It's a constant hindrance to my communication with other people.
