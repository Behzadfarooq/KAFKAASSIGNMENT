<p>Unencyclopedic, Buffy-cruft. It's dedicating a whole article on the "villain" aspect of a TV show. It's redundant because it just reiterates information found in a table in the main BtVS slayer and information from the individual villain articles. In addition, there is a bunch of fandom information posing as facts with no references (i.e. "Some fans", "little bad", etc.) Conter 21:22, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> because (1) The nominator didn't even add a tag to the article (I added it for him)- drawing the nomination into question, and (2) As one user remarked on the talk page, while it's redundant at the moment, "That's not to say there's no place for this article, just that it needs expansion to be pertintent. Perhaps more description--the villains objectives, etc.--should be given of the major villains. It might be good to include more of the minor, one episode villains as well." <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 22:08, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The core of the article is essentially a summary of one aspect of the show, which could be kept, because many articles about fiction include a summary. However, beyond this core, is much that is interpretation, and the author's claims about what most fans feel. If all of the questionable material is removed, there isn't a lot that can't be found elsewhere. Regardless, I agree with <a href="../../../g/k/h/User%7EGkhan_3d68.html" title="User:Gkhan">gkhan</a>: There is no way that Dru is the big bad of season 2; it's clearly Angelus. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 12:48, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I worked on this article recently, but I realize that the encyclopedic potential for this to equal a featured article is very little. Also, I couldn't find any authoritative sources for some of the article's claims, therefore the "original research" argument is valid. For example, no authoritative source states The First's morphing in "Lessons" were suppose to be big bads or just villains from past seasons. In addition, it looks like this focus on the Buffy villain is spawning more duplicates such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_bad&amp;oldid=19974201" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_bad&amp;oldid=19974201" rel="nofollow">big bad.</a> At best a merge into the main Buffy article, but it's already there under the "Characters" section so I vote delete. ! ! ! 01:42, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DoublePlusStrong Keep</b> - Even if the content is poor, poor content is <i>not a valid reason for deleting an article</i>. We should be working to <i>improve</i> it, rather than simply removing something we don't want to take the time to work on. All these votes for the deletion of a page whose namespace at least has some potential to it, almost make me ashamed to call myself a Wikipedian. This is inexcusible. --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvun_a92b.html" title="User:Corvun">Corvun</a> 14:32, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, we all know this. We don't want it deleted because the content is bad, we want it deleted because it is original research, and it if you removed the original research what would be left is, well, basically a list of the villains. That article would be quite useless, as it would be a complete duplicate of <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_8732.html#Characters" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer#Characters</a> and the villain pages.

<li><b>Keep</b> or Combine and Redirect. The "original research" notion seems pretty weak. Anybody who has watched this show and thought about it should see that it acurately tells what happens with villains on buffy the vampire slayer. Here's the primary source for the claims made in the article: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Seasons One through Seven. If that's not source enough, I cite TV guide. If that's not enough, I'll go find one of the dozen books on on Buffy and cite that. They all agree that what this article says is acurate. Anyone who has thought about the show can verify that most of the claims in this article are acurate, and can correct them where they are astray. No wild or controversial interpretations are offered in this article. And note this from the OR page: "[R]esearch that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research," it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." This article is not creating a primary source, it is reporting the content of a primary source. A friend of mine has a slogan: "If you want to know about an obscure Roman emperor, go to encyclopedia britanica for all I care. If you want to know about a Sith Lord, go to Wikipedia." Wikipedia is reliably a very good source of information about our evolving popular culture, probably the best on the net, probably the best in there is. Wikipedia should be proud of this rather than trying to evolve into a stuffy attempt to be Encyclopedia Britanica. Course, I'm the one who wrote most of this article... <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">User:Philosofool</a> 13:55 PDT 21 August 2005</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This seems milder than the Ashlee Simpson fancruft, but it is still fancruft nonetheless. The characters section in the main Buffy article and all the individual villain articles in the Buffy category is already enough. <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuop_07a3.html" title="User:Quop">Quop</a> 06:56, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
