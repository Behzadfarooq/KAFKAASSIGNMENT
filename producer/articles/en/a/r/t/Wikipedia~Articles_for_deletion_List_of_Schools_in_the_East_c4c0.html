<li><b>Comment</b> This is a spliting of the the list of Schools in England into the 9 <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_England_a07f.html" title="Regions of England">Regions of England</a>. This list is of the schools in the region of the East or Eastern region. The whole <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_England_1e1e.html" title="List of schools in England">List of schools in England</a> is very large and will only get larger as more schools are added. It needs to be split up and in some sort of way organised better than it curtrently is. I have found a list of all Local Education Authorities in Engalnd and have split that list up into the 9 regions. I have then looked at the combined list for all schools in England and pulled out the relevent ones for this region and tried to put some order to them (currently the list of schools in England uses various methods of listing withing the same list. With the break away articles I am trying to bring some order and regular structure to the lists so they are eaiser to follow and more useful. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 15:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> But not every school is worth an article on it's own. People have been debating this for a long time and I've seen many people argue on here that a simple list of schools for each LEA would be better than each school having an individual article. If schools are not notable enough have individual articles then the <i>category</i> function will not list them. While a school might not be notable in itself to warrant a whole article, the fact it exists is an important factor and very useful information. Getting hold of lists of schools is extremely hard (I had to spend ages when adding all the schools for one LEA to the main England list searching out the school names (that one LEA had over 100 schools, there are over 150 LEAs in Engalnd and I beleive over 20,000 schools)). I will admit though that the name is perhaps not the best name for the list, perhaps something illustrating that the 'East' is one of the English regions would be better. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 15:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Fine, if you want a reason, much of the list just invites redlinks to be created and AfD'd. In other words, much of the list is nonnotable and it's a little too indiscriminate for my liking as well. Why only England? What about every other country (for example, a list for the U.S., even for a larger state, would become unmaintainable quickly.). --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 04:26, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Such lists do already exist for every US state. The other parts of the UK also have such lists (which I noticed were split out of a single article for the whole UK about a week or so ago. I'm sure other countries will also have simialr lists. But this idea of lists was a compromise I had heard talked about many times when reading the arguments for and against individual school articles. rather than a tiny stub article on every school, just giving the info of type of school, location, size etc, the list gives all schools in one area, (which is the way the list will likely be most useful) with this information in just one large article instead of 100 or 500 or 1000 separate articles. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 12:39, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You're right (it exists for Canada also, but only for certain provinces). But I've taken a look at the country listings and it's very inconsistent. I'm still of the mind that it's unmaintainable (and probably a lot of the other school lists are unmaintainable as well). I'm not picking on you personally - it's an incredible mess. (E.g. why are only international schools in Shanghai in the China list? Why isn't BC (a fairly large province) included in the Canadian schools? Why is the listing of schools in Quebec only art schools? What about school-like institutions? What constitutes a school?) --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can I ask those of you who have voted 'delete' to have a look at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Yorkshire_and_the_Humber_e9a0.html#Barnsley" title="List of schools in Yorkshire and the Humber">Yorkshire and Humber</a> region list to have and see the entry for the LEA of Barnsley there. That list contains the age range of the school, the type of school (eg connunity, voluntary aided, voluntary controlled and the place the school is situated and any specialist status the school has. I hope to also include the number on roll too when I can find them. The ultimate goal is to have the same on all lists for all schools in the country. Obviously this will take some time and needs the pages setting up and them worked on. I have also redirected the page nominated here to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_the_East_of_England_5e33.html" title="List of schools in the East of England">List of schools in the East of England</a>.

<li><b>Delete.</b> There is no article on Schools in the East or Schools in the East of England. Why not? Because it is not an encyclopedic topic... because there is nothing conceptually similar about them. They do not embody a characteristic style of architecture, or a particular educational philosophy, or a common history. They have no more in common with each other than "Schools whose names begin with the letter C." In general, if there is no article on X, there should not be an article entitled "list of X." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:11, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Then I suggest you nominate for deletion the 50 or so list articles for lists of schools in the US for each state. There are no articles to go along side them of exactly the same name either. Why is there no article of the same name? Becuase the article which would contain the information in an article called Schools in the East of England would actually be contained in an article either on a more specific area or a more general area and would also be entitled education, eg <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_England_c7c5.html" title="Education in England">Education in England</a> or Education in Cambridgshire. And you say there is nothing in common between schools in the article, well within each such section of the article there are similarities. For example, you see the structure in Buckinghamshire contains upper, middle and lower, where as Cambridgeshire has Primary and Secondary Schools. Some LEAs will show lots of Grammar Schools, others wil have none. Maybe Educational establishments in the East of England would be more suitable? Alos, I say again, the reason there is this article is becasue one single artilce for the whole of England or the UK would be too huge to keep as a single article. What is really silly here is that people on here have been arguing for a long time against individual article for all schools, with the suggestion articles on education within each LEA, which lists the schools and gives only the basic information, eg type of school, local, size etc, with only the most notable schools having their own articles. Here we have the startings of such a system and yet people are still not happy and want to get rid of even the most basic collective articles on the subject. I really don't understand it. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 12:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The whole education structure is mess I agree (probably because schools aren't encyclopedic per se), but even if one was to accept your reasoning that it should exist because it can't be found anywhere else, the list you've created is just slightly less unmanageable than a whole list of schools in England. It's already huge and I guess you've barely started. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 12:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd guess the current list here is about 1/3 to 1/2 complete. That is however only a rough estimate. Then there would be finding the information on each school which would make the article more worthwhile. But the current state is a start and there is a clear end point to it too, which, once reached, means the artciel would only need updating when a schools changes, eg closes, a new one opens, a specialis is added/changed etc. It's not really an open ended lsit. Large yes, but certainly it has it's boundaries. And I'd say it's a very useful list too. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 12:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
