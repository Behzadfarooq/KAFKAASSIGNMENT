<p>These articles fail the Wikipedia policy located at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a> which states: "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." This article consists of nothing but a plot summary. Wikification, and the addition of one line of context would not address this issue. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 23:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete All</b> per nom. I understand that there is a movement to establish guidelines for summarizing individual episodes of programs or entire seasons. Until such a guidelines is established, these articles should not be written and are merely nn fancruft. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 23:30, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>. These articles need expansion and clean-up, but I fail to see why these articles should have less right to exist on Wikipedia than the hundreds of individual episode articles already in place for other series. The nom's rationale would pretty well disqualify 99% of episode articles, in which case I recommend the nominator make a policy change suggestion rather than singling out one show. The consenus at <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a> doesn't appear to have been violated, though the articles can be improved, of course. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As "inheritantly" isn't a word, I had absolutely no idea what the author was talking about. I was under the impression that they had simply misspelled "inherently". Furthermore, the notion that things inherit notability is not an accurate one. If my father won an Academy Aware it doesn't make me notable. Similarly, if I'm a US Senator, it doesn't make my daughter notable. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 00:46, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

Although third party sources are preferrable for notability and opinion, first party sources are perfectly acceptable for basic information.

<li>There was at least one valid third party source on Matthew's list, TV Guide can be used to ref the original airdate. Until you find that there is no dvd commentary to write a development section, do not call it impossible. Besides, there are two acceptable options here, delete is not one of them. They are "clean up and expand" and "merge and redirect", both of which point to avoiding afd.

<li>Starting to repeat repeat myself, so this'll probably be my last comment, but the point is that it's likely not <i>possible</i> to improve the articles without conducting OR. The kind of sources we'd need for a Wikipedia article are, for example, reviews of the specific episodes by independent critics. Just because something has lots of Google hits, doesn't mean that any of those hits are suitable as sources for these articles. That's why I used Lexis-Nexis -- wading through Google hits is a drag.
