<p>AfD 2nd Listing. Recommend delete per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The article makes no claim of notability. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Derrick_Lonsdale_55bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Derrick Lonsdale">1st AfD</a> had very little participation and probably should have been re-listed rather than closed. The only argument in the article's talk page for keeping this article is that there are thousands of worse stubs. That's too bad, but as per long-standing "there are worse..." arguments, let's continue the cleanup efforts - and we can begin with this one. <i>If this guy is notable, let's see it.</i> Otherwise, let's delete this article. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The copyvio text indicated that the subject authored a prolific number of scholarly papers. I am not comfortable with removal unless that is shown to be inaccurate.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know what the policy is, but I believe that AfD's closed with a No Consensus To Delete may be tried again, as opposed to those with an actual Keep which either need to go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> or else to wait a few months before trying again. That said, I don't think its very good form to immediately go right back to AfD. But its "legal" as far as I know. The problem with the guy's article is that it was apparantly copyvio, so I had to cut it back to almost nothing. But I think that it's <i>possible</i> that he <i>may</i> be slightly notable as some kind alternative-medicine guy. I thought he had written a book, but I guess not, as it's not listed in the article. Anyway, I'm not voting. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 01:42, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> - you are the one concluding he is an expert, and that's POV. You'll need a source other than yourself that says he's an expert to prove your point. Find it, and I'll happily withdraw my nomination. Incidentally, simply publishing in a peer reviewed journal doesn't make someone notable. Most Ph.D.'s have done so - it's part of what they do and it <i>does not</i> make them notable in their field. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 02:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - if your GP has written over 100 published papers, several books, run medical studies, sat on expert committees etc then he needs an article&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 03:12, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> - First, the only reference I've seen to 100 papers is something he's published on his own website. Second, the "favorably reviewed" "paper" wasn't published in a peer review journal. So where is this so-called "review"? Third, my insurance doesn't cover "alternative medicine". Lastly, and most significantly, where, aside from your own high praise, has anyone (other than the subject himself) published anything stating he's an "expert" or otherwise notable? <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 03:19, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Hmm, calm down you two&#160;:-) Taking everything together, I am happy enough that he is an expert in his field. The fact that it is 'alternative medicine' shouldn't count against him, in my view. I would also add the point - why would we want to exclude him? Does his inclusion harm Wikipedia bearing in mind that rappers who have released two CDs get in? I have nothing against rappers BTW, I am just making the point that Wikipedia is a broad church. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 04:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak delete</b> I'm not really sold either way on this one but I'd like to point out a few things. First, 100 papers for an 80 year old academic, while certainly worth a mention, is not that exceptional and highly depends on what you call "a paper". Since that claim is taken from a source which is most definitely not independent of the subject, we just have to assume that this is perhaps a bit generous. Secondly, an academics' job is to conduct studies, publish papers and sit on expert committees so it would take more than the current claims that he did those things to convince me. I'm not saying this man is not a renowned expert in his field but simply that the evidence given in the article is pretty flimsy right now. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 06:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../c/h/i/WP%7ECHILL_4ec5.html" title="WP:CHILL">WP:CHILL</a></b>, then <b>Take it to Deletion Review</b> It's too soon for a second nom. Besides, the closing admin did give instructions to cut out the copyvio portions, so unless you're gonna contest the close at DRV, that change should probably happen first before a re-nom is in order.--<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> 07:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The man is somewhat controversial in autism circles, and is thus worthy of mention. It would be nice if <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Alternative_medicine_a2b9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Alternative medicine">Wikipedia:WikiProject Alternative medicine</a> could collaborate on this one, but I understand that project is presently inactive. -- <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwissCelt_5ca3.html" title="User:SwissCelt">SwissCelt</a> 12:09, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> keep</b>. With such a common surname, it's hard to work out which contributions are his in a Medline search; however Lonsdale's work on nutrition in autism and on thiamine in sudden <s>infant</s> deaths do seem notable. There appear to be significant problems with the current article (eg ref 8 is not about the thiamine study) which should be fixed. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 15:43, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is a puzzling AfD. The guy is plainly notable. Fellow of two professional bodies, author of 3 books (1 controversial), held a senior position at the third best hospital in the USA and undoubtedly an expert in his field as sbown by the independent citing of his papers, and he has done controversial work on autism. Why delete him? The article is better sourced than any other I have seen. If someone comes to Wikipedia looking for info on the guy why shouldn't they find it? As I say, puzzling. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridgeplayer_5ae5.html" title="User:Bridgeplayer">Bridgeplayer</a> 22:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
