<p>This is an awesome word that will catch on-jack</p>

<li><small>The above comment was made by IP User:208.198.210.3</small></li>
</ul>
<p>so you know those are separte people from a school's public sever therefor they all have the same ip address attached.</p>
<ul>
<li><small>Ok, you have the same IP address. But in Wikipedia, it is one user, one vote. And truely, other than people from your school voting for "keep" of the article, no one else has came over and voted to keep. I would not be surprised if an admin will discount the Annon. votes. If you do not want this situation to happen again, why not just create an account so this mess will not be happening. Plus, the main reason why most people want the article to be gone is that Wikipedia is not primarily used as a dictionary. That is where Wikitonary comes into play. It is also the meere fact that only a small group of people use this word and we are not a collection site of slang terms. Try the urban dictionary, or your wesbite to spread this term, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 20:51, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>im the person that made this site and just so you all know how does a word start other than by someone taking the initiative to put it somewhere that people see it, and you said that wikipedia is NOT a dictionary so this means it should accept all terms that have meaning or sentimental value to people <small>Comment by 141.157.76.84</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I said earlier that you should put the term on YOUR personal website or YOUR blog, not Wikipedia. Though if you want to take the effort to make a word popular, more power to you, but Wikipedia is not the place to do it. Plus, this word does not have much meaning to many people, other than your schoolmates. That, to us, is not notable. If the term is used by half of the United States, we might think about it, but it is not. We got rid of terms before that were created, just like Squeegified, and we got rid of terms that appear in placed like the Urban Dictionary. I want you and your friends to read <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">this</a> to see where me and the others are coming from. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 21:18, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>okay, i get where your coming from, but I would like to say that this word is not one that is only used by one kind of group, also that this is not a slang word because it isn't a shorter version of a word that we are to lazy to sound out. This is a word made up be people for people, which is how most words start and i therefore think it should be allowed to stay.</p>
<p><br />
If you want to vote keep, that is fine with me. But I am just explaining on why myself and others do not want the word to be in Wikipedia. As for you claiming that the word is wide-spread, I have two words for you: prove it. Show us links, show us a Google search, show us stuff. Plus, since it is a made-up word, people might have some issue with that. As I said before, if the page here is whacked, then why not just start a website or a blog and then use the word there. It will still not be on Wikipedia, but I do not mind if you use the other methods to spread this word. I do not know if it will catch on. BTW, I want to clariify some of the votes people casted:</p>
<ul>
<li>NN=Not Notable. Usually, this means that this person/place/thing/word/event/etc. is not really important to the world at large. Though the above things might be meaningful to some people, to most the world, they do not care.</li>
<li>Negoloism=That word is defined as a word that is just mainly in local use. This word qualifies at that, since it is only used by you and your pals.</li>
<li>DicDef=Dictionary Defintion. As I mentioned above, we have a project that deals with just dictionary terms, so articles that are usually just terms are frowned upon.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know you want to keep the page, which I have no problems with, but I just think that this article will be deleted. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 21:35, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>do you want me to put the names that go with the comments that have no names? also when we said widespread we were referring to our area.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, but I am not sure it will affect the voting or not. As for the widespread factor, I am not sure what the benchmark is, but I think that just your school/region might not be good enough. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 21:56, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>you tell me to prove it but seeing as how you can type anything into google and find a naughty pic, i dont think that is the best search engine to use, and now it hasent gone international, but it could make it there with a friendly page helping it and then you all can say you supported the starting of this word</p>
