<li><b>Strong Delete</b> What evidence is there that he is a notable published author? The article states that his books are self-published. Markets supplements? Lots of hits? Try this: in the first ten Google results, planetofthegods.com is registered to the same person as donlemmon.com and donlemmonknowhow.com, and donlemmonproductions.com, donlemmonsoil.com, and secretstoaperfectbody.com are all registered to Don himself. Only trulyhuge.com, bodybuilding.com, and martingroupdesign.com are independent of him, and the last one doesn't actually make any mention of him. The only thing I can see him being notable for is being a ruthless self-promoter. OK, well, he already has at least half a dozen web sites devoted to his cult of personality, why does WP need to promote him, too?

<li><b>Comment</b> Weird: googling on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=SuperLASIK&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=SuperLASIK&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">SuperLASIK</a> without language restrictions yields 1,430 hits, and the first pageful, at least, are mostly in non-Latin-character alphabets: Russian and some Asian pictographic language I can't identify. Restricting the language to English yields only 48 hits (of which Google shows only 9 because "we have omitted some entries very similar to the 9 already displayed.") It suggests searching on "Super LASIK," with a space, which, when searched in quotes for exact phrase, displays a similar phenomenon. It yields 598 hits in all languages and only 145 in English. I don't really know that that means but I don't recall seeing anything like that before and it seems odd. I suggest that if the article is made a redirect to <a href="../../../l/a/s/LASIK_194d.html" title="LASIK">LASIK</a>, Super LASIK should also redirect to <a href="../../../l/a/s/LASIK_194d.html" title="LASIK">LASIK</a>. If the article is <i>not</i> made into a redirect, it should be moved to Super LASIK.

<li><b>Comment</b> A search in "Proquest Research Library," which indexes 2000 journals including Science, Nature, Archives of Ophthalmology, etc. yields 475 articles on "LASIK", none on "SuperLASIK", none on exact phrase "Super LASIK", none on "EpiLASIK," and none on exact phrase "Epi LASIK".

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes there are a lot of hits for "SuperLasik" or "Super Lasik" or whatever. But is there actually such a thing as a "super lasik" procedure distinct from the regular Lasik procedure, or are these just trademarked names used by individual surgeons for their own regular-Lasik services? Is the Russian "super lasik" the same thing as the Austrian "super lasik"? Does SuperLASIK really stand for "superficial Lasik"? According to the Austrian guy <a href="http://zirm.net/development/e4/12.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://zirm.net/development/e4/12.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, it stands for "Laser in situ Keratomileusis"... but our <a href="../../../l/a/s/LASIK_194d.html" title="LASIK">LASIK</a> article says that's what ordinary LASIK stands for. So it seems that "SuperLASIK" is just a fancy trade name for LASIK, as far as I can tell. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:28, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Something is definitely odd here. I did some Google site searches on the site <a href="http://www.lasikinstitute.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.lasikinstitute.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasikinstitute.org/</a> which is the big <s>promotional</s> educational resource on LASIK sponsored by surgeons who perform it. Or something like that. Searches on "SuperLASIK", exact phrase "Super LASIK", "EpiLASIK", and exact phrase "Epi LASIK" yield no hits on this site. Not only should <a href="../../../s/u/p/SUPERLASIK_19d4.html" title="SUPERLASIK">SUPERLASIK</a> and Super LASIK redirect to <a href="../../../l/a/s/LASIK_194d.html" title="LASIK">LASIK</a>, but we ought to be very damn careful what we actually say about "SuperLASIK" in the <a href="../../../l/a/s/LASIK_194d.html" title="LASIK">LASIK</a> article because something about this just doesn't feel right to me.

<li><b>Counter Comment</b>. Willmcw has since removed his block after this user explained that several other users share a networked cable connection in their workplace with hundreds of other people, and therefore have the same IP address. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27tStandYa_204d.html" title="User:Can'tStandYa">Can'tStandYa</a> 08:24, 2005 August 17 (UTC)

<li>No, I removed the IP block because that is standard protocol when blocking sock puppet accounts. The similarities extend far beyond a shared IP address. I don't know where you sent your explanation, but I've never seen it. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:57, August 17, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps you need to update your email address in your profile. Here is a condensed version of the email: "Dear Sir or Madam, My Wiki club has asked me to contact you about removing the block. Our club has several registered and a few unregistered members. We all work for a large federal agency and share a networked cable connection with hundreds of other people, and therefore have the same IP address. We frequently meet for lunch and discuss wiki topics. Thank you in advance, Can'tStandYa" The similarities you say you observed may result from lunch conversations and common interests (we are all geek/engineer types). Additionally, user:155.84.57.253 is not a single person but a composite of several unregistered users - I'm trying to get them all to register to close down user:155.84.57.253 Entries as 155.84.57.253 also occur when registered users lose their log-in in the middle of a session, and when registered users forget to log-in. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27tStandYa_204d.html" title="User:Can'tStandYa">Can'tStandYa</a> 2005 August 18</li>

<dd>I'd agree with you if there hadn't already been discussions in many different places about this issue. This instruction creep is all about ed forcing Wikiprojects and other Infobox users to all use the gray color scheme and not allow each group to come up with reasonable artistic variations. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.71.html" title="User:152.163.100.71">152.163.100.71</a> 04:50, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Although I am in fact, not in favor of the effort to "standardize" infoboxes. Since when is <i>instruction creep</i> an accepted criteria for deletion of articles? VFD seems to be motivated by a disagreement that standardization is good. In this case, bring it to the talk page and any surveys, votes, etc, that might be called on the matter. At least let the supposed merits of the standardization be discussed. There would be no risk of instruction creep, unless a consensus had actually formed that the standardization was worth it and proposed guidelines were approved. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 04:54, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, now that he's put up the policy proposal, it's out in the open and there's a forum for all sides to come to the table and trash it out. You can't say he's not opening a dialogue now, and perhaps this will settle things. Regardless, that's a separate issue - Ed's own stubborness aside, the issue here is whether this VfD is appropriate, and I don't think it is.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I know that the whole point of Wikipedia is to provide an internet encyclopaedia, but if Wikipedia were ever reproduced in printed form, it would be laughed at for the stylistic to-ing and fro-ing in use of infoboxes from article to article. Ed's dogmatism really put my back up in my early days here, but now I find that I'm 100% for a drive to standardisation. I think the process will fail – because, as Uther says, there are so many Wikiprojects that have forged concensus in their own communities – but that's no reason not to try. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 08:57, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, this is an interesting discussion. However, Wikipedia namespace contains quite a lot of pages that aren't related to policy - e.g. indices, WikiProjects, humor pages, chess games and other stuff. Most of that isn't speedily deletable by <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. My point is that 1) not <i>everything</i> in Wikipedia namespace is by default immune to VFD; 2) nominating a serious policy/guideline/proposal for deletion is in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and whoever does so should be slapped with a trout; 3) however, something silly or ludicrous that is tagged as a policy proposal <i>is not</i> a serious proposal and is therefore deletable. Borderline case-in-point is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiblower_protection_2f30.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiblower protection">Wikipedia:Wikiblower protection</a> (which at the time of nomination was really ludicrous). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:19, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You should bring up your concerns on the ongoing discussion to reform VfD or create a policy proposal for it. This is not the place for this discussion about a future change. The fact for now is that VfD <i>does</i> have the power to control policies. And it has proven a good place to reach a wide audience. We now have a firm basis for standardizing infoboxes. The policy to not standardize infoboxes would never have reached such a wide audience just by being in the proposal category. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 13:30, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongest delete ever</b>. If this page where meant to be a place to discuss (as some people have stated above without explaining how they ever got that idea) whether infoboxes should be standardized, this would be reflected in the title (For example, for a <b>POV title, move the page to: Should we have instructions to standardize infoboxes?</b>). While pretending to be a discussion, it should be obvious to anybody that this is not a place for discussion whether there should be further instruction creep or not. It plainly states that there is going to be further instruction bullying on infoboxes now. What amazes me most, is that all people above on this very page do vote to have infobox standardization by this rationale, without even realizing it. What amazes me even more is that most of these people are smart enough however to realize that <b>standardization of anything is the textbook example for instruction creep</b> and state in their comments that they are actually against it.<br /></li>

<dd>Can you, however, point to a policy that says that instruction creep is a criterion for deletion? The merits of the proposal aside, my vote on this VfD stands - this is simply not the way to do things. Also, I see no need to move the article, since it boils down to the same thing: a proposal for policy. If the policy passes, then the article name is correct. If it doesn't pass, it is marked accordingly. To shift the page to what you suggest is counterproductive, since if it passes, the page will have to be renamed. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 08:49, August 15, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This sentence here: <i>To shift the page to what you suggest is counterproductive, since if it passes, the page will have to be renamed</i> is logically contradictory. We have a page here that describes a policy (a highly controversial one as even this page shows). A user has created it without ever trying to get any consensus - which is easily explainable: if Ed had tried to get consensus to establish a policy for standardization of infoboxes, it would have failed miserably as this page shows - the majority of people on this page does not want these boxes standardized, they voted keep because they want a policy change on VfD, not a standardization of boxes. So Ed decided to leave the nasty consensus-getting out, and by naming the page he created Infobox standardisation he established the fact that there will be standardization of boxes. Your statement: <i>...if it passes, the page will have to be renamed</i> is contradictory - the opposite is true.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 09:32, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You completely misread me.

How my noting that is the same thing is quite beyond me, since I am not the one creating new policy proposals just to make a point. Neither did I suggest that I wanted more instructions. I do believe that <a href="../../../i/n/f/Wikipedia%7EInfobox_standardisation_ff77.html" title="Wikipedia:Infobox standardisation">Wikipedia:Infobox standardisation</a> <i>is</i> instruction creep.

<dd>Then, Khaosworks, since you absolutely want the obvious answer to your point-attack: to save you from having to look up <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> - here is what that page says: <i>This guideline proposes that discussion, rather than unilateral action, is the preferred means of changing policies, and the preferred mechanism for demonstrating the problem with policies.</i> Policy proposals are just the right place to have that discussion. You could not think of any real arguments so you resorted to quote a policy you vaguely know. But that policy even <i>encourages</i> policy proposals to be discussed. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 14:06, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

You say in the former that <i>The right way for user:Radiant! is to express his concerns about the new proposals on the talk page of the policy proposal.

Numerous users will be busy putting through rules that serve no purpose whatsoever. Numerous users will leave Wikipedia due to the edit wars that you are laying the basis for with the proposal you support. The proposal you are signing includes grave plans to disrupt the work of innocent human beings for an indefinite period of time.

You created it entirely as a snide aside to go, well, if we're going to debate <i>this</i> policy, then we might as well debate <i>that</i> one - and in doing so you're boxing yourself up in an inconsistent position. <b>That</b> is counterproductive, and the true waste of everyone's time. You - and everyone - can see how hard it was to try to pin you down for ultimately what was a very simple yes or no answer; which you still didn't answer. This VfD is the waste of time, not discussion of policy. And which proposal am I supposed to be supporting which leads to these dire consequences you are doomsaying, precisely? For the record, I never said I was supporting standardization; in fact, I imply the opposite. What I am opposing is attempts like these to stifle discussion by VfD instead of talking it out on the policy proposal pages.</dd>

Every child in kindergarden would understand it is quite logical to vote for a proposal you support: no standardization, and to vote against a proposal you don't support: this one. I have said that numerous times on this page and that you are now trying to find anything to accuse me of (huh?) is really disgusting. I have spent an enormous time to answer your questions. I will also answer your last one now: no, Khaoswork, obyiously I am not going to change my vote to support this proposal, are you kidding? Read the explanantions I wrote above. I do not support standardiaztion of infoboxes, so why on earth would I want to vote for it, are you out of your mind? What is so hard to understand about that? If your scheme here was just an attempt to get me over to your side and pinme down whether I want to change my vote, why did you not say so earlier?

<dd>I don't see how this nomination was "of questionable appropriateness". Although the consensus has been keep - which is the consensus on many VFD issues - it has also been interesting that the underlying proposal has found no fans amongst the voters.

<li><b>Delete</b> It does indeed promote factionalism. Before Schoolwatch was started, VfDs of schools were fairly normal affairs, not much different from other VfD discussions.

<li>That section also says "There is nothing wrong with adding to an article a list of content-relevant links; however, excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia." Personally, I find the items on this list to be relevant and not excessive with respect to the article that underlies the list. The key for me, however, is that this article looks and feels more like a list, and not just a list of external links. If someone created a list of all the Senators and Congressmen from a particular state but also added the official website for each individual on the list, is that article now a "repository of links"?

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a standard way of showing moves in chess -- much like algebraic notation. This is certainly not original research. This type of table is common in all chess opening books. An example of this type of table in a copyrighted book is available on page 6 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0812930843/ref=sib_dp_pt/103-6162253-0536652#reader-page" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0812930843/ref=sib_dp_pt/103-6162253-0536652#reader-page" rel="nofollow">Modern Chess Openings (MCO)</a> (viewable online) for the King's Gambit -- this should answer <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm's</a> request for a source. Furthermore, I'd like to link to this wikipedia entry to explain the notation I/we intend to use in <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Opening_Theory" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Chess/Opening_Theory">Opening Theory</a>. While the description of the table notation is not complete, this is how opening lines are decomposed and explained in a small space. I would be happy to consider a different title though, as I have always heard these table referred to simply as "Theory Tables" -- which is a bit generic without the addition of "Chess Opening." Finally, I have added additional content to the article that I think provides a clearer idea of the concept. More to follow! <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a>

<li>COMMENT - My issue with this is that sure, tables have been used for chess opening theory... but tables have been used for everything. From car pollution, to long-distance rates, to lawnmower efficiency. There is nothing to indicate that a "Chess Opening Theory Table" is anything more than one of the many tables created in the world for an almost infinite amount of subjects; and, as such, is not deserving of its own article. (Please note that there is no consistent methodology for writing such tables, and the one's in the article and the references are all formatted differently.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 18:07, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually there is a consistent methodology -- the way that moves are presented and lines are expanded off of previous lines. This is quite similar to describing chess moves in other standard ways that are presented in articles on wikipedia -- like the <a href="../../../p/g/n/Pgn.html" title="Pgn">PGN standard</a> and the like. Pretty much every chess opening book dedicates a page or two to explaining this type of table, and for most part, the approach is the same. In fact, both the Nunn book and the MCO book use the same format. Any reader not familiar with the format will require an explanation and an article would be appropriate. In addition, there is some very interesting history on how these tables have evolved over the centuries. These facts and the "when in doubt, don't delete" philosophy should justify this article. For gosh sake, we have an articles on <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_of_contents.html" title="Table of contents">tables of contents</a>, and on <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_%28information%29.html" title="Table (information)">tables</a> themselves -- will you delete them too? They are certainly no more wiki-worthy... <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 18:32, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If any of this was true, there would be at least one hit for "Chess theory table" or "Chess opening theory table" on google. Unfortunately, aside from the one coincidental hit listed above, there are zero hits. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 19:37, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Explain to me why the number of hits on a search engine is a criterion for deletion? I am perfectly willing to entertain a name change to the article, but explaining how this notation works is directly analogous to, say, explaining how the notation in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> represents elements. The fact that it is a table is really not important. What is important is explaining to the lay-reader how these diagrams represent chess opening theory -- and more importantly how these diagrams evolve. Diagrams like this have been used by Grandmasters for centuries. I think the demonstrable benefits outweigh the chance that we have a topic "not deserving" of an article. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 23:19, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that's just the thing: the periodic table IS important because it's a table. That particular way of laying out the elements, in that chart, completely changed the way we think about atoms, and even helped predict the properties of atoms that had not yet been discovered. Did putting Chess Opening Theory into a table do that for Chess Opening Theory? If you can make a compelling argument for it, I will gladly change my vote. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 14:47, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These tables are the basis of how chess opening theory is communicated. No doubt the periodic table is of greater significance -- chess is, after all, just a game. But the principle is the same. For many players, these tables represent a standard way of laying out the lines of play, and when chess players move from being a beginner to being an amateur, they discover this type of depiction. That discovery changes the way they think about the opening. Often, they make the mistake of thinking they have to memorize these tables -- and then they figure out that no one, not even a GM could do that. This leads to the idea of a plan in the opening -- the real discovery. Each opening has a set of properties -- themes if you will -- that these tables can lead you to. So I say yes, these tables do the same thing for chess that the periodic table does for, the much more important topic, of science.

<li>If it was so important, why wouldn't there be even one hit on google? This is a misrepresentation of fact. These are just tables, like any other, of no significance, importance, or effect on the game of chess. If they did have any importance, there would be google hits. And to answer your earlier question, google hits are considered a measure of notability on wikipedia - especially when it concerns a subject that is popular on the internet (read: chess). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 18:24, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>My last comment on the google issue -- this question has been asked and answered above. These tables are all over the internet, and are referred to as they are in the article: Opening Theory Tables. Links, found using google, are provided above. Furthermore, the number of google hits is one way to establish notability -- there are others. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 18:49, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We'd gone really, really far in this discussion without attacking one another, or accusing anyone of intentionally trying to misrepresent the facts. I would ask that you do not turn this into ad hominem sniping. Clearly there are people who are passionately in favor of keeping this. Here are the questions that still linger for me:
<ul>
<li>Is there a reason why the "Chess Opening Theory Table" (COTT) should not simply be a part of "Chess Opening Theory" (COT)?
<ul>
<li>It would make the already long <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">COT</a> page too long. It seems wise to me to separate the theory from the way the theory is recorded. I do not, however, have a problem with this. I suspect the COT article authors would however. It would be simpler to put the opening tables on the COT page and link to COTT page for interpretation instructions. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 22:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do COTTs have a developmental history to them, separate from COT?
<ul>
<li>Yes. Before COTTs, games were studied one by one. COTTs came along as COT matured. COTTs are now generated on the fly by huge chess databases that are updated weekly. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 22:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have COTTs changed the way we think about COT?
<ul>
<li>Yes. GMs use COTT and other tools to find and research novelties -- sometimes right before and even between games at tournaments. I'm not saying COTTs are the only tool, but it is how the huge amount of data in these chess databases are distilled for the human brain to work with. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 22:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not laying these out as definitive criteria, I'm just personally curious about them. Again, obviously people are passionate about this; I'm just struggling to understand why, exactly. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 22:34, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My passion (scary as it may be) is that I would love for there to be a wiki version of the opening books (like Nunn's book). This would allow kibitzing to go on for each point in the opening tree. Some sites exist out there to do this for games (like <a href="http://www.chessgames.com" class="external text" title="http://www.chessgames.com" rel="nofollow">chessgames</a>), but none allow this for the opening. <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Opening_Theory" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Chess/Opening_Theory">Chess Opening Theory</a> would allow this, on an open platform, but it also needs to provide a description of the format -- which is more appropriately put on wikipedia. If this forum decides it is not "notable," I guess I'll just move it there. I wish someone would explain the passion people have for deleting what seems to be a reasonable article. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 22:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, (or possibly rename if there is a more common term for this way of presenting analysis).

<li><b>Rename</b>. The subject is encylopedic, and the thing described really exists and is a common convention, as others have noted above. But if nobody actually calls this kind of table a "Chess opening theory table", then including the article under that title is bad policy. -- <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominus_070e.html" title="User:Dominus">Dominus</a> 15:16, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b>. I'm willing to change my vote as Dominus has elucidated my main concern, no one uses this terminology.

<li>Why not change the name to <b>chess opening tree</b>? That's a real name, and that's what chessbase and everyone else refers to opening charts as. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 06:48, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> to <b>Chess opening table</b>. The term <i>theory table</i> is used only by Scid. The term <i>chess opening tree</i> refers to slightly different presentation of openning lines.

<li>I would support <b>Chess Opening Theory Table</b> (my favorite as it is today), <b>Chess Opening Table</b> (fine, but the whole point is the theory), or <b>Opening Table</b> (problematic with other games' opening tables). A <b>Chess Opening Treee</b> is a different format as pointed out by Andreas above. In summary, <b>Chess</b>: specifying the game, <b>Opening</b>: specifying the area of interest, <b>Theory</b>: what is being presented, and <b>Table</b>: because of the unique format that the article is, after all, describing. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 12:25, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd like to believe that my personal opinions have nothing to do with this request. Using the justifications cited here to "keep" the book, any book publisher could write software that cranks through their database to (A) create a new Wikipedia article for a every title, (B) populate it with the standard marketing description and table of contents and (C) add a "stub" tag - so the article can "be expanded later." We used to call this "spamming." --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 18:21, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is true that some unscrupulous publishers may theoretically take advantage of Wikipedia's openess to market their products. I do not think that we as editors thereby have a justification to interpret VfD policy to mean more than it does. The WP:DEL page is pretty clear about what articles should not be in VfD, and this is very probably one of them. I agree that the "article" on the book is awful, and the version that you came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=In_Defense_of_Internment&amp;oldid=20888589" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=In_Defense_of_Internment&amp;oldid=20888589" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> particularly so, but equally, it is reasonably clear that <a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">User:CltFn</a> is not a piece of software; indeed, a visit to his Talk page discloses that he has had long-standing problems with articles on books, and appears not to understand how to write one. That this is so is good reason to try and correct the POV problems of the page (or attaching tags to indicate the NPOV problem and the need for attention/cleanup), but it is not a reason to VfD the page.

<dd><b>In Defence of CltFn</b>. With all due respect folks I started this page as a <b><a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a></b>. No sooner had I done so an editor nominated it for deletion. I hardly had a chance to develop the article.

I have often added an author's quote to the pages because it is the only thing that seems to survive the shredding of unhappy POV warriors.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This will be a bit long-winded, please bear with me.<br />
<br />
User Karl Scherer created a number of spam pages for puzzle games produced by his company, Zillions of Games, and a Vfd was created to delete them. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Zillions_games_a7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games">This Vfd</a> explicitly named only pages such as Cleanup (Zillions game), Spaghetti (Zillions game) and a few dozen others in the same vein, however a mandate was claimed to delete a total of 200 pages (basically, every page ever created or edited by Karl Scherer), including seemingly generic terms with numerous Google hits such as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlocking_puzzle.html" title="Interlocking puzzle">interlocking puzzle</a>, which did not contain any spam links, and <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lock_puzzle.html" title="Lock puzzle">lock puzzle</a>, which had numerous contributions from other editors.<br />
<br />
After this was done, the VfD proposer (User:-Ril-) noticed that he had missed <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burr_puzzle.html" title="Burr puzzle">Burr puzzle</a> and proposed it for deletion separately. However <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Burr_puzzle_4f55.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle</a> turned out to be a keep: after a few rapid-fire delete votes, some research was done and it was verified that this was a generic and legitimate mathematical topic, and the tide turned and the vote was to keep.<br />
<br />
Arguably, a number of generic terms such as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlocking_puzzle.html" title="Interlocking puzzle">interlocking puzzle</a> were unjustifiably deleted in the original VfD ("throwing the baby out with the bathwater") and should be restored. These were not in fact explicitly named in that VfD page, but could only be known about by clicking to a separate page, where they were buried among a large listing of obvious spam pages. No doubt <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burr_puzzle.html" title="Burr puzzle">Burr puzzle</a> would have suffered the same fate, but for the accidental circumstance that the VfD proposer missed it the first time around.<br />
<br />
To prevent this from happening in the first place, the original VfD should have been split into more than one VfD, to distinguish between the no-brainer deletions such as Spaghetti (Zillions game) and legitimate generic terms such as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlocking_puzzle.html" title="Interlocking puzzle">interlocking puzzle</a> and a handful of others. Arguably, every single page that is being proposed for deletion needs to be individually listed on the VfD page, in order for that page's deletion to be validly decided. The wholesale nomination of 200 pages (with some pages requiring careful consideration mixed in among a large number of no-brainers, on a separate page that many voters didn't look at) is a bit too much, and it's easy for mistakes to be made.<br />
<br />
It seems to be -Ril-'s position that the mere existence of an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlocking_puzzle.html" title="Interlocking puzzle">interlocking puzzle</a> page constitutes advertising (or "original research spam") for Karl Scherer; perhaps he believes that this is a term coined or used only by Karl Scherer rather than a generic term. However, I believe that Google shows it is in fairly widespread use. Another user has claimed (in an entirely separate context) that <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Statement_by_Dmcdevit" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">-Ril- sometimes uses an overbroad definition of "advertising"</a> in recommending deletion of articles.<br />
<br />
Even if an article on a topic was originally created or edited by a spammer, that's not the topic's fault. There is no reason why we can't have a non-spammy article on that topic. After all, we wouldn't delete <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_novel.html" title="Mystery novel">mystery novel</a> just because some spammer created My Stupid Book (mystery novel), would we? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 13:18, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

The original reason for its deletion and VFD was that it is part of an original research categorisation of puzzles, that Karl Scherer was pushing into Wikipedia. Specifically, one article was created per class. "Lock puzzle" returns under 1000 hits in google, and most of those are describing a puzzle "with a lock". We don't have square puzzle or egg shaped puzzle or puzzle with a drawer or keyhole puzzle or puzzle on a chain, because even though this describes a group of puzzles, it isn't a correct classification of them, and pushing that classification would be original research. While there are things that fit the description in the text, there are also Cows that have been painted red, but we don't have an article on those, because they are not a proper classification of cows. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 23:48, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Because these pages were never actually mentioned within any VfD page, it is questionable whether you ever had a mandate to delete them.

As the article itself mentions, the novel and movie <i>Hellraiser</i> incorporates a lock puzzle. There are publications dedicated to puzzle solving and companies that make puzzles and hobbyists who solve them and they do have terminology to generically describe different types of puzzles.

<p>No. In discussion of Egyptian fields as they regard standards of measure</p>
<p>A kht is the measured side of an 3ht measuring 100 cubits. A st3t is a kht of 100 royal cubits. Some 3ht were measured in mh t3 or land cubits, some were measured in royal cubits, some were measured in hayt or rods. Egyptian fields is focused on the system of crop rotation that left one field fallow and one in hay for the plow animal that caused there to be a measure of 300 royal cubits as the side of the set of three crop rotated fields.</p>
<p>The kht page will focus on its definition as length width and area in the same manner as the English perch and show how it was used to convert the area of a circle to the area of a square in the rhind papyrus.</p>
<p>"Gillings shows how a number of math problems in the rhind papyrus were calculated using the khet as a length, area and volume knowledgable mensurationists are aware that Mesopotamian measures would be sexigesimal and Egyptian measures septenary</p>
<p>The Egyptians calculated in unit fractions so to represent a number like Pi, rather than use 22/7 they might have represented it as 3 '8 '16 ... The khet seems to be in a relation to other Egyptian units such that it facilitates calculating the area of a circular field." <a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 15:06, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The 3ht page will focus on different types of land discussed in Gardiner and the relation of land type to the different standards of measure used to report them in the Wilbur papyrus. "Land tenure in the Ramesside period: Kahaty</p>
<p>The st3t page will focus on area measure for fields with sides defined as a chain of 100 cubits in Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Persia and compare land measures like the atur or hour of march to the river journey or itrw. Both atur and itrw were a unit of 7 stadia of 300 royal cubits equal to 21,000 royal cubits or 1/10 geographical degree.</p>
<p>The atur page will focus on references to the atur in the 18th dynasty campaigns against kadesh and the itrw page will focus on Herodotus Book II comparisons of Egyptian, Greek and Persian measures and those used by Eratoshethes, Archimedes and Ptolomy.</p>
<p>Rktect 8/13/05 Their first sentence is identical because they are cross referenced.

<p>Rktect 8/13/05 English is an amalgamated language. Many English words and phrases such as Ibis, 3kr (acre) Thank you (ank shu), mht3 (meter or land measure) and water (w3dwr) actually have Egyptian roots. You can say the same thing for 5000 other languages. Lugal for example is the root of both legal and regal. Of the 500,000 plus words in the English language, a significant number are jargon which means they are of great use to a small subset of people and much less use to most people.</p>
<p>It might be of interest to some people who actually have an interest to know the root of the word and to have some facts about it available in Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, you're going to have to do more than make bald statements without support. "Regal", for example, comes from an ancient Indo-European root word which existed at least concurrently with, and possibly earlier than, Egyptian. These words did not bloom full-formed in the English language, nor is there <i><b>any</b></i> evidence that the words you keep trying to claim are Egyptian in fact are. "thank you" is <i><b>two</b></i> words, by the way, both from Germanic roots. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 22:16, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would respectfully suggest that there is a limit to how much you can put on one page. The kht needs its own page because its discussing standards of measure used as short hand aids to calculation with examples from the rhind papyrus and the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll (EMLR). The st3t needs its own page to focus on area measure for fields with sides defined as a chain of 100 cubits in Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Persia and compare land measures like the atur or hour of march to the river journey or itrw. Both atur and itrw were a unit of 7 stadia of 300 royal cubits equal to 21,000 royal cubits or 1/10 geographical degree. The 3ht needs its own page to focus on different types of land discussed in Gardiner and the relation of land type to the different standards of measure used to report them in the Wilbur papyrus. "Land tenure in the Ramesside period: Kahaty</p>
<p>If I try and put all that on an existing page it will be very difficult for someone to find quickly and expeditiously exactly the set of facts they are looking for. I would also like to add some graphics to the page so that's another reason to break it up a little, you can only put one or two pictures on a page at any decent resolution before it becomes hard to load.<a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 10:08, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It was going to be "with bias against re-creation", but looking at how many Google hits the term gets even after the Wikipedia mirrors are discounted changed my mind. As Entail points out, however, it's not like there's a single agreed-on meaning of the term; it seems to range from "sexual pornography of a very social kind" to "fantasies of particular social orders being sated in a fashion not unlike pornographic fantasies" to "curiosity about particular social conditions being sated in a manner whose explicitness is reminiscent of pornography" -- and probably more I haven't come across yet. It's perhaps a relief that this particular article is just a POV essay with no attempt to cite or reference, because I think sooner or later there needs to be a real article on the term, in all its senses, by all the people who have given it formal definitions that don't necessarily have anything to do with each other.

<p>This apprently was previously nominated, but someone removed the tag and deleted the VfD page, which seems quite improper. The original article was speedied as a substub with hardly any info. It was on VfU, not fairing too well, when someone wrote the current article, which is certainly not speedy material. As for this band, they have no recordings, but it's been put forth that they pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criterion #2. This is somewhat suspect, as playing a few gigs outside of the island you live on is hardly a substantial tour. For example, they played a festival in Copenhagen ("festival" meaning they were just one of many bands). Their best claim to notability is winning a Faroe Islands contest, and as of now I can't tell how great of an accomplishment that is (the Faroe Islands having a population less than that of Eau Claire, Wisconsin). But I'd say it's their only real shot at articleworthiness. <i>gestir band faroe</i> got me 29 google hits.-<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:10, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wrote the article having read on VfU that the subject was clearly notable and that the subject would be kept as long as someone wrote a proper article, which I did.

<li>Only 1 person in the VfU said they were clearly notable, and didn't exactly give any rationale for that statement.

<li>My town is bigger than the Faroe Islands, and simply being "big" here certainly doesn't qualify a band for being in an encyclopedia. Fortunately, we have a nice guidelines to help us decide on bands, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. If they DO meet the criteria there, by all means the article should make this clear, and I'll reconsider my vote. Just to put things in perspective, these guys don't even have a record yet. Article says they're signed to a label which I can't find any information on (other than their website, which makes them sound like a vanity label for music from that particular location).

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm certainly willing to entertain the idea that the music guideline is slanted. But help us out here, what would make this band notable?

<li>Como mi amigo,el el Peruano-Japones,que escribio este articulo no esta presente,lo defendere yo.por lo visto,los atacantes,sigen la saga,aun continuan en sus mismas practicas,les fascina agredir a los indefensos.espero que sean justos y no sanguinarios como la vez anterior,aunque la idea de democracia y justicia es tan variada y colorida dependiendo de cada quien...</li>
</ul>
<p>yo el hispano hablante(see leer en ingles y escribo algo de este idioma,y comprendo los ataques que se le hicieron a mi conocido,el estimado autor),fui colaborador de el durante cierto tiempo,cuando enviaba sus escritos. el sintio molestia por la incomprension o molestia de algunos y decidio no componer mas. despues por motivos de trabajo se fue de viaje y yo segui colocando algunos articulos y comentarios que el me habia pedido enviar. y observe en sus concejos de eliminacion/borrado,en las opiniones de votacion como abundaban(y aun estan ahi) los diversos agresores,de todo tipo,color, formas,tamaños y pelajes.algunos lo hacian de manera digamos,planificada y analitica,otros lo hacian por puro gusto y otros ,simplemente no se y algunos(tal vez los comprendo mejor,se sentian ofendidos) compatriotas,les causo cierta molestia,pero se comprende mejor,en fin habian criticas para todos los gustos... incluso he observado cierto sarcasmo o cinismo como este: It's fascism! it's Japanese! it's <i>Japanese fascism</i>! y yo entiendo muy bien el sarcasmo y la burla aunque este en ingles,lastima que el autor no este por aqui! aunque no tengo las armas adecuadas(exelente ingles y buena gramatica inglesa),decidi apoyarle,expresando mi opinion en mi idioma natal el español,pude haber utilizado mi limitado ingles,pero he preferido hacerlo de esta forma. como es comun ver en todos los grandes grupos,nunca faltaran las gentes no que sugieran criticas constructivas,sino destructivas y agresivas o sea de todo hay en la viña del señor!</p>

<p>This is not and never was a real release by Daphne Loves Derby. After the release of their debut EP "Closing Down The Pattern Department" in 2003, they uploaded a demo song to their PureVolume profile which was there listed under the category "Post EP" (as in "songs recorded after the EP"). When they began demoing for their 2005 full-length, they put up three new demo songs under "Post Post EP" (as in "songs recorded after 'Post EP'"). Neither "Post EP" nor "Post Post EP" were actual CD releases by the band. Hence, all the information given in the Post Post (EP) article is totally incorrect and it shouldn't even have a seperate article page anyway, but should be on DLD's article page, just like the band's other demos. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 18:32, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b>: Hi Mark. I'm sorry but I don't quite understand. The <b>eXILE VfD</b> was initiated by User:199.107.55.222 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/The_eXile&amp;diff=21002527&amp;oldid=21002410" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/The_eXile&amp;diff=21002527&amp;oldid=21002410" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. This was a very strongly worded VfD against an article on the eXILE magazine, and seems to have been motivated by reasons other than a concern for WP policy. When VfD editors started disagreeing with User:199.107.55.222's take on the article, he actually reworded his VfD even more harshly. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/The_eXile&amp;diff=21007279&amp;oldid=21003667" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/The_eXile&amp;diff=21007279&amp;oldid=21003667" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The article proposed by malathion for deletion is a piece on one Denis Salnikov. It was <i><b>written by</b></i> User:199.107.55.222 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denis_Salnikov_hoax&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denis_Salnikov_hoax&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. From start to end, this article appears to be an unrelenting personal attack of Mr. Salnikov, and as malathion points out, there is no modifying view to counter the strident POV by the author. For some reason User:199.107.55.222 does not seem very fond of either eXILE or its employees. Anyway, I voted to <b>delete</b> this as it looks like a transparent attack piece. There is some question over whether it qualifies as a speedy; I think it just might under <b><a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">A6</a></b>, which states that short articles that exist simply to disparage their subjects are candidates for speedy (the shortness of short is not defined). I don't think malathion agrees with that route, but there I agree with him about <b>delete</b>. Have I missed something about the article that convinced you it should stay?

<li>Let me clarify: I think this is a worthwhile topic, that should be included in Wikipedia. Clearly the current version of the article is far from the standard set by the most brilliant prose on Wikipedia, but that means it should be improved, rather than deleted. I don't care whether the article is merged, renamed, etc. I'm merely stating my opinion that the "Denis Salnikov" affair is a topic that's, uhm, keep-worthy. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 01:53, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mark, we are in fundamental agreement. The only reason my vote (delete) differs from yours (keep) is that I'm looking at this from the closer's POV, in which he has to decide whether the page at "Denis Whatsisname hoax" has to be deleted, or kept. Because we all agree the title is itself biased, it should be deleted (or as you say, "renamed"). A redirect is unsuitable for the same reason, and unnecessary if the new title contains his name anyway. I have absolutely no objection whatsoever to anyone writing an article now or in the future with a suitable title ("Denis Whatsis") and dealing with it with the NPOV. The reason I didn't vote "merge" is that there is nothing in the article that needs to be merged, there is no other article at present to merge to, and currently the article is itself an unrelenting personal attack from start to end, such that it really should be deleted on sight. WP should have as many good articles as possible and as few poor ones; but it should have zero personal attacks. Kind regards—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 16:31:05, 2005-08-18 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rename to Denis Salnikov or <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_eXile_ffcc.html" title="The eXile">the eXile</a>, (edited see below). we should give an NPOV account of how it has been suggested that this is a fictional/satirical character, explain how his club review style etc. relates to eXile's style, and how he relates to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Russian_a111.html" title="New Russian">novi ruskii</a> phenomenon. this personage is notable, even if he doesn't deserve its own article <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 16:36, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Dsol</b>, the reason I urged <b>delete</b> is that the title seems to me irretrivably one sided. If the title page was just "David Whatsisname", it would be fine to simply edit the article to introduce the NPOV. In fact that would be the best solution. But <i>this</i> title should to be deleted. If an editor is interested in starting an article on David after that, he is entirely free to do so.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 22:02:00, 2005-08-17 (UTC)</li>

OK, unless I've misunderstood something, there seems to be a disconnect here. Every one of the above voters is <b>saying the same thing</b>, but is using <b>different words to vote</b>. We agree: David Whatsis is notable, a good article on him is suitable for WP, the current article is a personal attack, the current title is too biased to be maintained even if a perfectly NPOV article on David is written in that title space. What this implies, I think, is a delete vote for the closer. When one says "<b>rename</b>", one is saying "<b>delete the page and start a new one with a new name</b>," because in effect that is what has to be done (if my understanding of the technical process is wrong I hope an admin will correct this statement). Do any one of the above voters have an objection to the following sequence of actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the page titled "Denis Salnikov hoax."</li>
<li>Open a new page titled "Denis Salnikov."</li>
<li>Write an NPOV article in that title space on David Salnikov.</li>
<li>Alternatively, instead of 2 and 3, write an NPOV accont of Denis Salnikov in the eXILE article.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you agree with the above, your vote is <b>delete</b>. If you disagree, it is <b>keep, keep/redirect</b>, or something else that requires <i><b>maintenance</b></i> of the page "Denis Salnikov hoax."

<dd>Further comment: even if it's rewritten, the promotional origin makes it important to subject even the more mundane claims to scrutiny. For instance, Amazon best-seller status is not necessarily what it sounds: see <a href="http://www.writersweekly.com/the_latest_from_angelahoycom/002841_07272005.html" class="external text" title="http://www.writersweekly.com/the_latest_from_angelahoycom/002841_07272005.html" rel="nofollow">writersweekly</a> on the subject. And then there are the <a href="http://www.gnosticweb.com/index.php?PageID=63" class="external text" title="http://www.gnosticweb.com/index.php?PageID=63" rel="nofollow">study centers</a>, which sound like they have dedicated premises, yes? But a closer look finds that these venues are public rental rooms like the Indooroopilly Senior Citizens Centre, Brisbane, the Grattan Gardens Community Centre, Melbourne, and The Cedar Room, Wollongong Town Hall and Community Centre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, which takes precedence: VfD or copyvio? Easiest solution would be to slap a copyvio tag on it; it looks pretty clear-cut. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 11:23, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO, copyvio definitely takes precedence, since if the VfD were to keep it would have to be deleted anyway as a copyvio.

<dd>Hi there, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.69.18.3_1ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.69.18.3">User:82.69.18.3</a>. You're absolutely right, it's not nonsense. That's why none of us calls it that. And you're also right about a basic WP mechanism, everyone is welcomed to contribute their bit to improve what is a great human endeavour — to make important information as freely available as possible. While we're doing this, however, we need to follow certain rules so that we can be reasonably sure that the information it provides is true. One of those rules is to source things that we write. Another is that we write about things that are notable, because no encyclopedia can (or should) be riddled with every bit of available information simply because it is information. (That can be the goal of another kind of project, but that project will not be an encyclopedia). Those are the reasons this article is up for deletion.

<li><s><b>Merge and redirect</b>.</s> <b>Keep</b>. There is some precedent for articles about lotteries on the EnWiki, however they are filled with trivia at best. <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Lottery_8552.html" title="California Lottery">California Lottery</a> is a gruesome stub, and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Lottery_15e9.html" title="Florida Lottery">Florida Lottery</a> is an unencyclopedic list of games offered by the commission. I would argue that the most notable aspect of government-run lotteries is the winners themselves, but even they lack notability by virtue of the fact that there's a new winner almost every single week. I don't think there's a great deal of encyclopedic things to say about lotteries. I propose that the few existing lottery articles be merged into new, more appropriate blanket articles such as List of lotteries in Great Britain or List of lotteries in the United States. If there's anything encyclopedic and verifiable to be said about these individual lotteries, let it be said with a blurb under its entry on the list (good example of concept: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_2041.html" title="List of Star Wars races">List of Star Wars races</a>). I would love to hear more opinions on this matter. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 08:09, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Fair enough, but what exactly is encyclopedic about an individual lottery? I'm really asking for your opinion here, as my own thinking would benefit from some outside input. Are not all lotteries essentially the same? <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 08:32, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The novelty in this one is the way the winner is decided. Individual lotteries are given articles if they are significant eg <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lottery_179b.html" title="National Lottery">National Lottery</a> (UK), <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euromillions.html" title="Euromillions">Euromillions</a>, and most US state lotteries. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 08:39, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Again, fair enough. But is that unique enough for its own article? Couldn't it be covered in a sentence or two in an article such as the one I proposed in my vote above? <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 08:45, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is fair enough but as the UK only has two lotteries this would be a very small and unhelpful article. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lottery_179b.html" title="National Lottery">National Lottery</a> and the National PostCode Lottery work in very different ways and have very different aims, so it makes sense for them to have separate articles.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The spread of this type of lottery is actually quite an important innovation. If the lottery succeeds it will have a major effect on the UK National lottery and on the way that lotteries are run in many other countries. It is a significant departure from the scratchcard or match 5 numbers models used to date.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is not an official UK lottery. It may be genuine, it may be a 419-class scam. If its genuine, then lets see some press in the national papers and media before an independent article is written. In the UK, Postcode lottery usually refers to the fact that quality of medical service varies by region: the real national postcode lottery is the national health service.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>There has been much press and media coverage, however as this is based in the North-East the coverage is pretty much confined to the North-East and tends to appear in local papers (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Echo_ff3c.html" title="Northern Echo">Northern Echo</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evening_Chronicle_05d5.html" title="Evening Chronicle">Evening Chronicle</a>, The Journel, <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunderland_Echo_6ff5.html" title="Sunderland Echo">Sunderland Echo</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herald_and_Post_f861.html" title="Herald and Post">Herald and Post</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shields_Gazette_f3ec.html" title="Shields Gazette">Shields Gazette</a>, North East Telegraph), Radio (<a href="../../../t/f/m/TFM_21e0.html" title="TFM">TFM</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metro_Radio_7716.html" title="Metro Radio">Metro Radio</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_1152.html" title="Magic 1152">Magic 1152</a>, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Newcastle_89da.html" title="BBC Radio Newcastle">BBC Radio Newcastle</a>) and TV (<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_North_East_and_Cumbria_aa51.html" title="BBC North East and Cumbria">BBC North East and Cumbria</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyne_Tees_TV_90ed.html" title="Tyne Tees TV">Tyne Tees TV</a>). So the reasons given above are not really valid.

According to his website (but not the article) he gives lectures, but so do tens of thousands of other non-notable people. If Mr. Samara is so noteworthy, let's see a reference to an article or book written about him by a notable third party (the New York Times, the Village Voice, etc).

What is written about Tony Samara is correct and his invaluable work is being documented in books that are to be released by third parties at the end of this year.

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The consensus of this discussion was fairly clear that the current office-holder does not meet the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. The Camilo Agasim-Pereira is further complicated as it is an autobiography with all the challenges and risks those articles entail. (Note to the subject: We strongly discourage the creation of autobiographies. It is impossible to stay neutral in the discussion. If you are famous enough to deserve an article in a general purpose encyclopedia like Wikipedia, be patient and let someone else write it. In the meantime, feel free to create a user account. We allow quite a bit more latitude in the user space to write about yourself.)</p>
<p>The consensus was also quite clear that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a genealogical database</a> and that a great deal of these articles constitute genealogical data.</p>
<p>The decision was a closer call on whether a neutral discussion of the Baronies themselves might be encyclopedic. I note that one is explicitly described as being a mere 40 acres. Wikipedia is widely inconsistent about the inclusion standards for places. If kept, this would stand at the small end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Noting that, the current contents of the two "Baron" articles have only a little content about the respective Baronies. If converted into discussions of the Barony, most of the content would probably be removed and the title would have to be changed.</p>
<p>I am going to call Camilo Agasim-Pereira as a straight delete decision.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion here and call the other two as "no consensus" decisions for now. If they are not substantially improved in a reasonable amount of time, it may be appropriate to renominate them for deletion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:36, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This appears to be someone who just bought two titles (in the Scots Peerage, the lowest rank is Lord and not Baron; a Baron is merely the person who owns a particular patch of land). Lots of stories about the people who previously held the title but the current holder appears not to be notable, and I would also argue that Scots Baronies are not actually notable in themselves. The last named article is a total mess as someone appears to have edited it to criticise the subject. All three appear largely to be autobiographical. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 21:42, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In fact you can buy a Scottish barony, for about 100,000 pounds. Until recently you did this by buying the associated land under "feudal tenure", but the Scottish Parliament abolished feudal tenure so now you do not even need to buy the land. But indeed owning this title does not make you part of the peerage, or notable in a Wikipedia sense. The question for me is whether Camilo Agasim-Pereira is notable in himself. If he is then his somewhat colourful life needs to be noted, whether he is sensitive about it or not. <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Feudal_Baronies_e23d.html" title="Scottish Feudal Baronies">Scottish Feudal Baronies</a> is another of his articles. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Camilo_Agasim-Pereira&amp;oldid=20721770" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Camilo_Agasim-Pereira&amp;oldid=20721770" rel="nofollow">old version</a> was not a mess. --<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFacethefacts_f1c1.html" title="User:Facethefacts">Facethefacts</a> 07:41, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I mean the Camilo Agasim-Pereira one. However the fact remain the if we like it or not baronies and barons are legal title in the Noblesse of Scotland and were titles created in the peerage of Scotland, late the barons themselves gave-up the right to attend Parliament voluntary due to the burden of doing so.</li>
</ul>
<p>As recent as 2000 the Scottish Parliament re-affirmed those titles in §63(1) of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) ACT 2000 provides that "Any jurisdiction of, and any conveyancing privilege incidental to, barony shall on the appointed day cease to exist; but nothing in this Act affects the dignity of baron or any other dignity or office (whether or not of feudal origin)", therefore forever enshrined in law the dignity of the baronage of Scotland, the whole issue of sit in Parliament is dead one as neither Scottish Barons or Hereditary Peers can sit in Parliament any longer. Whether or not someone buy a title those title can only be used with a warrant from Lord Lyon’s Court on behalf of the Queen, I check in the Baron of Fulwood’s site he does hold a Warrant for Letter Patent, and also appear from the disposition that his title was not bought but bequeathed to him by the previous baron. --L Morgan 17:34, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Gentleman</b>, I hate to see an argument over something as innocent as the history of our Baronies.</p>
<p>You are all assuming erroneously that I paid for my title that is not so, even if there is nothing wrong in law to do so in Scotland.</p>
<p>Being a Scottish Baron today is about helping your local community, scholarships, charity and the promotion of the well-being of your barony, we certainly have done our fair share of those acts in our communities and in support of many cultural institutions in the UK and overseas. It is true that I have experienced some set backs in my life however I think that the Courts decisions in those matters speaks for themselves, they were fabricated and false allegations.</p>
<p>I do hold a Warrant from the Crown confirming my title and I have not bought my titles. All these comments are so unnecessary, as to the autobiography issue, I believe that there are 7 lines in the articles dealing with me and my family as the present holders of Baronies of Fulwood and Dirleton that have been in existence for over 600 years, hardly an autobiography, the rehearsal of old defamatory statements by Facethefacts in a new and incorrect article is the issue in hand not a historical piece on the Baronies of Fulwood and Dirleton, that certainly has its historical value.</p>
<p>To say the Scottish Baronies are not notable, is an insult to the History of Scotland to say the least. It clearly show a lack of knowledge of Scottish History, by the way not a “province” of a England but a equal partner, with its very unique monarchy, government and judicial system, please bear in mind the of System of the Nobility of Scotland are not English, but very Scottish. The importance of Scottish Baronage is demonstrated in the fact that even The Prince of Wales as Heir to the Scottish Throne hold the Scottish Feudal Title of “ Baron of Renfrew” among his official title. It's true most of us holders of Scottish baron titles are not notable, but the title and the history clearly is so. Here are a few quote that could maybe improve the lack of knowledge of the importance the Scottish Baronies held in the history of Scotland:</p>
<p><br />
1- That the Baronage of Scotland is an 'order', 'estate' (of the Scots' Realm) and a 'Rank': See Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, "The Robes of the Feudal Baronage of Scotland," (27th Oct 1945) Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Vol. 79, pp. 111 at 113, 116, fn. 1, 146, 150</p>
<p>2- Statement in Lyon Court documents that minor barons are officially the 'equivalent to the chiefs of Baronial Houses on the Continent of Europe': See Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, "The Robes of the Feudal Baronage of Scotland," (27th Oct 1945) Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Vol. 79, pp. 111 at p. 143, fn. 3, 155.

<p>3- Statement in Lyon Court documents that minor barons constitute a 'titled nobility' and that the estate of the Baronage are of the ancient feudal nobility of Scotland: See See 26th February 1943, Register of Genealogies, Vol IV, p 26; Thomas Innes of Learney, "The Robes of the Feudal Baronage of Scotland," Proc. of Soc. of Antiquaries of Scotland, (27th October 1945) Vol 79, P. 111 at p. 143, fn. 3, 154. See Petition of Sir Hugh Vere Huntly Duff Munro-Lucas-Tooth, 1965 S.L.T. (Lyon Ct.) 2 at p. 13;</p>
<p>4- The Lyon Court has issued a official pronouncement that the feudal or minor Baronage of Scotland constitute a ‘titled nobility’, as Sir Thomas declares in “The Robes of the Baronage of Scotland”, ibid., p. 143 in fn. 3, as follows:</p>
<p>“Edinburgh, 26th February 1943. The Lord Lyon King of Arms having considered the foregoing (in a birthbrief, the preparation whereof was then duly ‘authorised’, being the Signature for such writ ). ‘Further, with regard to the words ‘untitled nobility’ employed in certain recent birthbrieves in relation to the Minor Baronage of Scotland, Finds and Declares that the Minor Barons of Scotland are, and have been both in this nobiliary Court and in the Court of Session recognised as a “titled nobility” and that the estait of the Baronage (i.e. Barones Minores) are of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland’ (Reg. Of Gen., vol. IV. P. 26).” (Emphasis supplied.)

<li><b>Keep</b> Baron of Dirlton - This is an interesting history of the Barony (and therefore <i>notable</i> to me!) - the holder himself is not the primary subject of the article, and I don't have any problem that the current title holder added or edited the article himself. I don't believe the article is primarily genealogical either. I don't think Wikipedia shouldn't have a POV over whether the title can be bought or sold, either - they are still notable in Scottish history.

<li>Scots Baronies do not belong in that Category as I read it. They are fundamentally different to Baronies in the English and Irish Peerages because the latter are Peerages whereas the former are not. There is no POV over whether Scots Baronies are capable of being bought and sold: they are so capable, as a matter of fact and not opinion. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 09:48, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I stand corrected over the category! The POV is not whether they can be bought or sold, but whether Wikipedia should treat that as a reason for exclusion from the encyclopedia. Just because some people don't like the fact that a title can be bought or sold should not mean that that POV should govern whether the title is an entry in Wikipedia - such titles are provably historical and therefore notable and worthy of entry. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenb_2afe.html" title="User:Stephenb">Stephenb</a> 13:03, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>The user <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> is failing to notice one thing, every title in the Uk was somehow acquired, in one way or another, only a simple mind would think otherwise, nothing is for free in life. Scottish barony were (or are as per some scholars) peerages.It is a fact, however, that the feudal earls and barons were the original peers of the realm in the proper feudal sense of the word. It is also a fact, as stated above, that feudal barons continued to have the right to sit as part of the nobility in the Scottish Parliament up to the time of the Act of Union. Since they had as much right to sit as part of the nobility in the Scottish Parliament as did 'lords of parliament' they were, at that time, just as much peers as those 'lords of parliament'. Lord Bankton, one of the great institutional writers (i.e. someone who is accepted as authoritative in courts of law), states in his 'Institute of the Laws of Scotland' (II, III, para 83) that 'Baronies and Regalities come next to be considered … This leads me to the distinction of fees Noble and Ignoble … Noble fees, are those which conferred nobility to persons vested in them; these were baronies and regalities; and anciently all nobility, in the modern states proceeded from such fees; thus the title of Baron included Duke, Marquis and Earl, as well as that of Lord. All barons were equally entitled, as lords of parliament, to sit and vote in it'. This makes it quite clear that anyone who had the right to sit in Parliament as a baron was a lord of parliament and therefore, if there was any doubt in the matter, also a peer. In addition, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney refers ('The Robes of the Feudal Baronage of Scotland', P.S.A.S, Vol. LXXIX, p. 144) to the case of Sundry Barons v. Lord Lyon (1672) ('Brown's Supplement', Vol. III, p. 6) where those sundry barons 'successfully maintained, in claiming their supporters, that they were as good Barons after that Act (1587) as before'. On this basis, Scottish feudal barons were 'peers of Scotland' for the purposes of sections 22 and 23 of the Act of Union which made all 'peers of Scotland' into 'peers of Great Britain' (they remained 'peers of Scotland' but became part of a greater peerage of Great Britain). Since Scottish feudal barons became 'peers of Great Britain' in 1707 they have continued to be so ever since and all of them became entitled to sit in the House of Lords under the Peerage Act of 1963 (The Act states that 'The holder of a peerage in the peerage of Scotland shall have the same right to receive writs of summons to attend the House of Lords and to sit and vote in that House as the holder of a peerage in the peerage of the United Kingdom; and the enactments relating to the election of Scottish representative peers shall cease to have effect.') Since their peerages are not 'hereditary' under the terms of the House of Lords Act 1999 but are 'in commercio' (they can be bought and sold), they were not deprived of their right to sit in the House of Lords by that Act. Approached from the other direction the question is simply 'If feudal barons were originally peers of Scotland, exactly when and how did they cease to be peers of Scotland?' The answer is they didn't, certainly not in 1428 or 1587 (because they continued to have the right to attend Parliament as nobles) and certainly not in 1707. He may want to come up with a better argument in law for his point against the historical value of Scottish Baronies, what is cleaner buying a hereditary title legally, or donating a few thousand pounds under the table to the government of the day and getting one that will only last you the course of your lifetime. If a man can not write the history of his own Barony, I guess Churchill History of the World War should be discarded too, as he was one of the major player in the event.--The Baron of Fulwood 15:08, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is so much nonsense in that that paragraph that it is difficult to know where to start. Please find any example of a holder of a Scottish Barony (who was not in one of the other categories) as a recorded member of the British House of Lords from 1963 to 1999. Even better, turn up yourself now and make enough of a speech to get "Baron of Fulwood" published as a speaker in the House of Lords Hansard.

<dd><a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> is absolutely correct. Scots Baronies are <b>not</b> Peerages.

<p>David, I can't work out if you just hate Scottish Baron or the Scotland in general, until 9 months ago (November 28, 2000) Scottish Baron had magisterial power and were feudal superior all over Scotland, the power all such and so out of place in the 21st century that the Scottish Parliament so fitted to abolish the Feudalism and Magisterial power of the Barons. Now come you in you with your “learned legal mind” and compare and stated that a Scottish barony are the same as a Lordship of the Manor in England, your sense of History and Law is so appalling that makes one want to laugh at your knowledge and bias. What is you could no acquire one therefore you just hate them all, Freud explain those feeling the question is can you understand his explanation?--The Baron of Fulwood 16:05, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ho hum. It's best to avoid <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> on other Wikipedians and policy is to delete them, but I think it best to leave this one alone and pass over the personal aspect without comment - save to say that I am not one of 'learned in the law'. I nominated the three articles for deletion because I do not think they cover subjects which are appropriate for an encyclopaedia, in that the subjects are not notable. This does not apply to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Feudal_Baronies_e23d.html" title="Scottish Feudal Baronies">Scottish Feudal Baronies</a> and I would vote keep if anyone nominated that for deletion, but individual Scots Baronies are different. This is not due to a bias against the nobility, but to considerations of what benefits Wikipedia. As a <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Douglas-Home_d703.html" title="Alec Douglas-Home">Alec Douglas-Home</a> (14th Earl of Home in the Peerage of Scotland) remarked of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, he was in a sense the 14th Mr Wilson. We don't let people write their family histories and put them on Wikipedia, nor should we allow the collective history of people who happen to have held a particular feudal Scots title: it's simply too coincidental to be put together. If individual holders are notable then write articles about them, and by all means point out that they held the title and passed it to someone else, but the Barony is not in itself significant enough - in my judgment - to warrant an article. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 10:27, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>David, Thanks for clarifying your position. It was never my intent to write our family history for that purpose we have our website. I Think that what Lord Home was saying was that he was the 14th Mr. Home and not Mr Wilson, however with all due respect to Lord Home, who disclaimed his Title in 23 of October 1963and then was created a life Peer in 1975(as baron Home of Hirsel), he was wrong Mr is a title, like Earl is a title, if however he made that statement between 1963 and 1975 he was correct he was just plain Mr. Douglas-Home and not Mr Home as his name was a double barreled one. I might be wrong but I think that Lord Home actually was born in the Barony of Fulwood. I'm sorry if I offended you. I should not have done so. I apologize once again for my outspoken manner. The whole intent was to publish the History of the Barony not of ourselves. I don't have a problem if you remove my name, however that would be a mutilation of the history of the barony. Surely once I'm gone the new Baron, my son could add my name to the history, among the only good things about a heriditary title is it's immortality. --The Baron of Fulwood 00:03, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Famous quote from the '64 election - Wilson kept remarking that the 14th Earl of Home could hardly be a man of the people (he had disclaimed then, but it's not like people had forgotten where he was a year before), and Douglas-Home remarked "As far as the 14th Earl is concerned, I suppose that Mr. Wilson, when you come to think of it, is the 14th Mr. Wilson". Not a desperately meaningful statement, but a nice rejoinder. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 04:07, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I must disagree with the description as not-notable fancruft; it's a major plot element of the final series/arc of Sailor Moon. As such I'd say it's more notable than many of the articles we have on fictional characters who appeared during a single plot arc of their respective shows but were not important to the plot throughout, as the plot element of starseeds was. If we had a separate article for the "Sailorstars" series/arc of Sailor Moon, I'd call for it to be merged there.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Police departments are probably notable, but there is something about the way this article reads that gives me a little concern about saying keep. If the article underwent a major cleanup to remove all of the stuff that belongs in other articles, like the details of the laws it follows then it could clear up a lot of confusion. At worst case, this should not be deleted but <b>merge</b>d into the school article. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:37, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 5 "delete" votes to 4 "keep" votes. In this case, I am forced to remember that, despite the name, "votes for deletion" is not about "voting" at all. We seek consensus and strive to base our decisions on evidence, logic, policy and precedent. In this case, I find myself most compelled by <a href="../../../d/2E/_/User%7ED._Wu_3a90.html" title="User:D. Wu">User:D. Wu</a>'s observation that all the encyclopedic content is a copy from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Washington_e29d.html" title="University of Washington">University of Washington</a> article. (I can not convince myself that the list of police chiefs meets our recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>.)</p>
<p>I further note that similar VfD decisions on university police departments have been decided as "delete" decisions. While every article is unique and must be judged on its own merits, we should consider precedent. The argument that "any police department is automatically notable" is not one that has been supported by the community previously.</p>
<p>Given that the content is still discussed in another article (and that the other article appears to be the parent, therefore there is no requirement to preserve attribution history in order to comply with GFDL), I am going to exercise my discretion on this one and call it as a "delete" decision. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:58, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the same vein, I am also nominating this article because of non-notability.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>, as a major contributor to this article and small-time wikipedia contributor in general I'm shocked to see that it was deleted.
