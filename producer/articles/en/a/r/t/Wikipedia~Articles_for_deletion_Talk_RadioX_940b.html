<li><b>Keep</b> MnementhVII (Streamerp2p coder) How do new things get posted on Wikipedia?, sometimes it's going to be by somebody connected to the topic, as is the case here. How long is the 'grace period' for such a post to exist, without somebody not somehow connected to it posting, before it gets declared 'from a single purpose account' and nuked?. The current contributors to the article are admittedly all listeners to the stream and not completely independent. (but are not sock puppets). RadioX/streamerp2p is creating something that could be a new internet meme, that of 'live podcasting', and especially that of broadcasting live skype conferences to do chat shows. This has not previously been possible without bandwidth for streaming servers, and the accompanying constant donation begging they require. It currently seems to be a popular thing to do and is rapidy attracting new contributors. RadioX now has a full live schedule every evening, and some currently established shows from elsewhere are also appearing on their own channels, Chaos theory radio being one. I say it is worthy of having an article here. On the other hand, 'TalkRadioX - banned from Wikipedia' is a cool parting gift&#160;;-) If it is deleted, can it be re-added at some later date when it has grown more? <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: MnementhVII (<a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnementhVII_87ed.html" title="User talk:MnementhVII">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MnementhVII_7a70.html" title="Special:Contributions/MnementhVII">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Okay, I have read all the comments on the "main page" and on the "delete" page ... some of which are my own. I guess I should be noted as a Wikipedia virgin "trying" to understand what is going on here. Obviously, many view Talk RadioX and the streamerp2p as "not notable" and "single purpose" ... well as for not notable, if everything "new" was "not notable", how would technology ever advance??? .. AND as for "single purpose", what else is it supposed to be? Maybe I'm wrong, but I consider the Wikipedia like a dictionary and when i'm looking in the dictionary for "one word" .. thats ALL I want to see. Could someone that knows the ins and outs of Wikipedia please explain what exactly it is that needs to be done, changed or ammended to "keep" this post. May I also add, on the Radio Dan and Intern Jessica show, they have made MANY references to "Wikipedia" and use this as a valuable "search tool" for many of their discussions! If it wasn't for the broadcasters of Talk RadioX, I still wouldn't know that Wikipedia exists. For all those that wish to "delete", I encourage you to tune in for the shows and if you wish to verbally discuss your point of view and give some valuable tips to help save this post, call Radio Dan at 8pm EST, we will all be listening as we are all concerned about the "delete" discussion and process. /I personally would appreciate any assistance that you could give. / Jackie Jack <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.93.22.148 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.93.22.148.html" title="User talk:65.93.22.148">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.93.22.148_0c18.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.93.22.148">contribs</a>) 2006-09-30T17:59:59 (UTC)</small>

<li>MnememthVII Mine is definitely a single purpose account. I opened it to post in this discussion, rather than being an anonymous IP. I see it earned a 'single purpose account' tag, which actually appears worse than an anonymous posting. I think people outside of Wikipedia perceive it to be a 'peoples encyclopedia', where anybody can post things they think may be of interest to others. But that isn't really how it works, there is a heirarchy of sorts operating here. Correct? How would an article about the Streamerp2p app/network/community itself be accepted?. After several years of it's existence, nobody else has created an article, so it's likely to be me and my 'single purpose account' that does it. I see the other p2p radio system 'peercast' is on here, the article also having been created by it's developer, and that is marked as biased (but not pending delete) even though it contains factual innacuracies that are detremental to peercast.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MnementhVII (<a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnementhVII_87ed.html" title="User talk:MnementhVII">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MnementhVII_7a70.html" title="Special:Contributions/MnementhVII">contribs</a>) 2006-09-30T18:52:31 (UTC)</small></li>
