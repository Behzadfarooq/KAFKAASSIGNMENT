<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's very useful as a source of links to other pages for old or obscure shows that many people would not know about otherwise. As for being redundant in the Anime article, someone's going to complain that that article is too long with its version and delete that. Frankly, this list is far more useful than many articles which ARE kept.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd be right with you, CFL, if I thought some information were being lost by this article's deletion. But the categories serve the purpose this list does. To take an example, look at <i><a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigantor.html" title="Gigantor">Gigantor</a></i>. it's listed at the Categories&#160;: Anime series, Mecha anime, Anime dubbed into English and Mecha manga. These categories more than cover the list.

Also, since the recategorization of anime articles from the main <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnime_6c0f.html" title="Category:Anime">Category:Anime</a> to the genre categories easier this year, the deletion of this and a couple of other lists have been long in coming. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 12:34, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> On second thought... I agree with the consensus that this list as it stands-- a simple alphabetical listing of titles-- is redundant to the categories. However, a list can be informative in a way that a category cannot. For example, just reordering the list chronologically would be useful in a way that an alphabetically-ordered category is not. Also other information can be put after the title-- for example the director, author or studio that produced the anime. Reordering the list chronologically would be a lot of work, but, I think, useful. Just an idea. --<a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 17:11, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Further thought on the matter: By doing the list chronologically, we could break the article down into decades. <i>List of 1960s anime</i>, <i>List of 1970s anime</i>... A paragraph summary of anime activity in each decade could be put at the top of each article. This would address the problem of the list's unwieldy size, make the article into not just a category/list, but a historical chronology of the development of anime (with a list of every anime, which is beyond the scope of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_anime.html" title="History of anime">History of anime</a> article), and also be helpful for those of us who are interested more in one particular era of anime than others. --<a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 20:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would suggest creating a series of "anime by year" subcategories like other genres do rather than making more unmaintainable lists. i.e. <a href="../../../1/9/5/Category%7E1955_films.html" title="Category:1955 films">Category:1955_films</a>; <a href="../../../1/9/8/Category%7E1981_musicals.html" title="Category:1981 musicals">Category:1981 musicals</a>These lists are never up to date and they're much more easily maintained by the category system. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 18:11, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: I use this page on a daily basis or higher.

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Decade/chronologically would be my recommendation. As for it being "unmanagable," that's because the article just throws everything together, in an alphabetical list. In other words, it's just a category. Separate it by decades, and I, for one, would work on the '60s, and I'm sure others would work on other decades that they are interested in. As I've said before though, the article currently is redundant to the categories. But a list can be made into a more informative article than a category can be. Put them in order by when they were made, add info after the title like studio, creator, etc., add an intro paragraph describing activity/trends for the decade... and we would have something of value. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 20:24, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The lists are not simple category duplications, they provide Japanese titles and (in the manga list) information on if they have been licensed in English or not. Not to mention that they are much easier to navigate than a category. I will agree that specific manga/anime lists such as those that narrow down to genres should be turned into cats, but the main lists are very useful and should be kept. --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 02:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Are the redlinked titles notable? Are they spinoffs that are better served under the initial article? Are they listed on the Japan-related request page? We really don't need an article for every single anime or manga title ever made. We don't need a stub for every anime or manga ever made. As Jimbo said in this week's Wikipedia Times, we need to focus on quality of article and not quantity. I think we should pick an anime or manga seires and improve it to <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excel_Saga_079b.html" title="Excel Saga">Excel Saga</a> (featured) or <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetes.html" title="Planetes">Planetes</a> (good) standards rather than focusing efforts difficult to maintain lists. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 17:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are the redlinked titles notable? Some of them, yes. The English Wikipedia is greatly lacking in animanga articles, even compared to the French wiki.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The article in it's current form should be deleted, but the idea of a list article might not be bad.

<li>I've voted above, so I don't want to give an appearance of trying to vote twice, but I do want to address several of the comments made. Most of the negative votes seem to be either "I don't like it/or find it useful so no one else needs it." or "the page is redundant with various category listings". The first one is pretty subjective, don't you think? Just because Johnny Mecha the mecha expert, doesn't find anything new in this list, doesn't mean that Suzy Newbie, who has just discovered anime, won't. I consider myself pretty well-read about anime, and I've found new stuff here (usually either new shows or alternative names for older shows, but that's beside the point I'm making). As to the Catagory complaint, first of all, while there are certainly trends in anime, one of its appeals is that many shows don't really fit in well into 3 or 4 simplistic pigeonholes. And also, it assumes knowledge of what category the show you're looking for fits in. For instance, someone looking for Sazae-san: they have heard of it, but know NOTHING more than the name (that's why they're searching for more information). They're not even certain of the spelling. With this list, all they need to do is look in the "S" section, and they find the link. It's easy and helps newbies learn more about the subject. I certainly see the point that the size may be a problem, but there are certainly longer listings on Wikipedia (I've just looked up 'Volcanoes" and 'Fish') and I can find nothing about maximum sizes of such listings. Certainly, if this list gets too big for one page, go ahead and break it up into 2 or 3 (or more) pages by letter. I do like the idea above of a chronological listing, probably by decade. BTW, if anyone is really serious in trimming articles which have grown too large, I would suggest looking at the entries for many popular movies, TV shows or novels, which seem to attempt to include every unnecessary minor plot detail, sometimes two or three times. <a href="../../../c/f/l/User%7ECFLeon_0a91.html" title="User:CFLeon">CFLeon</a> 08:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not about it being so long, but being hard to maintain. It is much easier to maintain a category than a list. Also, you said "<i>With this list, all they need to do is look in the "S" section, and they find the link.</i>", they'd be able to do this via category too.. I've converted a few list articles into categories in the past, and the appearance of the category page vs the article were almost exactly alike. The only difference is you can't put in some form of note or something next to a category entry, but considering how much better maintained a category is likely to be vs a list, I think it's a fair trade off. And as Nihonjoe pointed out to me above, you can use redirects for alternative titles, since you can categorize a redirect. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 08:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I voted above to delete, and I stand by that vote, since the article as it stands is nothing more than a category. (It needs to be pointed out however, that there is actually no large "anime" category listing every anime article in alphabetical order, but a bewildering page full of subcategories which link to sub-subcategories. If the article is deleted, shouldn't there actually be a plain and simple "Anime" category put in place which actually <i>does</i> make this list redundant?) But I agree with your points, CFLeon, and think that it would be worthwhile to create new decade articles listing the anime in chronological order with some info after (for example, see entries I added in the the 'Y' section yesterday, with Japanese, # of episodes, and dates of original airing). <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 20:23, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not because the subject isn't notable or important; it's just too huge to ever be even close to completion. A good category, a poor article. Ifnord 15:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it's much more doable than you think. The only real area of trouble would be older shows from the 70s and such, but if focus is kept on licensed series then even that isn't a problem. I don't believe that there too terribly many (licensed) shows that are missing an article.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 00:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But why would they be focused only on licensed shows? What about films? What about flash-animation? What about independents? I simply think this list could go on forever and it'll be hell to maintain. Ifnord 01:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have gone ahead and formatted the <b>Numbers &amp; Symbols</b> section and am willing to do the entire list but will wait until the deletion review is over before that. While I would <i>like</i> to add additional information to the list such as dates, I find that having the three titles takes up a lot of space and additional boxes can end up rather cramped, especially on lower resolutions. It would be nice to get consensus on what information would be liked to be included and how to sort it. Personally, I'm for alphabetical, but if it's wished to be done chronologically it's important to know if it should be sorted by decade, year, or strict date of first airing.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 01:22, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
