<li>International news reports - Guardian (UK), New Kerala (India), The Scotsman (obvious...). Borderline notable prior to death for being a musical prodigy it would appear. Not sure I personally agree with the newspaper's view that this is that newsworthy, but I do occasionally have the ability to concede I may be in a minority, and I suspect this is one of those cases.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless evidence of prodigy presented. A 15-year old kid who died last week isn't notable because it makes the local newspaper. Has a CD which was quasi-self-released. I say "quasi", since it was released by his mother, in the same business in which she self-publishes her books (they are listed on Amazon with sales rank around the 2 million mark).

<li>I was unaware of this <s>bogus</s> novel policy that articles are required to pass <i>inclusion</i> criteria.

<li>Just because something fails deletion criteria, doesn't mean it should automatically be kept. Remember that many good articles that may have met deletion criteria have been kept, and are now useful. Why shouldn't it work both ways? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 18:21, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I had to read the above twice to be sure you're actually saying what you're saying. <b>If an article does not meet the criteria for deletion, of course it should be kept.</b> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">m:Wiki is not paper</a> -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:07, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This boils down to how one interprets the policy, and whether one should adhere to the <i>letter</i> or the <i>spirit</i> thereof. One can make a valid point for 'non-notability' being a valid reason for deletion, based on policy and precedent. One can <i>also</i> make a valid point for the opposite. That's what law courts are for, but thankfully Wikipedia isn't one. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:30, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm going with <b>delete</b> here or maybe tranwiki to wikimemorial, as he really doesn't seem notable. I think BM has it right. Yeah, he got a mention in the Post and USA Today, but the entire contents of the Post article was "• OMAHA -- Brandenn E. Bremmer, a musical prodigy who completed high school at age 10, apparently killed himself at 14, authorities said. Brandenn, who had studied piano improvisation at Colorado State University at Fort Collins, Colo., was found dead Tuesday at his home with a gunshot wound to the head, sheriff's officials said." Is everything ever mentioned in one of the nations top 10 newspapers automatically encyclopedic? The Post printed the weather in San Diego today as well, should there be an article on that? They must print millions of sentences a year, and 2 have been devoted to this kid. If you look at that link supplied by verdana above you'll see several other Post articles primarily of regional interest are printed along with this one. Are all such things going to be wikipedia articles? Wouldn't it have been great if wikipedia 500,000th article turned out to be "• FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Three teenagers kidnapped a 15-year-old and ordered his father to drop off a $50 ransom at a Taco Bell, authorities said. The father called police instead, and the teenagers were arrested." -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:16, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, some people beecome notable in death. This isn't one of them. This kid died, and a whole bunch of newspapers had a slow news day and ran a couple of paragraphs (dead tree, not online).

<li>Sorry to sound callous but this particular person was just another suicide. He did not become notable in death. Yes, he got some media coverage on a slow news day. Coverage in the media is an excellent indicator that the article should exist in WikiNews (now that we have that option).

<dd>"Widely reported" is a bit of a stretch. I think a two sentence blurb in a few papers is hardly "wide". Every minor thing mentioned somehow in the news on a single day is encyclopedic material? Pick up any paper on any day and you'll see hundreds of things given this kind of coverage. Are they covered in encyclopedias? Are they recorded for posterity? Shall I write an article on that dog that was reunited with it's family after 2 years that I saw on the news several times yesterday? Or what about that day about 2 years ago when CNN gave substantial live coverage about a small airplane that was making an emergency landing without a front landing gear? I remember it, so it must be notable, I guess. And your comment "This made the news... do you not watch the news or read newspapers?" strikes me as a bit condescending. This was not the Space Shuttle expolding, this was 2 sentences buried in the Washington Post that I'm sure 99.99999% of the world's population took no note of. Yes, many of us watch the news and read newspapers, but believe it or not we still somehow missed this breaking story. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 05:56, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It wasn't condescending, it was in response to someone who seemed to be under the impression this was some kind of family-written vanity page, even though it had already been pointed out that this did genuinely make the news (and not just the local papers, but internationally). By the way, The New York Times gave it 22 paragraphs (some of only one sentence, of course), and Google News counts at least 231 newspapers internationally that ran the wire story or wrote their own <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Brandenn+Bremmer&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Brandenn+Bremmer&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in the UK, India, etc. This is not a vanity page, nor a memorial, nor a music-related article to be judged on musician notability criteria, nor a topic of purely local interest, nor a "man bites dog" trivia filler story. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wiki is not paper</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 07:57, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, if it's widely reported in the international media, it's notable? OK, I'll go create Weather in London, 21 March 2005, since that's widely reported in the international media. It'll be in every national paper in most of the world's major economies, as well as on BBC News, CNN, Fox News (if you consider that to be news), etc, so it <i>must</i> be notable. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 03:14, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Earlier you said something to the effect of "sometimes articles that I think ought to be deleted get kept, so let's even things out by deleting some articles even if they don't meet deletion criteria". Were you serious? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:27, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I was serious in my comment, but I must have missed the part in my argument where I said what you're implying I said. My argument is that just because something doesn't meet the <i>explicitly-listed</i> deletion criteria, doesn't mean it should be automatically kept - remember that someone in the know can write a full-length article on things which shouldn't be here (note that the list on <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> is not exhaustive). It should be noted that this article <i>does</i> meet deletion criteria, specifically "No potential to become encyclopedic" and "<a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Vanity page</a>" (read it again - it very blatantly is one, compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandenn_Bremmer&amp;oldid=11282617" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandenn_Bremmer&amp;oldid=11282617" rel="nofollow">this</a> to the example given). It's also worth noting that your argument re: the music guidelines is also flawed. "I mean, that <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bono.html" title="Bono">Bono</a> guy is a nobody, he's never in the news - the fact that he's the lead singer of the <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">biggest rock band in the world</a> should be neither here nor there." One of the major points made in the article is that he was a musical prodigy, thus it should be also judged under the music notability guidelines. You're also flawed in your idea of how many news companies "ran" this story. Just because it appears on their Web site, doesn't mean it was printed in the paper. In fact, most of those on Google News probably didn't give the story column inches in their dead-tree editions, or actual coverage on TV. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 16:29, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>A <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">vanity page</a> is a page about a topic or person known to only a small group of people in a local area, usually written for the purpose of boosting the fame or recognition of that person or topic, and usually written by someone directly involved with or acquainted with the topic or person.
<dl>
<dd>Right, which is exactly what I think this article is - attempting to boost recognition for someone hasn't otherwise garnered it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A topic that made the news internationally is, virtually by definition, not a vanity topic.
<dl>
<dd>404 <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">Logic</a> not found.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Your original post mischaracterized this as something that "[made] the local newspaper", and although you have repeatedly been informed otherwise and provided references, you now treat us to your unfounded speculation about how this story "probably" wasn't actually printed anywhere... I can personally attest that it did appear both in print and on television news in a non-local area.
<dl>
<dd>So it was a slow news day. Ultimately, newspapers have a given number of pages to fill, and TV has the same problem - if there's not enough <i>real</i> news to fill the paper, then they have to turn to things like this. See it?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>One of the things people use encyclopediasfor is to look up background information about news stories they recall, and since <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> this meets a minimum threshold for being encyclopedic. And once again, the music guidelines you cite are completely and absolutely irrelevant... by your criteria <small>Warning! <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a> alert!</small> <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> should be deleted because he wasn't a notable artist.
<dl>
<dd>No, Hitler should be kept as a notable world leader, since that's the one thing he's best known for. According to both the article, and the Google results for his name, the one thing this guy was most associated with <i>before his death</i> was as a musical prodigy. As such, judging under the music guidelines is the Right Thing. Again, you seem to be caught up in this notion that everything that makes the news belongs in Wikipedia. Excuse me for noticing that the guy that egged <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> (and that made the news big time) doesn't have an article, and neither does whoever it was that harassed <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> outside that hopsital 4 years ago (we had to put up with that for a whole week). Now, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Keeler_7ff3.html" title="Christine Keeler">Christine Keeler</a> has an article. She made the news, but her incident was a national scandal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I readily agree that if someone had added this kid's bio one day before his suicide, it would have been deleted as a vanity page of a non-notable musician. But the international news story of his death, which received considerably more coverage than you were aware of or willing to admit, became a sufficiently minimally notable internationally news story (deservedly or not) that a background article on this news story meets the minimum threshold for being encyclopedic in a non-paper encyclopedia without size limitations.
<dl>
<dd>How about you shut up with the pointless conjecture and actually come up with a <b>convincing</b> argument for keeping this? The fact that it's made the news <b>does not</b> change the fact that the whole of this story is "There's this kid, really good at music, studying at college at 14, and he kills himself." That is not the makings of someone who deserves an encyclopaedia article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I personally don't really care all that much about this kid or his sad life and death, but I dislike seeing mischaracterizations of this topic and misapplication of irrelevant criteria. It's not your vote to delete, but rather the basis on which you seem to be making it, which is troubling. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 22:24, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Sort of an interesting dilemma. People who commit suicide are not inherently notable, but child geniuses who commit suicide so that their organs might go to save others probably are... and indeed, the news reports suggest that his organs went to several needy people. But I have to wonder if the story is all there - maybe his death was triggered not by altruism, but merely by the enormous pressures to which prodigies are subjected; maybe his mother's belief that his suicide was prompted by such a selfless motive is her own projection onto him of her values. Either way, very sad, but the prodigy-suicide combined with the <i>possibility</i> of a notably unusual motive tips the balance for me. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="#FF5500">gab</font></sup></a> 11:39, 2005 Mar 24 (UTC)

<p>I have resuscitated this VfD because an article on the same subject has been provided afresh. (On 3 May, originally telling us that <i>there was a side of him that hit the highest spectrums of natural intelligence.</i>) As you'll see, although the VfD process at first may appear to have resulted in a decision to delete, what actually happened was that after some rather lively debate the article was found to be a copyvio, listed as a copyvio, not revised, and deleted as a copyvio. There was no decision about the WP-worthiness of Brandenn Bremmer.</p>
<p>Bremmer still strikes me as a more than averagely interesting teen who had a more than averagely interesting suicide. Good fodder for the "human interest" sections of "news" sources on a slow day, but very minor and ephemeral news. He was no Mozart and his suicide was, sadly, not particularly remarkable.

<p>At 00:44, 2005 May 7, <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> deleted the entire content of the VfD project page, in conjunction with his or her creation of a new page about Brandenn Bremmer. Putting aside the question of the legitimacy of deleting a VfD page, I see much of the discussion above as <i>not</i> specific to this or that previous article about Bremmer, but rather about the noteworthiness of Bremmer. This made the resuscitation of the content of this page particularly important, but I'd have resuscitated it anyway, as VfD pages are "preserved as an [sic] historic record" -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:10, 2005 May 7 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any concerns about deleting an article with no explaination? I have never seen the original article. There seemed to some kind of voting taking place about an article that didn't exist - very odd. I think it may be very confusing to leave the debris of an aborted discussion about an article that has already been deleted here, especially when <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">User:Hoary</a> has tagged a new article of the same title as VfD. The casual reader may be misled. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 04:25, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have already raised this point, and I have already answered it, in the talk page. Interested readers can see that. Please do not remove the VfD notice from the article a second time; removing a VfD notice (however misguided you happen to think it may be) constitutes vandalism. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:45, 2005 May 7 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I gave a cogent reason for the removal, so it is improper to label it "vandalism". Your VfD was entered on May 7, yet it points to a May 5 discussion about an article that was deleted. You need to create a new VfD entry dated May 7. My removal of the VfD notice was entirely proper. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 04:53, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And articles that are deleted stay deleted unless there's a compelling reason otherwise. The consensus is respected - if we held a new VfD every time someone recreated a deleted page, we'd gridlock Wikipedia in 10 seconds flat. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:15, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If articles were deleted based on their subject and not due to transitory problems, then there would be no need to recreate deleted pages. But the vfd process is horribly broken, and thus recreations are sometimes necessary. If you want to stop recreations, then stop the deletion of articles based on transitory problems. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 13:17, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
