<li><b>Strong keep</b> Inclusion on the page means a game must meet specific criteria, and everything must be verifiable. In addition, as noted by STD above, many of these lists have been up for AfD and all have been kept (and I've voted keep on all of them).

<dd>The POV comes in the editors' decision to arrange them in a list in the first place. Surely you wouldn't allow a List of reasons the Jews have been considered evil, filled with anti-semitic hate-speech quotes, with sources? Just because a list is sourced doesn't mean there's no POV being pushed. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:38, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that you are correct in assuming that hate speach would not be allowed in article however, there is nothing in this article that even apporaches hate speach. I don't see any connection and I find it to be a bad comparison. --Edgelord 17:13, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um, no one said or even implied there was hate speech in this article - you're completely missing the point of the comparison, which is that just because some people say certain things, and just because we can cite them as sources and arrange them in a list, doesn't mean it isn't POV to do so. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:44, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Articles that take sourced quotes and arrange them in a list to meet to a predetermined conclusion (in this case, "great") is still POV. Since the anti-semitic example seems too confusing, instead ask yourself if you would also support List of movie stars that have been considered really sexy or List of instances in which Woody Allen has been considered to be the worst director ever. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:44, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I read the AFD in question and there are many comments that state that the article was not cited and that many of the selections were the personal choices of the editors. A quick reading of the AFD will demonstrate that being the case. This is not the case for this article and is a key difference between the two articles. This argument also goes against the peremise of your original argument because the deleted artice was not well sourced as the proposed anti-semetic article was said to be. This does not support you position because a badly sourced artilce deleted as POV cannot possibly prove that a well sourced aticle can be deleted for that reason. --Edgelord 19:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I hate wikipedia articles which have the title "x considered the y ever". They are lists of opinions, often one person or a small group. Although they tend to be sourced, second-hand POV is still POV. I submit that any article which consists entirely of entries whose inclusion is based on one person's opinion, or a poll, is inherently unencyclopaedic. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:black; background-color:lightblue; font-weight:bold">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 12:03, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Agreed. The fact that <i>people like things</i> doesn't make lists of them notable for an article, whether it's sourced or not.

<dd><b>comment</b> No, its a someone choosing from lists of games the writers consider important. Having a source does not make an article encyclopaedic. Any subject can have an article to cite, but there's a difference between front page of The Times (for example) and a list of games some people have voted the greatest ever. The problem with this sort of thing is that there are so many of those kind of lists, one is not really an authority. Also, because of the sheer amount of lists of this nature, inclusion in this article does tend to be a matter of opinion. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:black; background-color:lightblue; font-weight:bold">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 09:03, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> for all the reasons given. So long as additions are cited, I can't see a problem with this. <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorinkami_dd0e.html" title="User:Korinkami">Korinkami</a> 22:33, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG rename</b> title has a strong POV slant to it. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 23:43, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What would you call it? The current title doesn't claim the listed games are the best ever, just that soemone has said so. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 23:52, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Greatest ever" is very POV. "Most highly rated computer and video games" would be good. Or "Critically acclaimed computer and video games" would be just as good as it defines who's doing the claiming. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 18:24, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Critically acclaimed does a much better job of setting the standard out there from the start. I like it. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 03:05, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lots of games are critically acclaimed. Only a few have major publications call the the greatest game of all time. The list would be ten times the length and much less maintainable if it were critically acclaimed games. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 03:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But lot of magazines apparently publish "best games ever" lists. As long as the criteria are narrow (as suggested will happen in this AfD) it should be fine. It's very superlative and the title is ultimately untrue. Lists are bound to change and be updated when the best game since sliced cheese comes out. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 15:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, that's why this is a list of best games instead of good games. Unless the criteria were far tighter than the title implied, List of critically acclaimed games would have many hundreds of titles. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 22:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're playing semanics. Of course the criteria would be mentioned in the lead of the article. "Most highly rated computer and video games" does the same thing without getting your whole red-herring about loosening standards. And apparently the critria are pretty loose for the current article. There are many unsourced and poorly sourced entries. Someone needs to do some pruning. Also, wouldn't it be better to put titles together instead of the willy-nilly fashion that they're arranged in? Also Some of they claim to be "#1" or the "best" in issue #whatever of some redlinked magazine with no indication that the top ranking goes into perpetuity. How do we know that Redlink Gamers is not some <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanzine.html" title="Fanzine">Fanzine</a> produced by Martha Snodgrass of Moosejaw, Canada? The notability standards really need to be enforced. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 22:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG Keep</b> title is not POV, since "that have been considered" is not point of view. The arguement for deletion is specious at best, since there are few to no examples of games of "disputed" greatness.24.245.2.230 02:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> everything has a source and saying the game was chosen as the best ever could NOT possibly be considered POV.<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackInBlack_047c.html" title="User:BackInBlack">BackInBlack</a> 12:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Individual articles can link what the basic public thoughts about the game were, but I don't really think we need an article like this. Gaming does not have as much as an influence on the media as other mediums (such as film), so it's not as widespread and we're going to end up getting far too many games to consider.--Mythi 05:32, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Two problems with this argument. First, the article requires verifiable sources so that means that only certain sites can be included. By not using small blogs etc this helps keep the number of games on the list down. I also strongly against the nom manistream agrument for several reasons. First, games have become much more popular over the years and as mentioned earlier a similar article about worst games has passed 3 AFD attempts. This shows to me that people consider video game lists important enough and mainstream enough to be on wikipedia. --Edgelord 19:03, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per earlier reasons. Note that this article isn't POV. POV in Wikipedia *doesn't* mean that an article favors certain views over others. Wikipedia official policy in fact is preference for the majority view over the minority view so long as the minority view receives decent coverage, if the minority is vocal. In other words, what I'm trying to say is, for those of you who complain blah blah blah, go make another page labeled "Computer and video games that have been considered underdogs" or something. I'd contribute to that. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolberg_69b8.html" title="User:Solberg">Solberg</a> 08:40, 7 August 2006 (UTC)Solberg</li>

<dd>No it's not. The first few sentences are facts. Look up the policy if you don't remember. The last bit follows because there should be a "vocal minority" view as stated earlier.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I don't think the article promotes any particular POV, and every inclusion appears to have been from some article or poll or another. I think that it would benefit from some links to online poll results or citing specific magazine issues/articles, though. -- <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubblyhead_0a29.html" title="User:Stubblyhead">stubblyh</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">ea</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">d</a> | <sup><a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStubblyhead_555f.html" title="User talk:Stubblyhead">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_stubblyhead_ad64.html" title="Special:Contributions/stubblyhead">c</a></sub> 16:55, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This article is in parallel with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the greatest ever">List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever</a>, and uses the same criteria: best-selling (cf highest-grossing) and top lists by prominent magazines and other media (cf critically-acclaimed). If there are POV elements, then they absolutely should be cleaned up, but deleting the page is out of the question, unless the films article be deleted as well. --<a href="../../../c/e/v/User%7ECevlakohn_ab8f.html" title="User:Cevlakohn">Cevlakohn</a> 8 August 2006</li>

<dl>
<dd>Also another simliar article that I recently found, Films considered the worst ever have survived 5 attempts at deletion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Films_considered_the_worst_ever" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Films_considered_the_worst_ever" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I think it safe to say if three similar lists have survived this many attempts this one should too. --Edgelord 20:49, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Doesn't seem to have POV problems, information is sourced, and similar lists have survived previous AfD nominations, so precident is in this article's favor. - <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBootstoots_4bb4.html" title="User:Bootstoots">Bootstoots</a> 04:00, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
