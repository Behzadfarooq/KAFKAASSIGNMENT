<li><b>Keep</b> all the contestants currently part of Project Runway 3, even if they have been eliminated. Until the show finishes airing in September it is impossible to guage the impact of their appaerance on the show on their career.

<li><b>Keep:</b> It is not the least bit obvious what the terms "average notability" or "inherently notable" mean, yet they are used by <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> to convey some kind of pseudo-scientific aura of justification. Reality shows done well are comedy / dramas. They are crafted to make us interested in the contestants for 15 or 16 weeks. They are in effect mini-soap operas. As such, winning is beside the point to the "notability" of those involved. Read the blogs on the show as people passionately defend the "good guys" or berate the "bad guys". Indeed, given that the producers do not need to worry about keeping fans interested in the same characters for year after year (as is the case in traditional television fare), they are freer to pump up the story lines and the resulting emotions. One can be a snob about all of this and think that notability should be something more than having hundreds of thousands of people wonder whether or not you are going to be eliminated on a TV reality show. But then you would just be a snob.</li>

<ul>
<li>The claim seems to be that unless you have notability outside of a Reality TV series, you are not entitiled to space in Wikipedia (space being such an increadably precious commodity within Wikipedia. Oh wait it isn't, is it?). By this logic, all Wikipedia pages devoted to fictional characters should be marked for deletion. After all, a fictional character's notability is almost by defintion a construct of the fiction in which he or she occurs. For example, Col. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has a very nice article despite the fact that he is a character on Stargate / SG-1. Presumably, his notabilty is solely a function of the movie and the TV show and all the web references about him will be in the same contexts. Jack O'Neill will never write a book or run for president or do anything else notable, other than be a character of fiction. The contestants on a Reality TV show occupy an interesting niche. There notablity may be nothing more than that given by the show on which they appear. But if being a character on SG-1 is sufficent for notablity for Jack O'Neill, then it strikes me that it is sufficent for Kayne Gillaspie, Keith Michael, Bradley Baumkirchner, and all the rest. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 17:56, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A follow-up to my note above. One might argue that as main character on a series that has run for 10 years, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has acheived some kind of notableness outside the context of the show. If so, one would still be hard pressed to justify the pages of <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._and_Mrs._Stoppable_e7d9.html" title="Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable">Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Mankey_5daf.html" title="Josh Mankey">Josh Mankey</a>. These may not ring any bells for those not plugged into day-time Disney fare. The former are the parents of <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Possible_5e05.html" title="Kim Possible">Kim Possible</a>'s sidekike <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Stoppable_eb80.html" title="Ron Stoppable">Ron Stoppable</a> and the later is Kim's love interest in several episodes. Again, my take is that the characters on Project Runway et.al. are in fact characters in a drama. The standards of notablity for inclusion in Wikipedia should be based on the standards for Television characters. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 18:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It does seem to me that a little bit of an unfair set of criteria in use here. Reality television characters can be notable <i>only</i> for things other than what makes people want to write and read about them? It's a bit like saying that bands are only notable if they have done something notable besides create music. I think the criteria for including reality tv characters should be pretty straightforwardly related to their Ghits and the same criteria that applies to other bios. Ghits for blogs and reviews about a band's latest album or tour aren't discounted immediately are they? Minor reality show characters are rarely mentioned in articles or blogs about the shows and don't have as many Ghits, therefore there's an argument there for not including them. Or a new set of guidelines relating to reality tv should be hammered out. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 21:12, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Bad analogy. It's not at all like saying that bands are only notable if they have done something notable besides create music. The nomination is based on the lack of notability outside PR, not outside their field of expertise. One is not the subset of the other. Not all PR contestants were put up for AfD.<a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess what I'm taking issue with here is the basic assumption that appearing on PR does not make a person notable. What these people are primarily known for is appearing on this show -- why is that rejected out of hand as sufficient notability? Some are more notable than others within that ie. <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santino_Rice_a0c8.html" title="Santino Rice">Santino Rice</a> is a more notable Project Runway contestant than Marla Duran, not because of things he did outside the show, but because he did more things on it, and was mentioned in articles and reviews with greater frequency. Why must their notability be dependent only on factors <b>besides</b> what they're actually famous for? And anyway, non-notability is not a grounds for deletion.<a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 15:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm wondering if it's just that people are surprised, shocked, and even a bit offended, by the idea that a reality show contestant, let alone an aspiring fashion designer, can warrant a Wikipedia article, while skads of other anonymous folks are dismissed as not worthy of such an article because they are "not notable." Look, I'm equally shocked when I see lengthy articles on fictional characters from video games. But apparently these characters are notable in some circles, even though I wouldn't know them if they were sleeping in bed next to me. Maybe we should just accept that Santino Rice, Kayne Gillaspie, Katherine Gerdes et al are as notable to afficianados of reality television or fashion design as (fill in your favorite fictional video game character) are to their followers. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 23:49, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I heard through the grapevine that Santino was offered a spot on "The Surreal Life"</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. This is ridiculous. These people are notable now. We can't just say "Who will care in a few years?" because <i>someone will care</i>. As an active member of the Olympics Wikiproject, I can tell you that we have pages created for Olympians that placed from 1st all the way to 8th place in a single event over 100 years ago. Most of these are not Olympic medalists, but they get a WP page because they were notable <i>at the time</i>, and <i>in their field</i>. One of the things that drew me to WP in the first place was that it had obscure information like this, that I wouldn't be able to find anywhere else. This is the sum of human knowledge, and that includes Reality TV, whether you or I like it or not. As for notability on Reality TV, OhConfucius says that the zoo may be notable, but Monkey A and Monkey B are not. This does not come close to applying here. Imagine if millions of people across America were interested in these two monkeys - they knew Monkey A and Monkey B by name, could tell them apart by looking at them, knew their mannerisms, and went to places like WP to learn more. Then we'd have a comparison. <font color="#08457E"><b><a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomtheman5_0ad4.html" title="User:Tomtheman5">tiZom</a></b></font><sub><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomtheman5_2ea6.html" title="User talk:Tomtheman5"><font color="black">(2¢)</font></a></sub> 15:51, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. I completely understand why, in a year or so, we might want to re-evaluate the relevence of these pages. Probably in 5 years they won't all need their own pages. At the moment, however, the show is a not insignificant part of popular culture, and I have trouble beleiving people (especially casual and rerun veiwers of the show) don't come here all the time looking for more information. None of these individual pages are inappropriately long or detailed, and besides, if we eliminated these we'd just end up trying to cram these details into the season 3 page, which is pretty massive as it is.<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunkyrice_13_9440.html" title="User:Chunkyrice 13">Chunkyrice 13</a> 22:52, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
