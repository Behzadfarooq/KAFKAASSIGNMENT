<p>The result of the debate was <b>rather complicated, really</b>. Citing this discussion (yay!), I have moved the AfDed article to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_American_League_Championship_Series_df8a.html" title="1978 American League Championship Series">1978 American League Championship Series</a>, and changed the resultant redirect into something more appropriate. Note that <i>none of this required AfD</i>. <b>To Hell with "process"</b>. If anyone reckons an article title should be redirected, but doesn't want to blank the content, they're quite capable of performing the move and altering the redirect <i>themselves</i>; the <i>only</i> reason I'm doing it is because some silly sausage brought it to AfD.</p>
<p>Note that the current 1978 ALCS article is lacking a lot of context and could do with a fair amount of cleanup. Whelp, that's some work for you all to do. Your time starts ... now. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 01:29, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article describes the 4 game sweep of the Red Sox by the Yankees in the 1978 World Series. It was prodded but after less than 10 minutes another editor blanked the article and redirected to the historic <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Massacre_3c46.html" title="Boston Massacre">Boston Massacre</a>. I don't know if the baseball content is original research or is worth merging to a better sports article, but completely blanking it seems totally out of process.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It may be worth noting that when contributions made in one article under GFDL are merged into another article, the attribution history of the merged text must be preserved. This is normally achieved simply by maintaining the history of the original page (once it is turned into a redirect). If we turn the redirect page to a <i>third</i> article, I'm fairly certain we'd have to find some way of crediting the contributors properly. In this case, I think the important action is <b>redirect</b> to <b><a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Massacre_3c46.html" title="Boston Massacre">Boston Massacre</a></b>. An editor who additionally wishes to merge text into a suitable article on the 1978 Series may also consider doing the following:
<ol>
<li>merge text appropriately in target article</li>
<li>copy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Boston_Massacre&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Boston_Massacre&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">the history</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boston_Massacre_e14a.html" title="The Boston Massacre">The Boston Massacre</a>, and paste it in the Talk page of the target article, with a note explaining that "text written by these contributors has been merged into this article" or some such. Link to the history page.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It might be a good idea to check for copy vio; large chunks of this article were uploaded in single edits.

<li>You're absolutely right Thatcher, we can do it that way too (note incidentally that the resulting redirect at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boston_Massacre_e14a.html" title="The Boston Massacre">The Boston Massacre</a> actually <i>would</i> maintain something in its history logâa single entry stating that a move was performed. This is fine). The main issue is having the attribution history accessible from the target article, either in its own history logs, the talk page, or from a redirect that points to it. There are 3 or 4 ways to do these things; I remember writing a longish post on this somewhere way back whenâI ought to reread it.&#160;;-) â<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:#002bb8;cursor:crosshair;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 02:20, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</i> NB. Looking at the AFD it appears to me that we're all agreed on the redirect; all that is left to do is determine a suitable target article to merge this text into.

<li>No, not completely useless. Please speak for yourself; I do not speak German myself, yet these sites are useful to me as a Wikipedia user. Babelfish allows one to translate texts from German to English and I have also emailed some of these groups in order to gain more information about this style of music. You're correct that most, if not all, skiffle groups, as performing a music that is not of mass interest in popular culture (i.e., it doesn't sell large numbers of records), might not be "notable" enough to merit their own articles here; this is all the more reason why the genre deserves special treatment in our encyclopedia, as information about the genre is very difficult to find elsewhere. We are building something that will have information on all genres of music, not simply the ones that are most popular at a given time. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 06:23, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This statement is inaccurate. This is a list of all skiffle bands in the world that are known about, supplemented with links. You do not come out and say "delete all the bands" in the redirect; is that what you mean? Why not just say it? I must admit that it is very upsetting that another Wikipedia editor would simply vote to throw away such a large amount of effort that went into collecting these band names and locations; it's not something I would ever do to you or another editor. And are you not aware that there are Wikipedia articles with lists of bands in many other genres? Why is skiffle being singled out for deletion? As mentioned above (which no one has addressed), roots musical styles are often culturally and historically significant, while commercially unsuccessful (meaning most bands will not meet WP notability requirements for their own articles). It does not mean that the content about the bands should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 20:28, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry you went to all the trouble, but collections of external links are not appropriate Wikipedia content.

But a list of external links is not. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the genre. If you think there are other lists of bands that are only external links, please let me know on my Talk page, and I'll nominate those for AfD as well. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:28, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>No, this is inaccurate. It is not a list of links but a list of skiffle groups around the world, which contain links to their websites, to assist users in finding out more about them (as these sites are often not easy to locate). It is very disturbing that you seem to gain gratification from trying to destroy the contributions of another editor. And, even worse, that you simply ignore what I had said above about skiffle being a roots musical form that is not well understood, and deserving of coverage here (in the same way that lists of numerous other musical genres have articles here at Wikipedia). I would not treat another editor here in such a way. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 05:25, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>unmaintainable, potential POV-war flamebait. The truth is, while many of the people on this list could be seen as martyrs, many may disagree with that.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I don't see the logic in this. There are many musicians who are notable simply because they are in a band.

<dd>This is very true. However, I don't think this guy is one of those people. I've heard of Guns 'N Roses, and I've heard of Slash and Axel Rose. I've heard of Hawthorne Hights, but I couldn't name a single member, and I think as of now (aside from the band's hardcore following), that's pretty typical (for reasons enunciated by the voter below, most likely). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 04:10, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Ral has a vendetta against me, so he takes it out on articles I have to do with.

<ul>
<li>No vendetta here. But it's a non-notable article. I could write a similar article about thousands of cities across the world, and I feel that the subject is non-notable, and can't be expanded beyond a basic voter's guide (and, after the election, a news article reporting the results). I find your assumption of bad faith here disturbing. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 05:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What I find disturbing is that you don't write a similiar article about the thousands of elections occuring like this across the world instead of just blithely slapping a tag on it despite the fact that you likely don't care either way. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist"><font color="#4682B4">Karm</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="#00FF00">a</font></a><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmafist_6c43.html" title="User talk:Karmafist"><font color="#E32636">fist</font></a> 05:29, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, I do care. I would have nominated this whether it was you, or an IP. I <b>would not</b> write such articles, because I know they don't fit notability. My city of 75,000 people, and the neighboring city of 200,000 people, don't even have articles on their respective mayors- not because they couldn't be written, but because they're not automatically encyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 06:05, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

From what I have seen, it is the same as many other created games which seem to be on here. Some of which are less known, but have never been brought up on this issue. An example that came to mind was Blade Mistress, a rather simplistic FREE multiplayer game. Considering it is a free game, this entry has grown over time thanks to the players of the game.</li>

<li>No, I disagree. Electronic negotiation (sometimes called automated negotiation) is a very hot research topic at the moment in the Artificial Intelligence, electronic commerce and multi-agent systems research communities. I promise I will personally try to rewrite it. The truth is that I need to delete a lot of the existing text for the result to make any sense at all.

<p>Allow me to respond to this comment: I have edited many more Wikipedia pages, but without having an account (so I was logged by IP). In general, I prefer to edit pages where a lot of specialised info already exists and I can use my expertise to build on that (e.g. the Game Theory site). Electronic negotiation really requires complete clean-up: I simply hesistate undertaking this task (I assure you I have an expertise in scientific paper writing, but anonymous writing is not my thing, usually). I could look at it when I have time, but no promises. Papertiger</p>

<li>Actually the first AFD is moot.

That's actually just one of many criteria, that are allowed, and not the most relevant in this case. The AFD completely ignored the fact the band's music was used by another notable band. There was *no* discussion of what writing about the band existed (it's ok to reject some writing as trivial, but the AFD did not discuss the matter at all). Now, I fully understand the reason for original deletion. The article was horribly incomplete.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Good question. How many of them do we have about which a verifiable article can be written? If there are 10,000 such, let's start to worry when we have 10,001 such articles. But I strongly suspect that bands of this kind of pedigree are much thinner on the ground. In fact, looking at our category "Heavy metal musical groups", we seem to have barely 200, which is laughable. We really shouldn't be deleting articles about those that we have. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:08, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, 200 is very few. And Demilich have done more than release one album; they are currently on an international tour. (not to mention the fact that their one album has been rereleased on two major record labels). Is this enough consensus to keep the page?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: As long as the articles are halfway decent ones (like this one has become), I agree with Tony Sidaway completely. But, perusing the <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com" class="external free" title="http://www.metal-archives.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.metal-archives.com</a> database, I could certainly live without quite a few of those. Like do we need seven articles to cover each of the death metal bands called "Cremation"? Or five articles to cover the "Crematorium"s? Anyway, this isn't the place for this discussion - I just wanted to make it clear that I do have a decent grasp of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and the previous article for this band was definitely nowhere near it. â<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 00:38, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just leave it there. Eventually, an admin will remove it. Also, this AFD doesn't "belong" to one person, so it's not as simple as one person ending it. There's three people who still indicated they want a delete. Anyway, the decision to do an early close is best left to an uninvolved party. The best thing you can do, is add as much relevant sources and information to the article. The only reason this was deleted in the first place, is that it was never completed.

<p><s>* <b>Comment</b></s> <b>Keep</b> There was an opposition group called Unity (Agzybirlik) - banned in January 1990. Members formed the Party for Democratic Development - banned in 1991. This led a coalition called Conference (Gengesh), for democratic reform. So I think there's some scope for an article. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 18:53, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> the title is misleading though - this seems to have been created as an article about political parties rather than as a list. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As Dlyons493 said there <i>were</i> political parties (or groups) and they surely exists in underground. The article should be labeled as stub, incomplete, whatever until someone will add the details.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It does seem laughable to have a list of one thing. But I vote "keep" based on Dlyons493's comment and Pavel Vozenilek's observation. This one party is surely verifiable, the topic is "encyclopedic," and other information can be added. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 05:49, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>This spammer is a failed attempt to be the one millionth article, 1 Mar 2006 Deletesquidoo 15:10, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I remember back in July 2001 this little website with only 3,000 articles. It was struggling along, and it looked like tho project might die out soon. Eventually a user named Larry Sanger wrote an article an tried to get it published on Kuro5hin.org, a popular technology site of the day. Many users thought that this article was spam since Wikipedia had only been around a few months and was clearly using K5's reach to promote itself. Some of us thought it was a cool idea anyway that few people had heard of, and thought it had the potential to become something big. So we let it post to the front page. Then a few days later it got linked to by Slashdot, and suddenly the project was picking up steam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep, its very good entry</p>
<p><br />
Wikipedia has received hundreds of millions of dollars of free "advertising." I've spent more hours promoting Wikipedia than you will ever know. I've been a Wikipedia user since July 2001, when the above K5 article was published, and I created my first article on February 22nd, 2002. I know the rules. I also know what spam is and isn't.</p>
<p>The site is notable. The site has thousands of users, many of whom are experts in their fields. It is a novel solution to the problem of search. The site itself was conceived by a best selling author, and one of its advisors is on the board of ICANN. Currently while the site does generate money from adsense and Amazon referral links, it donates 100% of that money to charity, which it will continue to do throughout the next few months that it is in beta. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex3917_53fc.html" title="User:Alex3917">Alex Krupp</a> 15:47, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It sometimes provides information on topics of interest in one place. Google is a search engine. It sometimes helps people find web pages that exist on the internet. Many topics covered here are covered elsewhere on the internet in much greater depth. Nevertheless, in my opinion, that is not a reason or even a valid argument for deciding what articles are included here. Things are <i>happening</i> all the time. That may be reflected by google, yahoo, jeeves, it certainly does not preclude encyclopedic coverage of a unique wiki by a collaborative community of editors. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:37, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>. This page appears to be a complete fabrication. I live in Toronto and came across this by accident. I'd never heard of it, and decided to see if this was just my ignorance or not. An official map of Toronto neighborhoods can be found on the city's website at <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/torontomaps/pdf/hoods2004.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toronto.ca/torontomaps/pdf/hoods2004.pdf" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Brooklyn is not there. There is another unofficial site with good neighbourhood maps at <a href="http://www.torontoneighbourhoods.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.torontoneighbourhoods.net" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. Not there either. There is a Brooklyn Avenue in Toronto, but that doesn't qualify as a neighborhood, except possibly to people who live on that street. The page was created by an anonymous user and has had no edits since its creation, a long time ago. Pages like this bring Wikipedia into disrepute and should be deleted without delay. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 17:58, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There actually is a Brooklyn not far from Toronto (north of Pickering), but I certainly don't know of one in the Carlton/Sherbourne area as claimed by this article. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 21:03, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable or non-existent. I've never heard of it and I've worked in Toronto (East York, specifically... although there is also a York, North York, York Region, Yorkville, Yorkdale, York Mills and more York-related names than anyone knows what to do with as Toronto itself was once Muddy York, but no Brooklyn AFAIK). The area near Allan Gardens would be Cabbagetown, IIRC. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlb_f511.html" title="User:Carlb">carlb</a> 12:53, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>For the record, as somebody who <i>lives</i> more or less at the corner of Wellesley and Sherbourne, I can personally vouch for the fact that there's nothing called "Brooklyn" in the area. There's a <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Jamestown_f35c.html" title="St. Jamestown">St. Jamestown</a>, a <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabbagetown.html" title="Cabbagetown">Cabbagetown</a>, a <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regent_Park_3686.html" title="Regent Park">Regent Park</a>...and in the fevered minds of real estate agents there's a "Garden District" and a "Winchester Square", but not so they would actually deserve articles of their own. Based on "Originally a controversial area of the city because of problems with drug distribution and prostitution" and "Buildings that were once considered dilapidated are being reimagined and redesigned", I'd hazard a guess that this article is some kind of weird Regent Park parody, but I couldn't swear to that. It's definitely a <b>delete</b>, at any rate. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:28, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The author of the article rejected speedy, so I'm going to go the slow route. IMO, one single baseball leage for middle schoolers run by a single YMCA in Connecticut is entirely unnotable.

<p>First of all, it is not one single league. This happens to be one of the most prestigious leagues in southern connecticut, and it involves thousands of people, so it is a lot more than one single league for middle schoolers. It is one of the towns and counties most prestigious and active leagues. It is notable and should not be marked for deletion. Bobby5689 18:44, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I offer you the Association of British Counties, a pressure group which wants to restore the "historic" counties of Britain such as <s>The Kingdom of Fife</s> Fife. Google finds &lt;1000 hits, of which their website is top and Wikipedia second. Google News finds no hits.

The fact that <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Grant_cc36.html" title="Russell Grant">Russell Grant</a> is president is probably the most notable thing about them. The chances of their campaign succeeding are this: zero. They are a political King Canute. And one which has achieved, to date, no obvious outside notice.

<dd>As regards notability, I have seen their material quoted fairly widely in the regional media (especially in <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddleworth.html" title="Saddleworth">Saddleworth</a>, one of their favourite battlegrounds). The ABC are also mentioned with amazing frequency on the Talk page of any article referring to the counties of the UK - if nothing else, it's worth keeping just so there's a reference for people reading any of these talk pages.</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but <b>Strong cleanup if kept</b>. I don't know much about this sort of low-level British politics, but the article's been around for eighteen months now, and while it only has a few hundred Google hits, they seem to come from a relatively diverse and meaningful set of sites (links from the BBC, etc.), so I'm going to be generous and guess they're probably a bit more notable than the web gives them credit for.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. I agree with nominator's assessment of this organisation and yes <s>they have a snowball's chance in hell</s> there's effectively zero chance of this organisation's agenda being fulfilled. However, I do not think these points are either necessary or sufficient reasons to delete. The organisation has managed to get mentions on academics' web pages, <a href="http://www.sosig.ac.uk/roads/cgi-bin/tempbyhand.pl?query=1042027012-19376&amp;database=sosigv3" class="external text" title="http://www.sosig.ac.uk/roads/cgi-bin/tempbyhand.pl?query=1042027012-19376&amp;database=sosigv3" rel="nofollow">here for example</a>, was referred to in <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/debtext/41020-04.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/debtext/41020-04.htm" rel="nofollow">Hansard</a>, and on the letters page of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/12/26/dt2601.xml" class="external text" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/12/26/dt2601.xml" rel="nofollow">The Telegraph</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 00:23, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>... By poking around at the Hansard link I give above I see that they are perhaps more effective than I first thought. The 1994 debate in which the AofBC was mentioned was on a bill, given a first reading in the Commons, that would have put many of this group's ideas into law.... Presumably the bill got spiked later. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 00:32, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I checked out the references. They are: an <b>add-it-yourself directory</b>, a <b>letter in the Telegraph</b>, and <b>a namecheck by one MP</b>. There is no dispute that a small movement exists to promote the "historic" counties, but there are other more significant organisations doing this as well. I still cannot find a single reliable secondary source from which to verify the data in this article, and the number of genuinely significant organisations whose website is only available before midnight GMT is vanishingly small. We do not know the membership, we do know that they score zero on Google News and under a thousand Googles. Where is the evidence that this group is of any importance? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:19, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your point regarding the lack of reliable secondary sources is important, I think. There is no reason to believe that the bill I uncovered is anything to do with the organisation, it is coincidence until proven otherwise. I've just spent (far too long) trawling through Google hits to try and find a confirmatory, reliable secondary reference for the information in the article. I can't find a single one. So, <b>delete</b> for the reason that the article lacks <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> (specifically <i>not</i> because of its success or lack of it). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 19:17, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hmm. I'm not convinced we violate <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> either. I quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Self-published sources and other published sources of dubious reliability may be used as sources in articles about themselves. For example, the Stormfront website may be used as a source about itself in an article about Stormfront, so long as the information is notable, not unduly self-aggrandizing, and not contradicted by other published sources.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and from [WP:Reliable Sources]:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Partisan political and religious sources should be treated with caution, although political bias is not in itself a reason not to use a source</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Groups like these may be used as primary sources only i.e. as sources about themselves, and even then with caution and sparingly, <b>or about their viewpoints</b>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In this article, the only facts we are trying to establish are what this group believes. <b>Whether what they believe is "true" or not is another matter entirely</b> - but their website <i>is</i> a perfect source for details of what they claim to believe in. As long as the information is qualified as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, it's a verifiable source anyone else can check. If instead we are worried that they do not really believe what they claim to believe, <a href="http://www.lgbc-wales.gov.uk/preserved/preserved_final_proposals_a3_e.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lgbc-wales.gov.uk/preserved/preserved_final_proposals_a3_e.htm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> is a good example of the ABC actually "in action"; an offically submitted and published (ie <i>verifiable</i>) document showing how they apply their beliefs to a practical situation.</p>
<p>The job of any wikipedian who contributes to political and historical articles is to produce NPOV articles from POV sources. This <i>can</i> be done; indeed it is the goal of every successful historian.</p>
<p>Further, an article on a lobbying group <i>without</i> a long of Hansard links tells of a group and its lack of success. No article at all would inform nobody of anything. A membership figure would indeed be fantastic to put the "scale"(!) of their activities into context, but its omission is neither sufficient nor necessary for deletion.</p>
<p>I'd also like us to bear in mind that research is not confined to the world wide web, and sources are not confined to Google. If Wikipedia ends up a mere subset of that information which is Googlable, then it will never achieve full potential as a tool of scholarship, and it has acknowledged as much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Finding_a_good_source_may_require_some_effort" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Finding_a_good_source_may_require_some_effort" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></p>
<p>This is all quite subtle, and mostly very <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">meta</a>. I can't believe how much of my life is going into defending a tinpot organisation with whom I do not agree whatsoever, but the principle, for me, remains. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina">Aquilina</a> 21:22, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Comparing ABC with County Watch is laughable. County Watch is a relatively new collection of five or so individuals who hit the headlines by using direct action, whereas the ABC have been around for much longer and are involved in lower-profile government lobbying. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 12:26, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

The entire content of the navy article, including the info about the army patrol boats could go into that article just as happily as part of the explanation of why the Swiss have no Navy-- one of the cited links about the Swiss flag seems to indicate that there was an issue in maritime law at one time whether a landlocked country could fly its flag on merchant vessels. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:00, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was close, with 8 delete and 4 to keep or merge (some doubts here about whether to count Alpha269, a glance over his contributions list shows his account to be created March 6, and edits are exclusively to AFD voting, but I'll count it). Kappa presented some arguments for notability of this particular game, based on the fairly high number of Google hits so I won't delete it here. The suggested merge target is something along the lines of list of flash games. At the moment we don't have such a list, so I will call this a no consensus <b>keep</b> for now, and slap on a merge tag. The article may be renominated if such a list is not forthcoming. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As <a href="../../../b/z/2/User%7EBz2_c22b.html" title="User:Bz2">Bz2</a> pointed out, there are innumerable Flash games. What we need to ascertain is the notability.

<dd>This would be why I suggested an article on the archtype, which is a widespread one, though I'm uncertain of what would be a good name.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. First, this is a renomination from less than 3 months ago, nothing has changed except perhaps even more notable has been achieved by the subject being in the New York Times and other newspapers. Lexis-Nexis showed he's been quoted also in the LA Times and he shows up in dozens of articles. The opinions above that we should make exceptions to what normally constitute notablity notwithstanding, it's clear he is notable. The irony of citing that his blog is ranking at or near the top 100 of 23 some odd million blogs is thick. Second, this was created by an anon and is clearly a bad faith nomination as noted above by someone who was barely familiar enough with the process to even start it correctly. This article stood on its own two feet a few months ago, nothing has changed. -- 130.126.139.14 18:17, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> His most notable merits for inclusion are his work in information security. To put his accomplishments in perspective, an average PhD graduate in computer science may write dozens of papers for peer-reviewed conferences and journals over their lifetime and have hundreds of references to their work from other scholarly works (a measure of impact). John's publications do not appear to be peer-reviewed, do not appear to be scholarly in nature, and do not appear to have a high level of impact. So his accomplishments are less than that of the average PhD graduate and unless half the PhD graduates should have entries, I don't see why John should have one. 67.171.73.202 06:57, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

The 3 users I marked are so clearly made up, that I somewhat think those votes are here for the opposite affect ... to make "Keep" votes look dubious. I don't have any reason to say you are running this article. The afd was inappropriately listed by an anon (from Champaign... surprise!!!), and many of the pro/against votes are motivated by personal agenda rather than the merit of the article/subject. Afd's should be taken objectively rather than personal issues.

<li><b>Comment</b> You are welcome to refute my argument. The reality is that John Bambenek is not a famous person (like Ludacris, Roger Ebert, etc) nor does he have the accomplishments of an olympic medalist (Bonnie Blair) to warrant being listed along with those famous people in the Champaign-Urbana Metro entry. He is not famous in Champaign-Urbana nor nationally. The fact that he has a couple fans running around adding his names to lists he isn't qualified for is pathetic. Again, I challenge you to refute my argument. What is his major contribution? What peer-reviewed conferences and journals contain this contribution? How does this contribution make him any more notable than the hundreds of other PhDs from UIUC with vastly superior vitaes full of peer-reviewed publications? 67.171.73.202 17:51, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your argument needs no refutation because you are an anon attacker. However, plenty of people who aren't olympic medalists have bios. It's clear from your comments you have an axe to grind. The original anon poster was upset at a column he wrote last week, even Adrian recognized this is an attack afd. If he has enough visibility that whenever he writes a controversial column people try to delete his bio, it's clear he has more influence than people are giving him credit for. -- 130.126.147.87 21:12, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It should be noted that John has linked directly to this page from his blog <a href="http://jcb.pentex-net.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://jcb.pentex-net.com/" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> and that the vote may consequentially be biased by participation from his readership. If you look at timestamps, it appears most of the "keeps" come within a few hours after his blog post.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. This is the most acrominous AfD I've seen in a long time. It includes <b>sysops</b> deleting user comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FJohn_Bambenek_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=42493570&amp;oldid=42492596" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FJohn_Bambenek_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=42493570&amp;oldid=42492596" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>. It demonstrates a complete lack of following the process. There is a crtieria for Second Nominations, this doesn't meet it. This was started by an anon unfamiliar with wikipedia because they didn't even add the AfD right, this never made the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> process, and no discussion or debate was attempted before dumping this 2nd nom in. After seeing this level of sockpuppetry, I decided to take a look in depth on this one. There seems to be two criteria of notability that is claimed here. First is as an information security professional, second is as a blogger/columnist.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In general, this user has over <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=john+bambenek&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=john+bambenek&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> 277 unique Google mentions, almost a hundred more than the last time and more than most articles that do get to stay. He is mentioned in dozens of news articles which is amazingly dismissed out of hand. Since when does being in a front page article in the New York Times not mean anything? In many cases, that is ipso facto proof of notability and that ends the discussion. Why are the criteria being thrown out just to vote delete?</dd>
<dd>In information security, his material that he has authored does certainly seem to meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria of 5,000 or more readers. Some mention that he doesn't have much in peer review journals, but any research that is notable enough for the New York Times certainly bypasses that threshold. Not all research in journals makes it into the mainstream media, research that does, especially if it makes the New York Times and international papers, most certainly is notable by any definition of that word. If 5000 people is the criteria, why is a readership in the millions being discarded out of hand?</dd>
<dd>In blogging, his comments have appeared in the LA Times and Seattle Times. Any blogger mentioned in the mainstream media is pretty much considered notable. In fact <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> states that multiple non-trivial media mentions is enough to establish notability. That threshold has been more than crossed here. His blog is ranked #104 in the Truth Laid Bear system out of 51,578 blogs (top .2%) <a href="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/showdetails.php?host-http://www.pentex-net.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/showdetails.php?host-http://www.pentex-net.com" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>. Technorati ranks him at 1008/29.9 Million <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/jcb.pentex-net.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.technorati.com/search/jcb.pentex-net.com" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> (top .003%). He is an apparent right-winger that has enough visibility that he was mentioned and criticized by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href="http://www.dccc.org/stakeholder/archives/001759.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dccc.org/stakeholder/archives/001759.html" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>. His political opponents, the <i>Democratic Party</i>, see him as notable enough to respond to. His paper, an independent and self-financed corporation has a circulation of 20,000 <a href="http://www.illinimedia.com/DI/DI.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.illinimedia.com/DI/DI.html" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>. He is a featured writer on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogcritics.html" title="Blogcritics">Blogcritics</a> and stoptheaclu.com which both have readerships above 50,000 a day. The 5000 person threshold is more than crossed here.</dd>
<dd>It seems that some of the votes here are not considerations of the content but those who want to vote no for the sake of voting no. This process has been horribly abused in this case and will likely, instead of reach any consensus, land this in Deletion Review. The criteria for notability has been more than crossed by any objective standard. This AfD shouldn't even be considered because it is a sham 2nd nom, independent of that, the 1st AfD came to the right conclusion. The criteria and process exists to prevent circuses like this from taking place that shamefully include sysops deleting supporting comments. That process and the criteria should be followed. This article should stay. -- 130.126.139.14 00:18, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>yes i can see how u can think that, but the show and station was first created for tweens and teens. The network then decided to make the show into more the porn direction and the station as well. At this still the other shows havent been produced (that is why they changed the station) MCcoupe7</p>

<li>It's my understanding that new television networks tend to get their name out to the public by sending out press releases and getting coverage in major industry publications. In fact, we just saw that happen in the last two weeks with <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Network_TV_a0f6.html" title="My Network TV">My Network TV</a>.

<li><b>KEEP</b> This artical does not claim to tell the futer but merly gives needed anaylise on these very intresting subjets. As about it not being a current election, the 2008 Presidential Election artical was established without dispute substantialy before the 2004 Election. Anyway, there are many websites anaylising the particulars of these elections. I am tired of bullies trying to cut off articals that are considerd "silly" or "unimportant" before they are even given a chance. Evreything is factual and just because this is lower priority doesn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to contribute. It may not help as much as some other artical but it difenitly helps. Finally, I envision a Wikipedia that has exelant articals on every imanginable even slightly important subjects. Anyway, this is a VERY important subject and an EXTREAMLY intresting one.

<p>Try reading the talk page. Just because I happen to be the record holder doesn't mean it's all vanity and lies. In fact, try reading something properly before plastering 'baleet' over it. Not self promotion, the fact I am the record holder is merely that - a fact. Notability is ambiguous as a cause for deletion. Forum posts as sources: Locations of existing threads of the competition, and the current record post location? What's the problem there? 'Random' articles as sources: Try reading the article. I quote: 'Information and sources for the possible effects of partaking in this competition can be found on related articles'. Sleep deprivation being what the competition is about, for one. Sleep deprivation, insomnia, sleep debt for source on background info on effects of partaking. Precisely as I say. So there, arguments countered. I await your retort.

<dd><b>Response</b> Almost all those links are mechanically generated adspam, and most of them are just mirrors of a very small number of "original" pages. If you were to work your way through them, you'd find about a half dozen real pages, 50,000+ framed mirrors of those pages, and a few thousand "free porn" indexes. It's just "affiliate marketing", with pages designed to show up in google searches. The original porn site could put pictures of a complete unknown up on its site, and within 12 hours, probably less, there'd be tens of thousands of Google hits. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 00:53, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just another one of the mixed breed. From the first set of RfD -</p>
<p><i>There are 500 breeds of dogs. Any of them can be mixed and anyone can name the mixes anything they want. (E.g., see American hybrid "registry" and Poodle hybrid and Dog hybrids and crossbreeds#Casual crossbreeds.) I realize that WP is not paper, but mostly what can be said about mixed-breed dogs is that they might have some characteristics of either parent, or not (if you also look at Maltipoo and Schnoodle you'll see what I mean). We've discussed this within the dog breed project before and feel that all these do is create multiple mixed-breed-dog articles. We're leaving in Cockapoo because it's been around long enough to be the only mixed-breed name to make it into the dictionary, and Labradoodles are so common as to be found in just about every puppies-for-sale list everywhere, with Goldendoodles getting pretty close, but I'm hesitant to open the floodgates for articles about everyone's mixed-breed dog with an invented name</i></p>
<p>This one doesn't even have all that many finds on Google--although it's clear that it's a fairly well-used name for a border collie/jack russel dog, particularly in <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flyball.html" title="Flyball">flyball</a>.</p>

Might be just another one of the mixed breed. From the first set of RfD -</p>
<p><i>There are 500 breeds of dogs. Any of them can be mixed and anyone can name the mixes anything they want. (E.g., see American hybrid "registry" and Poodle hybrid and Dog hybrids and crossbreeds#Casual crossbreeds.) I realize that WP is not paper, but mostly what can be said about mixed-breed dogs is that they might have some characteristics of either parent, or not (if you also look at Maltipoo and Schnoodle you'll see what I mean). We've discussed this within the dog breed project before and feel that all these do is create multiple mixed-breed-dog articles. We're leaving in Cockapoo because it's been around long enough to be the only mixed-breed name to make it into the dictionary, and Labradoodles are so common as to be found in just about every puppies-for-sale list everywhere, with Goldendoodles getting pretty close, but I'm hesitant to open the floodgates for articles about everyone's mixed-breed dog with an invented name</i> (written by <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a>)</p>
<p>I am having more concerns over time as some of these articles keep reappearing (I believe that this one was deleted as a stub a couple of times as a bogus name), as you can see there's a lot of info in this article. I added some of it. It seems to me that we might be better off leaving some of the more common ones, which this seems to be, with all the warnings inherent that you don't really know what you're going to get. The other issue is that it's going to keep reappearing (as I said, I believe it was deleted a couple of times and turned into a redirect to <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_hybrids_and_crossbreeds.html" title="Dog hybrids and crossbreeds">dog hybrids and crossbreeds</a>, but it just kept getting recreated as an article.)</p>
<p>So if this seems inside out, I'm listing it because we've been trying to keep these invented combined-breed-name mixed breed dogs out, and I think this will come up for deletion eventually if I don't nom it, but in fact the names ARE being used and the dogs ARE being sold and people WILL come looking for the name. -<a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 00:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a trend, should we compile all trends as they happen? It's a waste to have it's own article, why not merge information on crossbreeds into the parent breed article? Besides, this article isn't really that informative other than describing it could be -like a beagle, maybe, but like a pug if it's like that or inherient of a beagle-. No real information is here, or concrete for that matter as it flip flops on traits of the parent breeds. Until an article can be written that's more than a mishmash of personal experiance (POV BTW) with the animal there's no point in having it.--Skeev 21:19, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
