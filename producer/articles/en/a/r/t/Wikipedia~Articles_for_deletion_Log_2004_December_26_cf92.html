<p>I've been collecting comics for 10 years, and haven't been able to find a single amount of evidence that this comic strip ever existed. I've checked hundreds of issues of The Beano from not only the time period this article was made (mid-2003) but from everywhere, and nothing. I've scoured the internet, and nothing, save for some forks and mirrors. I've checked annuals, nothing, summer specials, nothing...notice that the original (IP address) author has repeatedly tried to blank his/her article since he/she wrote it, which further confirms that this is just a load o' made up codswallop. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillyH_002d.html" title="User:BillyH">Billy</a><a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillyH_e850.html" title="User talk:BillyH">H</a> 01:45, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"A leader in his community, Herman H. Neuberger has saved the lives of many through his work and quiet diplomacy. Valued for his keen wisdom and integrity, many seek out his advice. He is the President of Ner Israel Rabbinical College in Baltimore, Maryland."</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the president of a Rabbinical College qualifies for an encyclopedia, but more importantly if you want to claim he saved the lives of many you need to say how and provide a cite.</p>
<p>Also, who values him for his keen wisdom and integrity? Either delete everything except his position or delete the whole thing. Mike Friedman 22:17, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

Proposed album with unverified track listing. 172.161.56.164 05:29, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Weak keep. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mars_Volta_5300.html" title="The Mars Volta">The Mars Volta</a> have performed at the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Day_Out_04f8.html" title="Big Day Out">Big Day Out</a> and toured supporting the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Hot_Chilli_Peppers_042d.html" title="Red Hot Chilli Peppers">Red Hot Chilli Peppers</a>, so they are a major second-tier band at least. I'd guess this material is as accurate as most of our stuff!

<li>Keep. The album has been confirmed by the artist, the track listing has apparently been verified, and considering the release of cover art by <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storm_Thorgerson_e477.html" title="Storm Thorgerson">Storm Thorgerson</a>, it's quite definitely a real album.

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is going to be released, and by a fairly well known band. Like sub-stubs, I don't think these articles should be created, but I don't think they should be deleted if they are. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 15:02, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Contributor should store the page in his or her user space and then post it when the album is out. There are many slips between cup and lip, and many confirmed albums don't get released (forget "Smile" and remember only "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"). Speculative material is unverifiable. When the album is released, then, well, I still don't think it's <i>good</i> to have an article on it (this isn't "Let It Bleed" we're talking about here), but it would be unobjectionable. I.e. I'm voting delete until the record is real. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:09, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

This animal simply does not exist -- the idea of it was either created or popularized by the film <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i> Perhaps one could rework the article in order to make these facts clear; otherwise, it needs to be deleted.

<hr />
<p>The information is simply incorrect. Where's the wiki tag for that? No potential to become encyclopedic</p>
<p>Subtractive color space</p>
<p>Subtractive color is not a color space, it is a system that describes how pigments and dyes, etc. mix togther. The title is <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtractive_color.html" title="Subtractive color">Subtractive color</a>. I kept trying to redirect it. But I have a foe.</p>
<p>And the article is not correct either. Because Subtractive color is not a color space, the author begins his definition with that assumption.</p>
<p>It can be confusing since RGB can be a color space and CMYK is a color space, but one must not dive first into color spaces, without first explaining the theory--<a href="../../../d/k/r/User%7EDkroll2_e3eb.html" title="User:Dkroll2">Dkroll2</a> 05:37, Dec 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Space or no space, the article is extremely redundant with the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtractive_color.html" title="Subtractive color">subtractive color</a> article.

<li>I think the entries should be merged, and Subtractive Color Space made a redirect. Even though "subtractive" isn't a "color space", that doesn't make the entry redundant because there are "color spaces" that are "subtractive", so the phrase "subtractive color space" has meaning (and is in use). There seems to be some attempt to maintain both entries, which would be just silly. If there are people with good information to add on this topic, they call all do better by focussing on making just one better entry. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 17:13, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC) On reflection, I am saying do not delete; deletion is for subjects that should not be there and have no alternative.

<dd>Nobody ever accused Darwin of "bad research."

<li>Hey guys, chill&#160;:) - the only reason I made the page was because I saw a red link on Goldsmith's page and I knew who she was. I added a little more, but deleting the page and removing the link on Goldsmith's page, while noting (on his page) that she composed the lyrics and sang in the song for his only Oscar-winning score may be an idea.

<p>Why is this being considered for deletion? Have I placed it in the wrong category? 84.202.32.248 15:11, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the article seems to fail the test of being "encyclopedic", the subject is not notable enough for an encyclopedia. In this case, it is basically trivia related to a fictional universe. Also, it is basically not expandable. The article can't ever really be more than one sentence. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:44, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>keep</b> if the merge queue is too long. Merging makes some sense because it's not interesting outside of the star wars universe. There is no reason to <i>delete</i> detail like this because <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 15:51, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I´m pretty sure I marked it as a SW item and put it in the proper category... VT-16 15:57, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete: Would be better in the machines or guns or critters of SW article. As a separate article, it is essentially lost information and/or a claiming of a letter combination that might be in use by a real world item that needs an entry. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:17, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The information can be found easily from the category or well-sectioned List of vehicles in Star Wars under imperial -&gt; ground vehicles. The page could be moved to <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-RT_%28Star_Wars%29_5876.html" title="AT-RT (Star Wars)">AT-RT (Star Wars)</a> to prevent any real-world clashes but somehow I don't think that would change Geogre's mind. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 16:46, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Finding it via categories is a bit precious. Insiders know to use them. Researchers, though, use the handy search box. You could also say that the information would be found by clicking on its linked article, which would be true. However, in that case you already <i>know</i> what it is. As for the people who go to an encyclopedia to cruise the category list of a fictional universe, I don't think that's truly general knowledge encyclopedia reading. That seems to me to be fan site work. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:41, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>If there's no article for AT-ST the search box would presumably show AT-ST (Star Wars) as a result for "AT-ST" so the info could be found. If there was a real AT-ST article, yes it would be hidden unless there was a disambig on that page, (which it probably wouldn't deserve) but that's not the case yet. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:43, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Utapau is a real place in Thailand (and the planet is probably named after it). I think we should not, under any account, redirect only to a work of fiction when the place really exists. It appears to be a local airstrip, with a flight code UTP.

<li>Comment: I agree about not redirecting, Star Wars' Utapau should be merged or moved to Utapau (Star Wars) or similar. There could be a disambig notice in the 'real Utapau' article, assuming a lot of people would search for the Star Wars one.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is subtrivial fancruft. Furthermore, this seems very suspiciuosly like original research in that I believe this person may have just seen a random vehicle in the background and decided to attach this name to it. I cannot recall any West End Game product that has named these vehicles, and no other source would have expanded on something seen in the background of a few shots in those movies. This most likely is a Ubrikkian Personnel Skiff Model IV, which appears in Episode IV as well and gets a write-up in the Rebel Alliance Sourcebook, but in that case, this article is in the wrong place. I feel all of this is moot, since fancruft like this should just be eliminated, but this detailed analysis is for the benefit of those who may not realize that the subject of the article itself is of questionable authenticity. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:26, Dec 29, 2004 (UTC)

<li>The vehicle in question is neither the P-Tower (dish-shaped artillery) nor the DF.9 (white gun-tower), it is a separate object seen inside the rebel hangar in ESB and is dark grey in color. There is an article on T-Bone´s SW site that has more information and pics of the "wagon": <a href="http://www.starwarz.com/tbone/cut_scenes/ep5/luke_gunner.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.starwarz.com/tbone/cut_scenes/ep5/luke_gunner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.starwarz.com/tbone/cut_scenes/ep5/luke_gunner.htm</a></li>

<li>Ok. Looking at that picture, I agree that this is something different that has not been discussed in any product I am aware of. I still feel that since this object has essentially been expunged from the movies (apart from the brief glimpse at the gates) that giving it an article is imporper since anything written about it would be "original research" in a manner of speaking.

<li><b>Comment'</b>. IB does not mean a school is academically the "top" school in a region. It just means that it has a significant number of students with international backgrounds: most likely it is a school that attracts the children of expatriates living in the region, since the IB will be more recognized by universities in other countries. IF a school has a distinguished history, is significant in terms of the history of education in its region, has many famous alumnae, etc, then it should be in, but not just because it awards the IB. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:41, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see no point in a flame war over a trivial matter like this, especially as I am leaning more towards keep than delete. I changed the wording above for increased clarity, but if you had actually read what I wrote in context, you would have understood what was meant, i.e. the school is probably important, but there isn't enough "content or information" to make the school worth an article of its own - yet. I think there may well be at some later point. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 15:18, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>I have read it and find no support for your claim. Any article can be listed on VfD. One of the good reasons to list an article is that one believes that it is not, and has no potential to becom, encyclopedic. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. Just because somebody released a single or produced a trading card with a picture of a monster on it a produced an episode of a situation comedy, does not mean that the song or the card or the television program episode merits an individual article in an encyclopedia. These things should be discussed to decide which things should be kept, which should be merged, which belong on another wiki, and so on. This is why we have VfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:23, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Everyking: They're lapidarily-written articles on topics that are extremely ephemeral and celebrity-based. I wish they were on something besides a teeny-pop artist's latest PR maneuverings. I wish they were somewhat critical, including the same information, but they're in a context such that every year, for over fifty years, such meowings (pardon me) have been 'important news,' for the month they've been relevant, and then have been supplanted by other meowing.

<dd>No, a lot of people have worked on the Mac OS over the years. Presumably, they all worked on something, and a lot of that code is probably still around and used. That does not make the coder notable. There are tons of sticky-type programs on all sorts of platforms; such programs are not high-tech. Ditto, iChat. Maybe it is just because you haven't done a very good job communicating what a genius this guy is and how highly regarded he is by everyone, but he comes across as a competent programmer employed by a big company in the computer industry, of which there are literally tens, if not hundreds, of thousands in the United States alone. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:09, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't think you are Jens, and I think I've found his on-line resume/job history. Although you could have answered my question. You know, this guy is in his thirties. He's worked on this project; he's worked on that project; team member here; team member there. If I advertised for software engineers, I'd expect to get dozens of resumes that look like this. OK, his might be one of the ones I'd interview, maybe, so he looks a bit better than average on paper, mainly because he's worked for companies, and on projects, I've heard of. He looks like he has a good career in front of him, but he doesn't look any more notable than thousands of other Silicon Valley types who've worked for Apple, Sun, etc over the years.

<dd>Well, being employed 10 years as a software engineer doesn't qualify someone as notable, or else there are probably a 100,000 notable software engineers. I've been employed for 25 years as a software engineer, and I don't think I'm notable. Both Apple and Sun have technical career tracks that go up very high in the company. What I meant was that I'd expect to see him in a very senior technical position at Apple -- a senior Architect, Consulting Engineer, technical lead of a major project, etc, one of the maybe 30 or 40 top engineers in the company. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:41, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you even read the article before marking it for deletion? He left the company after a few years and then came back. Since then he has been technical lead on Java AWT.

<li><b>No vote yet.</b> I don't think being "the developer of Stickies" warrants an article; it's not an integral or CUSP-y part of the OS like QuickTime, or the Finder. Nor is it a major separate application (like iTunes or iMovie). The statement that Windows equivalents are "copies" bothers me, too; I think I recall similar programs as far back as MS-DOS (in Borland's SideKick, IIRC. I've never used Tornado Notes but some regarded it highly). "Stickies" is not a seminal application like <a href="../../../v/i/s/VisiCalc_11da.html" title="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a>. The work on AppleScript seems much important to me. But in that regard, it bothers me that the <a href="../../../a/p/p/AppleScript_ff34.html" title="AppleScript">AppleScript</a> article mentions "Sal Soghoian, William Cook, Donn Denman, Warren Harris, Kurt Piersol" and does <i>not</i> mention Jens Alfke.

<dd>You appealed to personal considerations when you stated, "I've been employed for 25 years as a software engineer, and I don't think I'm notable" and you then went on to deride the superior accomplishments of a respected developer partly because they are not "senior in the technical hierarchy". The merits of Jens Alfke's accomplishments are not limited by his job title. You can throw around "ad hominem" all you want, but it won't do much to hide your sour grapes attitude. I try to assume other editors contributions are made in good faith, but this is VfD abuse. I'm really surprised that someone with 25 years of experience as a software developer is trying to minimize the accomplishments of a fellow developer in this manner.</dd>
<dd>Your interjection of "porn actresses" into this discussion is a straw man, please compare apples to apples, for example, would you object if another editor were to expand the profile of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Leak_dbd4.html" title="Bruce Leak">Bruce Leak</a>?

<dd>VfD discussions are inherently about whether the article subjects are notable. It should be possible to argue against the subject of a biographical article being notable without being accused of "sour grapes" or of trying to "minimize" someone's accomplishments. For me, someone whose claim to fame is that he has worked ten years for Apple and has written applications like Stickies or iChat is not very notable, even if Stickies itself is (which is debatable). Am I not allowed to voice that opinion? Having said that, on Wikipedia every actor who has ever played a minor role in any movie or TV show, anybody who has written a single episode of Star Trek, anybody who has been a backup singer for Ashlee Simpson, every band that has ever released an album, every writer of any book sold on Amazon, etc are notable. So perhaps it is only fair that software engineers be considered notable if they wrote programs that desktop computer users have used. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:35, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
