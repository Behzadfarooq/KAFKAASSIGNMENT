<li><b>Delete</b>, after reviewing the sources presented in DRV. These simply verify that an operation existed, which I don't believe was ever in doubt. There is still no evidence of notability, other than that it has an interesting backstory (how the smuggling was done). Media coverage is still trivial, even with the CIO magazine mention, and there it was brought up as an example by an Interpol person, not the topic of the interview. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 01:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

There is nothing unusual about police agencies from 50 countries being asked to search their databases for Interpol.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per the concerns I raised in the original afd and in the original. We should care about the quality of references and if they verify the claims of the article. Simply adding reference footnotes with links does not prove that an article is well-referenced.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here are the issues with the unproven claims and implications of the article:</li>
<li>1) The original research implication that the operation was named after a children's colouring book. The CIO magazine article mentions the title of a series used for drug smuggling but does not specify what kind of book. Making an unreliable original source claim that a children's book series is connected with drug smuggling is irresponsible - it may cause legal problems with the children's book series authors and publisher, especially as the book series implicated is still active<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Show-Me-How-Activity-Step-Step/dp/0765194198" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Show-Me-How-Activity-Step-Step/dp/0765194198" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.
<ul>
<li>So fix it. That <i>may</i> have been presumptous by the author of the article to <i>perhaps</i> assume that it was the children's book of the same name, but that can be easily edited. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you're saying that there's a solid argument to be made that this book series <i>was</i> used for drug smuggling? Not an serious issue to suggest such a thing? I'll fix it by taking the statement out. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Was there a book called "show Me How" that was used for drug smuggling? Appears so. What was presumptuous? <i>Perhaps'</i> assuming that it was the children's book of the same name and not something else. To take it out entirely would be improper, to take out the children's book part, possibly not. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2) This misleading suggestion: "Through Operation Show Me How, an important international gang of drug smugglers were disrupted as a result of twenty four hours of coordinated database effort".Actually, the CIO magazine article specifically uses the operation as an example of "the international multicountry operations that may last for eons". The operation lasted at least two years. Not 24 hours. What the article says is that within 24 hours of an inquiry being sent out internationally, they received responses from 50 countries - how long does it take for a professional department to respond to an email, fax or phone call which asks the department to look up something in their own computer database? This is not particularly noteworthy. Note that none of the official reports mentioning this operation mention the "24 hour" aspect at all. Magazine interview sources should also be taken with a grain of salt, especially if the interviewee appears to be talking off the top of his head (I doubt that arrests were literally made on "all continents" for instance plus he can't remember the month this eventful supposedly-smashing-drug-gangs-in-a-supposedly-landmark-24-hours operation started but we are to take his "50 countries" number quote as gospel?)
<ul>
<li>Okay...and? With the interview thing specifically, we're sourcing to him, right? So that's all that matters - what he said. The article can merely reflect "Interviewed party claimed 50 countries on all continents." --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My main point is that the article's claim that the operation was special for achieving something in 24 hours is misleading. The database inquiry is not unusual. As for the second part of the statement, I was pointing out that the magazine interview is not a solid source. As I said above, we should care about the quality of our sources and what they actually say. In addition, as I also note higher up in this discussion, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpol.html" title="Interpol">Interpol</a> is an international police organization with 180+ member countries and one of its main routine purposes is to coordinate information sharing and inquiries between all its members. Making an inquiry to 50 countries is not special for Interpol, its their normal business. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:39, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree with you regarding the interview, and I don't think anyone's claiming that the inquiry to 50 countries is anything special. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3) The misleading suggestion that the operation was decisive in showing the possibility of drugs sent through mail was an issue for all countries. This claim is based on the 1999 Interpol report which mentions Show Me How and at least one other operation ("Hostel/Portrait") in connection with Express Mail smuggling as well as vague additional "Interpol Information". Unless we apply an original research expansive interpretation of the brief one-line mention of Show Me How, there is no statement which suggests that Show Me How was decisive in showing that this was a problem. It is also not clear even if it did, why this would be encyclopedically notable.
<ul>
<li>So is the problem with the word "decisive," or something else? The operation was apparently worth noting, so it was <i>something</i>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By your standard then, any operation or project mentioned in a paragraph or even a single line by a government or police or international agency report is worth an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a>
<ul>
<li>You're probably correct. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4) No other indication of why this operation was especially important compared to other Interpol drug operations. In the 36 page 1998 Interpol annual report, this operation gets a ~30 word mention. (9 countries, not 50, are mentioned as significant operation areas) in the middle of a list of 10 drugs operations. There is no indication why this is a stand out operation. In the 40 page 1999 Interpol annual report, the operation is given a single line mention, which is shared with another operation. In the 196 page Transnational Crime report, the operation is given a 25 to 30 word mention in a list with 2 other operations. Furthermore, a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> news database search showed no news coverage hits for "Operation Show Me How"
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a> in reverse. Perhaps we should make articles on the others, too? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said above, by this standard, any operation mentioned in a paragraph or even a single line by a government or police or international agency report is worth an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5) The Czech and the "World News Connection" articles (which are actually the same - the World News Connection is merely an international news collection database translation or summary of the Czech article) refer to a French NGO report which does not mention Operation Show Me How at all. See my comments at deletion review about this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_January_11" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_January_11" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. --<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, again, fix it. If the reference is tagged incorrectly (and just because the source doesn't mention the operation doesn't mean it's not a valid source in the article for any number of statements), then fix it. These are issues that should be taken up at the article, not as reasons to delete - you have yet to indicate what the problems <i>with inclusion</i> are. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I have in detail. Regarding this specific source, even if accepted, does not show why this Operation is encyclopedically notable <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a>'~
