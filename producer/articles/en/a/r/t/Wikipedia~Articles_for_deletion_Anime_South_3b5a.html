<li>Thanks for the pointer. Read farther into it, though, and while Ned's comments were rather acerbic, no doubt, my statement still stands - as does my&#160;!vote.

<li>I'm not sure why that would be considered bad faith considering it's a logical path of reasoning. We became aware that the article itself should be deleted using the same rational as why it shouldn't be in the list article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to note that this AFD was started by a neutral editor and not by one of the parties involved in the dispute. Even if the topic did come up in the RfC, this nomination is not in bad faith. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 01:14, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It was not a neutral editor.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Honestly, I couldn't care less, but as has been shown in the link above, the AfD is clearly a bad faith nomination.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. Per the link to the List of Anime Conventions talk page, deletion has been debated thereon. This is <i>not</i> a bad faith nomination, the convention is simply not (yet) notable per criteria. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 21:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It's somewhat hypocritical to claim this is a bad faith nomination based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_anime_conventions#Request_for_Comment:_List_of_anime_conventions.27__criteria" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_anime_conventions#Request_for_Comment:_List_of_anime_conventions.27__criteria" rel="nofollow">List of anime conventions RfC</a>... the creator and sole proponent (minus his socks) of the Anime South article has tried to nominate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anime_conventions.html" title="List of anime conventions">list of anime conventions</a> as an AfD simply because his small convention did not meet the criteria. Also, several of them are joining wikipedia just to "vote" <a href="http://www.animesouth.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=554" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.animesouth.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=554" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for this article. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyOliver_4b95.html" title="User:TommyOliver">TommyOliver</a> 23:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I've put the {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_a_ballot_89d1.html" title="Template:Not a ballot">not a ballot</a>}} tag on just in case --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 01:26, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm ambivalent in general about individual articles for individual conventions and issues surrounding the RfC that led to this. However, looking at a few articles on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anime_conventions.html" title="List of anime conventions">List of anime conventions</a>, this particular article has citations that are about average for its type. It cites AnimeCons.com and, yes, the convention's own webpage. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_Weekend_Atlanta_0a33.html" title="Anime Weekend Atlanta">Anime Weekend Atlanta</a>, a far more notable convention in my estimation, doesn't even go that far. As for notability... AnimeSouth probably fails the test. But I think a lot of other convention articles would also fall under the axe.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonocrat_e146.html" title="User:Monocrat">Monocrat</a> 02:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I guess. If it's notable, it doesn't tell me why. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 04:09, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> After repeated requests to add some actual content (with references) to the page before removing the "stub" tag, neither User:Animesouth (nor anyone else) has done so. Therefore one must assume that there is nothing else that can be said about this convention. Surely <i>someone</i> must have posted an independent third-party con report that could be cited as reference. If there were detailed information on it, I might be able to support keeping it...but seeing as how nobody has anything to add -- no history, no details on past events, etc. -- I don't see anything in the article that makes this any more notable than the next convention. (If there <i>IS</i> a reason this convention is notable, <i>why isn't it here?!</i>) Additionally and unfortunately, the repeated vandalism by User:Animesouth has made maintenance on this article far more troublesome than it should be. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 22:03, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
