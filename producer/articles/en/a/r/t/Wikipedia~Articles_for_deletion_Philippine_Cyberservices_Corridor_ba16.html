<p><s>Delete for two reasons. One, this is definitely already a promotional article, no matter how one salvages it, and wikipedia is not a promotional tool. The corridor is not even notable. There are so many tech facilities spread out all over the country, the whole country is a corrider? The Philippines also does not have a <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_technology.html" title="High technology">high technology</a> district, that can be compared to <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, even just in notability. Two, part of its title "cyberservices" is not used in technical or mainstream in any language, other than by its marketing inventors, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cyberservices_32f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cyberservices">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cyberservices</a>. Note to everyone, I am Filipino, and I am not race bashing.</s></p>
<p>Simply put, it does violate <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">2 sections of policy</a>. Deliberately promoting what is definitely '<i>not</i> there, and predicting way too far in the future. A new administration can change alot.

<p>If we were to pursue logic of Noypi380, we would have to delete all other entries in the category High-technology_business_districts as well. The reason why Noypi380 has targeted this entry is his/her anti-Filipino attitude, as can be seen from his/her other posts.</p>

<dd>I'm not anti-Filipino coz I am Filipino, and proud of it. I challenge you to cite a post that is anti-anything.

<p>You may be right about Noypi380. For this person to say "the corridor is not even notable" is a contradiction to the Philippine president's statement that over 100,000 people are employed in the corridor. It seems this person is biased against the Philippines, and I would not be surprised if this person comes from a country that competes with the Philippines for offshore work.</p>
<p>Why target the Philippines? Why is Noypi380 silent about other corridors in other countries?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pls try to compare the corridor which is 600 miles from <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baguio.html" title="Baguio">Baguio</a> to <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamboanga.html" title="Zamboanga">Zamboanga</a> with <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>. That is almost the 9/10's of our country! The government is trying to make our whole country a corridor? Truthfully, no. --<a href="../../../n/o/y/User%7ENoypi380_7d93.html" title="User:Noypi380">Noypi380</a> 09:31, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>What is going on is the government is taking credit for those over 100,000 tech workers. Those over 100,000 are being employed in tech-related enterprises, spread out all over the country. The government conveniently credited themselves, by calling it all a "corridor", as if the government planned it ahead of time. That is why it is not notable, and it would be more politically correct to remove it. <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a> is definitely a corridor. Though I am Filipino, I am the first person who would admit that there no such place in our country remotely like <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, no matter what the government labels it. --<a href="../../../n/o/y/User%7ENoypi380_7d93.html" title="User:Noypi380">Noypi380</a> 09:28, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes sir, but pls compare further. Firstly Mr. Commissioner, is your corridor existing, or is just hype? Does the effort at its current stage, if ever, warrant an article in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, or just in local newspapers? Just because the plan is big does not mean it should be in Wikipedia already. Wait and see. The goal is too far off, too <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">unpredictable</a>. Or can you say "600 miles of fiber optic cable" is equal to "the corridor", and then put an article here on the whole corridor? No sir. It is best that the article only exist if/when that dream is almost a reality, unless crystal balls are back in fashion. Secondly, the article cannot deliberately mislead readers promoting what is not there.

<li><b>Delete</b>, for the reasons below:</li>
</ul>
<p>Although President Arroyo mentioned about a "cyberservices corridor" in the speech cited on the page, it is only but a mere concept. The Philippine Cyberservices Corridor does not even exist yet in reality as of yet. Also, the chosen resource in itself is faulty. If President Arroyo talks about the concept of the Philippine Cyberservices Corridor, that does not mean that the corridor exists, even if she tries to promote <i>forming</i> a corridor by the end of her term. As of now, while cyberservices are booming, there is no concrete proof that the corridor even exists.</p>

<dd>Well, it is there... the land is there. There is controversy on its characteristics but the stretch of land does exist.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>.</s> <small>(Merge, see below)</small> Noypi, your motivation for deletion seems to be based on the fact that the article is biased towards the Philippine Cyberservices Corridor being a "real" high-tech district, not whether the concept is notable or not. I believe the concept <i>is</i> notable, considering the government is actively promoting it. Now, whether this 600-mile stretch of land should be considered a high-tech district or not is for the two sides of POV to battle out in the article.

<dd>For the moment let us all call the corridor "PCC". There are two PCCs in question here. One is the planned future PCC, which is based on a source, (only the presidential speeches). The other one is the "current" PCC, (subject of the article before you edited it). That "current" PCC is not sourced, is not planned, is not a district, and it does not exist, never mind about the area. That is why I argue against its notability, because there is none. Speaking in an NPOV way, it violates <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">this policy</a>. The one who started that article is also a government official in our country who is responsible for promoting the local industries. I apologize that he is promoting <i>now</i> something that is not there, and is also in doubt. On the future planned PCC <i>which is not the subject of the article</i>, that I concede is notable. However it is just a plan. Over 50% of long term government plans in the Philippines do not push through, even elections, and on that regard, that is why users Noelle, and Akira, and Coffee, all Filipinos, voted <b>delete</b>. We only start important Philippine-related articles only when we are already sure it is almost built, as too avoid <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">this violation</a>. That is how we do things in order to accomodate wikipedia's policies. The future PCC is a long time away, and "PCC" is certainly not the correct name in the future, and that is assuming we are using the PCC as defined in the speeches. The article was deliberately misleading, sourcing the "planned" PCC, and saying that is already here to a "current" PCC, which does not exist, and I was vehemently against. That is basically all of it in NPOV. That is why I urge everyone to <b>delete</b> it already. It can be brought back anyway, in perhaps 5-10 years time, assuming all goes well.

The Corridor, which is connected by a US$10 billion high bandwidth fiber backbone and digital network, shall serve as a “one destination” for investors, stretching 600 miles from Baguio to Zamboanga. Certain areas have been declared as ICT hubs with high-speed networks and connectivity: (Pasig-Ortigas, Makati, UP-Ateneo-Eastwood, Alabang-Paranaque, Subic-Clark, Cebu-Asia Town Park, University Belt, Davao). Additional 9 areas have been identified as potential ICT hubs: Leyte, Camarines Sur, Pangasinan, Iloilo City, Baguio City, Davao, Zamboanga, General Santos City and Cagayan de Oro."

<dd>What I question is that why would an article talk about a concept that is only a concept and does not physically exist. It is concedable that the Arroyo administration is pursuing the corridor, but pursuit of a concept does not mean that such a concept exists in reality. In fact, there is still no hard evidence that the PCC even exists except for the concept. Note that the first line of that quote mentions "The development of the Philippine CyberServices Corridor which shall provide a variety of cyberservices at par with global standards was pursued". Pursuit, as mentioned earlier, is not tantamount to formation. President Arroyo herself did not even give a timeline on when the PCC concept would finally take shape and when it would be completed. Because of that, it's still a non-existant concept and I still stand by my decision to <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkira123323_37f1.html" title="User:Akira123323">Akira123323</a> 07:51, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your considered responses and explaining the distinction between the current vs proposed PCC -- the Wikipedia article definitely confuses the two (I have not yet checked to verify your claim that the two are indeed distinct). If indeed "over 50% of long-term government plans" are empty "electoral promises" then that should be mentioned in the article. I did not previously see the article <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process_outsourcing_in_the_Philippines_2dfe.html" title="Business process outsourcing in the Philippines">Business process outsourcing in the Philippines</a> - that is a very appropriate article. <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process_outsourcing_in_the_Philippines_2dfe.html" title="Business process outsourcing in the Philippines">Business process outsourcing in the Philippines</a>. Again, let me remind you that the existance of a Wikipedia article (or section of an article) on a subject does not make it "better" or give it more credence, it can also be bad. Corporations often advertise on Wikipedia, only to have their article become a description of all its horrible business practices rather than a description of the things it sells. For example, if President Aroyyo has made promises in regard to the PCC / PCC proposal that she does not hold, then this could serve as documentation for future reference that she failed her promises. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">02-12</a>&#160;13:40<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>

<dd>It seems another option is to <b>remove the categorization</b> of the article from the High Tech Business Districts. With regard to suggestion to merge to <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process_outsourcing_in_the_Philippines_2dfe.html" title="Business process outsourcing in the Philippines">Business process outsourcing in the Philippines</a>, this would not be acceptable as <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberservices.html" title="Cyberservices">Cyberservices</a> is more than just <a href="../../../b/p/o/BPO_f952.html" title="BPO">BPO</a>. With regard to crystal-balling, this is not acceptable as the $10B high bandwidth telecomm backbone already exists and can be verified physically, as well as the call centers and other companies mentioned in the article. There is actually going to be a MOA signed between the governors and mayors within the next 60 days to formalize the existence of such corridor on a local/regional level (it is already part of national policy on a country level). Upon such signing, article will be updated. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDondiMapa_77ef.html" title="User:DondiMapa">Dondi</a> 07:18, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes Mr Commissioner, but the work you are doing now in office is not equal to the "corridor". Telecom backbone + call centers + contracts is not equal to a "present" corridor (subject of article, non-existent) and is not equal to a "future" corridor (based on vague speeches of president who can be deposed even tommorrow). See how deceiving? I urge you to vote <b>delete</b>, and don't worry if it is removed. I'll help you out create encyclopedic articles related to the Philippine information/communication technology industry. Pls, I mean pls, vote <b>delete</b>, based on the reasons I said.

<dd>That's an unfair comparison. Read the text above again, particularly my discussion with Quarl. This is clearly not like <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2007_films.html" title="Category:2007 films">Category:2007 films</a> or <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2007_elections.html" title="Category:2007 elections">Category:2007 elections</a>. Those things are almost certainly going to be done in 2007. The films have definite release dates, even down to the hour in so many countries. The elections have poll voting and counting schedules planned beforehand, with contingencies. The future "corridor", <i>assuming the sources</i>, does not even have a deadline, and has so many other uncertainties. There are so many plans but no completions in the Philippines. The "future" corridor is not even the subject of the article, for the subject of the article is a "present" corridor that does not even exist, read Akira's earlier comments. That is why there is no apparent NPOV dispute. No corridor, no dispute. You're confusing the future uncertain, unfinalized, <i>plan</i> with a corridor <i>that is not there</i>. See? That article has already been proven to be blatant act of deception through wikipedia. The planned 600 mile "stretch of land" does not automatically present itself as a corridor <i>now</i> unless the thing is fully or nearly built, <i>if it is built</i>. I urge you to reconsider you're vote to <b>delete</b>. Of course, all of this assumes were not kidding...&#160;:) --<a href="../../../n/o/y/User%7ENoypi380_7d93.html" title="User:Noypi380">Noypi380</a> 00:06, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
