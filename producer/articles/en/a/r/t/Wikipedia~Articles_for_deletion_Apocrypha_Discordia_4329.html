<dd>Hey, somebody's done his research! I think I'll add that comment to the discussion about <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a> too. Apocrypha has a history, it's been around in Loveshade's form since the mid 1990s which is now the Ek-sen-trik-kuh, and in DrJon's form since 2001 or so. And really, Wickethewok, do you really feel you have the authority to declare a work as non-notable? That sounds like an opinion to me. Some people think Barbie is stupid, so should we delete her article too? <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJennyGirl_5bb2.html" title="User:JennyGirl">JennyGirl</a> 08:14, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - My two cents: The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha_Discordia_0ade.html" title="Apocrypha Discordia">Apocrypha Discordia</a> was created and evolved as a separate work to what's now known as the <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a>. The title was influenced by the mention by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jackson_e31d.html" title="Steve Jackson">Steve Jackson</a>, not by the subsequent Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, and the research for the work itself stretched back to the 1970s. Although one of the extant three short pieces from Rev.Loveshade's work was included, that piece shares space with over a hundred other works - the primary ones being "apocryphal" but genuine passages omitted from the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Discordia_be68.html" title="Principia Discordia">Principia Discordia</a>. The Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia (although no doubt a worthy work) is entirely incidental to <i>this</i> Apocrypha Discordia. <b>Keep</b> or <b>Delete</b> the entry as you will (I would argue that it seems to have become rather beloved of modern Discordians--I receive fan emails at a slow but steady pace--and it <i>is</i> in the Library of Congress), but the work is wholly separate to the Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, and if the wikipedia cares about accuracy at all, it will not merge the entries for two uniquely different works. <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 09:32, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that you've never heard of a major religion like <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism.html" title="Jainism">Jainism</a>, which has millions of followers, does not justify keeping articles for every group with a few dozen. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 18:27, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree. I was making a point, anyway. We even have articles on <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">hypothetical religions</a>! Amounts of followers do not make a religion any more important. Things like this should be especially true for any religion, too, since I would imagine a lot of people would take offense to a part of their beliefs (or somewhat-beliefs in this case maybe) being called non-notable. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus"><font color="green"><b>Vore</b></font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVoretus_e700.html" title="User talk:Voretus"><b><font color="blue">tus</font></b></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Voretus_d90a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Voretus"><b><font color="black">the Benevolent</font></b></a> 18:47, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was commenting on Fan1967's comment at 18:27, not trying to make another argument towards keeping the article; I was saying that amounts of followers aren't directly correlated to notability, as demonstrated by the invisible pink unicorn and flying spaghetti monster, which both have approximately 0 real followers. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus"><font color="green"><b>Vore</b></font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVoretus_e700.html" title="User talk:Voretus"><b><font color="blue">tus</font></b></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Voretus_d90a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Voretus"><b><font color="black">the Benevolent</font></b></a> 19:19, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I strongly disagree. The fundamental definition of "notability," as we use it here, is "a lot of people care/know about it." Wikipedia standards of notability involve being in a bunch of libraries (for a book), receiving significant media coverage and/or sales rankings (for a company), reached a significant number of album sales or radio airplay (for a band), or with high Google and Alexa rankings (for a website). That there is not one shred more verifiable, NPOV evidence of the existence of Allah than there is of the Lint God that lives in my navel doesn't remotely make the latter an equivalent faith to the former. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:46, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Notability isn't based on the number of followers. It's based on how many people are aware of it (which of course does include the followers themselves). <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven%27s_Gate_5d0a.html" title="Heaven's Gate">Heaven's Gate</a> had very few followers but became, poshumously, quite notable. FSM is a pretty famous joke, and qualifies based on that. This, on the other hand, seems to have few members, and is all but unknown outside the group. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:37, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is this non-notable if Discoridianism itself is notable? Why would it be less notable, than, say the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Sub-Genius_b78f.html" title="Church of the Sub-Genius">Church of the Sub-Genius</a>, which also has "sacred texts"? There are religious dissenters in all religious groups, even seemingly bogus ones. <b>KEEP</b> unless new criteria for religions are developled; then you can delete FSM and the Church of Bob as well. <a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 21:00, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except the "sacred texts" for Discordianism are the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Discordia_be68.html" title="Principia Discordia">Principia Discordia</a>, which are not being challenged. This is some additional stuff that some (how many?) believe in and some (how many?) dispute, according to the article itself. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:39, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That sounds remarkably like saying that the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a> should not have a page of their own because it's "additional stuff that some...believe in and some...dispute". If you're happy to keep <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discordianism.html" title="Discordianism">Discordianism</a> why the problem with pages relating to its texts? ~~ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrother_William_5af5.html" title="User:Brother William">Brother William</a> 13:13, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Despite not being as well known as the Principia, mainly because <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illuminatus.html" title="Illuminatus">Illuminatus</a> was written before its creation, the Apocrypha is still an important text in the Discordian canon. In my view for wiki to give an accurate and clear picture of Discordianism it should have pages on the most important texts. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discordianism.html" title="Discordianism">Discordianism</a> has grown beyond the many versions of the Principia and to ignore the Apocrypha would be ignoring a notable part of the religion. References to the text have been around since 1994 and some have even referred to it as "The New Testament" of Discordia (Konton magazine Autumnal Equinox 2005). -<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrenna_09f5.html" title="User:Prenna">Prenna</a> 16:11, 18 May 2006</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is another aspect of the confusion over the two <i>Apocrypha Discordias</i> (the first now called <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a>--see the deletion proposal for that entry). The 1994 reference to <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> was to a <i>possible</i> work that Steve Jackson Games was considering, but never did. The first works to claim to be part of <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> were written by Reverend Loveshade, and appeared online in 1995. (As proof, the dates on the index of both <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_links.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_links.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_links.html</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html</a> will show these works were posted in the 1990s). While DrJon wrote that he had been collecting Discordian works for over 20 years, he didn't publicly use the title <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> until he published his collection using that name in 2001. I think we should keep the articles on both works, or at least <b>Merge</b> them. But realize that some of the arguments here for DrJon's Apocrypha Discordia actually refer to Reverend Loveshade's work, <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a>. 207.67.146.218 03:09, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> - I came up with an international print magazine as a source that refers to the importance of the Apocrypha, not exactly Geocities, eh?. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrenna_09f5.html" title="User:Prenna">Prenna</a> 08:28, 19 May 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I believe the point the poster was making was that the Date Stamp on the article verified when it was posted. The Date Stamp is set by clocks based on International Standards, and can't be changed by a Yahoo!, Geocities, Angelfire, or whatever user. In fact, they have been used as evidence in court, and falsifying them is a violation of international law. The whole structure of the Internet is based on that--determining who first registers a domain name, for example. It's possible with the right program to fake the date stamp on an email; it's almost impossible to fake one on a website. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamthatIam_66be.html" title="User:IamthatIam">IamthatIam</a> 06:11, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> - Ok... thats nice.... I don't think how old this hoax is in under questioning or if anyone asked for proof regarding that. What we want is proof of notability, not age. Something can be a few years old and still be non-notable. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:50, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> - Ermm... yes. That is the long and short of it. We need evidence that this is notable. I don't know how I'm being not being impartial. The editors of Wikipedia are requesting <i>verifiable</i> information about this subject being notable, and no one has provided it. Thats the bottom line. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 21:51, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> I was pointing out the history of the concept of the Apocrypha which, particularly in something like Discordianism, is an important thing. The fact that Steve Jackson created the idea in 1994 shows that the concept has been in the consciousness of Discordians, and non-Discordians, for 12 years. I was not attempting to write Rev Loveshade out of history or anything. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrenna_09f5.html" title="User:Prenna">Prenna</a> 08:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You challenge the statement earlier on that you are not impartial, but then you say "you may provide additional sources and I will tell you why those are also don't work".

<dd>Still ignoring the evidence that doesn't fit your opinion on this then eh? As I've referenced previously, international <b>print</b> magazine, Konton, has referred to this book as "the new testament of Discordianism" (Autumnal Quinox 2005). Perhaps you are unaware that life exists outside the internet as well. From what I can see you have decided that you will delete this and nothing will shake you from this decision.

<dd>Your initial statement that the work "Started as a non-notable usenet thing" is an error of fact. It demonstrably did not start as a "usenet" thing, but as an internet thing.
