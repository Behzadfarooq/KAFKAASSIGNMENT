<li><b>Comment</b> Well yes, I'm sure your local bookshop has a great many books that are <i>part</i> of the Simpsons franchise. (e.g. <a href="../../../a/_/c/The_Simpsons%7E_A_Complete_Guide_to_Our_Favorite_Family_e89b.html" title="The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family">this</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/c/The_Simpsons_Beyond_Forever%21%7E_A_Complete_Guide_to_Our_Favorite_Family_...Still_Continued_ae44.html" title="The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued">this</a>). But reading them and conducting some sort of critical analysis would still be inescapably <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">orignal research</a>. I severally doubt you can find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that conduct such any analysis of motor vehicles in a television cartoon franchise and that could form the backbone of anything even approaching encyclopaedic content. -- <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon"><font color="#153E7E">I</font><font color="#1569C7">sl</font><font color="#157DEC">a</font><font color="#1589FF">y</font><font color="#1589FF">So</font><font color="#157DEC">lo</font><font color="#1569C7">mo</font><font color="#153E7E">n</font></a> <font color="#153E7E">|</font> <a href="../../../i/s/l/User_talk%7EIslaySolomon_7b55.html" title="User talk:IslaySolomon"><font color="#006600">t</font><font color="#336633">a</font><font color="#669966">l</font><font color="#99CC99">k</font></a> 12:21, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>With rare exceptions, shoes don't matter on the Simpsons (though there was a case where Lisa got some dancing shoes that would, IMHO, qualify for a spot in an article about the subject). That's an exception though. However, I can think of at least seven episodes about vehicles in the Simpsons. (Homer's Snowplow, The Homer, Bart's racer, the Canyonero, the Monorail, the episode where the family goes to Italy, the RV...). That's not even getting into the importance of regular vehicles in the series.

<li><b>Delete</b> Without denying that she looks good, and even assuming she has talent, no basis is demonstrated for having an article at this time. The article has many phrases the same as <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/bands/band.asp?bandID=308" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/bands/band.asp?bandID=308" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> so there may be copyvio issues unless the Wikipedia article came first. The many unsupported claims: "fans all over the world," "sold well," "popular" do not provide even one independent attestation of notability. A websearch of several thousand publications disclosed no reviews in publications of general circulation. Google only has 590 hits. There are no verified (or even unverified) numbers of cd's sold or paid downloads. Anyone with a computer and a microphone can create 5 self-produced CD's. It is up to the creaters of an article to provide multiple independent reliable sources to show that the subject is notable. Wikipedia is not a site for promoting new talent. Become famous, (I expect she well may) THEN you get an article. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:12, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

It fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, being only very little more than a video game guide. It is a combination of material lifted verbatim from <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/monsterhunter/hints.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/monsterhunter/hints.html" rel="nofollow">this website</a> (and "used by permission" with no link or other reference), and what appears to be original research on the part of the article creator--there are no citations of independent, reliable sources. Accordingly, it fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Lastly, the character of Fatalis is not notable except for serious users of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_Hunter_03e2.html" title="Monster Hunter">Monster Hunter</a>. A google search turned up very few references to this character and none outside of the context of game hint pages. It fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> as fancruft. I would suggest merging with <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_Hunter_03e2.html" title="Monster Hunter">Monster Hunter</a> but I think the treatment of the character of Fatalis in that article is adequate and that this material isn't suitable for inclusion in WP. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 02:43, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think this is vanity, since the editor writes a lot of articles about Guantanamo (and from his other entries may be in Alaska or the Yukon). I also think this article was created in good faith. However, I'm not convinced that this person is himself notable enough to merit inclusion in an international encyclopedia. There is nothing in the article that asserts his notability, especially since he is a living person who has not chosen to be in the public eye, and therefore his privacy concerns are of importance. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 12:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Proposed deletion before which was removed by author. This is a non notable movie which does not yet even exist and can not hope to assert it's notability at <i>least</i> until it does. I can only imagine a non-existent movie could be notable and suitable for Wikipedia were it (for example) a highly anticipated sequel to a blockbuster movie, an awaited adaption of a notable book or musical etc. or perhaps had some reason why it would attract public attention (politically outrageous movie denying the holocaust, socially outrageous movie depicting child sexuality) As it stands this article fails WP:NOT in that Wikipedia is not a a crystal ball, and Wikipedia is not a soapbox. <b><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•E<span style="background:#206">l<span style="background:#504">om<span style="background:#702">i<span style="background:#a00">s•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 02:48, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. The expansion of the article since the AfD began only contains one additional claim to notability, and that is a trivial mention on TV news. Non-trivial independent coverage has not been shown, which is what would be required to negate the consensus for deletion here, and the presence of editors continuing to argue for deletion following expansion gives me no reason to think that those who argued for deletion before it have failed to revisit the article; and if they had, would have changed their minds. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:21, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is my argument for not deleting The WiseGuys Wikipedia article</p>
<p>The WiseGuys meet the Wikipedia:Notability (comedy) in the following ways:</p>
<p>1) There are multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person/group/show and its creators/producers, such as articles in The Commercial Appeal and the Memphis Flyer. They have also performed on local television news/entertainment programs.</p>

<p>As one of only three improvisational theater companies in Memphis, Tn, The WiseGuys have been a major feature in the growing comedy community. They are a feature at the new Comedy, TN Comedy Club and perform out of the city as well.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - "Major feature" is a subjective term, and does not appear to be borne out by the available information. I'm sure it's an important group to you (since you appear to be connected to them), but it's not notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - the group's only legitimate claim to notability that I see is the presence of Larry Clark. It's difficult to gauge just how notable Clark is, however. Wikipedia does not have an article for Larry Clark (clown), and it's difficult to use Google as a gauge of his notability because there is another very famous <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Clark_aa1d.html" title="Larry Clark">Larry Clark</a> - the director of <i>Kids</i>. Clark has certainly toured with some impressive circuses, but I'm unclear about the magnitude of his contribution to those circuses.

<p>This group has been written up in "The Commercial Appeal", Memphis' newspaper. Links on the MCIA web site show that membership includes local and national comedy clubs and several groups. The calendar published by the MCIA is of value to individuals seeking information on comedy in the Mid-South. Finally, the MCIA is not "self promoting". It is a resource for multiple groups.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Aphrica album is widely considered a blip in Klaus Schulze's otherwise extremely prolific and acclaimed career. Schulze himself has no love for this album, neither has his manager Klaus Dieter Mueller, and both men fell out with Ernst Fuchs over its creation. As a painter Fuchs is great - much of his work is quite something, but this musical collaboration was ill-advised. Nevertheless the album was made and released (and I have a copy, though I admit it's not Schulze's best work), only to be withdrawn a while later. It has never been made available on CD and never will be. But I don't think mention of it should be simply left out of (or removed from) Wikipedia, or limited to just a name in the discography in the main Klaus Schulze article. It is part of Schulze's history; the album itself has a history, and some people may be curious about that history - what is this strange album they've seen listed but never been able to find? Therefore, out of respect for completeness if nothing else, I feel it should be kept. (Tonythepixel, 16 Nov 2006)

<dd>I retract this nomination in favor of the solution I just put into place on the article, whereby the original text is moved to The Babylon Project, and the Wikipedia article reflects primarily out-of-universe information, but has a link similar to sister project boxes at the bottom linking to the in-universe article. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 19:01, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This was a lead character in a novel, and mentioned in other novels and TV episodes in the series. With all due respect, I've seen a lot of less deserving characters from other series with similar wikis on this site. I'd support a transwiki if the B5 wikia was the primary source of information, but looking at the number and size of articles on that site versus this, it's clear which one is the de facto primary source. OTOH, a combined page on this wiki for minor characters like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Firefly_universe_0b96.html" title="List of minor characters in the Firefly universe">Firefly</a> or <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld_characters.html" title="Discworld characters">Discworld</a> have might also do the trick - all that's left to argue then is how much of a part a character has to play in a work of fiction before they earn their own wiki page. (Major part in one novel/episode? Background part in three? Is there a rule for that somewhere here I've missed?) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 08:07, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not a standard that has, to my knowledge, proven to be accepted as a notability standard. He certainly isn't a major character in B5 at large, and though he's a major character in a B5 novel - one we don't have an article on in the first place. (We admittedly did, but I just had to nuke it because the article was just the text from the back of the book.) <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> indicates pretty straightforwardly that character articles shouldn't get spun off the main article until it's too long, and minor characters should be put in a "list of minor characters" article. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 14:12, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I don't know anything about Babylon5, but I know there are a lot of Star Wars characters from the novels who have their own articles, and who in my opinion would be considered very minor, because I've only ever seen the movies. But if it isn't notable enough, I'd say merge it to a list of B5 characters, if one such exists. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 21:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Hello. I performed several edits on this article as I am familiar with the term. It is a popular financial term but many people do not understand it, thus the need for an accurate and informative wiki. Its a term used to describe a series of applications. It has no relation to any particular company. It seems the wiki was greatly improved from its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=App-O-Rama&amp;oldid=75201063/" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=App-O-Rama&amp;oldid=75201063/" rel="nofollow">first incarnation</a> to my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=App-O-Rama&amp;oldid=85312607/" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=App-O-Rama&amp;oldid=85312607/" rel="nofollow">last edit</a>. Most of the previous problems were addressed...it had several links and sources added, spam was removed, it was categorized and wikified, etc. So it was developing into a good wiki. Unfortunately, it appears some people began to dismantle the wiki, removing categories, spamming fatwallet, etc. It is no more and no less a neologism than the wiki on <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoozing.html" title="Stoozing">stoozing</a> (the term for 0% credit card investing in the UK) which has an active wiki. In fact, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoozing.html" title="Stoozing">Stoozing</a> wiki is a clear "how to" guide...this wiki, at the time of my last edit, is not. Perhaps all references to the fatwallet website should be removed. But there is a lot of interest in this term and if not proper for wikipedia, maybe should be moved to wikipedia dictionary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.132.154.187 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.132.154.187.html" title="User talk:71.132.154.187">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.132.154.187_10bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.132.154.187">contribs</a>) 08:09, November 17, 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> In the guide to deletion, Neologism means that the user considers this article to be about a word or phrase that is not well-established enough to merit a Wikipedia article. May be either a literal neologism (a very new word) or a protologism (a word coined in a small community but not used outside it). This term is used outside the community of the fatwallet website , examples:<a href="http://creditcardperks.webgroups.biz/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=8153" class="external text" title="http://creditcardperks.webgroups.biz/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=8153" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.cardst.com/tag/App-O-Rama" class="external text" title="http://www.cardst.com/tag/App-O-Rama" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.creditcardwatcher.com/an-app-o-rama-primer-how-to-profit-from-credit-card-offers/" class="external text" title="http://www.creditcardwatcher.com/an-app-o-rama-primer-how-to-profit-from-credit-card-offers/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Thus it is not protologism. It shows a documented history of use for well over two years in the public domain, and is therefore not a neologism. It is not about a company or an online discussion forum, though its use can be found in those places. Granted it certainly needs more work, but does not merit deletion.</li>

It is strategically important because it is the site of much of Iran’s oil reserves. Historically, the Arab community has been marginalised and discriminated against. Tension has mounted among the Arab population since April 2005, when scores of Arabs were killed, hundreds injured and hundreds more detained during and following demonstrations. The demonstrations were undertaken in protest at a letter which came to light allegedly written in 1999 by a presidential adviser, who denied its authenticity. This appeared to set out policies for the reduction of the Arab population of Khuzestan, including resettling Arabs in other regions of Iran, resettling non-Arabs in the province, and replacing Arabic place names with Persian ones</b> <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 17:12, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Few points: <b>1) Please show evidence of ethnic tension between Arabs and other ethnic groups in the region (such as Persians, Lurs, Bakhtiaris, Qashqais, Afsharis, etc.) 2) Why should <a href="../../../a/h/v/Ahvaz_Bombings_004a.html" title="Ahvaz Bombings">Ahvaz Bombings</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> be merged here when it should be the other way? i.e. Merge what is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> here (very little) into <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a>. 3) WP is not a soapbox or a political platform and the way you quote Amnesty (and bolding such a huge portion of text) is clearly evidence of this POV. 4) The Amnesty report is not neutral and it contains factual inaccuracies. Also the Amnesty report only shows tension between Arabs and the regime. In case you didnt know, there is tension between ALL Iranians and the regime. This is NOTHING to do with so-called "ethnic tension", "ethnic politic" or "ethnic conflict". Again WP is not a soapbox, not for advocacy, not for propaganda, and not to prove a original claim or point.</b> <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 17:39, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

But this article title is OR. As Mr. Doostzadeh says we could create similar OR titles like Ethnic conflict in North Africa (which actually wouldnt be OR because there is plenty of articles about Arabs killing Berber peoples), Ethnic conflict between Arabs and Persians (which though we could say is very true, is still OR), Ethnic conflict in Iraq (about pan-Arab genocide of Persian-speakers and Kurds - this is also not very OR), Ethnic conflict in Southwest United States (about conflict between Hispanics, Whites, and Blacks), etc etc etc. Some of them are not OR but would turn into "political battegrounds". Already we see the problem here.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article can be dealt with in the Khuzestan province article or Arabs of Iran. Virtually all the sources here are from separatists sites. Easily a country like former Ba'athist iraq can support a small group and that small group can setup a website and then propogate their political POV which is definitely not neutral. BTW is there is an article on Berber ethnic politics in Algeria? I think the genocide against Iranians by Arabs can also warrant an article. So these sort of articles are not helpful to anyone and are too POV oriented to have any neutrality. I do not see any valid reason for this article since it is all POV so far. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 04:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Looks like a POV fork and a huge chunk of the article is nothing but obvious (and certainly not neutral) promotional material for separatist political groups, most of which don't even seem to meet the threshold for verifiability. Accordingly, there are several other standard and generic articles about this region and/or the peoples of this region. metaspheres 20:37, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your block on me has prevented me from making an important point on the deleting of the Ethnic Politics of Khuzestan article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ethnic_politics_of_Khuzestan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ethnic_politics_of_Khuzestan" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. As this block extends beyond the deadline for the deletion, I would like you to pass on my points.</dd>
<dd>1. The article was created as the information contained within it was judged to be too lengthy for the Khuzestan article alone: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Khuzestan_Province#Ethnic_conflict_in_Khuzestan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Khuzestan_Province#Ethnic_conflict_in_Khuzestan" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. This was done with consensus of editors, although the name was changed from "ethnic conflict" to "ethnic politics" as "conflict" was judged too strong and POV and anyway it was recognised that the issues were of political importance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. A lot of work has gone into the article from people of all POVs, with the involvement of Iranian editors, and it has not been the subject of any lengthy edit war, despite the sensitive nature of the subject. This work will be lost if it is simply deleted without a merger with other articles - which I think is Khorshid's intention. It is worthwhile noting that Khorshid has made no attempt to edit the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. The issue of minority rights in Khuzestan is of significant public interest <a href="http://www.unpo.org/article.php?id=5848" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unpo.org/article.php?id=5848" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> <a href="http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/2006/11/european-parliament-condemns-iran-over.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/2006/11/european-parliament-condemns-iran-over.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> and deserves a separate article, with details on the actors involved.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>1)There is not just <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a> article - there is also <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> (where most of the Arab stuff that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - not separatist propaganda - should go).</dd>
<dd>2)Both are POV and violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. No credible evidence is there to prove this. What sources is there only shows tension between Arabs and regime, and this is same for all Iranians.</dd>
<dd>3)I have no bad intentions. Most of the article is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> like the separtist political groups.

<dd>4)<a href="../../../u/n/p/UNPO_2036.html" title="UNPO">UNPO</a> and British Ahwazi Friends Society, the two links you provide, are not only not neutral they promote separatist agenda and false history. There is fact and then there is propaganda and they are 100% not fact. Also those links dont discuss "minority" rights but "Arab" rights and the current article only talks about Arabs. There are a ton of minorities in Khuzestan beside Arab. And like I said there is already <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> (which be renamed <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestani_Arabs_a7eb.html" title="Khuzestani Arabs">Khuzestani Arabs</a>).

<p>Keep: politics should not influence history. Unfortunately some with ultra-nationalist, anti-Arab ideology want to influence this respectable forum that should be an educational tool. Arabs of Iran as a non-dominant, ethnic, linguistic and a national minority have never had the opportunity to express their identity in a Persian-dominated Iran during both, the monarchist or the current clerical regime. So it is just to allow this minority a few lines in Wikipedia. It is utterly undemocratic for the Persians to push for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alsaid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alsaid_f332.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alsaid">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Alsaid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alsaid_f332.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alsaid">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p>KEEP Please: Ahwazi-Arabs are indigenous to the area of Khuzestan. They date back before Islam. About 5000 years ago, long before the Achaemenid left Russia and headed toward the Iranian plateau, a Semitic nation by the name of Elamite lived in Khuzestan. They have left us signs of their blooming civilization in the ruins of Susa, Ghagharzanbill and other parts of Khuzestan, Lurestan and Fars. The Old Testament mentions their name for the first time. So we the Arabs of Iran are decedents of the Elimite. Kasravi, a well respected Iranian historian, in his book titled “500 years history of Khuzestan” writes "but it is certain and there is proof for it that during the Parthian era Arab tribes were living in provinces of Kerman, Khuzestan, Bahrain and Fars". Kasravi refers to the Tabari history book, the first Muslim historian whose work is still universally accepted and writes ‘Aam (banu-Am tribe). This means during the Sasanid era, Iran had many kingdoms, of which Aghlim al-Ahwaz (province of al-Ahwaz) was one. Other historians such as Mohammad Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Batota and ibn Athir travel books as well as many other historians such as bin abi Yaaghobi, ibn Haghol, Estakhri, Nasser Khssrow, ibn Balkhi, el-Kamil, Habib al-Sair, Askendar Beg, Najm al molik Ghafari and others reference the existence of Indigenous Ahwazi Arabs in Eghlim (region) of al-Ahwaz or Arabistan, in one way or the other. So to say there are other ethnic groups live in Iran, it may be true but they are not indigenes to the area. In fact up to the discovery of oil in Khuzestan in 1908, the area was 100% was inhabited by indigenous Ahwazi-Arab tribes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alsaid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alsaid_f332.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alsaid">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Alsaid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alsaid_f332.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alsaid">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - The subject is noteworthy and is an issue of growing media interest due to human rights issues and unfounded claims by the Iranian regime that Western governments are responsible for unrest in the province. If there are concerns about the title, then it should be changed. A section is also needed on the province's Mandean community, which is also subjected to discrimination and state terrorism. But as the Arabs are the largest ethnic group, they naturally receive the most coverage. The issues go well beyond recent bomb attacks. Additionally, the article as it stands has 64 references, mostly Amnesty International but also including Bloomburg, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Al-Jazeera and other reliable news sources. Therefore, the claims of breaching <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> policies are questionable - indeed, this article is one of the most heavily referenced on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 21:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've no particular objections to this, only that the reason why the article was originally created was because it was decided by consensus that the Khuzestan article was getting too long. A separate article was created for the issues surrounding ethnic unrest in the province - not just the bombings, but also the geopolitical issues and human rights concerns. There have been other spin-offs from this article since then - eg <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a>, which goes into greater detail about claims of British involvement in the province's ethnic politics.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 23:18, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Or perhaps a new article on Ethnic Minority Rights in Iran, to cover all minorities? I don't really mind this, but I think it would be a mistake to put human rights issues under <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a> (which I think is more appropriate for historical and geographical data) or <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> (which should be anthropological rather than political).

The first point about ethnic groups in <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_0ebc.html" title="Human rights in Islamic Republic of Iran">Human rights in Islamic Republic of Iran</a> is valid - it should go there (as long as no OR) but not have its own article like "ethnic politics of so-and-so province". Thats OR. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 00:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just read the article, and I will change my opinion a little bit. I still think that the idea behind the article is valid, but I have to agree with Ahwaz that there might be something more than simple human rights issues.. I can also hear Khorshid's comments that some of the stuff about human rights can go into Human rights in Iran article, but I think that there is enough info about it that it could have its own article. But considering that there are some other issues talked about in the article, I think some other names could also be appropriate. I just proposed "human rights in.." because it is a quite universal word that can cover many things with subsequent sub-sections with different titles. So I don't know.. Depending on what other content can be added "human rights in khuzestan" or even the original name "ethnic conflict in Khuzestan" can be appropriate, I just thought that human rights could have been a less inflammatory compromise for a title. But the idea beneath is definitely valid in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 02:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never liked the title - it can be changed, in my opinion. One editor originally created the article as "ethnic conflict in Khuzestan" in order to put relevant content from the <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a> article in its own article, but there was consensus that this was too strong as there has never been a suggestion that there is communal violence between ethnic groups in the province. It was changed to "ethnic politics" without much thought. But no-one really knew a better alternative. It is more than a human rights issue, but indigenous grievances touch on the area's historical autonomy, inequality, linguistic rights, civil rights, geopolitics, etc.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 00:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why not just rename it <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a> (there are plenty of "politics of ..." articles on Wikipedia), so that wider political issues can be taken into account - including election results, political traditions, etc? I can see that just transferring the political stuff to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> will continue to generate problems, with users arguing that too much importance is paid to just Arabs and that Arabs are being defined solely in terms of opposition to the Iranian regime. Such issues are often more complex. Taking the "ethnic" element out of the title need not lead to the removal of current political content, but could broaden it to include broader issues. What do you think?--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 00:51, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You see problem there is Iran is not like USA where state/province has autonomy. Iran has strong centralised government and provinces do not have any kind of autonomy (we can argue that one or two have it but thats something else - khuzestan has no autonomy). All the political groups except one are separatist and based outside Iran and some of them are not even verifiable. So <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a> makes no sense because there is no autonomous poltical system and also there are no ordinary political groups of Khuzestan, just one that is Arab in Iran (has no power), one that is "pro-federalism" outside Iran, and the rest are separatist/terrorist. So they belong in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a>. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 01:18, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, I don't agree with the conflation of separatist and terrorist. I also think that there are political forces that are particular to Khuzestan - certain personalities, the way the place is governed due to its geographical and strategic significance, etc. While Iran is highly centralised, each province has a different set of political dynamics - this is what makes Iran, a highly diverse country, such a fascinating place. I think there should be articles on the politics of each major province and perhaps Khuzestan could be a good starting point.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 01:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would like to hear what other ppls have to say about that. My issue is that it will be mostly an Arab article with focus on south Khuzestan, like this one. In fact the only difference would be the change in titles. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 01:46, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not necessarily. The electoral politics and governorship of Khuzestan are not adequately covered by an ethnic focus. A broader article will make it less about ethnicity and more about politics, of which ethnicity plays just a part. Why not change the title to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a>, clean up the article and see whether the problems you have raised have been addressed. If there are still problems by 20 December (a month after the conclusion of this AfD), then open up a new AfD and we can look at other ways of organising the material.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 01:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> There can be no arguments for deletion for any article because of its shortness since we have many more shorter articles about fictional Pokemon and Star Wars characters and planets, so as long as the title is correct, there is no reason why any article couldn't exist. If there is a "main article - sub-article" relation with another article, the correct remedy is to introduce a few sentences in the main, then put a "see also: X" at the end of that section. POV issues can always be addressed in the article itself, and title should be NPOV, but deletion, no. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 03:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Doesn't meet WP:WEB, which says "The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it." A NY Times article would certainly suffice, but cites in online forums don't seem sufficient. Especially with only 501 Google hits.

<li><b>Keep</b> That it may ultimately include "thousands of entries" doesn't seem to be remotely confirmed or even plausible at this point.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Development hell is a real phenomenon, it's used as a reference to why so many films don't get made, and <i>Tales from Development Hell</i> is available on Amazon.

<li><b>Keep</b> Found and added numerous references to the notability of the phenomenon from Variety, the New York Times, and other mainstream sources. Most books or screenplays purchased do not become films, and some languish for 50 years. <b>Edit boldly</b> to remove randomly listed films and other works which do not have cites or which do not clarify and exemplify the concept and make the article encyclopedic, or which lack citations and are original research. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:51, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Excellent. Sometimes the only way to salvage an article is to bring it here.

<p>I'm sure they have delicious foods. Next time I go to Canada, I may even eat some. But due to the article claiming the company make its money by going round houses and selling their produce a la travelling salesmen, I henceforth feel that the CSFF is evil, and I must quash their attempts at getting famous. Hell, if I were in charge of a food company, I'd write myself a nice little article on Wikipedia too. Then ppl from as far away as Wales could find out about this evil company. EVIL. EVIL. It's claimed "their salespeople try to sell you a year's supply of meat and other food products along with a free deep freezer (yours to keep after re-signing for a second year) on the spot". And frankly, we can't have that. How intimidating of them, taking advantage of the poor Canadians' friendliness as willingness to spend money of stuff. I also urge you all to go to their [url=<a href="http://www.fsuniverse.net/forum/showthread.php?t=20788" class="external free" title="http://www.fsuniverse.net/forum/showthread.php?t=20788" rel="nofollow">http://www.fsuniverse.net/forum/showthread.php?t=20788</a>] forum] and say how dissatisfied you all are with them. I'm gonna go there, pretend I'm a Canadian lady with 3 kids, and slag them all off. You know why? Coz that is all I can do to put a stop to this nasty company.........oh, wait. We're trying to get the <b>article</b> deleted, not the actual company. You know, one day I hope to be able to delete companies as easily as deleting encyclopedia entries on companies.

<p>One of my favourite pages I've AFDed for a long time. I doubt that Wikipedia is the place to have cows. I would write a satirical page Wikipedia:I'm sorry, but we don't allow articles on models of cows, no matter how interesting they may be or WP:NOCOWS... Note to the closing admin.

<li><b>I strongly object to this AFD. Having read wikipedia's deletion criteria, I fail to see the grounds for deletion. Ths subject is a factual discussion of a serious work of art. the images are public domain, and the content is of wide interest to the communit</b>y. The problem here is that I havent had time yet to continue create the content - but I plan to demonstrate the intellectual property, techniques, evolution and and artistic history that is behind Gladys
<p>You see, gladys the swiss dairy cow is in fact a serious and very well known piece of ongoing performance art- having been created in over 50 forms and has appeared on television, been front page news widely circulated publications inclusing the Connecticut Post, on more than a dozen occations, and has been featured in two parades.</p>
<p>An article documenting her development, the artists creative methods and the overall artistic merit is at least as worthy of entry as any other artists work.</p>

I can appreciate that this is a longstanding family art tradition, but it is a family tradition nonetheless, and I don't see how this particular yard decoration is more notable than, say, my mom's neighbors who decorate their property with half a zillion watts of Christmas lights come December. The newspaper mentions are a good start but these appear to be fluff pieces, not an examination of Gladys as art (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires "multiple non-trivial published works").

<li>Uncle G - great comment - I'm really new to WIKI so trying to write the article while addresing wiki-guardians concerns is difficult in real time - especially since I have limited technical abilit in wiki.
<p>I'll investigate the proper refernce help - the current images posted to the AFD debate are designed to serve as proof points that the subject is notable, and have not yet been added to the actual content.</p>
<p>Bikeable and Aaron - the art is more than a family tradition, although you are correct in identifying it as being created by a family of artists. The piece has been featured in charity auctions, present at charity events ( most recently a haunted house/barnyard in Monroe, which was visited by more than 2,000 persons over three days - resulting in more than a ton of non-perishable food donations to a local soup kitchen. The artwork was the subject of an entry into West Haven CT's Cow Parade, and has also been widely photographed</p>
<p>Moreover, the ability to review, understand and perceive art is in itself relatively undefinable, as is the communication of a point of view on art - to you it may be fluff to have dozens of fromt page articles in connecticut papers - I'd disagree.</p>
<p>To my original point, Gladys is a work of art, just like every other piece listed in wikipedia. The details of the development and evolution of this art, the techniques, the outcomes, and the notability of this could very well serve as a living history of a one-day world-famous piece.</p>
<p>From a notability perspective as well, I can document more than two hundred written communications from art critics ( albeit amateur) and recognition by local officals as proof of wide interest and merit. In fact, a float with Gladys as a centerpiece was awarded "Best Appearing Float, Services Club" by the Town of Fairfield's memorial day commitee in 2004 and a similar entry with gladys won "honorable mention in 2005.</p>
<p>So, all in all, an ongoing piece of performance art is definetly more than a once a year christmas display, (although gladys has been a christmas tree complete with an outline of lights)</p>
<p>Just because the topic is light hearted, doesn't mean it is not of encyclopaedic quality.</p>
<p>Give me some time to prove this please.--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.lebinski_2692.html" title="User:James.lebinski">James.lebinski</a> 16:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You have at least until the AFD discussion period ends, as pointed out above.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unfortunately, all these references etc. seem to be local. There are many millions of works of art that are notable purely on a local scale. Merely having been featured on the front page of one's local newspaper cannot qualify something for inclusion in an international encyclopedia. If this is a work of art that has the potential to become famous but is not, in fact, famous <i>now</i>, then unfortunately we simply cannot include it now. When it has <i>become</i> at least nationally recognised, yes, but at present I must regretfully say that I'm not convinced this meets the criteria.

I believe that this passes the multiple non-trivial sources test, and further believe that haleth;'s e notion that a "notability" threshold must be national is flawed. The combined circulation/audience of the publications cited approached one hundred thousand - which is substantial notability. Moreover, while I haven;t actiallu counted the words used to describe this art in the publications, my estimate is that each published article has been between 1000 and 3000 words. There was a professional photographer at my home last evening taking pictures for yet another newspaper arcticle to be rune before christmas so I said potential to be "world famous" . The art is already famous in Connecticut.</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm not quite sure what to make of this one. On one hand, it looks like it might be mainly of local interest, though a claim to statewide noteworthiness has been made. On the other... it's a quirky article, but it's treated in some depth, and with references. It certainly appears to pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. It is <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">interesting</a>. Is it important? We have no guidelines specifically for physical works of art, but taking <a href="../../../f/i/l/WP%7EFILMS_131b.html" title="WP:FILMS">WP:FILMS</a> as an example, it could arguably pass the "subject of multiple non-trivial published works" criterion, and it's also had multiple exhibitions in different parts of the state. Finally, effort is clearly being made to continue to improve the article. In the face of all that, and lacking any strong reason for deletion, I say keep it for now and see how it develops. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 00:23, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep it civil Calton</b> The fact that you do not regard this as a performance art is clear, but there is a saying " de gustibus non-disputandum est" or in English - there is no accounting for taste. A significant number of others disagree with your position.</p>
<p>To the facts/policies here - I have offered proof of wide interest, significant notabiilty and and circulation, and this is in fact an ongoing piece of performance art - so if you would like to debate the facts about that according to Wiki policy, or back up your assertion that the largest circulating newspaper in Southern Ct is "hometown" , or that coverage on the largest cable network in Connecticut is insignificant then lets have that converrsation.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> if verified. This looks and reads far different from the usual vanity trivia; it doesn't sell a PoV; it may be of local/regional interest as opposed to world-wide, but I can understand how it could gravitate towwards wider notability. And as is it's well-enough written, that I doubt as good a job could be done swiftly, if it becomes world-famous. If the final decision is <i>"delete"</i>, may I suggest that it be ported to the author's User page, so that he can archive it, before salting the earth. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:13, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s><b>SPEEDY KEEP</b> I have put this article before AFD to hopefully avoid a revert-war occuring between editors. I came across this article on AN/I where it seems it has had a hot past. I have cleaned it up and feel it is now the descriptive type of article that we have on wikipedia. It needs expanding but it's a real-world product launched by two significant companies. Sadly it is not featured in a pokomon game (which seems to be the criteria for a speedy keep) However another editor feels that it should be CSD and keeps adding the template. Hopefully by thrashing it out we can put a stop to this here and now. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 13:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>Questionable notability. The awards smell fishy because two of the awards are for <i>next year</i>: "For 2007, F&amp;R was ranked #16 (tie) on the AveryIndex's list of the Top 25 Prestigious Firms to Work For [1], a ranking that accounts for both firm prestige and associate satisfaction. [...] For 2007, F&amp;R was ranked #17 on the "Best 20 Law Firms to Work For" by Vault [3].".

<li>A very likely <b>keep</b> per above and about 1.4m ghits. However, I can appreciate the nominator's concerns about the article in the state it was in before the Prod. And if it is contested, process dictates in a round-about way that it appear here for wider exploration. Maybe confusing for those who work outside the law (figuratively speaking), and I probably would have done the same. The fact that another editor expressed concerns was also instrumental in the article's appearance here. Further to that, it's amazing how a Prod can improve an article (usually by the original author) to a state that is semi-respectable. Also, I don't believe the nominator entered a "vote", as stated "like some wider input".

<li><b>Comment</b> There are plenty of people and things, even obscure ones, from that era that generate reams of Google hits. This article is linkless because the editors who wrote the articles on Marland, Marland Oil, sauerkraut, and even <a href="../../../p/o/n/Ponca_City%2C_Oklahoma_76de.html" title="Ponca City, Oklahoma">Ponca City, Oklahoma</a> apparently didn't think he was important enough to mention (if there were mentions, I'd have fixed the redlinks) - except perhaps a note under Ponca City, I can't see how you'd find an excuse to shoehorn Mr. McCaskey into the other articles without getting into a lot deeper detail than a Wikipedia article normally does. The references cited are, other than the Marland biography, weak IMHO, lots of people get local paper mentions and directory mentions. BTW, speaking of Ponca City, someone should write an article on the <a href="http://www.kaycounty.info/101_ranch/101_frame.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kaycounty.info/101_ranch/101_frame.htm" rel="nofollow">101 Ranch</a> <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 19:49, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Based on my research thus far, I expect the primary difference between this man and his contemporaries is that this gentleman died early, before he was pressured by estate tax laws to establish charities and foundations in his name to secure a legacy. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 20:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> pending cleanup. I'm not sure that the references listed suggest that he was the <i>subject</i> of the publications; in several of them he almost certainly was only mentioned and not featured as the primary subject; which would not satisfy the criterion mentioned by truthbringer. None of the references have McCaskey's name in the title or allude to the reference being primarily about him, so notability on the basis of that criterion is up in the air in my mind. Regardless, this is a substantive article that has at least made significant inroads to establishing notability of its subject within the article. It badly needs cleanup to look more encyclopedic and less like a personal essay. Hopefully, the original editor comes back around to address these concerns, because no one other editors are around that really seem to know anything about this guy. <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 18:11, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This movement does not exist. It's the brainchild of one rabbi in one synagogue in the Bronx, NY. There is no media or scholarly coverage of this movement outside of the movement itself, which must, of course, be excluded. Besides, not having any clear boundaries between orthodox, modern orthodox, open orthodox (go figure...) this article serves as an unhelpful, unmergable vehicle for the promotion of the religious musings of Rabbi Weiss and/or creator user:Shirahadasha. Which is good, but it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. To reiterate, I don't think merging this anywhere is a good idea. The Rabbi is borderline notable, but his ideas don't belong here. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for things invented in synagogue one day. <b>Delete</b>. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 13:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Shirahadasha, just to be clear, are you voting for <b>keep</b>? <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 17:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep'</b> Firstly, this article meets the standard criteria in terms of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and sufficient material for a stand-alone article. Secondly, the nomination raises a red herring -- it says there is no evidence of the existence of a "movement". But the article describes it as a philosophy, not a movement. And philosophies are often associated with their founding philosophers, so long as the philosophies are themselves independently notable. As additional evidence of more widespread use in addition to the press coverage, see also e.g. <a href="http://www.ostt.org/pdfs/0607Brochure.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ostt.org/pdfs/0607Brochure.pdf" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://www.hiwp.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hiwp.org" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://www.discoversydney.com.au/things/synagogue.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discoversydney.com.au/things/synagogue.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, <a href="http://www.bethjacobatlanta.org/?page_id=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bethjacobatlanta.org/?page_id=20" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. This has attracted enough attention and followers to be legitimately more than something specific to Avi Weiss and to be an approach a substantial number of individuals and congregations subscribe to. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 07:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"This process has resulted in the development of open orthodoxy whereby adherents to halakhah (Jewish law) re-engage both with secular studies, Jews of all denominations and global issues. This movement has its own rabbinic school in New York, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah. Some within this movement have experimented with orthodox egalitarianism where gender equality solutions are found through halakhah. This has led to women taking on more leadership roles. Others in this movement are increasingly re-engaging with social justice issues from a halakhic point of view." No. This is trivial to support an article on a new religion. Any books written on it by anyone outside the movement? - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 15:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> <b>Redirect</b> into Avi Weiss and keep all the material in the Open Orthodoxy article as part of Avi Weiss. Rabbi Weiss is very notable and Open Orthoodxy is notable but the ideology is entirely by one person, one author, and one director Avi Weiss. If, and when, they produce other authors and thinkers then it should become its own article. Or if they hold a convention that brings all the fellow travelers of ideology under one tent, then it is notable as Open Orthoodxy. Or when they form their own Rabbinical association. Right now, it is still a one person show. YCT has not produced any notable graduates yet. The movement does indeed exist, and is notable, but is entirely STILL linked to one single person. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 16:34, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I find crz much too biased on this one, using inflamitory language of "new relgion" givng his owe definitions of Orthodoxy. Yes, Open Orthodoxy is being discussed at the GA as we type, and is regualrly featured in the Federation Jewish papers. It is certainly more notable and less advocacy than the many many kiruv outreach rabbis who have pages on WIKI. They only have press coverage when they buy ads or put out their own self promotion. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 17:01, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Though it is a fledgling movement in Judaism, it is developing. Yeshivat Chovevei Torah only started ordaining people a few years ago, give it time. I know rabbis from this movement I also know that many Modern Orthodox disparage them and the movement. It is distinct from Modern Orthodoxy and other Jewish movements, and is distinct from its creator, Rabbi Avi Weiss. It deserves its own page. I, by the way, am not part of the Open Orthodoxy movement just so you don't think there is a POV motivation here. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 17:11, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hehe, no, I've never heard of it. Besides, not being modern orthodox, I am not exposed to the disparagement of the movement. I've never heard of it. Asserting that it's a distinct movement does not make it so. That YCT has only started ordaining people - give it a few year - is a good argument for deletion. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 17:42, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is little to disntinguish most members of the Edah Charadis from each other, and there is nothing to seperate them from their schools.

<li>Surely you're joking, Jayrav? I am not disagreeing that Avi Weiss may be a visionary of Modern Orthodoxy, but no member of the Edah Chareidis claims to have started a new Jewish movement. Obviously all Charedi rabbis deserve their own articles like Avi Weiss does, and some even deserve special pages on their philosophy (e.g. <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah_im_Derech_Eretz_1d79.html" title="Torah im Derech Eretz">Torah im Derech Eretz</a></i>, which is of enormous religious &amp; social significance and 200 years older than Open Orthodoxy). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 14:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Star Awards has an article for the fact that it is <i>the</i> most prominent award in the Singaporean mass entertainment arena. That it is basically a "self-rewarding" award does little to dent its avid following and the buzz it generates amongst the masses. May I just point out that "Star Awards" itself may not garner plenty of sources online, because it is actually the English name of an award for Chinese-language productions.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:23, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Star Awards is like the Emmy of Singapore. It is the highest category of television awards in the country, and has been a very popular event in the Chinese television scene.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I concur that the current presentation does look unweldy, and I appeal for ideas on how to better present the facts. Keeping individual articles for each year's awards was one way to keep the information sanely manageable, so perhaps we may wish to keep the non-redirect ones for now.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 15:38, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It might be a good idea to remove the table from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Awards_a812.html" title="Star Awards">Star Awards</a> and keep information about winners on the individual pages, and have the main page just contain text about the awards, but not the winners (perhaps just naming a few who've won a lot)? --<a href="../../../l/i/j/User%7ELijnema_e954.html" title="User:Lijnema">Lijnema</a> 16:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The awards seem well-known enough to warrant this article.

<p>This is definitely not the worst article in Wikipedia, and it contains some useful information. However, it is written in the style of a travel guide, and would thus be more appropriated for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a>. I don't know the exact criteria, but the general idea is that Wikipedia collects objective information without providing how-to guides for travelers. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 15:55, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This parallels an incident in England where a supermarker development successfully blocked a main rail rine, when the cut+cover tunnel collapsed. A structural engineer might be abel to say whether there's mileage in an article about supermarkets destroying local transport links, but I'd say this is a news-issue, not a famous landslide -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:24, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- it already is famous. I acknowledge the perspectives above, and that the entry may need revision. However, with respect to those reviewers, a superficial glance will grossly underestimate the severity and importance of this event. I live hundreds of miles/several states distant, but have noted the circumstances being evaluated in legal, land use, and commercial development circles both online and offline (not to mention among pro- and anti- Wal-Mart and community advocates). The developer aggressively sought and received waivers of various local zoning requirements over many months. As a direct result, some 500,000 cubic yards of stone and soil collapsed onto a major state thoroughfare, closing it for nearly two weeks -- along with high-volume tracks of Norfolk Southern. Had the collapse occurred only a few months later -- say, during the development's grand opening, with dignitaries and possibly thousands of citizens on site -- its Wikipedia footprint might have rivaled that of the 9/11 events in New York. As a legal, land use, and engineering point of reference, we can only hope the Kilbruck slide will have few equals in the coming century. Attorneys, planning professionals, elected officials, and others in growing numbers will be searching for context. That's how I arrived here today! Gstock 15:58, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It seems to me that it clearly meets at least criteria 1.5 with links to two prominent Mississippi papers listed on the page and probably 1.7 due to their activity and success in their community <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">WP:MUSIC</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">User:anonymous</a> 15:45, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I attended school with the members of the band and live in Ocean Springs, where they are all from. They are very active in the community. I served with the members on the board to create an annual music festival in Ocean Springs. Proof of the festival's existence can be found here: <a href="http://festival.oceanspringsmusic.com/" class="external free" title="http://festival.oceanspringsmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://festival.oceanspringsmusic.com/</a>.

There's no reason whatsoever for this article to be deleted as they are clearly very notable, if only in Mississippi. Futhermore, The River Company has a large fan base located across the entire Gulf Coast and everything in the article is fact. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael.m.winters_dff8.html" title="User:Michael.m.winters">Michael.m.winters</a> 17:43, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just because an article links to non-notable things doesn't mean it is itself non-notable. If you disagree, let me have a respectable article in sandbox-mode for 1 day: I'll fill it wth red-links, and you can AfD the result, and see what people think. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:25, 16 November 2006 (UTC) (who klnows nothing about the band)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's not like other booster/vanity/advertising pages, but the claim is unverified and it lacks the information of a proper corp page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the article needs a tidy I agree but it's not non-notable. Several references can be found stating it's the leading online financial accounting solution in Europe with currently up to 20,000 (depending on source and date of source) subscribers. If these are true, and they are mentioned in several different sources including many prestigious titles in the industry area, how can it be non-notable? Just because you haven't heard of something or know nothing about it doesn't mean it's non-notable. I knew practically nothing about the product, other than it existed, but have done some searching and it is definitely notable. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 07:25, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

In fact the site has won a pretigious award, <a href="http://www.whatpc.co.uk/accountancyage/features/2168759/awards-2006-goodman-jones-best" class="external text" title="http://www.whatpc.co.uk/accountancyage/features/2168759/awards-2006-goodman-jones-best" rel="nofollow">Accountancy Age</a> awarded it "Best use of internet" for it's benefits to the SME community.

<li>Although a published author, Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet doesn't seem to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s standard of "published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". I don't think that mere quotes (of which we have no sources) qualify as reviews, and another Wikipedia article can hardly be a reliable source for notability purposes.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was just browsing your wiki and not only is it a great idea but I can tell that a fair amount of work has already been put into it. Also it is a great example of how to avoid gamecruft here on Wikipedia. But Wikipedia gets millions of visitors and we have to be strict about these policies even when our hearts tell us otherwise. Not because of you but because of the many many sites that will argue against their own justified exclusion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 19:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Kudos MartinDK</b>, your a competent admin, I'm confused when by you saying I failed to assume good faith (I am aware it is a wikipedia principle and I all assumed you were all well intentioned), so I don't quite know how to reply to it. Darklordabc 20:11, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Although Wikicheat is a really great idea and has great <i>potential</i> to grow into a well-known resource for game players, it hasn't been around long enough to become <i><b>notable</b></i>. In the future I hope that it will grow to a prominent stature. When that happens it will be appropriate to make a Wikipedia article about it. But it needs more time. It's not ready to be in an encyclopedia yet. Good luck to the people at Wikicheat and all the best. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 21:50, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested speedy. From the opening -This essay aims to outline- right through the numerous opinions until we reach the closing -Written by Deniz Gencturk- this is pure original research <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 19:09, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite, wikify, and cite sources properly. This is a research paper, but it's not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. It did not make up the term "timar"; it cites 9 (non-English, albeit) secondary sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> From <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <i>Original research is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source</i>. This isn't original research as somebody just copy-pasted their term paper (which includes, assumably, reliable sources) and called it an article. Also, the article as it is presently was recently edited to include Mr. Gencturk's homework assignment; look at the history and you'll find a much briefer and more encyclopedic description of Timar. I'm reverting the page to that version until the additional information added can be appropriately reworded and wikified. <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 21:43, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> now that the term-paper side of things has been deleted. The term is (as other users have pointed out) an accurate one and one which is often used for the land tenure system of the Ottoman Empire. Yes, a longer article that isn't a term paper would be just lovely, but this version is a good start. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:12, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Don't understand this nomination. Subject of obvious historical importance, and if someone adds some unsourced statements or original research, that can be reverted or cleaned up.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> <i>for now</i>, per nom. I've heard about it through the grapevine, but it's still just gossip at this point.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -It is a widely reported story in the news, and currently has almost 2,000 Google news hits, even before the publication. If anything, the article should be expanded to include the reaction in the publishing industry, as well as the greater public. And this is not speculation. As well as being on the news, the book is listed on the Harper Collins website <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061238284/If_I_Did_It/index.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061238284/If_I_Did_It/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>.Additionally, I think it should be linked to--but not merged with--the article about Simpson and the murders he committed. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 22:48, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even when it wasn't "certain" to take place, the "speculation (was) well documented," as noted in all the arguments listed above. "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CBAL" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>" is in place to prevent original research, which this article is not.--<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 23:23, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Crystal Ball policy says, <i>Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place.</i> This book/TV special is almost certain to take place as the events are highly advertised and the release of the book is all but a certainity (It has probably already been shipped.) This book has already had numerous reviews and will almost certainly be a NY Times Best Seller (but such a prediction is using a crystal ball.)<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 23:35, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The book is scheduled to go on sale in just over 2 weeks. A good portion of the article is cited even. Granted there could be some editing to remove some original research but I don't know how much more positive we need to be that this will be released. I'm not understanding the nomination even. How is the book "non-existant"? If someone reported that OJ Simpson might be writing a book in the future, that's non-existant. If major news outlets and the publisher speaking about a book scheduled to be released in two weeks along with a major promotional television appearance doesn't make a book "existant" then what is existant?Hammy 00:14, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't believe in expired notability, that once a subject is notable, it is always notable. If not, 1/2 of the bios on this site should be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b> - fair point so let me expand. I don't think that there was anything notable about this mall; it was just a fairly large mall. <i>However</i>, there is an argument that a large <i>open</i> mall merits an article because it provides information to people who might visit it. Naturally, that rationale no longer applies and there seems no reason to keep the article. I have added a reference to the mall in the locality article at <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livonia%2C_Michigan_d5dc.html" title="Livonia, Michigan">Livonia, Michigan</a> and that seems sufficient. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:58, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - once notable, always notable. So I do not agree with the nomination that this mall is losing its notability by being demolished. Intead, it is now simply historic notability. The article does state that this is was the first mal built in the city, but gives no sources, which is why i'm making this a weak keep. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 22:29, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The bulk of this article is dedicated to what stores were in the mall and why the mall ultimately failed.

<li><b>Delete</b> Show me one reference that shows this ex-mall is notable today. Just as something can be not notable and later reach notability, something can be notable(barely, if at all in this case) and then later slip in to a lack of notability(for example ceasing to exist).

<li><b>Keep</b> and rewrite for NPOV and WP:V. If this article is to be kept, Chinese and Korean influence in US elections should be included as well, not just US influence on other countries. It should not include foreign events that influence elections (e.g. terrorist attacks) but explicit influence like funding opposition parties or assassinating candidates. The phenomenon itself is certainly notable and there's lots of verifiable evidence of it, but this article is poorly written as is. Remember, the AfD process is not the place to address such things -- poorly written articles on notable topics should be rewritten, not AfD'd.-<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:43, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

In Bolivia people felt that Venezuelan President Chavez' open support for Morales was interference. But if public comments and opinions by foreigners are interference then Blair's expression of support for Bush would count. And what about EU support for national referenda?

<p>As much as I love Gad's, individual college clubs aren't really appropriate to include as individual articles. (We've deleted plenty of newspapers, GSAs, etc. before.)

<p>Contested PROD candidate. I believe this article is a hoax. I can find no mention of a notable Justin Giroux anywhere, or of the group "Ordo Ab Mors" that he is supposed to be a member of. When the article creator was asked for a reference, he added the external link. Unfortunately, the website does not contain Mr. Giroux's name anywhere that I can see. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyous%21_8a6f.html" title="User:Joyous!">Joyous!</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoyous%21_ed0e.html" title="User talk:Joyous!">Talk</a> 23:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't anyone say "all schools are inherently notable", because that simply isn't the case. What we have here is a school which fails to assert notability. That it exists is proven by Google, but there's nothing notable about it.

I know this doesn't meet any actual "speedy" criteria, but we should just avoid this debate, which could very easily aggravate many editors (myself included).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. FamilySearch.org is a very well known site among genealogists, and has many useful tools for anyone, even those who are not LDS.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Although FamilySearch is referenced/discussed in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">Genealogy</a> article, the site's name is well known to genealogists online and would be a natural search at Wikipedia. Sure, it's an LDS site, and uses LDS references, but the site and its associated physical library have broad use by genealogists of all categories because of its vast stores of information. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 20:02, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is conditional. I believe the article needs to be rewritten with the main focus on genealogy. This may evolve into a future merge or expansion. The sponsor of the site should not be in the introductory paragraph. The value of the article is easily apparent to anyone that any degree of interest in researching one's roots. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:12, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Not "mormoncruft". Sure, the LDS church proselysizes heavily in their communities, but having been a non-LDS volunteer at one of their largest family history centers for ten years, I have never heard any proselytizing to genealogists. Yes, the article can mention the church provides financial and technical support (somebody had to be reponsible for this free database), but I don't consider the discrete links to their main church site at the side or bottom of the FamilySearch site proselytizing. <a href="../../../g/u/l/User%7EGUllman_5e88.html" title="User:GUllman">GUllman</a> 23:01, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, however I also do think that the primary focus of the article should be strengthened, demonstrating more clearly how this site contributes to genealogy and the general genealogical comunity; it should most definitely not be allowed to devolve into a myopic "here's another something Mormons do" belly-navel contemplating article. Also it would be much better if a large portion (a majority if possible) of the references cited should be from non-LDS sources. I think that Trödel has a good start above; anyone care to start adding some of that to the article itself? -- <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishUtah_190e.html" title="User:FishUtah">FishUtah</a> 02:57, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>insider comment</b> We've been working on the next version for a few years now. Currently we have about 75 software engineers on the project, approaching a second beta test cycle for version 0.9 of what we are calling internally "new FamilySearch". Version 0.9 will have limited access, but when we finally release version 1.0, this is going to be <b>HUGE</b> in the world of genealogy. This article, if deleted now, will resurface in a big way. Ever hear of petabyte-sized databases?&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/d/User%7EWadsworth_1cbe.html" title="User:Wadsworth">Wadsworth</a> 23:05, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of the most useful websites, along with rootsweb.com, and the New York Times archive, for writing biographies for Wikipedia. It has good access to original documents and there is no charge to use it. Is there such a thing as "CruftCruft" yet? That's where by deriding everything as cruft, the concept of cruft becomes useless. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 20:41, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
