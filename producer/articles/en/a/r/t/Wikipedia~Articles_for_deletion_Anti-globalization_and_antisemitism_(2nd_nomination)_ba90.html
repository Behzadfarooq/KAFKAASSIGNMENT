<li><b>Comment</b> I'm also not seeing too much NPOV there, but I'm still pretty iffy about keeping the article. As it is, it does seem like a soapbox article, and it reads a lot like a personal essay. If it's kept at all, I think it should be renamed Debate about anti-globalization and anti-semitism as suggested on the talk page -- and it needs a major rewrite, avoiding <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWeasel_words_17d9.html" title="WP:Weasel words">weasel words</a> ("some writers have argued"...)

<li><b>Comment</b> I took the time to read over the article's references. Many of them say little or nothing about the anti-globalization movement; their focus is on "the left" in general. In the Naomi Klein article, the anti-Semitism angle is focused on the presence of Jean-Marie Le Pen, who showed up to at an anti-World Bank/IMF rally. But Le Pen is a far right-winger; he was there for the "free Palestine" rally, not the anti-globalization rally. The Toronto NOW article (<a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-03-18/news_story6.php" class="external free" title="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-03-18/news_story6.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-03-18/news_story6.php</a>), talks about the possible link between anti-Semitism and some of those who are opposed to the American neo-cons. It says nothing about any link between anti-globalization and anti-Semitism, except that it mentions a prominent anti-WTO activist who <i>condemned</i> an allegedly anti-Semitic Adbusters article. Doesn't exactly support your thesis, does it? And the references from FrontPage and Mark Strauss are inherently biased sources: FrontPage and Strauss' "Foreign Policy" journal are furiously PRO-globalization. If anything, the references provided for the article weaken, not strengthen, any argument for retention. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R. Hercules">J.R.

The article is NPOV by default. But even if some forced "balance" of opposing viewpoints were to be stringently applied in this case, it still wouldn't undo the overwhelming reality that the article itself exists as an utterly unencyclopediac point/counterpoint exchange of viewpoints. And that's classifying the article in the most charitable fashion I can think of; it's clear that there's a political, not scholarly, agenda underlying the article. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm curious as to why you say the article's references are "well cited to established, reliable publications." Did you check the references out? If you did, you would have found that most of them don't even talk about any alleged link between anti-globalization and anti-semitism. A few of them do: 1) an archived 1999 opinion piece from an obscure Dutch group's website; 2) a hit-piece from the conservative <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontpagemag.com.html" title="Frontpagemag.com">frontpagemag.com</a> site; and 3) Mark Strauss' article for <i>Foreign Policy</i> journal -- a journal whose very existence is based on the pro-globalization stance (which hardly qualifies it as an unbiased source for an encyclopedia article's information, especially for this particular encyclopedia article.) <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R.

<li>Did you actually read those references? The Naomi Klein piece has her specifically saying the following: "The globalization movement isn’t anti-Semitic..." And yet, the Klein article was cited by a dishonest Wiki editor as an example of a link between anti-globalism and anti-Semitism? And the editor's rationale for making this connection? Why, Naomi Klein is "one of the leaders of the anti-globalization movement". Therefore, uh, there's a connection between anti-globalism and anti-Semitism (sarcasm). <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R. Hercules">J.R.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> for now since there appears to be a good effort at cleaning this up and adding sources. The first line of the article is in desperate need of a rewrite however, <i>"Some writers and researchers have argued that there is rising acceptance of antisemitism within the anti-globalization movement"</i> screams of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with the main anti-semitism page. I'm not really sure this type of articles merits its own article. Yes, we are aware that there is a trend towards anti-semitism in some sectors of the global left, and that obviously, with some of these people also in the anti-globalization movement, this trend migrates to the latter movement. Again, this goes into what does and does not constitute an article on its own merit. I would argue for a section on secular anti-semitism to be created in the main anti-semitism page, whereby it could be made more congruent with the main article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Prince_Manifest_a6ca.html" title="User:The Prince Manifest">The Prince</a> 10:03, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Commentary</b> At this point, it would be useful to include some historical context regarding this article. Almost two years ago, it was subject to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-globalization_and_Anti-Semitism_05b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism">another Afd challenge</a>. One of the principal defenders of the article from two years ago? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a>, who's back to lobby once again for the article's retention. This is what SlimVirgin has to say <b>today</b> in defense of keeping the article:</li>
<li><i>"Keep. The page isn't well written, but there are reliable, scholarly sources available who explicitly address this issue, and who can be added to improve it."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>"Comment. I've tidied it a little and added some more material."</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now contrast SlimVirgin's current remarks with what she said <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-globalization_and_Anti-Semitism_05b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism">two years ago during the first Afd challenge</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Note: the article has been tidied and references have been added. The allegations are certainly notable: for example, there's an article about the issue on a website run by Yale University."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>Keep. This does seem to be a legitimate topic judging by Google searches. I've tidied it up a bit, have added a couple of extra sources, have found links for the quotes already there, and have added a references section. The article needs to be expanded, and examples should be given of actions or statements by anti-globalization protestors that are regarded by others as anti-Semitic.</i>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it's nearly two full years later, and the "tidying up" from the first time around has turned into..."tidying up". If the article merely had to be "tidied up" two years ago, and yet its defenders are <b>still</b> saying that all that needs to be done is to apply some "tidying up", just how viable of an article could this be? <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R.

<dd>Yes, she significantly improved it in April 2005, and improved it even more now. I can only surmise that you were making your comments to thank SlimVirgin for her tireless efforts to improve Wikipedia articles. It's becoming one of Wikipedia's best articles - no doubt that's why the discussion here is even more strongly in favour of keeping the article than in April 2005. If only the early commenters who almost unanimously voted "Delete" could have seen the article in its current condition, I'm sure the non-politically motivated among them would have voted quite differently - one can see how the trend has changed on this, concurrent with SlimVirgin's diligent work. Of course, Wikipedia articles are always a work in progress - no doubt someone will come along one day and improve it even more - odds are that person will again be SlimVirgin, she seems dedicated to actually helping Wikipedia, rather than just pushing a political agenda. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:44, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hercules, the reason my first attempt at tidying petered off was that I was confronted by editors who were trying to slant the article to imply there is no antisemitism in the movement, so I gave up and took the wretched thing off my watchlist. The only reason I returned was that I saw it was up for deletion again. This happens a lot around these articles — people try to fix them but get discouraged by the shenanigans. Aren't you glad your nomination led to its finally being improved and (it appears) kept? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
