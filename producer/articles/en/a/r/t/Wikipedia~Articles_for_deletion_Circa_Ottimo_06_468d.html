<li>Putting aside the question of football club notablity for a second, lets look at <i>this</i> article. The info box states that they play on the "Grand Old Smith Field", yet the article states they will begin play at the "'Turf City Complex' in Wayne, NJ". "Grand Old Smith Field" gives no google hits, and I found only one 1 hit for a Turf City Complex in Singapore. I found the name of one of the other teams (Corgodayo FC) here <a href="http://www.bracketmaker.com/tmenu.cfm?tid=45276&amp;tclass=NNJSC" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bracketmaker.com/tmenu.cfm?tid=45276&amp;tclass=NNJSC" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but the other teams seemed to be high schools (like <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_Catholic_High_School_848b.html" title="Bergen Catholic High School">Bergen Catholic High School</a>). This would preclude the "semi-professional" status of the team, since it is unlikely that a high school level team would pay its players. There are other inaccuracies as well, but I think by this point it is clear that this is absolutely unverifiable thereby rendering any notablity debate moot. <b>Strong Delete</b> - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 05:58, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>first of all, grand old smith field is in Saddle Brook, NJ. It is our practice field, because Turf City Complex is an indoor complex in Wayne NJ, there are no home and away games. and i dont know what your talking about, go to Google, type in "Turf City" and its the first link Flaninthefacerh 19:30, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> looking at <a href="http://turfcity.us/index.html" class="external text" title="http://turfcity.us/index.html" rel="nofollow">the Turf City website</a> it is an indoor multi-use public sports centre where, by the look of things, small-sided football matches take place. This would suggest that the team is not in fact "semi professional" but rather an amateur hobby team playing in a local league, and there's no certainly no comparison with <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_United_of_Manchester_4bdb.html" title="FC United of Manchester">FC United of Manchester</a>, who average somewhere in the region of 3,000 paying spectators to home matches. Best of luck with the team, lads, but I fear it doesn't qualify for a WP article <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 09:21, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>i understand that, but i just don't understand what you guys are trying to say about us. if your worried that this is some kind of joke, its not. for one thing it has cost $1000 to be signed into the league. i don't know what a "noteworthy" thing is, but if our soccer team is not, then I am confused. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Flaninthefacerh (<a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlaninthefacerh_45d7.html" title="User talk:Flaninthefacerh">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Flaninthefacerh_1f63.html" title="Special:Contributions/Flaninthefacerh">contribs</a>) 18:09, 23 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>If you were able to direct editors to coverage of your club which fits the above description (has there been any coverage of the team in local newspapers which you could cite, for example?), that would go a long way towards being able to satisfy the notability guidelines. As it is, though, all we know from the article is that Circa Ottimo is a new football team in an un-named league which has yet to actually play a match. There isn't anything currently in the article to indicate that anyone outside the squad itself has ever even heard of the team, and for that reason it fails the notability test as it stands. Hope this helps! <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 08:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
