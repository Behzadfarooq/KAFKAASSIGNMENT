<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> Patent nonsense. Firstly "voidism" is not a Buddhist belief. A Google search of "Buddhism Voidism" (ommiting wikipedia.org) brings about 532 hits. A look through a World Religions textbook (Schmidt, R, Sager G, Carney G, et al. (2005). <i>Patterns of Religion</i>. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.) gives nothing. A tenuously similar Buddhist concept, <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunyata.html" title="Shunyata">Shunyata</a>, meaning "emptiness" or "voidness", which yields 50,400 Google hits (again, ommiting wikipedia.org) and is located in aforementioned textbook. It seems to be used in a Buddhist sense by those who don't know the Sanskrit term.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Of the two citations found in the Voidism article itself, the hyperlink reference is stated in the Voidism article to be "academically well-known" is a link to a GeoCities cite. While the author does appear to have some connection to [ <a href="http://www2.creighton.edu/Creighton" class="external free" title="http://www2.creighton.edu/Creighton" rel="nofollow">http://www2.creighton.edu/Creighton</a> University], I find it odd that it is hosted on a GeoCities rather than the University's website. Furthermore, it seems to be an academic essay, but the essay itself cites no other work. Spelling mistakes and made-up terms do not lend to its credibility, either. The second citation appears to have been copied from the citations from Buddhism. As I stated above, I did not find voidism used in a Buddhist religious context in <i>Patterns of Religion</i>, and I doubt that it will be found in the cited book, though I have no way of making sure.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The "shunya" is a Sanskrit term literally meaning "void", and is a synonym for "zero" - you may consult Georges Ifrah's "Universal History of Numbers" or simply google define it, or look it up anywhere. In that particular book, which rests upon much original research into the history of numerical concepts, and 0 itself - the most important of all - Buddhism is inextricably linked as the most prominent of early mystical philosophies of the void. Mahayana Buddhism, specifically through Nagarjuna, espouses the void to be all that can exist, and that form of Buddhism leans extremely towards nihilism in its solely-void belief. Shunyavadin (voidists) is a validly wide-used term to describe Buddhists, of every existing sect - as is shunyavada, which literally translates as "voidism" - and Nirvana is defined as the void, which is asserted as Buddhism's ultimate reality, the "true world", in Nagarjuna's terms; thus its Buddhist connection with shunya/shunyata, void/voidness is entirely accurate, from whatever reference; in fact, it seems a lesser known - yet well-established - connection, thus justifying such an article's creation. As for the connections with 0 and mathematics, they seem entirely valid, and I'd presume since Creighton is a catholic institution, they probably would be less inclined to host a voidist essay on a university website; the essay seems entirely valid as well. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by HelloThere1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HelloThere1_7bfc.html" title="Special:Contributions/HelloThere1">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunyata.html" title="Shunyata">Shunyata</a>, if you read the article correctly, is not anywhere close to nihilism. In fact, the lead states that Buddhist doctrine considers nihilism a deusion. The article is not about voidism as a Buddhist concept. The article is about how the void equates to 0. If it was about void as a Buddhist concept, I would have simply said delete and redirect to Shunyata. However, it is not. It appears, as I said above, to be patent nonsense. Furthermore, there is aboslutely no reason why a Catholic, or any religiously affiliated institution cannot publish a scholarly paper that talks about other religions. The paper itself, as I pointed out above, cites no other work and is not of the greatest quality. The only connection it has to Creighton University is that the author has an email account at creighton.edu. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">Lim</a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_Esperanza_b9a2.html" title="User:Limetom/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b><i>e</i></b></font></a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">tom</a> 21:24, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The philosophy is entirely valid; the connection to Buddhism has been entirely established. Obviously the subject is a larger extension of the concept of voidism as an ontology superseding its limit to Buddhism, although that particular philosophy is cited as a prominent example . . . the void is a universal concept, the same as 0 - 0 being equivalent to the void even in Buddhism, yet of course not nihilistic - and philosophies have been developed of it around the world outside of Buddhism - see Plotinus, who is cited in the article - this article clearly represents an elucidation of voidism beyond a view of nihilism, to which the notion of 0 has been erroneously inextricably linked in western thought; that purpose alone justifies the article. It is also concerned in connecting epistemological thought around the basis of 0, thus transcending a purely religious or metaphysical connection with Buddhism, and validating its independence. The essay seems of amply sufficient quality; a reason a catholic institution wouldn't officially endorse its stance is due to the certainty asserted towards the ideas in the essay, and perhaps it was a personal wish of the author to have no such official connection with the institution. --HelloThere1 22:17, 5 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— HelloThere1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HelloThere1_7bfc.html" title="Special:Contributions/HelloThere1">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Valid points will however. --Jeromes 23:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm quoting an article from Wikipedia on Cosmology (Metaphysics): "Acosmism is the belief that neither the self nor the universe has ever existed. This is held by some forms of strict Advaita Vedanta, a Hindu philosophy. The Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, whose beliefs are called voidism, or nihilism (in the Eastern, rather than the Western sense), believed that the world neither exists, nor does it not exist." This clearly confirms and validates not only definitively the use of the term "voidism" in the aforementioned proper context, but it represents a branching beyond Buddhism alone in its Avaita Vedanta reference to identical views - that is, selfless (void) philosophies the void clearly applying to all philosophies avowing an absence or a falsification of any notions of static identity or attachment (justifying a generalized voidism category to include all such views not limited to Buddhism or even the East, as are referenced in the article), the primarily singular sense of application of the void, even in Buddhism (another Wikiquote): "The Suñña Sutta, part of the Pali Canon, relates that the monk Ananda, the attendant to Gautama Buddha asked, "It is said that the world is empty [void], the world is empty, lord. In what respect is it said that the world is empty?" The Buddha replied, "Insofar as it is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self: Thus it is said, Ananda, that the world is empty."" Voidism is the general term for this universal phenomenon, requiring elucidation. --HelloThere1 01:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Nagarjuna refined <i>shunyata</i>, which I stated above as translating to "emptiness" or "voidness", not "voidism". And there is no "Eastern" meaning to nihilism that I'm aware of, especially if the term was invented by <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Heinrich_Jacobi_f922.html" title="Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi">Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi</a> in the 18th century. The article you gave should be using a link to <i>shunyata</i>, not the translation of "voidism". <i>Shunyata</i> does not prove that the voidism theory, as presented in the article is universal in any sense. In fact, only using Buddhist philosophy limits it, because if it is Buddhist, or based on Buddhist thought, it is not universal. Again, I would like to point out that adding Buddhism into this discussion is confusing the issue.</li>

<dd>The article has two reliable, but not nessecarily relevant sources. The first is a World Religions textbook made to back up the use of <i>shunyata</i> in the article, but it appears that it may have simply been copied from the Buddhism article. The other reliable source is a book attempting of cover, as the publisher calls it, "every aspect of nothingness." While this is a vaild source, from the quick look I gave it, it seems to be talking more about nihilism than this article's theory, voidism. The theory that the article is written about is covered in an unreliable source, namely a self-published webiste which was written by a non-notable author. According to both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, this is not a valid source. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">Lim</a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_Esperanza_b9a2.html" title="User:Limetom/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b><i>e</i></b></font></a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">tom</a> 02:40, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Not only have you successfully failed to refute anything previously mentioned in the slightest, you haven't brought up a single valid point. The widely referencable term "shunyavadin" (shunya = void; vadin = ists) and its application to Nagarjuna's "middle-way system" sufficiently validates beyond further necessity the translatable (and widely-used) term "voidism". You seem to be emphasizing "shunyata" (meaning "voidness") while entirely displaying your ignorance of its root, the term "SHUNYA" (literally meaning only "void", no -ness or emptiness), a literal synonym for zero whose etymology is in fact in the extremely reputable source John D. Barrow's popular "Book of Nothing", which also links the concept to Buddhism. So, that totally cancels all your hopes to dismiss the connection of Voidism - a specific philosophy of the "void" - as it is established with Buddhism. As previously established, since this voidism pertains specifically entirely to the denial of multiplicity, duality, or the concept of a static aggregate, egoistic sort of "self", it is a universal philosophy of monism in its purest form which is to be found the world over and is an alternative indeed to an erroneous perception of voidist nihilism which you've also confirmed, which itself again justifies a specification in its own article for enlightenment.
