<p>Several reasons this page needs to be deleted.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is rambling <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a>. Example: <i>Such innuendo is usually presented in a humorous setting, a trend spearheaded perhaps by the television show Three's Company and continued the television show Facts of Life, its successors and many other shows since then.</i></li>
<li>It makes specific and highly debatable assertions with no <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citations</a>. Example: <i>Generally, girls are told about the facts of life sooner than boys, since they reach puberty sooner and are viewed as being more at risk to bear the burden of child raising if teen-aged preganancies occur and are carried to term and live birth.</i></li>
<li>It is poorly written and unencyclopedic. Example: <i>Often, the moral message is merely abstinence, however, sometimes more creatigve alternates to copulation, such as tribadism and/or frottage (are these the correct terms?)...</i></li>
<li>But, most importantly, the entire article was written for the express purpose of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">proving a point.</a> Quote: <i>You all think I am just oogling her. I had an Aha! moment recently. I had no idea that boy and girls wrestle now because I went this a Catholic school system where they _still_ have some issues with it.</i> For those of you who can stand it, the full talk page is <a href="../../../e/l/i/Talk%7EElizabeth_Morgan_bdaf.html" title="Talk:Elizabeth Morgan">here</a> -- <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 01:29, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is true the "social aspects" section of that article is sadly, sadly lacking, though. It's all spread out in separate articles. While this article definitely doesn't pass muster, the need it fills is real. As an aside, I don't know why people keep mentioning <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproduction.html" title="Reproduction">reproduction</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> need clear criteria for notability of organizations and online communities. Maybe your fantasy league is more notable, but what's the criteria? Number of users? Length of operation? Google hits? If you don't play fantasy football (or aren't interested in reading about it), you may think it's all non-notable; some people think stock-car racing is non-notable, and pro wrestling isn't "sport". Would 1 million FF players convince you? 10 million? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 05:41, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is characteristic of FF leagues not to pay much attention to the goings-on in other leagues, with a few rare exceptions. The original Rotisserie Baseball League, who counts among its owners the revered "Founding Fathers" of fantasy baseball, might be one, but it has published tens of books and its members were either notable when the league began (sportswriters of national repute, for instance) or became notable after (as published experts in baseball analysis). So, no, I wouldn't categorically consider all fantasy leagues non-notable, but your typical fantasy footbal league is not like your typical university or your typical professional league. It's just a bunch of schmoes, among whom I count myself, who love sports. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitchell_k_dwyer_69ef.html" title="User:Mitchell k dwyer">Mitchell k dwyer</a> 08:16, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>"'is not a democracy' is a common phrase." Well, so is "is not a monarchy," "is not a dictatorship," "is not a fascist state," and (my personal favorite) "is not a fundamentalist Hindu theocracy ruled by green Martians in feather headdresses."

<li>I agree that the articles are nonsense, but they are not <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">Wikipedia:Patent nonsense</a>. The definition of patent nonsense is:<br />
1. Total nonsense - i.e., text or random characters that have no assignable meaning at all. That means things like "asdfasdfasdfasdfatpotatoasdfasdfasdfasdf", where someone bangs on the keyboard a lot.<br />
2. Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to try to make head nor tail of it.<br />
These articles clearly don't fit the first definition, and only fit the second by a willful application of incomprehension. The articles' flaws lay in their verifiability, not in their lack of meaning. Using speedy deletion for these types or articles is an abuse of Wikipedia process. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 23:14, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to vote on my own page (which I did NOT create or help write), But I think being a well known Flash artist with several popular movies on the worlds most largest Flash portal (which also has a article) is an acceptable reason to have a Wikipedia page. It's not claiming I'm the best or anyhitng like that. It's citing what I've done, and fans might learn a thing or two.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The thing is, there are literally thousands of people on Newgrounds, being such a big portal. And the vast vast majority of it is pure pure dredge. <a href="http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/255487" class="external text" title="http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/255487" rel="nofollow">A Sample of Joseph's work (That I helped with - Joseph)</a>. I don't see anything that lifts this from all the other stuff on Newgrounds, I don't think it's any funnier, original, professional or intelligent then anything else on the portal. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:36, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> - I'm not against Flash or anything, there can be some genuinely good stuff out there. Compare say Joseph Blanchette's work with some other random internet things - <a href="http://epic.makingithappen.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://epic.makingithappen.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">EPIC 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.zeppotron.com/lawcops/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.zeppotron.com/lawcops/index.html" rel="nofollow">Lawcops, by entertainment company Zeppotron</a>. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:47, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Hahnchen , You should post a movie that I animated, drew, and wrote, not one I just helped with. This is one I did all by myself: (<a href="http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/105053" class="external free" title="http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/105053" rel="nofollow">http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/105053</a>) Just because I'm not the best flash animator ever dosn't mean I can't have a page about me. There are countless movie and TV actors as well, but that dons't stop people form making pages for lesser known ones. Making internet cartoons is very much like being a actor in many respects. The simple fact is I AM popular in the flash comunity, it's just the flash comunity isn't as well known as the acting one. If you want my opinion, I think there should be more entries for popualr flash artists from sites such as Newgrounds. Right now there are only a handful. It's not like its useless, pointless information. Imagine searching for your favorate Flash author on Wiki and getting a page about them. Pretty neat huh? Isn't that the point of Wikipedia? - LegendaryFrog 9:48, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Apologies</b> - I just went to a random site on the external links section and clicked on the top movie. I still don't think that your movies have had enough recognition outside newgrounds, unlike say <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiao_Xiao_21c5.html" title="Xiao Xiao">Xiao Xiao</a>. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 23:55, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, that's very much what I was thinking when I did this. It just happened that the only Flash artists I know enough on to write are the Chapmans and LF, and the former was already well-documented here. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptHayfever_007c.html" title="User:CaptHayfever">CaptHayfever</a> 05:11, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, I agree with the argument about the credit we give lesser-known actors and I'd like to add that Joseph's early work not only topped the charts on both <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_Player_5eac.html" title="Flash Player">Flash Player</a> back when it was first submitted, but it has inspired a generation of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromedia_Flash_1a63.html" title="Macromedia Flash">Macromedia Flash</a> artists in their work. It seems that every 1 in 3 comedy Flashes, whether in or outside of Newgrounds, revolve around the style established by Blanchette: the sitcom vibe, the character animation and the same type of humour has been echoed in countless submissions, of particular note being those of the The_Super_Flash_Bros/<a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_Helix_71e3.html" title="Double Helix">Double Helix</a> team, who have already got several Flashes in the Newgrounds top 50 with their style. I don't feel that it's unreasonable to ask for a bit of recognition to a growing industry. There is obviously an interest in this subject because even if one could accuse the page of being vanity there are still people with an interest in the subject reading and adding to these articles. Besides, there's also an educational aspect with encyclopedias: you don't use them to find things you know all to well, but things you're not sure about, even things you've never even heard of. There's already a big interest, and it can only stand to increase over time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Not Only Keep, Expand.</b> I haven't visited Legendary Frog's website but I've viewed many of his Flash pieces - his Alexa rating is irrelevant if he releases on Newgrounds. In fact I'm a little surprised that The Super Flash Bros do not have an article. Their work, including Decline of Videogaming, is arguably more notable than Legendary Frog's. Certainly if the Pedia has articles on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Kid_6b75.html" title="Star Wars Kid">Star Wars Kid</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a>, icons of dubious longevity or cultural relevance, then if enough people search for Blanchette or Dim/JT and generate this kind of talk page, they deserve to keep or gain articles. You can put me down for "Wish I'd found some content when I searched for The Super Flash Bros, and glad at least Legendary Frog got his due." Keep up the good work, Wikiers.

<li><b>Keep</b> Everyone I know has seen at least one of his cartoons. He is one of the most famous (and one of the best by the way) flash animators on the net.

<p><font color="purple">The Original Link (found on Hislops Two Babylons Wikipedia page) finds Hislops ideas discussed in minutiae <b>covering these very same topics</b>. So the original article (with false assumption in detail) is appropriate, yet its crticism, by one of its most noted detractors is not? The purpose of the 'minutiae' in the original argument is to lay out the very case that Christianitys roots are pagan. The purpose of the 'minutiae' in the rebuttal is to lay out the very case that Hislop was in error. <b>The Woodrow article IS ABOUT HISLOPs BOOK because the very link that references him (Woodrow) distinguishes him as a critic of it.</b> Woodrows second book is about the VERY SUBJECT of refuting Hislop.</font></p>
<p>Assuming that the value of the need to view the rebuttal is found worthy of 'Wikipedians' perusal, undoubtedly Woodrows page will ultimately be expanded and 're-written' further so as to give an even more in depth understanding of the errors of Hislop.</p>
<p>Just as the referenced <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venerable_Bede_a5f1.html" title="Venerable Bede">Venerable Bede</a> finds aspects of his life, works, struggles, and ideas ... so would any 'completed' article on Woodrow. Many Wikipedian articles, within themselves, and through links, show both PRO and CON views of the subject. The article on Woodrow is following in the established Wikipedian style and allows the reader to understand how one set of ideas may have been falsely arrived at. (and WHY)<br /></p>
<p>Is it 'more appropriate' to take these very same Woodrow facts and examples and <b>incorporate them into the body of the Hislop articles</b>, or more reasonable to provide the link to the Woodrow page that discusses them. --<a href="../../../m/-/f/User%7EM-filecastle_2dc3.html" title="User:M-filecastle">M-filecastle</a> 21:16, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The subject matter is religion.</p>
<p>Is Humblefool? an editor of this type of topic?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a series of articles that suggest that Christianity comes from pagan origins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such articles are all over the internet and on Wikipedia as well.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The debates on this topic are widespread and involve both Christians<br />
(interdenominationally) as well as 'non'believers</p>
<p>Mr. Woodrow originally wrote a book - <b>AGREEING</b> that there are pagan roots to Christianity. It was very popular.</p>
<p>It (his book) took many of its assumptions from earlier works by <b>Alexander Hislop</b> (Wikipedia) as well as his theories regarding <b>The Two Babylons</b> (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The Wikipedia articles on the above -2- subjects <b>LIST Mr. Woodrow</b> as someone who has argued <b>AGAINST</b> these points of view.</p>
<p>THE ARTICLE IN QUESTION GIVES MR WOODROWS point of view as to why he found his own earlier work, as well as the work of Alexander Hislop, <b>to be fraudulent and in error.</b></p>
<p>Any reader of this particular subject would have great interest in understanding that Christianity, while it is accused of being from pagan origions, is NOT in fact .... and that the historical facts do not support such a claim. Mr. Woodrow, and his book REFUTE these claims.</p>
<p><b>ONE OF ITS VERY PROPONENTS (Woodrow)</b> is now one of its critics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the purpose of Wikipedia if not to inform the reader to give them insight into each side of a subject and a broader understanding of the topic.<br />
Wikipedia <b>already LISTS a LINK to RALPH WOODROWS name</b>as being a critic of the Hislop - Two Babylons theory .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LEAST Wikipedia could offer its readers is what Mr Ralph Woodrows actual thoughts on the matter are!</p>

<p>Much of what is in the original articles by Alexander Hislop<br />
(Two Babylons) are unsubstantiated and are no more than his opinion.<br />
Apparently Alexander Hislops saving grace (here) is that he is long dead.</p>
<p>Mr Woodrow is a known critic (and one-time exponent)<br />
of those very same 'opinions'.</p>
<p>His POV or 'opinion' is RELEVANT for that very reason.<br />
And although some may quible with his syntax or 'phrase-ology' ...<br />
I would argue that the very VALUE of his words are because of JUST THAT<br />
because they ARE his words ...</p>
<p>When other peoples thoughts and ideas are recorded here -<br />
is it incumbent upon the gallery to edit their thoughts&#160;?</p>
<p><br />
Were there an article on Princess Dianna's criticism of the press (here)<br />
- would we correct her statements for grammer or use of analogy?</p>
<p>In an article on the Pope, (here) would we edit his remarks<br />
so as to reflect the Protestant view?</p>
<p>The views expressed are those of Mr Woodrow -<br />
any reader of such a text link would understand FROM HIS WORDS<br />
that what they were reading WAS HIS VIEW ...</p>
<p>Isn't that the point&#160;?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a result of Tim Pope's odd approach to merging. The article is actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_schools_in_Wadsworth%2C_Illinois&amp;oldid=20471619" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_schools_in_Wadsworth%2C_Illinois&amp;oldid=20471619" rel="nofollow">here</a>; quite a reasonable school article which could use a lot of expansion. Tim has decided to wipe out most of the information about the school, move it to a "list of" article and then add tiny little gobbets of information from other school articles which he intends to keep as redirects. So don't be deceived by the insubstantial nature of the article at present. It has been edited close to death but can be restored and expanded whent he VfD is over. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:42, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's hard to explain what happened as a result of Tim's "musical chairs" approach to merging, but I'll try. The article that was at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millburn_School%2C_Wadsworth%2C_Illinois_e44a.html" title="Millburn School, Wadsworth, Illinois">Millburn School, Wadsworth, Illinois</a> was a clone created by someone after Tim moved the actual article to the list article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Snell seems relatively notable, at least by the low wiki standards. I hate vanity articles as much as the next guy. In general, don't worry too much. An article with no links from other pages gets little or no attention; once it does get linked from other pages (or if for some reason it generates interest elsewhere), the wonderful wikipedia world intervenes to balance things out. Take a look at CF's own article: Cyrus Farivar. It's just how things go. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 06:16, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>It should be noted, in substance, the Cyrus Farivar article is little changed (the Wikipedia section will be jettisoned eventually). Use of Wikipedia as a promotional vehicle is a new challenge that will only be more tedious (patrol new articles and see for yourself). If we choose to keep promotional/vanity articles, then we should accept our lack of control over the article. We can't verify most of the claims, leaving editors just the task of snipping egregious self aggrandizing prose, but we will be powerless to challenge the actual information. If the nature of an article is known, I say aggressively stamp it out. You can shrug dozens or hundreds of instances of unlinked vanity but that number will grow and it would be foolish not to expect damage to Wikipedia's reputation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" rel="nofollow">lots of issues</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">leave me a message</a> 08:45, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am happy to accede to the wishes of the community either way -- only you all can judge whether I am a worthy subject for inclusion in Wikipedia. I did not create the page or ask for it to be created (and I have a user talk page, regardless), but I did modify it in order to add some facts about my background that the page's creator did not know about. (And actually, it make me consider that the early days of publishing on the Internet are not well-covered by Wikipedia, which may lead to further articles regardless of the results of this particular vote.)

<li>I guess it has to do with what you consider "minor interest." To members of the Macintosh community, I'm a pretty well-known figure. The key here, in my mind, is: what is Wikipedia supposed to be? A source for information on as many possible subjects as possible, even those that are fairly obscure but still relevant to a wider audience than a small circle of friends and family? Or a source for information that's both broad and extremely narrow. As Jimmy Wales has put it himself, it's not as if there are space constraints on Wikipedia -- that's one of its assets. If this article is truly of interest to nobody, it should be deleted. But how do you define "minor interest"? Is <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_C._Engst_254f.html" title="Adam C. Engst">Adam C. Engst</a> interesting? Frankly, I am getting quite confused about Wikipedia's VfD subculture. What's the point of Wikipedia if not that I can look up someone obscure like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Steadman_a60c.html" title="Carl Steadman">Carl Steadman</a> (who founded <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suck.com.html" title="Suck.com">Suck.com</a> and should have his own entry), as well as looking up <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>? <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 01:10, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do understand your point, but should every reporter and every columnist from every major and minor newspaper and magazine have a separate entry since they can, by defining their own ground, claim to be a "pretty well-known" figure? It seems unnecessary, particularly when we have user pages for contributor bio info. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 17:47, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>User pages are for bios of wikipedia contributors; articles are for topics that someone might come to Wikipedia to learn more about. I think an argument could be made that everyone who has a byline for a major publication/web site should be a candidate for a Wikipedia entry, just to promote transparency -- that way, readers would have the ability to find out exactly who is writing the articles they're reading. (It's even more important since many newspapers and magazines print only a bare byline, with no other biographical information to tell you anything about the perspective of the person in question.) I guess the question is, what's the true definition of someone "important enough to be in Wikipedia"? And should the community be extra vigilant in deleting articles about people, or extra lenient in giving articles the benefit of the doubt because what's unimportant to you may be very important to someone else? I'm obviously trending toward the lenient side, but I do see both sides. <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 18:19, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Snell provides a very reasonable argument. In addition to Cyrus Farivar, see <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Liberty_8348.html" title="Jesse Liberty">Jesse Liberty</a> (and the accompanying VfD debate), who is also a contributor to Wikipedia. Is there a list of Wikipedians with articles available? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 18:26, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good points. But I think it should be a question of lingering or lasting importance and some kind of reasonable standard with this regard should be iterated. I note that there are almost no entries that I can find for New York Times reporters or even critics (whose role as arbiters of popular tase elevates them to a higher importance in terms of who they are). This is also true of someone like James Taranto, editorialist for the WSJ. If they are deemed by the community (through omission) to be below threshold, I think surely the same applies in this case. The existence of other entries of marginal interest does not promote the point. Anyway, just my $0.02 <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 19:35, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I want Wikipedia to become the last reference of all interests. As an inclusionist, I bulk at the suggestion that an article should be deleted due to limited interest. However, there can be no compromise between inclusive interest and factual integrity. Whenever Wikipedia includes a low-verifiable subject with even a minor interest in becoming better known, quality chips away. Not surprisingly the author will be an acquaintance or the subject.</li>

<dd>I don't want to eliminate these journalists because only Mac users will query their name; actually, I am upholding neutrality and verifiability, which are some of the central tenets behind how Wikipedia works. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" rel="nofollow">lots of issues</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">leave me a message</a> 07:17, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I think that any published figure should have a Wikipedia page--if someone chooses to create it--as all writers have bias. The more information about a writer, the better the context in what they write is placed. This is true for computer journalists and writers at small local papers as for New York Times writers. The case that more well-known print journalists don't have Wikipedia entries demonstrates a bias by Wikipedia contributors, who are certainly multifarious, against mainstream media. This is well-known as Wikipedia is itself a stance against mainstream, single-voiced/publication-voiced media. If you remove Jason Snell, then Wikipedia also has to have a VfD for every single figure of any sort that someone believes hasn't contributed enough. There should be a very weak test for adding a biography, because the mere presence of a biography doesn't confer any authoritativeness nor an expectation that anyone will ever find such. Insufficiently well-known people will never have their biography read. They may post inaccurate information, but this is true on any obscure topic that no one ever reads. Any biography of anyone with sufficient reputation will be read and corrected. Further, there's nothing wrong with the subject inserting their own opinion because Wikipedia is designed to push toward the mean. A subject who persists in perpertuating known lies will not be able to persist if they are sufficiently observed. Disclosures: I found (did not create) a stub entry for myself, and fleshed it out. Someone had added Adam Engst and put a link to me. I did not create the entry. It has since been edited, showing that I have at least some minor interest to someone, otherwise no edits would have taken place. Disclosure: I write for Macworld and know both Jason and Cyrus. I have no vested interest in their particular biographies appearing or disappearing, nor my own. I edited my own biography with the expectation that it might be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would urge caution here. The subject matter is a serious avenue of study in the philosophy of ethics, and is encyclopedic. It needs some serious attention, most importantly its writing needs to be NPOV. It is in serious need of references. Are there other articles in the Philosophy sections that touch on the subject matter? If there is already a good article on it I'd urge deletion for duplication. If there is no other article, I'd urge applying the clean up tag and bringing it to the attention of the philosophy experts on Wikipedia.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon">Encephalon</a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon">ζ</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon">Σ</a> 11:06:40, 2005-08-08 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> I'm sure that in the field of philosophy I cannot say that I am an expert, but I am rather confident that there is almost nothing relevant going on in this field and that attempts to reconcile deontology with consequentialism are simply flights of fancy. Realistically, they are polar opposites; it's like trying to reconcile oil and water. I believe that one philosopher advanced a "deontological consequestialist" theory of some kind, but it was more of a suggestion than anything, and I'm not sure that he actually supported the theory personally. Anyway, this article is a personal essay. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">malathion</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalathion_119a.html" title="User talk:Malathion"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 16:47, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Re Reply</b>. I understand how you feel, but I'm afraid I am unpersuaded. You seem to be giving us reasons why <i>you</i> feel deontology may not be reconciled with consequentialism. That's fair as far as it goes, Malathion, but it doesn't quite address the issue, does it? I think the issue is the <b>encyclopedic merits of the subject</b>. This truly should not necessarily take into account how "true" a conjecture is, or even how many people themselves agree with one or more of the conjectures. For example, no one today believes in the pre-Copernican idea that Earth was the center of the solar system, but that does not mean an article on Ptolemy and his astronomical theories should not be written. No one today believes some of what Plato had to say about politics and philosophy, or what Aristotle had to say about medicine, but that shouldn't stop anyone from writing just such articles. In 5 years time, some genius Cambridge physicist might show that Einstein's light constant is in fact no constant at all; I doubt any of us would be rushing to remove articles from Wikipedia in that eventuality. Now, I am no philosopher, and I really cannot tell you for certain how widely the above problem is studied. However, I don't think it's as bad as you suggest; I seem to remember RM Hare writing on the subject just before he died (see his <i>Sorting out ethics</i>, for example). Of course, if it stays it's going to need a <i><b>massive</b></i> rewrite, as it's got all kinds of problems.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 22:49:18, 2005-08-08 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> I understand the NPOV policy. My point is not that I dislike this article because I disagree with it, but because everyone disagrees with it. RM Hare was not a "utilitarian consequentialist" and he advanced the idea as a flight of fancy. No one else takes the idea seriously. That makes it unencyclopedic. Further, this article is a personal essay about the author's own ideas, and not those of Hare. That makes in original research. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">malathion</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalathion_119a.html" title="User talk:Malathion"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 00:20, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Malathion, you continue to miss the point. <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy.html" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s theories of planetary motion were a flight of fancy. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s idea of the number of teeth women had was a flight of fancy. Much of <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galen.html" title="Galen">Galen</a>'s anatomy was a flight of fancy. Most of <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippocrates.html" title="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>' therapeutics were flights of fancy (indeed, <i>all</i> of medicine was a flight of fancy until about 150 or so years ago). Yet all of these things have a place in Wikipedia (and every other reputable encyclopedia) — and rightly so. Wikipedia is a scholarly record of things about us and our world and our past. If it were restricted only to those theories and "facts" which are held by contemporary society to be true or plausible, then an astonishing amount of our scientific, religious, cultural, philosophical and artistic heritage will find no place in it. That we don't believe Hippocrates' quackery or the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">Intelligent design</a> peoples' fantasies <i>ourselves</i>, does not mean that a record of these beliefs and thoughts should find no place in an encyclopedia. Now, as I have said earlier, I am no philosopher. I have no idea how much scholarly activity is contemporarily centered on this subject. I do know that it has been debated in the past, and it engaged some of the best minds in philosophy. Certainly that has been my impression. Now, like very many other things, it might be deeply flawed, but that is not intrinsically a reason for it not to have mention in an encyclopedia. If you know something of the subject, I will have no objection if you rewrote that article to say "The idea of deontological consequentialism is held by most philosophers today to be little more than a flight of fancy. Etc etc etc..." That's fine (I'm assuming that assertion is factually true). If it stays, it will need a complete rewrite anyway, because as I (and you and the others) have pointed out earlier, it's very badly written. I'm only saying that I am mystified by your reasoning — that to find place in an encyclopedia, a subject or theory or thought has to be true or held to be true by contemporaries. That's absurd.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 02:04:35, 2005-08-10 (UTC)

<dd>Malathion/Ryan, I was addressing your argument that an article has to be about things that are held by contemporary thinkers to be wholly or largely true before it may be included in an encyclopedia. This is an erroneous belief. Your point about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> on the other hand is a very good one; I am rather inclined to view this essay as <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">poorly cited</a>, rather than wholly unacceptable.</dd>
<dd>Having read once more Hare's "Could Kant have been a utilitarian?", I am inclined to think that the earlier claim that Hare advanced this subject as a flight of fancy is in fact a flight of fancy. Hare was making a serious effort to form a bridge. Be that as it may, I don't think WP will suffer a real loss with the deletion of this article. The problem with what to do with an article or stub that 1. is of encyclopedia value but 2. is poorly written and referenced, is vexatious. Editors like Tony Sidaway usually move to "save" anything that isn't actually incomprehensible gibberish; other editors with higher standards about what should find a place on WP often vote to delete. If I had to describe my own view, it is far closer to the second than the first; by this I do not mean that the former are "wrong," in fact both "types" of editors usually act within WP policy/guidelines. In this particular instance, I feel the page should not be deleted for reasons already elaborated. <b>Summary of what I think should be done</b>: 1. Keep the page. 2. Reduce it to a stub with only verifiably true details of the concept, with references.

<li>Had some thoughts, so I'll share them with you all. I have some objections to the rule that important speeches are okay if they are substantiated with some background information. I feel this background info is desirable and definitely helps the reader and makes the article more encyclopadeic. But the absence of this information does *not*, IMO make grounds for deletion of an article from wikipedia. This is a personal opinion and opinions differ. Do let me know what others think. Alternatives like {{attention}} or {{cleanup}} could be pursued. Do let me know what you all think.

<dd>It does not in the least duplicate the TC article. There are two Decalogues discussed in biblical scholarship, the Ethical and the Ritual. I made this a separate article because it's not the common understanding of the "Ten Commandments", and I didn't think people would appreciate having it in the main TC article. Izak and Tomer, if you would prefer to divide that article into two sections, Ethical Decalogue and Ritual Decalogue, I would have no objection. In fact, I would prefer it: I agree with you that that's where it belongs. I was merely attempting to avoid the edit war that I thought might follow.</dd>

<dd>Please delete any original research. I agree the article's a mish-mash; I'm not the person to write it. I came to Wikipedia to read up on this topic, and it's a rather egregious omission on the part of Ten Commandments article not to mention the Ritual Decalogue. Better a mish-mash, which will improve with time as other editors play their part, than silence. Please improve the article to make it more respectable, wherever it ends up. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 09:57, 2005 August 8 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Kwami: It is rather poor form to "create" articles out of thin air, and then admit that they are in fact "mish-mash" to wit! May I suggest that you <i>first</i> learn how to do things in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a>. Writing an article is <i>not</i> the same as putting down in writing the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stream_of_consciousness.html" title="Stream of consciousness">stream of consciousness</a> of one's mind about any given subject. All you are citing are <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophical</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">moral</a> aspects, perhaps, of the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>...otherwise articles could become splintered in 6 billion ways as each person on Earth comes along and has "thoughts" and "ideas" that they may dredge up from the Internet or wherever. We must be more responsible than that in creating a respectable and coherent online Encyclopedia that conforms to <i>accepted</i> scholarship. What you say here merely re-inforces the need to delete the article (and place anything of value on the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> page.) Thanks. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:32, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be missing the point. I'm prepared to accept the criticism that the article is mishmash, because I know I'm not the best writer in the world. But these are not my opinion about the TC, or dredged up from the internet. They are accepted scholarship, and can be found in standard biblical commentary. You can perhaps find better sources than I. This material needs to be in here somewhere, preferably in the TC article. It should be clear that according to much biblical criticism, there are two distinct Decalogues. One is not a "philosophical" version of the other, at least not according to the sources I've cited. (There will of course be other points of view which I have not found.) <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 11:28, 2005 August 8 (UTC)</dd>

IMHO merging the articles would be misleading; but the article as it stands looks already interesting, NPOV (or if some people think it isn't, it can be made so), and it can also be seen as useful in that it's easier to remember "Ritual Decalogue" than "Exodus 34" which is the place where to find it in the Bible. -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 23:54, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>- what makes Princess Di, or Carol Burnett a gay icon as opposed to just a regular icon? The current criterion for this list is really anyone who has a following in the gay community. The number of followers is undefined, and subjective. For instance, suppose I am gay and think that <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jani_Rita_dbdc.html" title="Jani Rita">Jani Rita</a> is a good role-model. I could include him on the list, particularly if I have a gay friend who agrees with me. It's inherently flawed, just as a List of heterosexual icons would be.

<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b> were it not for the fact that I know there is such a thing as a gay icon and there probably could be a good article about them I'd say delete. I agree with all of those who have said that there is basically no justification for any of these people to be considered gay icons and thus in my view this article serves very little purpose. It seems very arbitrary and doesn't meet the standards that seem to normally be applied to other Wikipedia articles in terms of detail and in terms of original research. I don't really want to see it trashed, but if it were come up for a vote for deletion again in a few months and nothing has changed I would very likely vote the other way. Each person on the list should, at the very least, have enough of a following as a gay icon to warrant a section in the original article otherwise it would appear to me to be very arbitrary. Some of them seem to be very improbable to me...

<p>The result of the debate was <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_army_surgical_hospital.html" title="Mobile army surgical hospital">Mobile army surgical hospital</a>. Now for the justification of making such a call when nobody voted "redirect". The article is an essay, and as has been pointed out, such essays should not be in Wikipedia, therefore I will be removing the essay from the "front line" by converting this to a redirect. However a number of users want some of the content merged with <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_army_surgical_hospital.html" title="Mobile army surgical hospital">Mobile army surgical hospital</a>. This is not all that easy to do, and since I am a lazy administrator, I cannot be bothered to do so. Instead, I will give other users a chance to do the merging, so I will leave the history intact. Anyone may now look into the history, and merge parts from this essay at their leisure. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:01, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Belzebuub is a notable character. He is known by tens of thousands of individuals who have been greatly affected by his life and work. It is arrogant of you to state that he is "non-notable" when people around the world take part in his courses and read his books.

<dd><b>Delete</b> Just get rid of it, apparently nobody on Wikipedia has an open mind enough to find the information of any use; from what pure nonsense i've seen here, nobody here is even worthy receiving this information. Since the only spiritual beliefs that matter to Wikipedians are those of the corrupt organizations already in existence; anything that isn't already corrupted by mainstream mediocrity and greed should be deleted. Only corrupt mainstream-accepted information is allowed on the Wikipedia (i.e. information from organizations that collect large sums of money from their members "on behalf of god"), not information from individuals who give away electronic copies of their information and seek no financial support from their students. Good luck finding any truly valuable information from an organization founded on the pervasive principles of modern day religious organizations. I'm sorry that I'm not like everyone else, and I'm sorry that Belzebuub has a different way of portraying himself than most people. I hope that reading the article didn't offend anyone's fragile constitution. Adreamsoul 20:07, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I forgot the outrageously POV aspect: <i>Known to history as a famous demon, Belzebuub later repented in the internal worlds with the help of Master Samael Aun Weor - wanting to transform himself back into a Being of light. To do this, he was given a physical body with the name of Mark H. Pritchard</i>. Is that supposed to be an encyclopedic statement? <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 03:02, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>i don't see why the wikipedia should discount this information merely because it is of a spiritual nature. Channels and other spiritual leaders have done a great deal to help humanity. The work of Belzebuub has helped many people achieve the ability to perform <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astral_Projection_452f.html" title="Astral Projection">Astral Projection</a>; it has also helped many people to become aware of higher spiritual states. I, honestly, cannot see the harm in displaying such ideas. Adreamsoul 03:43, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is not the ideas, but their presentation from a single point of view. If kept, the material would need presenting in a way acceptable to both those who believe it and to the majority of readers who think it extremely unlikely that some guy in Australia is literally the incarnation of a reformed major-league demon. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 10:54, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The Catholic church is one of the most corrupt organizations in the world. They have committed so many crimes against humanity throught history: pedophile preists, getting the top Nazis out of Germany after WWII, selling indulgences to "pay your way to heaven", sending children on crusades and then selling them into slavery... It is beyond me why anyone would ever trust such an organization. There is no such thing as spirituality within such an organization. God help anyone who tries to get spirituality at a church, they have none! They have encouraged individuals like yourselves to do whatever they can to discredit anyone who claims to have spiritual information that is different from theirs. Maybe you should delete the wiki on catholicism if you really want to do the world a favor! Adreamsoul 21:56, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am the creator of Scrunchy, which I have renamed Scrinchy because the former name has a connotation I dislike (ask any woman). I have never put Scrunchy on sourceforge, but I put it on Freshmeat. If you search today on either SF or FM you will not find Scrunchy; you will find Scrinchy on FM. So just <b>keep</b> the Scrinchy page, it would be reckless to remove it. (anonymous comment by User:207.245.94.146)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry was thinking freshmeat but typed sourceforge. I actually think your project is quite cool myself, don't take it personally. However, the bar for including products and programs on wikipedia is quite high. Your program has not yet reached the point of encyclopaedic notability.

<li><b>Uh, probably merge, or something</b>. I can't think of anything significant he did to garner significant attention. I know he got some minor notice from bloggers who were attracted by his economically-very-conservative-yet-socially-moderate stance, but as far as real media attention I know of very little (only the one Enquirer editorial already cited in the article). I agree with PedanticallySpeaking that it is important to have a complete record of the election, however I think that the current situation with separate articles for all is overkill, and that (s)merging them all into the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Second_Congressional_District_Election%2C_2005_ca67.html" title="Ohio Second Congressional District Election, 2005">Ohio Second Congressional District Election, 2005</a> article is probably not a bad course of action.

<li><b>KEEP or MERGE</b>. This was one of the rare competitive Congressional elections in recent memory, and one of the few to get national attention. At the very least, the information on each of the candidates up for deletion should be moved onto the main page for the OH-2 election. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 16:06, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The primary reason this garnered national attention is because it was a special election. If this occured during a standard election cycle, these men would be even less than historical footnotes. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 16:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know about that. There are often up to 3 or 4 special elections every cycle. How much did you hear about the special election in North Carolina last year? That was a district drawn to represent a Democrat and a Democrat won easily. Ohio-2 is a district drawn to represent a Republican and yet, for whatever reason, a Republican almost lost. It's important to note all the people involved so that the reader will get a picture as to why this election was different. I'm not saying they have to have all their own pages, but at the very least they should each get a more expanded mention on the central page for OH-2, and a link to their own websites, if they had a website. I also wanted to mention that out of all the OH-2 candidates up for deletion, I think Peter has the most grounds to keep his own separate page, as he was the only one who seemed to be noted by the local media as having a good future in politics. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 16:37, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I had to choose I'd say that Fossett was probably one of the most irrelevant candidate. Jean Schimdt, a Republican, was chosen by Portman to succeed him. Fosset challenging Portman's pick as a Republican was a sure way to fail quite spectacularly, something he did. 2.3%? Doesn't seem very bright to me. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 17:09, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He placed 6th out of the field of candidates, and he was specifically praised by the Cinci Enquirer, which may indicate a future run for him. Considering that Schmidt gave the weakest performance of any Republican OH-2 nominee in over 30 years, maybe Fossett wasn't too wrong after all. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 18:10, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Schimdt's relatively poor showing has nothing to do with Fossett. It was directly tied to the backlash against Bush and the Republican party building because of increased numbers of killed soldiers in Iraq, a disturbing number of whom call Ohio home. To assume that anything Fossett said or did impacted Schimdt's campaign or vote count is illogical. If Fossett does run in the future, and manages to get more than a statistically insignificant portion of the vote, he can have an article. Until then, he's just a footnote. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 19:08, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't feel that Schmidt's performance had nothing to do with Fossett, but you were the one who said that he didn't "seem very bright" for running against her. You connected the two and I went along with your train of thought. As for the rest, I think that based on his coming in 6th and the comments of the Enquirer, there is enough there for at least a small article. But as long as some of that information is moved over to the main OH-2 election page if or when Fossett's page is deleted, the deletion won't bother me. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 19:24, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I said "seem very bright" that was in response to what you characterized as Fossett's "good future in politics." I meant that his future in politics didn't look bright. Now that you mention it, running against a member of your own party endorsed by the seat's previous holder isn't too bright either. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 19:29, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have no personal opinion on Fossett. What I said was that the Cincinatti Enquirer had praise for him, and that seemed to suggest he may have a good future in politics. They are one of the leading conservative papers in the city, and probably in all of Ohio, so if they see something in him, then they must have had some basis. I don't know why Portman endorsed Schmidt but she was not the choice of a lot of power brokers in that district and she will probably be lucky to survive her next primary. Anyway, I guess this is off topic. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 19:47, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Who told you that Rob Portman endorsed Jean Schmidt? That's outright wrong; Portman officially endorsed no candidate in the primary. That reason for claiming non-notability is bogus.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with you completely with respect to the "include all schools" view; there are clearly not many who subscribe to such an extreme view. We do have some pretty good criteria to apply to schools: verifiability and neutrality, on those we can all agree. If someone comes up with an external school report on this preschool that uses reasonable standards applicable to early education, I'll change my vote to keep.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Did a little more NPOVing. Hi, <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinboy_5d8c.html" title="User:Spinboy">Spinboy</a>, we seem to have different opinions on minor Canadian politicans.

A politician is someone who serves in public office. I have more google hits! If the only criteria is running I can sign myself up at the registrar for the next council election and get a free wiki page! Politicians primarily need name recognition, she doesn't have it and wikipedia is not a political endorsement.

<li>Delete: Any item in an encyclopedia should be referred to by a group outside of its own participants. If an item is referred to only by its own participants, then it is jargon or argot or slang or cruft. However, when a subject appears in <i>multiple referential contexts,</i> it will need discussion and explanation. Hence, fanfiction, fanmaps, etc. are not appropriate encyclopedic fare unless some context other than fans (e.g. getting on the 6 o'clock news for being scary), it is inappropriate content.

<li>In the case of a list it's always going to be difficult to know whether it will develop.

Given the fact that the Rugrats' language forms a central aspect of several episodes (like "ATM machine"/"M&amp;M machine"), I'd say it's a very important and noteworthy aspect of the show.<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyLegsKC_77db.html" title="User:CrazyLegsKC">CrazyLegsKC</a> 02:41, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>To ensure that this wasn't <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a>, with all of its ensuing verifiability perils, I checked the history, and was pleased to see my expectation confirmed that <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:dbiv</a> didn't write it ... <i>until</i> I saw that it was a straight word-for-word copy (done by 62.254.64.14 (<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.254.64.14.html" title="User talk:62.254.64.14">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.254.64.14_0dd7.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.254.64.14">contribs</a>)) of the autobiography on <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">dbiv</a>'s user page. If the only source of the information on a subject is the subject itself, albeit via a third party parroting it, it is suspect. If the subject really is a published author of a book with a wide audience, then he meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. However, the article cites no sources and so far the <i>only</i> source that we have for this statement, and indeed for everything else in the article, is <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">dbiv</a>'s autobiography. The comments above are unwisely taking the article at face value. No matter how we might trust <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:dbiv</a> it is unwise to trust <i>any</i> autobiography. We don't trust the editors who write unsourced articles about themselves claiming that they are world reknowned academics, business leaders, coolest bitches on the block, and the like. We should not trust a straight copy of <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:dbiv</a> writing about himself on his user page.</p>
<p>Attempting independent verification, therefore, I find that the book, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1902301595</a>, exists, and <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Jim_Fae_Scotland_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Big Jim Fae Scotland">has apparently been read by at least one other Wikipedia editor</a>.

Slavin has been involved in electoral politics on a national level since 1984, and seems to be a figure of note in social justice causes for a long time before that. A little googling shows that she's definitely notable by wiki standards. She seems to be one of those "raging granny" 60s-radical types with a long history of activism.
