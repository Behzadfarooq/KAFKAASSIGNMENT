<li><b>Comment</b>These are worth keeping because first of all I spent so much of my time working hard on them. It would be a waste to see them all go. Second of all the majority of these girls have found modeling/acting careers post show. For example Elyse Sewell has done more modeling than all the winners combined. She is signed with multiple agencies, and is a top model in China. Also these pages are not yet complete. There is alot of available info in their MySpaces. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELil_Flip246_7a32.html" title="User:Lil Flip246">Lil Flip246</a> 15:45, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For starters, the ones who actually won their respective shows would seem notable (winners of any other reality show seem notable as well, so that solves that quandary). Those who made it to the final episode or however this show works are probably notable for almost winning (that seems to be what the precedent is, but don't quote me off-hand). Those who went on to bigger and better things despite not coming close to winning are probably notable because of what they went on to do. An argument could be made that anyone kicked off or involved in a controversial incident on the show is notable, but I'm not sure if that stands up or applies here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. Unless it's someone like <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>, people don't get wrapped up in the performances of particular game show contestants like they do with those on reality shows. Does anybody watch <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> and root for one of the contestants each night? I watch both game and reality shows frequently...I couldn't tell you who won on Wheel or Jeopardy last night, but I could tell you who got voted off <i>American Idol</i> or fired on <i>The Apprentice</i> last year. With reality shows, you get to know the contestants, their bio info, and their idiosyncracies. That just doesn't happen with most game shows, and that's what makes them more notable. (For the record, I've never seen a single episode of ANTM.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 16:56, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well my point is just that in at least these two cases, the nom's stated criteria <i>It is noted in previous AFDs that reality TV contestants generally aren't notable unless they come close to winning the show. Many of these do not assert notability under WP:BIO</i> are not met. A mass deletion is simply not in order here. I don't exactly agree that the competitors on reality shows are no different than game shows -- game show contestants generally appear for only one episide, very little biographical information about them is offered, and game shows in general have a much smaller fan base than shows like ANTM <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 16:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's because the Price is Right is a game show not reality show. Every episode of The Price is Right, there are new contestants.

<p><b>Alternative to a mass delete</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Criteria I used for compiling the following list include:</li>
<li>the nom's own <i>reality TV contestants generally aren't notable unless they come close to winning the show.</i></li>
<li>"Delete the stubs and redirect, keep the rest" from <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Soo</a></li>
<li>My own feeling that with a current modeling career (usually determined by whether or not they have been signed) this information is verifiable and therefore not running afoul of any wikipedia policy.</li>
<li>I erred on the side of inclusion. (signified by <b>Weak Keep</b> where the credits seem slim, but I don't feel like I know enough about modeling to judge.) I didn't google anybody, just used info from the articles.</li>

<dd>My attempt here is merely to simplify a deletion proposal that's incredibly complicated because it proposes 77 (!) articles for deletion. All of my suggestions above are up for discussion. Wasn't it easier for you to check now that I've marked some Delete and you could just skip over them? As I mentioned, I didn't google anyone, but merely tried to sort the stubs from the articles with some content and provide a brief summary of why I think they should be kept, in the interests of inclusion and building a consensus here (which will require compromise for everyone as my first impulse was to keep them all and I've now marked roughly half <b>Delete</b>). It's a tool for the discussion, not the final word on these women's notability. And I realize there's been some unfortunate reversions on the affected pages recently that would get anyone's ire up. And I'm sorry if I somehow misread <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbyne_Manning_dace.html" title="Robbyne Manning">Robbyne Manning</a> -- I'll have to go doublecheck where I got that she was a Miss Tennesee.

<dd>I can't speak for RMHED, but I generally think when we say a person is NN, we really mean they fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. (And <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> if it's a company, and so on, etc.) And I do think the fact that proper sources for many of these articles can't be found outside of their own MySpace pages speaks volumes. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 00:49, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it's still disputable whether or not <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> applies to reality TV characters -- they are real people, but their notability largely depends on their role as characters in a television show. I think a more general guideline, like <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">Wikipedia:Importance</a> might apply here. And when I say that non-notability isn't a criteria for deletion, I'm including <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. There are three official criteria for deletion and notability is not involved, though <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is, which does, in fact, render some of these articles deletable in my opinion.

<dd>Well... I suppose <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> is right about the link between MySpace sources and non-notability. If we can't find non-MySpace sources for info on the girls, they most likely fall into the NN category.

<li><b>Delete</b> selective list per Dina. Reality contestants are not inherently notable but may be if they have other achievements outside the narrow confines of the show. Although some might succeed in a few years and warrant an independent page, most of these girls will disappear and be forgotten in a few years.

<li><b>Keep all</b> for now but <b>without prejudice</b> to later re-nomination for deletion. The nominator stated that "reality TV contestants generally aren't notable unless they come close to winning the show", yet most of the contestants were nominated for deletion even if they did win the show or clearly achieved notability from post-show activities (both were the case with <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrianne_Curry_698e.html" title="Adrianne Curry">Adrianne Curry</a>). I could support deletion in some cases but it would be better to review the less notable contestants individually and keep the more notable contestants out of AfD consideration. As a second choice, keep the ones recommended by Dina for keeping and delete the ones she recomended for deleting. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:44, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the overall winner(s), plus any contestants who have other claims to independent notability. As for the others, I think it's reasonable to keep an article on each one if (1) the show is <i>actively</i> on the air, <i>and</i> (2) the individual contestant is getting regular press from it in the entertainment news. Those two factors give them a reasonable claim (IMHO) for at least temporary notability. Then, after the season finishes, take another look at the article. If the contestant's notability disappeared with the end of the season, merge their article back into the main show article, set up their name as a redirect to the show article, and life goes on. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 07:53, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Probably all the girls are more well known than a lot of people on wikipedia, but this is the problem with having no clear guidelines on what deserves an entry - If being known by the public is the main criteria, then these girls are obviously way ahead of the many academics and historical figures contained in wikipedia.</li>

<li><b>Keep - Adrianne Curry</b>, I'll admit right now that I don't know who most of these people are and probably don't care since I don't watch television. (yes, I have one, but I just watch rented movies) I'm also not about to go through a list of 76 people. But Adrianne Curry is a definite <b>keep</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Many of the "keep" votes seem to be made on the basis of one or two entries on the list. That is not a valid reason to vote "keep" on the entire list. <i>Be specific</i> about which should be kept and which should be deleted, so the nominator can choose to withdraw some of the nominations before the AfD ends. Furthermore, some are voting keep simply because they don't like the length of the list of nominations - that's hardly AfD criteria. If you don't want to slog through the long list, I can't say as I blame you, but don't just blindly vote "Keep all" if you haven't actually read all the articles. People would be complaining even more if the nominator had actually filed 76 separate AfDs. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:35, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wikipediatrix is doing the right thing, actually. Sources should always be given for information, especially when it's about living persons.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the person who decided to ruin all the articles should be punished. What a petty thing to do just because you don't agree that these articles should be here. Unless you are the owner of Wikipedia you do not have any business messing up stuff people have worked on without at least asking for input first.

<li>Perhaps you should familiarize yourself with Wikipedia policies, such as <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, before making such judgements.

<li>That's because the articles are not yet complete. Give it some time instead of removing valuable TRUE information. Wikipediatrix isn't giving us ANTM fans a chance.
