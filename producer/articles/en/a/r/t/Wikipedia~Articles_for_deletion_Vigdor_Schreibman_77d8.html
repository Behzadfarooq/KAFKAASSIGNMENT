<dd>There is significant discussion about who Vigdor is, for people who are just getting started, and questions about what I do in the land of bloggers. A visit to my website is the most authoritative way to answer those inquiries rather than the all-inclusive attacks and "horror" stories that one sees from the largely uninformed censors who inhabit this domain. I am not a person who is especially sensitive to the quality of the technology over the quality of the content but I did make a quick check on my code for the FINS website using TIDY, my favorite authority. They report 0-errors! with a negligible number of warnings, despite the alarming report by the "Timecop" authority. --Vigdor 10:01, 26 December 2005 {UTC}</dd>

<dd>Thesquire works hard at his job, I'll give him or her credit for this. He enjoys vandalizing my article on blogs, with page blanking, then posts warnings to me and fanciful "Comments" here and there demanding that users join his masquerade. It looks like the latest career move for the "mind guards" that use every form of coercion to get their way. In a society that is locked in gridlock of complex and conflicting ideas, the technique of coercion that is known as "Groupthink" is working overtime. Wikipedia is the made-to-order site for this destructive cabal. Reworking the meaning of the world guided by the standard of "Neutrality"! Organization of knowledge and approximation of a "world encyclopedia" have flourished since ancient Greek and Roman times. This new venture based on the standards of "Neutrality" is going nowhere. Knowledge organization requires, above all, engagement of the striving human spirit. To say that all we can be is what we are, which is what you get with the direction of "Neutral" ideas is a breakthrough to nowhere. The net result is a war of censorship, something that died a natural death in the Dark Ages, reborn in the 21st century at Wikipedia. Vigdor 11:27, 26 December 2005 {UTC}</dd>

<li>I have no idea what motivates stupid behaviour or vanity. What matters is the issue at hand- the article raises a relevant historical question, particularly considering that this is an internet encyclopedia. The references I added to the article confirm that Schreibman started an Internet news service and was denied press credentials in Washington. His case may be one of the early precursors in the ongoing confrontation between the old and new medias. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:57, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have never engaged in page blanking, so I frankly do not know what Vigdor is talking about. Also, I would remind him of the Wikipedia policy of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_Personal_Attacks_af31.html" title="Wikipedia:No Personal Attacks">No Personal Attacks</a>: a line which I think he's definitely crossed.. I personally know little about the very early history of blogging myself, hence my reluctance to make an actual vote on this article, but I do not appreciate attacks upon my character. That he's resorted to making these false accusations against me rather than argue his own case only points to the weakness of his position. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 02:39, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe, but you could have avoided the <i>reeks of vanity</i> comment above as well. Every statement here seems to call for a reaction that quickly spins out of control. If the nom had mentioned that there was an edit war at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a>, I would have understood the real motivation for this nom and not remarked on what I perceived as jealousy. Anyway, I do find some of the <b>delete votes from new users/infrequent editors</b> a bit strange. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:12, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a soapbox. I'm neutral on notability, but... horrible article, vanity, POV, delusions of grandeur.

This is an argument that could happen on the talk page, except that the vanity of the author may make it impossible. I also note that very little of the article is actually about the subject, mostly being about his sites. (That 9000 google hits is actually 132 <i>unique</i> hits, by the way.)

<li>It's not the "first blog"! This is an attempt to rewrite history so that V.S. can be the first in a category that wasn't invented yet. But as the article itself documents, there were periodically updated internet presences before there was a web, and there were sites, such as the NCSA What's New page, that had daily updates before Schreibman. While he no doubt had an early internet presence, you will not find any source substantiating that claim except his own. (It's really hard to keep my annoyance over what's happening in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a> article from spilling over here.) <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 22:16, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>((User Rodii makes a relevant inquiry, which certainly should be explored. In a genuine dialogue the first stage of idea generation requires that "Every person matters, so it is necessary to protect the autonomy and authentifity of each observer." In the second stage of idea synthesis, a model of influence and importance of each idea can be produced with the support of computer methodology such as Nominal Group Technique (NGT) or Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). The approach followed in Wikipedia is very destructive, inviting vicious attacks by opposing partisans. No sane and reasonable person would call this a "collaborative system." The facts that I have stated about my experience in Internet-based news are accurate. The documents that I have cited are true and accurate. My entire library is open to public inspection. You will see, for example, the first edition of the Federal Information News Syndicate: in the directory on News Columns, the first article on "Participatory Democracy in the Information Age," which FINS published on January 11, 1993. The search engines may not pick this up because the text of my early reports were not HTML. I am pursuaded that my claim of being the first "blog" is valid, albiet open to challenge, based in large part on my experience at the Periodical Press Gallery of the U.S. Congress during the period from 1993-1996. During those years no one at that venue had the least clue what Internet-based news reporting was. In fact, when I started reported via Internet, the Manager of the Gallery, David Holmes, held a meeting with his colleagues to consider terminating my Press Pass; they were all terribly concerned about what I was doing, which they thought must be illegal. These are all seasoned Journalists, completely mystified by the whole idea of Internet-based news. My news column was clearly a first among that leadership group! There certainlly were others using the Internet, many Universities, including, of course, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), but it would surprise me to learn that they thought of themselves as a "blog"!

<li>Now included above is a link to an image of The Washington Post story where critics can examine the top treatment given to the public service of Fins Information Age Library in August 1994. This article also conveys information about numerous Government Documents "Gophers" but does not include the NCSA site that brother Rodii mentioned as a possible contender for "1st Blogger" credit.[User:Vigdor]{UTC}</li>

<li>Keep: I have rewritten much of the article. Because of his legal struggles in Puerto Rico and his shunning by the congressional press, he is important enough to have his own article. He should not feature in the blog article, however. He didn't do anything truly original in blogging and he has never played well with others. Because of his vain efforts to vandalize the blog article, his contributions to Wikipedia should be viewed in terms of how those contributions can rightly be interpreted by others, whether or not that is in Schreibman's interest.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There is a difference of opinion about who is vandalizing whom. The "rewriting" that User Anthony refers to was not to correct any inaccuracy or prejudiuce but simply to continue a mad attack and smear mode of Wikipedia consensus building. While I am perfectly willing to abide by a consensus decision to delete my blog article and my bio I find it unethical and unacceptable to have an avowed enemy "rewrite" my work without my consent. Anthony is perfectly free to write up in his own article all of his criticism of my work. That will help distinguish what is intended.

<li>(1) He isn't an "avowed" enemy--at least, I have seen no such avowals. Can you point to any? (2) There is no reason to take him as an enemy at all: assume good faith. (3) It isn't <i>your work</i>--when you contribute to Wikipedia you give up ownership of your work; it is the community's to modify and improve. That you may not consider some other editor's changes an improvement is an issue to be worked out through discussion and a consensus process. The mindless reverts you've been doing--which, incidentally, have been wiping out the good work of other editors that has nothing to do with this dispute--are damaging to that process; try taking part instead. At the very least, try to learn how this project works; in particular, try reading <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">this</a>. The people you imagine to be your "enemies" have the best interests of Wikipedia at heart, not some animus toward you. What are <i>your</i> motives? <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 01:54, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:I now have a fairly good idea of how this project works. It is a project derived from the mode of Groupthink governed by the values of slease, attack, and smear. Will this mode of association for the "World Encyclopedia" be sustained? A little consultation with the outsiders should tell us something about this question.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Vanity on a soapbox, and Wikipedia is not a blog (in particular, AfD is not a blog). I'm closing this, as it's been days and the "deletes" double the "keeps". I haven't protected the page against recreation, but I strongly advise Vigdor not to recreate it or edit it, since it's generally considered not a good practice to do that. Yes, even if <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> did it. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.
