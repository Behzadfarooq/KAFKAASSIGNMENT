<hr />
<p>Does not meet criteria for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and therefore should be deleted according to Wikipedia policy. Specifically, it does not have any mainstream credibility beyond a very small niche in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a>. Just because it survived afD last time doesn’t mean that its notability was established.</p>
<p>During the last debate, I was not aware of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and therefore did not bring it up in the debate. I apologize for that; I was still learning Wikipedia at the time and in fact I am still learning it, and probably will not have the full hang of it for another year or two, but I am definitely learning.</p>
<p>Regardless, there is nothing in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> about the number of hits a web site gets; therefore the argument last time that it has a 15,000 or whatever ranking on Alexa is entirely irrelevant.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you believe it should not be deleted, then please point out examples of mainstream publications that have covered DVDR - i.e. magazines, newspapers, periodicals, etc. I am not aware that there are any, meaning that per Wikipedia policy this article should be deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, please when debating this issue keep <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> in mind. Last debate, a few users were not so civil and as a result the discussion ended up going south pretty fast.</p>
<p>With all due respect to them, none of the writers from DVDR - be it Schneider, Rasmussen, Sweetser, or anyone else - has in any way significantly impacted the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a>--i.e. like a Scott Keith or someone like that. This is a fluff entry probably started by people who work for the web site and as we all know, Wikipedia is not meant for advertisements.</p>
<p>Specifically, it must meet this criteria:</p>
<p>Web specific-content<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> is notable if it meets <i>any one</i> of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.
<ul>
<li>This criterion excludes:
<ul>
<li>Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_commerce.html" title="Electronic commerce">online stores</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This criterion includes <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>The article itself <b>must</b> provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section. Even if an <i>entire</i> website meets the notability criteria, its <i>components</i> (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't particularly like or frequent it, but it's an <a href="../../../i/w/c/IWC_7432.html" title="IWC">Internet Wrestling Community</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smark.html" title="Smark">smark</a> cornerstone, with roots going back to 1995 on Usenet (group rec.sport.pro-wrestling). Professional wrestler <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Storm_c3c4.html" title="Lance Storm">Lance Storm</a> took the subject of their critique seriously enough.

<dd>Alexa rankings do not hold any relevance according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If you can show me where Wikipedia policy puts value to Alexa rankings, then I will withdraw that claim. Also, as established at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bleeding_Was_Only_Half_the_Job" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bleeding_Was_Only_Half_the_Job" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bleeding_Was_Only_Half_the_Job</a>, it does not matter at all whether professional wrestlers have in any way endorsed web sites or online articles about pro wrestling. It must have mainstream credibility (coverage in publications) to be featuredon Wikipedia. <b>Therefore, with all due respect, your argument does not hold much strength, Papacha.</b><a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 00:13, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ergo the yadda-yadda; <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is really a rough guideline.</dd>

<dd>Verbosity wasn't called for, as it wasn't the basis of my argument. Neither was <b>random bolding to get my point across</b>, for that matter. I'll <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and figure this has nothing to do with TheSmartMarks.com being recently <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_TheSmartMarks.com_094b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/TheSmartMarks.com">put up for deletion</a>, which you have been instrumental in trying to save. <a href="../../../p/a/p/User%7EPapacha_a178.html" title="User:Papacha">Papacha</a> 00:29, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not engaging in <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verbosity.html" title="Verbosity">verbosity</a>. As you can see by my extensive initial explanation at the top of this page, it is simply the way I write. I like to fully explain my point so that you know how I came to my conclusion. I will also <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and assume you did not realize this at first glance and misinterpreted by post. It is of my understanding that Lance Storm's involvement does not at all impact the notability of the entry's subject.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 00:47, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You do know that "verbosity" referred to <i>my</i> edit, yes? Otherwise, it seems you're prepped and ready for a argument (as you mention the degredation of the prior AfD) in which case I prescribe a cold bucket o' water and a deep breath. No one here's trying to escalate or be insultive, 'kay? <a href="../../../p/a/p/User%7EPapacha_a178.html" title="User:Papacha">Papacha</a> 00:56, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry but I am totally confused by what you mean by "You do know that "verbosity" referred to <i>my</i> edit, yes?".<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 00:59, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oy! This is going on <i>way</i> too long and taking away from the AfD at hand (this is Talk Page 101), but alright. "And yes, good Alexa ranking, yadda yadda" isn't being <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verbose.html" title="Verbose">verbose</a>. Heck, it barely qualifies as concise. What it means is I didn't expand on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa</a> because it wasn't my edit's <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linchpin.html" title="Linchpin">linchpin</a>, while in turn it was the first topic you expounded on in the reply.</dd>

<b>STRONG KEEP</b> I am only going to say this once: JB you are wasting everyone's time with your obsession to get this article deleted. It has survived your attempts in the past and yet you refuse to let it go. Be careful, repeatedly listing the same article for deletion is a violation of Wiki policy. I am going to get an admin to review this and possibly revoke this AfD. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 07:50, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- I presume this little spat in the professional wrestling community is as fake as the sport itself. Correct? -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't know how to answer the opening bell. My tastes for drooling fanaticism have altered over the years, and I'm sadly out of practice. Only a closet full of <i>WCW Prime</i> and assorted supershows stands as my sad legacy. Though it is a bit off this was nommed again so soon for deletion, just to segue this on a technicality. I rarely post to AfD, so y'all would know the criteria for keeping/cleaving an article far better than I. <a href="../../../p/a/p/User%7EPapacha_a178.html" title="User:Papacha">Papacha</a> 09:51, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A website should not have an article unless it has had a huge, profound effect on the real world, and a wrestling website does not meet this criterion. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 09:40, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
