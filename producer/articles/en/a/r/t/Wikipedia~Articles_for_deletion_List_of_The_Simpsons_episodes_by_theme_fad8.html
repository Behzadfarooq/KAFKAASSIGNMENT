<dd><b>Ammendment</b> - I also believe that with the 350+ individual articles on Simpsons episodes, there should be an article categorizing them, and this seems like the best way. The only other option I see would be to create categories for every theme ("Homer themed Simpsons episodes" category, "Marge themed Simpsons episodes" category, "Vacation themed Simpsons episodes" category, etc.) - <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaizersoze_5fee.html" title="User:Kaizersoze">Kaizersoze</a> 20:45, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Heh. If you're the creator, Kaizersoze, nice job, but why not just put it on a fansite or something? You're right that it's unique to the web, but Wikipedia is not a haven for rogue sites.

<dd><b>Comment</b> -I wouldn't have nominated if I thought it could be expanded to something useful.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Most people voting for 'Delete' on this page are not huge Simpsons fans. Take 'Carnildo' who posted 'I wouldn't object to deleting the Simpsons episode articles, as well'. Said opinions should be disregarded, as they are from sources whom wouldn't appreciate any article of 'The Simpsons'. The fact is, this article is an organised, and very useful summary of Simpsons episodes which is user friendly, and is great for reference, which is what Wikipedia is all about. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.39.html" title="User:195.93.21.39">195.93.21.39</a> 18:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>"Most people voting for 'Delete' on this page are not huge Simpsons fans"</i>?

<li><b>Comment</b>: Because the two (!) users above have not done this, I want to state that the Afd etiquette states: <i>Sign any recommendation or comment you add, by adding this at the end: ~~~~.</i> Also, my argument was about Wikipedia's status as an encyclopedia, a collection of knowledge, not any fan data anybody could possibly think of. I am a big Simspons fan myself (earlier seasons), but that does not change the validity of the one major <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">WP:WWINs</a> I listed in my initial post: <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i>. There has got to be a reasonable border between what is general useful and interesting knowledge and simply information for diehard fans - otherwise Wikipedia will welcome all data bins one that can possibly be come up with. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerofoks_be6e.html" title="User:Zerofoks">zerofoks</a> 14:26, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The information IS useful. At 350+ episodes, your average user wouldn't know where to BEGIN to search for a specific episode. With thematic divide, they can easily search for a particular episode via the sub-categories. It saves a lot of time for any user, and it is the type of thing many internet users would expect they could use Wikipedia for. Because it makes life much easier. Wikipedia is all about organised information, and this is exactly what this page is. Such a huge topic as 'The Simpsons' really does require this level of organisation, otherwise any other information becomes much less useful. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.39.html" title="User:195.93.21.39">195.93.21.39</a> 18:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Sure it is useful - somehow. Any type of information can be useful to someone (I doubt this article is useful to the average user, though). But is this encyclopedic? It has been pointed out that there are other, better places for this type of fan-info on the web. Sorting out rather unencyclopedic or very specific types of data to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikimedia_projects_6e29.html" title="Category:Wikimedia projects">other wikimedia projects</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWiki_communities_9539.html" title="Category:Wiki communities">other wiki communities</a> has been a generally accepted and successful policy on Wikipedia so far. Letting this article stay will only help to allow other types of extreme "fancruft" to enter Wikipedia - and there is no reason that would detain anyone from saving this article to a more appropriate place on the web. But I am repeating myself....--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerofoks_be6e.html" title="User:Zerofoks">zerofoks</a> 18:56, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
