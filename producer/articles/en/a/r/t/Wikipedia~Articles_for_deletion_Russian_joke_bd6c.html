<dd>Well, I am keeping an eye on this article with the very goal not to allow to turn it into a joke repository. It was separated by me from the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_humour.html" title="Russian humour">Russian humour</a> article. As it is kept now, I don't see how it can be worse than the very <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">Joke</a> article. This is not a repository of jokes created in Russia. It is a normal aricle that discusses types of jokes of <i>Russian peculiarity</i>, each topic being exemplified by 2-3 jokes. In particular it doesn't contain sex, wife/husband and other common topics. Knowing Rick as a reasonable editor, I am a bit surprised by this nomination. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 00:26, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Because I like it. Yes, it's skating on thin ice in many ways. But it's interesting. It's the result of a reasonable amount of work. It's not simply a repository of jokes, it's an attempt to indicate something about Russian culture as <i>illustrated</i> by jokes. It's not material that can easily be found in a better form in some other place; I know lots of places to go for jokes, but I don't know lots of places to go for <i>Russian</i> jokes. It appears to be the work of a reasonable number of collaborators and hopefully they know what they're talking about and are keeping an eye on verifiability, POV. (BTW: without examining the article I would have expected an article on "Russian jokes" to be about "Jokes told by English-speakers <i>about</i> stereotypic Russian immigrants." You know... as in the jokes told about another Slavonic ethnicity). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:32, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A place where the ice is particularly thin is that it borders on <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. A couple of references to scholar work on Russian humour would be handy. Despite my noticeable presence in the history of the article, my major contribution is trimming it mercilessly, and I have no particular scholar interest in humor. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 01:55, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, it's an article which contains jokes, not just a repository of them. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:48, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, concur with Rick. The jokes in the article are not inherently notable or encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:10, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a reasonable study of the <i>kinds</i> of humour one finds in Russian culture, and devotes adequate effort to explaining their context. A couple of examples of each type, which is mostly what we have, is quite reasonable. Equally it would be encyclopedic to have a "polish joke" article or "irish joke" article, but neither should turn merely into a list of jokes. This does need (and I don't think it has) a link to the "<a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Soviet_Russia_02dd.html" title="In Soviet Russia">In Soviet Russia</a>" joke meme (even if that's a meme Russians don't use). -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Fader_67b5.html" title="User:John Fader">John Fader</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Fader_436f.html" title="User talk:John Fader">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_Fader_67c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/John Fader">contribs</a>) 02:28, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It does not. It is an american joke. You are free to write Soviet emigree jokes article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 03:27, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It may be appropriate to rename this article Humor in Russia. If not, it probably needs to be listed on <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">WP:UA</a>, as precedented by <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_soap_radio.html" title="No soap radio">No soap radio</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meta-joke.html" title="Meta-joke">Meta-joke</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrhaspati_5095.html" title="User:Brhaspati">Brhaspati</a> (<sup><a href="../../../b/r/h/User_talk%7EBrhaspati_1f9e.html" title="User talk:Brhaspati">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brhaspati_b1d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brhaspati">contribs</a></sub>) 03:41, 2005 Mar 6 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is nothing unusual or hilarious in the article to be listed elsewhere other than in <a href="../../../j/o/k/Category%7EJokes_72ed.html" title="Category:Jokes">category:Jokes</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 06:25, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That was not my intention. The article itself is perfectly fine, but the title may make one believe that this is an <i>instance</i> of a Russian joke. My point about UA was to shield it from such assumptions, not to single it out. But of course, it was only a suggestion. -- <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrhaspati_5095.html" title="User:Brhaspati">Brhaspati</a> (<sup><a href="../../../b/r/h/User_talk%7EBrhaspati_1f9e.html" title="User talk:Brhaspati">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brhaspati_b1d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brhaspati">contribs</a></sub>) 12:48, 2005 Mar 6 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_humour.html" title="Russian humour">Russian humour</a> or baring that, <b>Keep</b>. We have an article on <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_have_two_cows.html" title="You have two cows">You have two cows</a>, so why not this? BTW, that comment box in the upper right of this nomination is hilarious. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 04:17, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've already written above, it was actually split off the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_humor.html" title="Russian humor">Russian humor</a> because of article size problems. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 07:18, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — it's an article about jokes, that happens to include examples. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Epopt_6905.html" title="User:The Epopt">➥the Epopt</a> 05:25, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with Kappa, John Fader and The Epopt. It's an article about various kinds of jokes in Russia, with examples of them, not just a big repository where people write their favourite Russian jokes. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 07:39, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article presents a whole definite slice of Russian culture. It can't be reduced without losing it's completeness. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 11:48, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC) The article seems to me so alive, that it cannot be deleted; only killed. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 14:29, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. It is a really good article, and not a repository of jokes. To be that it would have to have tons of examples under every topic... Even though we would come to a conclusion that it <b>DON'T</b> belong on Wikipedia, I think the content still should be saved and moved to wikibooks instead, where the article would be allowed to grow to enormous sizes. Btw... I think the article should be renamed.. Not sure what the new title should be though... --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstantin_bea4.html" title="User:Konstantin">Konstantin</a> 12:28, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> but also summarise briefly in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_humour.html" title="Russian humour">Russian humour</a>; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, so we can afford to keep this kind of article, especially if it's well written and interesting. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 17:15, 2005 Mar 6 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting and well-written article. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 19:18, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Comprehensive and useful article. Perhaps we can merge it with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_humour.html" title="Russian humour">Russian humour</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinadot_5292.html" title="User:Binadot">Binadot</a> 21:08, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it is no way a repository, I think we need such an article for every nation, any jokes represent some shared meaning between people and very closely relate to culture. BTW I agree that it should be renamed to something else, maybe to set a future standard for unambiguous naming of this class of articles <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnomz007_d993.html" title="User:Gnomz007">Gnomz007</a> 00:57, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not just a list by any means; it's a discussion of common themes in Russian jokes, and of their history, illustrated by examples. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 07:01, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I understand the arguments that this is supposed to be an article <i>about</i> a particular class of jokes rather than a listing <i>of</i> them, the current version does not read that way. I believe this would be better in the Jokebooks section of Wikibooks. (The Russian humor article can easily cross-link to it.) <b><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:Transwiki">Transwiki</a></b>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:58, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article gives pretty accurate insight on typical <i>anekdot</i> short stories, whose popularity in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> is on the same scale as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics.html" title="Comics">comics</a> in the US. The jokes might not be easily understandable due to cultural differences or translation difficulties, and being Russian, I don't think the selection of stories represents the best of the genre, but it's still a remarkable piece of work. A summary could be incorporated into the corresponding section of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_humour.html" title="Russian humour">Russian humour</a>. --<a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 16:24, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that rather than simply being a repositary of jokes, it is an attempt at showing the Russian sense of humour, largely via their jokes. However, maybe it could be shortened slightly and merged with 'Russian Humour'? - User:Bez</li>
