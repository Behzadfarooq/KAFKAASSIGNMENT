<p>This is schoolcruft at its max.

<li><b>Keep</b> The school is notable as an overcrowding reliever for an existing grossly overcrowded school, and what's the point of deleting an article just to have to place it back up when the school opens? Might as well keep it now. Plus, the school building may not be open, but the school is operating with 9th graders only at the Doral Middle School campus. <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a> 01:18, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Everybody always says this about "crystal ball" articles. But why not copy it to user space, leave it there, and create the article at a time when it is appropriate?

<li>But it's not a "crystal ball" article. It's something that we <i>know</i> will happen, already exists, and is already in progress.

<dd>Its atheltic rival has already been chosen since Miami Springs High School has no official rival and all the students at Regan/Doral will be taken from the Miami Springs Boundaries. But I guess it could be deleted until its official. Let's see what others think.
<dl>
<dd>Um, chosen by who? I can understand a rivalry happening, but it's not something mandatory. My HS didn't care about anybody we played more than anyone else. I'd say leave it off until the statement has some meaning. Like fighting over some trophy or mascot.

<dd>Yes, it is apart of the official name, no question. But, many articles don't have the *exact* official name as their article name. The exact name must always start the article, but it doesn't have to be the article title. A number of articles even have a message saying the article name is wrong for technical reasons. I just wander if there are potential problems with it. I'm not a wiki expert, but wanted to mention the issue, to get some feedback. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:11, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Disagree. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> is dead. <b>Requesat In Pace</b>. The fact is, (and clearly demonstrated here and the rest of this week's nominations) that there is indeed no concensus. All of the previous attempts to reach it over the past 2 years have failed - utterly. Deletionists (not necessarily <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a>), who have waged an ongoing, destructive, war of attrition against school articles would now like to re-open some sort of negotiations to re-wrangle through previously kicked-to-death-horse issues. I see this as nothing more than a last ditch attempt to stem the tide of two inevitabilities which are ruining their campaign: First, the exponential growth of the rate of creation of new school articles (virtually impossible to AfD them as fast as they are being created). Second, the near 97% rate of survival by school articles at the AfD process. Suggestions have emerged from deletionists that the AfD process is no good, and that a new concensus has to be reached. I submit that gradual and inevitable concensus is indeed being reached - school articles are being created at a never-before-seen rate, and they are surviving the AfD process at 95%+. What this means is that if there is not already a "concensus" (of a sort) that school articles will indeed be part of WP, then there soon will be. As the number of school articles grow and are improved over time, more and more editors will acknowledge their legitimacy, if only because there will be so many articles which will have been a part of WP for so long (by the time this is "over" it will literally be <b>years</b>). AfD is doing it's job (even though it is chronically being abused to launch terrorist strikes against school articles in the form of multi and mass-nominations) - editors are voting on articles, and the articles are surviving the process.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Keep" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Keep</a>. It's pretty obvious that this will be completed, and if it's not, it will become even more interesting if stopped at this late point.

<li>I'm almost lost for words— the thing is even written in the future tense. This is quite sad; would really like to have seen some evidence of non-partisan, knee-jerk-free commentary, but it's not to be I guess. Clear delete, not only for the usual reasons, but this time also for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball.</li>
