<p>No assertions of notability in the current revision of the article; I looked at previous revisions and I still didn't see much notable.

<dd>On a side note, the article was blanked by me since it contained a lot of stuff that would not be suitable on Wikipedia, due to our policy on living folks (<a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>). There also seems to be an edit war based on something that could have happened on Wikipedia.

<li>I'm a little concerned why I'm back on Articles for Deletion. I already survived one of these, and I can say that everything that was in the article was real, since I'm the actual person that it was about, I can say it's real. As this happened right after vandalism on my page, it just feels like the whole of Wikipedia is dumping on me because of this. I don't understand this deletion decision at all, honestly. <a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDopefish_fa91.html" title="User:Dopefish">Dopefish</a> 02:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>You didn't survive an AFD, it was withdrawn under very curious circumstances. This one will go the whole duration. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 03:44, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Very curious circumstances?" That's that in regards to? Until right now I always thought I survived, I didn't realize it was withdrawn. <a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDopefish_fa91.html" title="User:Dopefish">Dopefish</a> 04:21, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, isn't the nomination for deletion template used incorrect? There's a specific nomination tag for a second nomination; shouldn't that have been used instead of what is there now? <a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDopefish_fa91.html" title="User:Dopefish">Dopefish</a> 03:42, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, Joe Siegler was an important part of the section of gaming history that is <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apogee_Software_04e9.html" title="Apogee Software">Apogee Software</a>. He was a level designer on <a href="../../../r/o/t/ROTT_3c6a.html" title="ROTT">ROTT</a> and has made a notable contribution to every game they've released since the start of his employment, simply due to the nature of his job. TerminX 03:04, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> it's a rare forum mod who's notable enough for an article, and just participating in the design of a notable game doesn't make you notable. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 03:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: no reason not to mention him in the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apogee_Software_04e9.html" title="Apogee Software">Apogee Software</a> article, if its relevant. I don't see anything in the current content to warrant a seperate article. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 03:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I have researched individual employees of 3D Realms in college papers dealing with the early history of the company and the shareware marketing model. That Mr. Siegler has become notable for things other than game design does not detract from his contributions to the history of the Duke Nukem franchise and the early first-person shooter Rise of the Triad. Adding complete biographies of all 3D Realms and Apogee employees to the company entries is beyond the scope of those articles. --Aesire 03:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable person in regards to Apogee/3DRealms, with enough public history to warrent a personal article. Article could perhaps be expanded, but I'm curious as to the specific reasons for a deletion request, considering the content does not meet general guidelines for an article requiring deletion. Mblackwell 03:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The fact that he worked on ROTT does not make him notable. There were probably hundreds of other individuals who played some role in the development of Apogee's games. The article seems to me to be more of a resume than a biographical article on a notable individual. Being the moderator of forums for some websites does not make you notable enough for Wikipedia, nor does being one of several programmers for a major software title. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 16:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Nothing personal, but Microsoft has made a huge impact on the software industry, and we don't and shouldn't have biographies for every one of their employees. Unless he can be shown to be notable apart from working for a notable company or working on notable games, there's no reason for him to be on here. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahameS_afe0.html" title="User:GrahameS">GrahameS</a> 18:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> We can't have an article for everybody who works for something important. For example: I worked at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Charlotte_d3aa.html" title="University of North Carolina at Charlotte">my college</a>, and it is very important. Should I get my friends to write me an article? Also, anybody who contributes to the deletion discussion for an article about them probably is not important enough to have an article about them in the first place.

<li>As the consensus appears to be in favor of deleting this article, can we mark it for <b>speedy deletion</b>? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 02:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I added "software entrepreneur" to the first paragraph of the article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. If this were an article about the <i>founder</i> of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apogee.html" title="Apogee">Apogee</a> that would be different. But the webmaster? <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 07:30, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Apogee stuff on the page indicates that Apogee thinks he's an honest and reliable enough person to be trusted with the gold master, again, nothing particularly notable here.

<li><b>Delete</b> - fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for lacking multiple non-trivial articles by third parties; notability is questioned since I get only 147 distinct Ghits for "joe siegler", consisting mainly of forum postings and a few press releases that quote him.
