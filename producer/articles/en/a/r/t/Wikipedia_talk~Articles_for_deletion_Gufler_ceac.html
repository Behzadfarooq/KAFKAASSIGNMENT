	    <p>Albert H. Gufler, one of Emporia's influential citizens and business men, is a native of Kansas, born in Douglas county, Feb. 17, 1872. He is a son of Anton and Grace (Kellerman) Gufler, the former of whom was born in Germany and came to America in 1854. He located first in Chicago, where he was employed at his trade, as boiler maker, three years, and then, in 1857, came to Kansas, locating in Eudora, Douglas county, where he engaged in the mercantile business. He served in the United States commissary department throughout the whole of the Civil war. In politics he is a Democrat and in religion a Roman Catholic. He now resides at Lawrence, Kan.</p>
<p>Albert H. Gufler was educated in Endora and in Lawrence and is a graduate of the Eudora High School. During his high school course he spent his hours out of school in his father's grocery store, where he thoroughly learned every detail of the business. In 1887 he entered the employ of the Theo. Poehler Wholesale Mercantile Company, of Lawrence, Kan., in whose service he has continued to the present time, his ability and faithfulness having won him advancement, step by step, to his present position, that of a director of the company and manager of its branch business at Emporia, which latter position he has held since 1901. In 1892 he went on the road as salesman, in which capacity he served until located at Emporia. This company is incorporated, the main house being at Lawrence and a branch house at Emporia, the latter of which alone employes twelve salesmen and sells goods all over Kansas. Mr. Gufler began his business career as a poor boy, beginning at the lowest rung of the ladder, and his life has shown how a laudable ambition may be gratified when that ambition is accompanied by energy, integrity, perseverance, and business ability.</p>
<p>In 1899 was solemnized the marriage of Mr. Gufler and Miss Mary Hoffmans, of Burlington, Kan., daughter of Frank Hoffmans, a leading merchant of that town. Mr. and Mrs. Gufler have five children Wilhelmina, Dorothea, Albert H., Jr., Winifrede and Carleneâ€”the three eldest of whom are attending school. Mr. and Mrs. Gufler are Roman Catholics in church faith and membership. Mr. Gufler holds a life membership in Emporia Lodge, No. 633, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, in which order he is Past Exalted Ruler, and he is also a member of the Knights of Columbus, and the United Commercial Travelers of America. He takes an active interest in every movement for the general welfare and commercial advancement of Emporia, and was one of the committee of three which secured the paving of Main street in that city. At present he is serving as president of the Emporia Commercial Club.</p>
