<p>Most of this is original research and unsourced. List items are based on subjective judgment by editors as to the supposed atheistic nature of movies, books, etc. List criteria are vague, poorly defined, and overbroad, making the list an indiscriminate collection of information. In any case, a list of atheists in fiction ought to begin as a subsection of the main List of atheists. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 05:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> OR. Subheaders like "Books that generally are atheist in nature, although the main characters are not outwardly atheist," etc, are absurd and contrary to guidelines for lists. If it is kept, all OR should be eliminated. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 05:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Lack of sources is but one problem with this list. The main problem is that the list is original research, which is a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 18:35, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Listcruft - why exactly is this stuff needed or interesting?

<li><b>Delete</b> OR magnet, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a> - if the characters have no other thing in common and even that can't be verified, it's unlikely to be useful to readers. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 07:00, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Unsourced OR. Also inaccurate in that a number of the examples I spotted during just a quick glance at the list were of shows and/or characters said to be critical or skeptical of God. As theologians will tell you, that's not the same as being a true athiest. A (sourced) list of characters whose athiesm is a primary motivator -- as in that's what their character is all about -- might work, but I see too many POV judgement calls in this one. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I started the page, and I'd like to point out that Wikipedia already had a Category:Fictional atheists before I made my page. Why didn't that get deleted? I incorporated all names in that Category list. It's a good page, but I admit that I list some works in the first few sections that can be removed. Still, if you have 'List of fictional jews' and 'list of fictional catholics', you can have a fucking list of fictional atheists. And no, to address the question above, you can't just list a character if he/she never expressed belief in god- you have to cite an example of the char. saying something atheist or the like.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you guys delete this page while allowing 'list of fictional catholics' or 'list of fictional jews', it'll seem like Wikipedia is biased against atheism. Why allow those two pages if you aren't going to allow mine? Because fictional atheists aren't relevant enough?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please note that nominator is an atheist, and anti-atheist bias was not a motivation for nomination, but rather concern over the original research content of the list, which is counter to Wikipedia's policy. A list of fictional atheists might be appropriate for inclusion in the encyclopedia, but the list as currently written violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Deletion or a drastic rewrite with proper sourcing is needed. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 21:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep if properly sourced.</b> This is the kind of thing that during CfD we tend to say "delete category and listify". If every name on the list is properly referenced with an external source identifying the character as an atheist, then it can stay. Don't just pick sources that interpret the characters as atheist. We need to know that the original source of the characters clearly identify them as such. Otherwise, you'll also get into an atheist-or-agnostic debate about each. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 20:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - even a cursory glance demonstrates that this article is entirely unsourced OR and based only on one or more authors' impressions of what might or might not be "atheistic in nature." -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 22:52, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was under the impression that for something to be verifiable, it means that a person can go look in a book or other media and see that the info is true. On the page, I claim that certain characters say certain things in episodes of certain shows- a person reading it could go check for themselves if they wished. So why do I need to link to the proof for it to be verifiable? It's not like every fact in every article of Wikipedia has a cite to go along with it- some info is just stated, because the author knows people can go find the support for the info in a book or other media. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewdt85_00b5.html" title="User:Andrewdt85">Andrewdt85</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewdt85_762c.html" title="User talk:Andrewdt85">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andrewdt85_6192.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andrewdt85">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Andrewdt85, the problem is not that the things you cite aren't true. No one doubts that in X episode of Family Guy, Y character said Z. However, what you have done in this article is synthesized a lot of statements, events, and sources into an interpretation that is not, in and of itself, verifiable in third party sources.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 03:36, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">list of atheists</a></b> for notable atheist characters.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> was the primary concern here, and is a criterion for deletion of an article. Lack of sources is not a criterion for deletion of an article, but it <i>is</i> grounds for deletion of any material within an article that remains unsourced. If the article were merged, the vast majority of it would be deleted from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">List of atheists</a> for being unsourced. I agree that potential content on fictional atheists would be better maintained on the main list, at least until size concerns justify splitting the list. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 16:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as OR. Even if the OR were removed (essentially removing the content of the article), a list stemming from this topic is stupid and unmanageable. The existence of similar stupid and unmanageable lists elsewhere on wikipedia is an argument for deletion of those, not for retention of this.--<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 03:10, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> <b>Keep</b> If there can be a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_Catholics_f181.html" title="List of fictional Catholics">List of fictional Catholics</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictitious_Jews_fbb1.html" title="List of fictitious Jews">List of fictitious Jews</a>, why not atheists? Seems pretty biased to me. I say that if you don't keep, then you must delete this, and List of fictional Catholics, List of fictitious Jews and any similar articles. Obviously this article needs significant cleanup, but that isn't ground for deletion. A <b>merge with List of atheists</b> is also a possibility, but then you'd have to merge fictional catholics to list of catholics, etc. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnesh_5043.html" title="User:Arnesh">Arnesh</a> 04:27, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I reiterate that the primary grounds for deletion is the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> content of the article, which is a criterion for deletion in Wikipedia policy. I don't think anyone here has objected to creation of a List of fictional atheists that is not original research and which is well-sourced. There is no double standard. If List of fictional Catholics and List of fictitious Jews were primarily composed of original research, they would be appropriate candidates for deletion too. Merging of the small amount of properly sourced content of the List of Atheist fictional characters with the main <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">List of atheists</a> is in no a way binding precedent for merger of other lists of fictional religious adherents with lists of real-life religious adherents. If kept, significant cleanup of this list would involve deletion of most of the material. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 17:18, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: so I see that you deleted the article, even after I removed the OR in the first handful of stupid categories at the top of the page. Fine, then you must now delete the catholic and agnostic fictional character lists. Otherwise, you are favoring non-atheist lists. That wasn't your intention, but that is what you are doing.
