<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with GravityExNihilo &amp; Michael Johnson. Would like to add that when this article was nominated, the vast majority of it (2/3rds) was about the YouTube Censorship Controversy. That's why you'll see a lot of merge votes here and comments about "POV". Those pieces have since been edited out. As such there is nothing of note in this article that's not at <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemy_Challenge_6e6c.html" title="Blasphemy Challenge">Blasphemy Challenge</a>. For me it's a <b>strong delete</b>. YouTube Atheist should redirect there.

Those references all seem to deal with YouTube and the controversy around whether their actions were censorship.

<dd><b>Strong keep</b> For a start, this has been pruned away from the YT article (it's not called the 'Censorship' section anymore either), and it now just says main article - here. More importantly, it quite definitely meets the standards for Wikipedia inclusion. And much of the page was not written by the people concerned - I know, because I recognise the wording of the total banning part - some of that was identical to wording I had used in the <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> article, which was clearly cut and pasted onto this article. So the text was not written by those concerned (I'm quite definitely not NickG, and I am not a member of the RRS, although I agree with their aims etc.) <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhase_Theory_d0e1.html" title="User:Phase Theory">PT</a> 22:41, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The overwhelming majority (over 99%) of all topics that have been featured on multiple non-trivial news sources do not merit inclusion on Wikipedia. I see articles get deleted all the time that have appeared in much less trivial news sources than <i>Christian Today</i>. (Besides, neither of those articles are actually about "YouTube atheists". They're both about the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemy_Challenge_6e6c.html" title="Blasphemy Challenge">Blasphemy Challenge</a>, which was nevertheless recently deleted and merged into <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational_Response_Squad_67c2.html" title="Rational Response Squad">Rational Response Squad</a>.) So this article's only two reliable sources aren't actually <i>about</i> "Youtube atheists" (except indirectly), and all this article's other references (which are what are actually relied on for the overwhelming majority of the article's claims) are to YouTube pages, the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular_Student_Alliance_eb7b.html" title="Secular Student Alliance">Secular Student Alliance</a>, Nick Gisburne's personal homepage, and an unrelated University of Buffalo policy page. That's pretty damned unimpressive, especially compared to other Wikipedia articles which are billions of times more noteworthy and newsworthy than this one and yet are regularly deleted and merged. That's why Wikinews even <i>exists</i>—and this topic clearly falls far below the standards of Wikinews, so why do you think it satisfies the <i>much higher</i> standards of Wikipedia? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I just checked youtube, and it appears there are several hundred groups with way more members than "youtube atheists." As well, no sources suggested (other than people's youtube videos) have any mention at all of the group itself, but of the blasphemy challenge. Is it safe to say that this article is entirely delete-worthy <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravityExNihilo_1b3a.html" title="User:GravityExNihilo">GravityExNihilo</a> 11:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Perhaps this could be helped by a single sentence addition to the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a> page along the lines of: "The Internet is allowing Atheists to assert their views in new ways..." <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 06:15, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That'd be fine, if (1) we have reliable sources to back that claim up, and (2) it's highly noteworthy and non-trivial information. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 06:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So long as it isn't specific to any one group, due to the fact that there are significantly many atheist groups and all of which do not need specific notability given to them.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravityExNihilo_1b3a.html" title="User:GravityExNihilo">GravityExNihilo</a> 07:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
