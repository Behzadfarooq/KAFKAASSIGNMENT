<p>People from another website message board are using Wikipedia to validate their arguments. They feel if they post their side of an argument on Wikipedia, it becomes factual, and they win the argument. The people who created the "passion pit" article are all involved in slandering each other 24/7 on this website:</p>

<p>The "Passion Pit" Wikipedia article should be deleted as it currently reads for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1.) It amounts to nothing more than shameless promotion for the people specificly named in the article.</p>
<p>2.) It contains unverified assertions.</p>
<p>3.) It contains material that is clearly opnion.</p>
<p>These are not qualties of an encyclopedia article.</p>

<li>While the above are all reasons for editing rather than deleting, it also remains that this is an article about a discussion forum. If it really is 'one of the highest traffic boards on the internet' then this might be notable.

<p>This - 'one of the highest traffic boards on the internet' - is an opinion with no substantiation. People from that forum will edit the message with vulgarities and obscenities on a 24 hour basis to degrade other people. That is the sole point of the article. No academia, only petty wars. User:65.33.8.89 I was responsible for one of the early (18:55, 12 October 2005) edits of the Passion Pit article. That said, I now think it's a strong candidate for deletion. This article has been edited over fifty times in the past 24 hours. I believe it is extremely unlikely to ever serve any purpose other than that of a venue for an ongoing malicious edit war. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECactus_Wren_c120.html" title="User:Cactus Wren">Cactus Wren</a> 17:21, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The forum itself is only notable for its contention and vitriol. This contention has now been exported to Wikipedia. This is clearly a vanity article by the definitions of Wikipedia and should be deleted.</p>
<p>This board should not be deleted. It should be locked.</p>

<p>As DJ Clayworth mentions, vandalism alone is no reason for deletion. Anyway, had a look around, and it appears that IMDB has approx. 4 million users<a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:IY-t-NSOo90J:www.big-boards.com/board/926/+imdb+statistics&amp;hl=nn&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:IY-t-NSOo90J:www.big-boards.com/board/926/+imdb+statistics&amp;hl=nn&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which I would say is enought to make it a notable bbs, although I don't know the specifics about this particular board. One option might be to create an article for the IMDB bbs, if it doesn't already exist, and then merge this into that article, or to create a Category:imdb-forums, and list any other (if they exist) notable IMDB forums. Although this won't help regarding the vandalism, the article would be placed in a better context. Any comments to this?</p>
<p>BTW: please remember to sign the posts, even if you are an anon user. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">bjelleklang</a> 19:45, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I support keeping the page as a valid reference (The Passion of the Christ message board is one of the largest and most frequented on the IMDB), but support locking it to prevent contentious changes. -JK 11:02 PM EST, Oct. 14 2005</p>
<p>Though it is heavily trafficked by a limited number of users, it is not one of the largest on the IMDB. In fact, the IMDB administrators have limited its size. The board was certainly a phenomenon in the year leading up to and during the time of the movie's release, and that might make an interesting subject for an encyclopedia entry. But to give it an entry such as is currently composed is again, simply an sop to the vanity of a number of people who continue to post there.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the moment, people on that forum are affraid to edit the article, because a user there posted on the Passion forum the IP Addresses of all the people debating here on this Wikipedia page. IMDb took action and removed the thread (IMDb protects privacy), but obviously it proves the people on that forum will do ANYTHING to hurt other people, including invading their privacy. User:65.33.8.89</p>
<p>Lastly, there are at least 75 forums that not only have heavier traffic than the Passion forum, but also have at least 5x the messages. The Passion forum has an average of 100 threads daily, whereas at least 75 other forums have 500 daily threads. The Main Boards (general topics) of IMDb alone eclipse the Passion forum in traffic rate and number of messages, not including the boards for newly released films and soon-to-be-released films.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This should be first merged into a new in-depth article called "IMDB trolling phenomena", which then would, due to nonnotability, be merged into the main IMDB article, and edited for NPOV, encyclopedic relevancy and style, after which all that would be left is "The database is known for their message boards. It is frequently alleged that the users are <i>not</i> very good at debating." In other words, it's just not worth the effort. (And finally, a comment: Anyone care to reformat this AfD a little? It's a bloody eyesore. If I have to ask "where do I sign" when adding stuff to the thing, it's a <b>bad</b> sign.) --<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a> 22:27, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>According to an IMDb Adminstrator, it is not possible to deduce the busiest boards: <a href="http://imdb.com/board/bd0000041/inline/27990906?d=28128858#28128858" class="external free" title="http://imdb.com/board/bd0000041/inline/27990906?d=28128858#28128858" rel="nofollow">http://imdb.com/board/bd0000041/inline/27990906?d=28128858#28128858</a> <a href="http://imdb.com/board/bd0000041/inline/27990906?d=28145662#28145662" class="external free" title="http://imdb.com/board/bd0000041/inline/27990906?d=28145662#28145662" rel="nofollow">http://imdb.com/board/bd0000041/inline/27990906?d=28145662#28145662</a></p>
<p>If this "article" is merged, all of these IMDb forums (to name a few) must be named in the merging, because if you skim them, you'll find they have 10x the amount of traffic than the Passion forum: The Soapbox The Sandbox I Need To Know Film General Music Books Horror Sport Best And Worst Games Video Games Jennifer Lopez Johnny Depp Tom Cruise Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith Batman Begins Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) George W.
