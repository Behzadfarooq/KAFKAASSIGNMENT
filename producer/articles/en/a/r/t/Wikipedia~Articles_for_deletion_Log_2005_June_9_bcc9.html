<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b>. Two votes for delete, three for merge, three for keep = a clear consensus to keep the information, just not a consensus on where to put it. Merge if you like. I am, however, moving it to the correct name. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 18:19, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article describes (very briefly) a real grammatical category in many languages - e.g., <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Quotative+evidential+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Quotative+evidential+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Not sure if quotative and hearsay markers should get their own article or just be redirected to <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidentiality.html" title="Evidentiality">Evidentiality</a>.--Chris Johnson 04:31, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In response to Tony, who I think makes some good points, I would have to say that the notability is more important than interest. Wikipedia does not cover every thing that is interesting to someone, rather only <i>notable, important, influential</i> ones and this page is none of those. The site is literally a joke. Geogre and jglc make good points. The article says nothing about the website that is significant, it just mentions its existence. Every single website on the internet does not deserve its own Wikipedia article because it is interesting to a few people, unless the site actually has a significant impact on something. -- <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 05:05, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I find myself in full agreement with all the arguments in favor of deletion, except the particular one that this article is deletable. This is in my opinion a truly remarkable site, a boys' illustrated war story transformed into a grotesquely absurd and comic sadomasochistic fantasy. While I understand that there are many samizdat works similar to this in Japanese manga and anime, I believe that this work may well be <i>sui generis</i> in European folk art. It has much of the exuberance and energy of obscene toilet graffiti. So I just cannot bring myself to vote for deletion. This is quite simply the most remarkable website I have ever encountered. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:41, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The argument is not whether or not the site is academic or interesting; it is whether it is notable enough in its interest to be retained. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 13:23, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Not necessarily. There is no consensus for website notability, and I'm sure we have many non-notable websites that have been kept. There is room in Wikipedia policy for the exercise of discretion. This website is indisputably non-notable but this doesn't mean it should necessarily be deleted. If it's deleted I'll probably include it in an article about the use of graffiti in art and the artistic role of vandalism. From toilet walls to Orton and Halliwell's defaced library books, it's a very interesting subject. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:40, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I like that idea, actually. Why not add a subsection (essentially a <b>merge</b>) to an artistic vandalism article (is there one? If not, it sounds like a wonderful idea) and <b>redirect</b> from the current article. I don't feel as though it deserves a standalone entry, but it would be a great case study. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 15:36, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> That is true, but why not set the notibility bar very low, just above vanity pages? There seems to be enough room to accomodate interesting yet esoteric pages. In fact I'd allow vanity pages as long as they were <i>verifiable</i> as notibility it seems is a POV concept that is apt to be abused esp. when censoring controversial ideas.

As for whether I am published or not, I should imagine that you have no idea, as I haven't written an article about myself or my real name. Would it change anything if I were really Dr. Bigshot at Prestige U.? No. The least talented child can tell good writing from bad, good painting from bad, and anyone on Wikipedia can assess whether an article is an advertisement and puff piece or not.

<li><b>Keep</b> Donna Denize is an incredible teacher, philosopher, and a friend to all those whom she knows. After just completing two semesters of ninth grade english with her, I am convinced that Ms. Denize is worthy of having a web page on Wikipedia because of her unique teaching style and her love of literature and passion for art. Ms. Denize is committed to educating her students about society's evils and downfalls and convincing the future generations (me) that change is necessary in this country's policies concerning war, government, and education. If people want to know more about her, there should be a medium to inform people of her life, and I believe that Wikipedia should take responsibility for its mission in this incredible web site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.200.254.34 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.200.254.34_9b3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.200.254.34">contribs</a>) 15:50, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC).</small>

<li>While I vote a <b>weak keep</b> as well, the anonymous, assumedly 14- or 15-year-old, user is entirely incorrect. "...her unique teaching style and her love of literature and passion for art" are in <i>no means</i> the reason for anyone at all to have a Wikipedia entry. In fact, if someone's wikipedia entry was based solely on their "love of literature," that would be a good candidate for a VfD. The reason that Ms. Denize deserves a wikipedia article is for her contributions to the field of literature and teaching - not her personality. In addition, let me note that she is <i>not</i> a philosopher. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 15:54, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>On the other hand, there were only 64 hits for the search string "Donna Denize." 39 of these were unique hits.

<li><b>Keep</b> A political office is a political office, and the holder of one is a politican. Many Americans are uninformed about the vital role that Soil and Water Conservation Districts play in the absolutely necessary agricultural community. The goal of this article is to act as a reference to concerning the work of one such individual serving on a SWC Board. More of this individual's work on the board will be posted in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover there is not enough information in Wikipedia concerning local-level politicians, except of course in large cities. This is an unjust double standard that works against smaller communities, although they are just as unique as their larger cousins. Wikipedia should work to correct this bias against small localities and recognize their important contributions to the fabric of America. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhatores_4d5c.html" title="User:Khatores">Khatores</a></p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. This is really an effort to combine several tertiarily related topics (which already have articles) into a single article.

<li>Delete: I'm afraid that I can't quite agree, although I would like to, that there is a salvage here. My biggest problem is the nebulousness of the name, which requires an ill-jointed discussion. There are nuggets here and there that ought to be preserved, but these aren't very substantial. Until the 1960's, sharing a bed would have been the fate of most children, so any scandalousness is either because of the euphemism or because of our reactions to the pedophilia scares of the 1980's. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:43, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was -- The option that appeals most to me is the last one given - Nuke the article (It has <i>no unique information</i>; two of the names are red, and the only blue name is already in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_mathematicians.html" title="Indian mathematicians">Indian mathematicians</a>) and then move Indian mathematicians to this article.

<li>What program do you think "20 GOTO 10" represents? This <i>isn't the name of the program</i>. (That would be something like "HELLO.BAS".) It's just one line of code <i>from</i> the program. Programmers do not refer to this program by the name "20 GOTO 10". And there are plenty of <i>other</i> programs that happen to contain this line of code, such as <a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n12/209_Outpost_Atari.php" class="external text" title="http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n12/209_Outpost_Atari.php" rel="nofollow">this one</a> or <a href="http://kasoft.freeyellow.com/Central/Kasoft/Typeset/BBC/Ch46.html" class="external text" title="http://kasoft.freeyellow.com/Central/Kasoft/Typeset/BBC/Ch46.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, that have nothing whatever to do with this article. Programmers refer to these as <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_loop.html" title="Infinite loop">infinite loops</a>. The only thing that "20 GOTO 10" <i>is actually the name of</i> is, ironically, <a href="http://www.beefterminal.com/music/musicmain.html" class="external text" title="http://www.beefterminal.com/music/musicmain.html" rel="nofollow">an album</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:38, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article about <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_world_program.html" title="Hello world program">hello world programs</a> <i>does</i> comprise examples in many programming languages. The <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_world_program.html" title="Hello world program">hello world program</a> article is <i>not</i> entitled 10 PRINT "Hello World", after one line of code in one "hello world" program in one particular programming language. Drawing an analogy to <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_world_program.html" title="Hello world program">hello world program</a> also draws our attention to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_loop.html" title="Infinite loop">infinite loop</a>. And, I often RENUMbered from 100, anyway. ☺ This is the wrong title. <b>Merge</b> as per everyone else. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:28, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are suggesting merging this because it has "the wrong title"? It makes a horrible fit with <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goto.html" title="Goto">Goto</a>. Also it gets far more google hits (11,700) than 200 goto 100 (88). <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:16, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Google hits are a poor metric in this case, and are an entirely useless mechanism for deciding upon a sensible encyclopaedia article title here. There's an awful lot of source code indexed by Google Web, and random lines of code are not sensible encyclopaedia article titles. The fact that, for example GOTO :LOOP gets <i>three times that number of hits</i> doesn't mean that it is a sensible article title. Another example: puts("hello world") gets <i>over a million</i> hits, but no experienced C programmer will tell you that that is a sensible title for the article that we actually have at <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_world_program.html" title="Hello world program">hello world program</a>, even though that latter only garners roughly 55,000 hits, 1/20th of the number that the line of C code does. The best solution is transwiki to Wikibooks and then merge to <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QBasic:Flow_Control" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:QBasic:Flow_Control">Wikibooks:QBasic:Flow Control</a>, since this is really the annotated development of one specific small BASIC program. But since <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">JIP</a> thinks that the article should be kept, a merger, either to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_loop.html" title="Infinite loop">infinite loops</a> or to <a href="../../../g/o/t/GOTO_4b8b.html" title="GOTO">GOTO</a>, is a compromise. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:38, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)</li>
<li>Using the default increment the next line number after 100 is 110, not 200, by the way. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:38, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Actually, if the focus of the article is the line of code "20 GOTO 10", which it is <i>purported</i> to be, it is. The description of this line of code given in the article "repeats the PRINT command in the program without stopping", is, simply, false. (I've linked to two examples above where "20 GOTO 10" doesn't "repeat PRINT commands" <i>at all</i>.) If the focus is <i>not</i> "20 GOTO 10", then this isn't about the line of code, but about a specific program containing that and another line of code, and the article is <i>at the very least</i> mistitled because the line of code is not the name of the program, as already explained. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:38, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep (BloodOfThePoet)</b>Since "Islamophobic/Islamophobia" exists in the popular consciousness, the world press, and the educational establishment -and is gaining ground in the approved lexicon, there is a need to explore its conceptual antithesis, for a host of reasons: including the analytical, political, aesthetic, religious, philosophical, linguistic and even the counter-propagandistic. I commend the article writer, since, in contrast with at least 75% of what gets accepted in the Wikipedia 'canon', this submission is commendably researched, factually reinforced, literate, and, considering the comments for deleting it (a revealingly passionate compendium of reinforcing "interests" in something usually deadeningly dry and stultifyingly neutral like the discussion of a neologism), has hit such a nerve, that, for this reason alone, "Islamophila" deserves to remain. It will draw many new eyes to Wikipedi, and will allow scholars to fulfill their proper function of expanding the understanding of the human intellectual experiment. I find nothing offensive, anti-religious, biased, bigoted or improper with this article or this ingenious coinage. Keep it, and let it become enriched as the understanding of the word, and is roots, deepen in the interpenetration of cultures, "East" and "West". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.20.176.72 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.20.176.72_0161.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.20.176.72">contribs</a>) 04:05, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></s></li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> This is not an anti-islam propaganda article. It just describes people who try to atribute unreasonable characteristics to islam, and actually end up doing harm to Islam, for example, claiming that the Quran contains new scientific theories in a cryptic form, which, if decoded, can change the world, etc. I can understand that islamophiles would love to see such an article deleted, since they love to whitewash anything that THEY THINK reflects badly on Islam, or stops short of attributing to Islam all the best qualities possible.

<li><s><b>Keep but overhaul</b> - The article is meant to describe a certain ideology, not to "target" it. Unfortunately, the article is defintely not NPOV in its present form, and was probably written as a reaction to the POV article on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a>. However, I don't see how it is "irrational." Semitophilia does not exist, so there is no article on it. This cannot be said about Islamophilia which is a reasonably popular ideology. A small example is <a href="http://www.islam-is-the-only-solution.com/science.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.islam-is-the-only-solution.com/science.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> Although it needs to be overhauled, I am surprised that people want it (and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a> )to be deleted. There is no dearth of articles on wikipedia which produce less than 10 google results, and I checked on FAQs that low google hits is not a sufficient reason for deletion. The term has a very healthy web search to group search ratio on google, so it doesn't seem to be promoted by any one particular group. I don't think it is not a good idea to delete articles simply because in their present form they are POV. There's a POV tag for that. Also, google "Islamophilie" (French for Islamophilia) and you'll get many more hits, and some pages belong to the 90s, even before September 11, etc, so the term is not very new either. ~~deeptrivia</s></li>

As for the argument that an article about "Islamophilia" makes it "fair" to have an article about Islamophobia: I see no "Semitophilia" articles! No "homophilia" articles (simply redirection to the homosexuality page). An encyclopedia cannot contain this bias. No "Islamophilia" nonsense, please.

<p>I suggest deleting the whole article. The contents could be moved to cs:Wiki then. The article generally seems to be of the vanity type. The sport successes listed seem to have even factual errors. Person covered here is just a Czech regional politician. Mentioning him among the short list of other [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Czech_politicians" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Czech_politicians" rel="nofollow">Czech_politicians</a>] on English Wiki doesn't fairly address his importance. Only politicians who have had either a non disputed role in the history of the country or who's international relevance is obvious should be covered here. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneliner_6e64.html" title="User:Oneliner">Oneliner</a> 08:30, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've first spotted this article a long time ago and from the editing history it was almost certain that created by the person itself as a vanity page. Maybe this knowledge made me biased since. Listing this particular person among the very sparse list of Czech politicians creates an unrealistic idea of his importance within the political scene. But let's look at the facts: there are 77 such towns within the country. Or from the other side, he is also a member of the regional council, that makes him one of approx. 700 peers and yet he is the only one noted on wiki. Add to it some 300 higher (Parliament, Government) level politicians, say exchanged fully every 12 years, that makes 3500+ of people just in the Czech Republic. Of all of these, there are 12 Czechs in the politicians category here on english Wiki. None of them being "just" a mayor or regional council member. See my point? The notability should be judged within the playground we're all playing at. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneliner_6e64.html" title="User:Oneliner">Oneliner</a> 11:57, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Oneliner, all your arguments seem to me to suggest that we should expand our coverage of Czech politicians, a sentiment I heartily endorse.

<dd>Important Czech politicians like prime ministers are getting covered, although slowly. Members of EU parliament were all covered (quite easy since they must have Web page with detailed biography). Coverage of local Czech politicians should start on Czech Wiki, we here have not enough of means to do it, unfortunately. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 17:58, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly! A much wider coverage of Czech politicians would make the general reader's view of the Czech political sceme biased and sort out naturally most of the reasons I oppose this article for. But unfortunately the number of articles didn't get higher in last two months and there isn't much hope that it soon will. Mainly for the reasons Pavel Vozenilek has stated below. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneliner_6e64.html" title="User:Oneliner">Oneliner</a> 22:43, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The page was originally created by person who created <a href="../../../j/a/b/Jablonec_nad_Nisou_a32a.html" title="Jablonec nad Nisou">Jablonec nad Nisou</a> city article and added city template for US town. This template has line for mayor so short article was added. While mayor of quite big city is notable person reality of <u>current</u> English Wikipedia says such articles are not maintainablen now because:
<ul>
<li>there are about dozen or few dozens of Czechs on English Wikipedia and they have usually better topics to work on than local Czech politicians (only Jiri Cerovsky and <a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavel_Bem_77af.html" title="Pavel Bem">Pavel Bem</a>, current mayor of Prague has been created, the second one being quite important political figure).</li>
<li>local Czech politicians are not yet covered on Czech Wikipedia, for exactly the same reason</li>
<li>these politicians do not have Web pages and finding any relevant information is every hard, lest you live in the place and carefully read local newspapers (w/o web archives). I had problem to find online biography on Cerovsky even when he's long term mayor. The only one available was one paragraph from his election materials, not something one would put high hope of validity and neutral point of view.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>While in ideal world such politicians should get covered current state won't allow to maintain such articles in reasonable quality.

<li>Hopelessly misguided. A hint for the author: speed of light in vacuum is always constant, and doesn't depend on its frequency (or on the relative speed of the source and the observer; see <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_relativity.html" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a>). <b>Delete</b>. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a>

<li>Response: I know. But I want to know how the constant speed of light squares with the Doppler effect between monochromatic light and white light. The Doppler effect shows a change of frequency which seems to imply a lower speed of approach. Arthur Hinks.
<ul>
<li>No, change of frequency does not imply a change in speed of light. (Once again, speed of light in vacuum is always constant.) It implies a change of its <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave_length.html" title="Wave length">wave length</a>. The following equation holds for the wave length of light (and any other wave):<br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/9/c/49c9fb6cd10c1275cc9e4ab5136c4e8f.png" alt="\lambda = \frac{c}{f}" /><br />
Where λ is the wave length, c is the speed of the wave's propagation, and f is frequency. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 17:02, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Thanks Mike but back again!</b> If a fixed frequency approaches me with the speed of light and I am receding at half the speed of light its frequency will <b>appear</b> to be reduced. This makes me think that I must be receiving it more slowly and I am stuck on this point. It looks like simple logic and the fallacy is eluding me. Arthur Hinks.</p>

<p>I DIDN'T MEAN SLOWED DOWN. Sorry I misled you! Please, please comment on this new summary;- IN A NUTSHELL: A red shifted hydrogen marker strikes us at a lower frequency, telling us that WE must be receding from it’s source (Hubble).

<li>Thank you for your advice. I think that it might fit in WikiBooks, as it a major part of Number Theory. However, I think that wikipedia would be a good place for it as there are multiple other pages on Number Theory and such.

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe an encyclopedic article could be written on this topic, as for "how-to" argument, well, every algorithm could be considered a how-to, yet we have pages on different algorithms (sorting, prime tests and other mathematical problems).

<li><b>Keep</b> Qualifies as encyclopedic: number base calculation is both a notable and important activity in mathematics and computing.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: 1)There are 11,500 google hits, a medical paper, and a BBC article on the subject. 2)The user that nominated the VfD also put an NPOV tag on it, even though, IMO, there is little reason for it. The entry seems neutral to me (though in the past it has had problems, per the history), it's just that Whig (per the talk page) seems to vehemently disaggree with the assertations made by the scientist(s) noted (rather than the tone and language of the article).

<ul>
<li>First, it's not a "new article"- it's 25 months old. Second, it's not "unnecessary" by any known wikipedia standards. And third, the article is not attempting to pathologize healthy eating, it is simply reporting a phenomena that is both recognized in popular culture, and a legitamate object of scientific study. --Jeffrey O. Gustafson 01:46, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"The average vegan weighs 23 lbs. less than a non-vegetarian and 12 lbs. less than a dairy vegetarian according to the isocaloric research studies of Dr. Mervyn Hardinge."

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Regardless of whether we agree with the contents of the article, "orthorexia nervosa" has entered standard lexicons and <i>encyclopedias</i> of disease.

Also, see the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_years_in_television.html" title="List of years in television">List of years in television</a>—years 1907, 1908, and 1923, which are also not rich with events, are listed there without a corresponding article.

<dd>My main objection is that it breaks the flow of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_years_in_television.html" title="List of years in television">years in television</a>. All these articles are interlinked (e.g., 1988 would point to 1987 and 1989). 1900 cannot be interlinked this way. While Wikipedia is indeed not paper, I still don't see why 1900 should be kept, especially when 1907, 1908, and 1923 (not to mention all the years in between) are non-existent. I will have no objections to (re-)creating these articles when they have more content than current one-liners (remember, the information in the article will not be lost, but merely moved to the main list of years). I understand this reasoning of mine may still not be good enough for some voters to vote in favor of deletion, but I feel that I should let it be known.

<li>The Google search I did was for "Bob and George" (in quotes like that) along with the word "comics."

<li><b>Comment</b> - Andrew mentioned that he's heard of it, but I don't know if he's really into comics or not. I'm not a comic aficionado at all, but I'd heard of it. For me that's a rule of thumb when judging notability - if the word's gotten around enough that someone like me, who's not into the overall genre has heard of it, then it must be notable. Of course the converse of that wouldn't neccesarily be true. But yeah - since I've heard of it, and I'm not a comics or web comics fan (and don't have any kind of personal connection with the authors and they don't live in my area) then it's notable. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 19:24, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>. The West Mersea Yacht Club is a notable UK yacht racing club having sponsored international yacht racing meetings. It is a properly constituted yacht club, founded in 1899 with a formal yacht club structure and a warrant from the UK Ministry of Defence for its members to fly an approved defaced ensign. It merits a mention in respected yacht racing handbooks. Its burgee is internationally recognised. The category 'Yacht Clubs' would look very odd if only certain clubs were allowed; I note that the New York Yacht Club and the Golden Gate Yacht Club and others are allowed a page. The fact that its own page is under construction (replacing a previous site) has nothing to do with it. --194.80.134.139 21:26, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Supposedly a disambiguation page for the phrase "Super Mario RPG."

When Paper Mario was first announced, it was claimed to be the sequel (I don't think it is considered to be "official" sequel even the Wikipedia "Super Mario RPG" stated, "No official sequel to Super Mario RPG was ever released...") of the original Super Mario RPG. However, it just doesn't make sense that the lowercase "mario" article is a disamb while the capitalized "Mario" article directs to the original game. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChill_Pill_Bill_4117.html" title="User:Chill Pill Bill">Chill Pill Bill</a> 00:13, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
