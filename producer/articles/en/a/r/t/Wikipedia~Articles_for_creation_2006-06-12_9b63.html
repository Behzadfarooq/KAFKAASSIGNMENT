<p>Ground clearance refers to the shortest distance between a flat, level surface, and any part of a <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehicle.html" title="Vehicle">vehicle</a> other than what's designed to contact the ground (such as tires, tracks, skis, etc.). Ground clearance is measured with standard vehicle equipment, and for <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">cars</a>, is usually given with no cargo or passengers.</p>
<p>Ground clearance is a critical factor in several important characteristics of a vehicle. For all vehicles, most notably <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">cars</a>, it's a tradeoff between <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handling.html" title="Handling">handling</a> and practicality. A higher ground clearance means that the center of mass of the car is higher, which makes for less precise and more dangerous handling characteristics (most notably, the chance of <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rollover.html" title="Rollover">rollover</a> is higher). However, it also means that the car is more capable of being driven on roads that are not level, without the road scraping against and likely damaging the chassis and underbody. This is why <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_car.html" title="Sports car">sports cars</a> typically have very low clearances, while <a href="../../../s/u/v/SUV_9cd0.html" title="SUV">|SUV's</a> have higher ones. Two well-known extremes of each are the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrari_F40_1703.html" title="Ferrari F40">Ferrari F40</a> and the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hummer.html" title="Hummer">Hummer</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_fighting_vehicle.html" title="Armored fighting vehicle">armored fighting vehicles</a> (AFV), ground clearance presents an additional factor in a vehicle's overall performance, and that's that a lower ground clearance means that the vehicle minus the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chassis.html" title="Chassis">chassis</a> is lower to the ground and thus harder to spot and harder to hit. The fianl design of any AFV reflects a compromise between being a smaller target on one hand, and having greater battlefield mobility on the other. Very few AFV's have top speeds at which car-like handling becomes an issue, though rollovers can and do occur. By contrast, an AFV is far more likely to need high ground clearance than a road vehicle.</p>
<p>Lowering a car's <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspension_%28vehicle%29.html" title="Suspension (vehicle)">suspension</a> is a common and relatively inexpensive aftermarket modification. Many people prefer the more aggressive look of a lowered body, and there is an easily realized handling improvement. Most passenger cars are produced such that one or two inches of lowering won't increase the probability of damage significantly.</p>

<p>From 1997 to 2002, <b>AMOR BELHOM DUO</b> was <b>NAIM AMOR</b> (vocals, guitars, violin and samplers) and <b>THOMAS BELHOM</b> (percussion, drums, accordion, vocals), both from Paris, France and living in Tucson, Arizona in the United States. <b>MARIANNE DISSARD</b> contributed lyrics in French and English.</p>
<p><i>"Dark, tropical, tribal pop, Naim Amor and Thomas Belhom's Amor Belhom Duo is hauntingly beautiful, capable of capturing you with spooky, mystical singer-songwriter pop with a French twist one minute and stun you with jazzy, tropical tribal experimentation the next. This is a diverse album, one that is hard to get into at first. But as soon as you listen to it enough, you'll be so mesmerized, it will flow, eloquently, from style to style, track to track. And it is because of that this album will become a long lasting favorite in your collection. I'll give it an A-."</i>(Alex Steininger)</p>
<p><br />
Before forming their "avant-French pop" duo and regularly collaborating with Tucson-based Touch And Go artists Joey Burns and John Convertino from CALEXICO, Naim and Thomas belonged to bands ranging in style from early Parisian hardcore (WITCHES VALLEY) to experimental musical and theatrical political avant-garde (from 1992 to 1997, in GENERATION CHAOS, performing experimental music with contemporary music percussionist/composer Jean-Charles François - director of UCSD music school from 1972 to 1986- and stage director Marc O').</p>
<p><b>1995</b> Naim and Thomas meet then-filmmaker Marianne Dissard (who directed the Giant Sand documentary "Drunken Bees") and compose the soundtrack to her French TV documentary "Low Y Cool". Naim visits Tucson, Arizona where Marianne resides and begins collaborating with her on some songs, which would form the basis of the first Amor Belhom Duo album.</p>
<p><b>1997</b> Amor Belhom Duo is formed. Relocating to Tucson, Arizona, they start regular close collaborations with JOEY BURNS and JOHN CONVERTINO from that other fine Tucson duo, Calexico.</p>
<p><b>1998</b> In May 98, AMOR BELHOM DUO records its first full-length album, WAVELAB PERFORMANCE, in Tucson at the Wavelab Studio (recording home to the likes of Giant Sand, Howe Gelb, Calexico, OP8...). With that album, the Duo attempts the challenge of translating their original style of live performance onto tape, through a four days recording session. The 11 tracks album features guest performers Joey Burns and John Convertino, whom Naïm and Thomas later back up on stage, in San Francisco at the Great American Music Hall, in LA at the Troubador, in Austin at the South By Southwest Conference. WAVELAB PERFORMANCE is self-released on CD through the Duo's own label, NORMANDIE DREAM RECORDS.</p>
<p><b>1999</b> In May 1999 , the Duo returns from its first very successful and critically acclaimed US west coast tour (opening for Sparklehorse in San Francisco at the Great American Music Hall, playing Café du Nord in San Francisco, and clubs from Seattle to San Diego) to record its second album, the self-titled AMOR BELHOM DUO.</p>
<p><b>2000</b> French label ICI D'AILLEURS (home of Yann Tiersen, Married Monks, Madrid, Bed...) releases the self-titled album in Europe and label SAIDERA RECORDS in Japan.</p>
<p>Also out is collaborative album TETE A TETE by ABBC, i.e. AMOR- BELHOM- BURNS-CONVERTINO on WABANA RECORDS in the US, Saidera Record/Japan, Vicious Circle/France</p>
<p>After performing at SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST 2000 as music festival sponsor Tucson Weekly's regional band of choice, Amor Belhom Duo tours Europe with David Grubbs, Quentin Rollet and Noël Akchoté (label Rectangle), appearing at festivals Printemps de Bourges and Transmusicales de Rennes.</p>
<p>A fall 2000 european tour includes dates with Giant Sand, Calexico, the release of tour-only CD, ANY TIME ANY WAY, and the music video for title "Pulling On A Cig", directed by Marianne, appearing on French music channels MCM and M6.</p>
<p><b>2001</b> Invited back at SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST 2001, Amor Belhom Duo then heads back to Europe for a six countries tour, in support of the release by Ici d'Ailleurs of album WAVELAB (the reproduced, remixed, remastered version of the original 1998 Wavelab Performance, the Duo's first album). Later that spring, the release of albums Wavelab and Amor Belhom Duo by Chicago-based label CARROT TOP is followed by a US tour opening for labelmates Handsome Family.</p>
<p><b>2002</b> Amor Belhom Duo collaborates with Valerie Leulliot from French band Autour de Lucie on a live album, recorded in Tucson at Solar Culture by Jim Waters. The album, LIVE IN TUCSON, is released by Ici D'Ailleurs in Europe. Amor Belhom Duo opens for French pop star MIOSSEC in France and disbands after that tour. NAIM and THOMAS start solo careers, under their respective names and on their respective sides of the Atlantic, while, in 2005, MARIANNE begins singing under the helm of Joey Burns.</p>

<p>French-born, Tucson-bred Marianne Dissard was Madame to Joey Burns' lovestruck gold digger on Calexico's "Ballad of Cable Hogue" and sang with husband Naim Amor on album "Tete A Tete/ABBC" (Amor/Belhom/Burns/Convertino). Her first album, due out sometimes in 2006, is composed and produced by Joey Burns, with Calexico's John Convertino on drums, Naim Amor on guitars, Rob Burger on piano and accordion and John Parish mixing. It features her all-French lyrics, eleven vignettes of love and other little lies (three of those composed by Naim Amor). Marianne has also written lyrics for Howe Gelb (on Giant Sand's ".. Is All Over the Map"), Amor Belhom Duo (two albums on Carrot Top Records), Naim Amor (album "Mistake Love" produced by John Parish and "Sanguine" produced by Joey Burns), and Francoiz Breut. Her poetry has appeared in national and European magazines. During the 2004 presidential election, Marianne launched the Tucson Suffragettes, a group of downtown Tucson vixens who went after "virgin voters". She periodically collaborates with Spork Press/Magazine on various paper-derived products. And, way back, Marianne directed documentary films ("Drunken Bees" on Giant Sand, recently re-released on DVD, "Post No Bills" on LA artist Robbie Conal and, for French TV, "Low Y Cool" - shot by filmmaker Robert Kramer - on lowrider bikes in Tucson and "Celtic Traveler" on the Dublin music scene).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-12_9b63.html" title="Edit section: Futago">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Futago</span></h2>
<p><b>Year:</b> 2005</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Fung Yuen-Man</p>
<p><b>Producer:</b> Sam Leung Tak-Sum</p>
<p><b>Cast:</b> Hisako Shirata, Tony Ho Wah-Chiu, Emily Kwan Bo-Wai, Samuel Pang King-Chi</p>
<p><b>The Skinny:</b> For low budget stuff, Futago is decently paced and shot, and qualifies as a better-than-average calling card for new director Fung Yuen-Man. Still, the story, acting, and originality of Futago fall well short of the average mark. A valiant, but unnecessary attempt at Asian Horror.</p>
<p>Asian Horror gets another entry with the underwhelming Futago. Hisako Shirata turns in a frightfully average performance as twin sisters Asa and Mio Uchida, a pair of Japanese girls with vastly different reasons to be in Hong Kong. Asa came over to become a popstar, but during her stay at a Tsimshatsui motel, she suddenly disappeared. Enter sister Mio, whose sudden appearance at the motel freaks out everyone else staying there. Their overdone fright at Mio's appearance is because A) something obviously happened to Asa and everyone is acting guilty, and B) Mio walks slowly and in a bizarre, zoned-out state, just like every creepy Asian girl since The Ring. Everyone should be afraid; soon after Mio appears, people begin dying left and right. You'd think people dying would cause a mass exodus from the hotel, but nobody leaves. The room rates must be good.</p>
<p>Mio's appearance could mean many things. Is she a vengeful spirit out to avenge her sister? A tourist just checking up on her sister at the wrong time? Or a cheap knock-off of every other creepy female in an Asian Horror movie? The answer: a combination of the above. For a period of time, the film does hold some intrigue. This is mostly due to first-time director Fung Yuen-Man, who reveals the ins-and-outs of Futago with a slow, patient style that's surprising for a Hong Kong filmmaker. The film also has effective cinematography and art direction, and manages some tense and even effectively violent moments. Futago doesn't reveal too much too soon, so those who find the mystery of Asa and Mio Uchida interesting should be on the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mystery of the twin sisters isn't really that interesting, so whatever goodwill the film engenders is soon lost. After a while, the film's tension gives way to unintentional silliness. Actors start to overact, characters and situations grow inconsistent, and an obvious costume change occurs. Hisako Shirata ditches her white dress and shows up in a red one, which is a dead giveaway in any Chinese horror film that you should run away as soon as possible. However, nobody takes the obvious hint, and continues to let Mio Uchida have her way. Making matters worse is investigating cop Ching (Tony Ho), who qualifies as possibly the worst cop in all of Hong Kong. Ching is tortured by bad memories and a disintegrating marriage, so he could be excused for being sloppy. However, Ching doesn't seem to have any idea how to run an investigation except show up after people are dead. As Ching, Tony Ho makes a decent burnt-out cop, but he loses all credibility when he begins to overact comically. But even before then, Futago has already ceased to become anything more than an unnecessary entry into an overcrowded genre.</p>

It drove her first album, "Chi Coltrane", to stay on the charts for three months. Go Like Elijah" also received considerable airplay.</p>
<p>Coltrane studied a number of instruments as a child. Her family moved frequently; her father died when she was 10. She gave her first piano recital at 12. In 1970, she formed Chicago Coltrane, playing blues, funk and gospel in local Chicago clubs and bars. In 1971 she represented the USA at the International Rock Festival in Rio de Janeiro. She appeared on "The Tonight Show" and "The Midnight Special". After her first album was released, she attended the Salter School of Music in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> 1973-1975, released the album "Let It Ride" early in 1974 (on the Columbia label), and four years later another alubm, "Road To Tomorrow". She subsequently moved to Europe (mainly Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, where she was voted Best Female Artist for two consecutive years). She released three albums on the Teldec label during the 1980s, including "Silk and Steel" (1981), "Ready to Roll" (1982), a live album (1982, reached #12 on the European charts) and "The Message" (1986).

<p>London-born, educated in Malta, Rob, as he prefers to be called, lives in Surrey with his Canadian wife, Ballet Dancer/Teacher Diana Cremona, and three children. In the 1980s, he composed musical scores for film, British TV channels such as the BBC, Channel 4 and other commercial advertising jingles. He worked with David Puttnam's production company, Enigma, on the film 'Those glory glory days' as well as others for the BBC and Channel 4 TV. Cremona won the Unisong Best Instrumentalist Award 1999 in the USA and has released three albums since 1995: "The Blue Bird", "All In The Mind", "Reasons For All Seasons". His compositions are still used internationally by contemporary dance companies, for foreign film companies, TV, radio, promotional ventures and other advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Rob is on dialysis after suffering from kidney failure in 1976. He has since had three failed transplants, two heart attacks and a stroke. He trained as a Counsellor in Stress Management and in 2002 this led to his involvement with long term disability. Since then, Rob has been helping the National Health Service (NHS) on 'The Expert Patients Programme'(EPP) and has been lecturing and tutoring the course to medical professionals and long term patients suffering from long term chronic illnesses. Cremona is very enthusiastic about this work which takes him around the country promoting the EPP. Over the years, he has written many articles and medical papers on renal failure and the self-empowerment of long term chronic illness. During 2005/6 he was awarded four commendations for his contribution to the community.</p>
<p>Still keeping his hands in his music, in 2003 Rob formed a band with a some musician friends called 'Out For The Count' and at the time of printing is also the house pianist in 'The Lounge' at The Ambassadors Theatre in Woking, Surrey, UK.</p>

<p>Owlpen Manor is a Tudor manor house, half a mile east of Uley, built largely from the mid-fifteenth century and completed in 1616, with alterations in the early eighteenth century. It was restored by the arts and crafts architect Norman Jewson in 1924-25 after a century of neglect and forms part of a small hamlet with almost a thousand years of history, including a court house, tithe barn and grist mill.</p>

<p>201.253.131.152 04:50, 11 June 2006 (UTC) OWLPEN has long been recognised as one of England's most romantic early manor houses. The Tudor manor (1450-1616) stands with its early formal garden of magnificent yews at the centre of a clutch of medieval landmark buildings. Many are now adapted as quite exceptional award-winning Cotswold holiday cottages.</p>
<p>The Owlpen estate, steeped in 900 years of history, forms its own remote and picturesque wooded valley under the edge of the Cotswold hills in the south-west of England.</p>
<p>The licensed Cyder House is an atmospheric medieval restaurant set at the heart of the estate. It serves home-cooked gourmet meals and light lunches in the summer with an emphasis on the fresh produce of the working farm and garden.</p>
<p>The Mander family welcome you to Owlpen to experience this beautiful and dreamy valley, survivor from a bygone age, first hand and at leisure. We hope these pages will give you some flavour of the experience of Owlpen, long admired as "the jewel of the Cotswolds", based on the family motto: Vive bene, "live well".</p>

The Treasure Hunters is an <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> reality TV show that aired in the summer of 2006. Produced by <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imagine_Entertainment_033f.html" title="Imagine Entertainment">Imagine Entertainment</a> in their first entry into the reality television genre, it features two sets of treasure-hunting teams. Each set believes that their five teams of three people are the only people hunting a cache that is "worth millions." Each team is characterized by a catchphrase -- for example, the "Miss USA" team features three former state champions in the Miss USA beauty pageant, while the "Ex-CIA" team is made up of three former CIA employees.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28magazine%29.html" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a>, NBC executive Jeff Gaspin claims "There will be a component for the Internet" for viewers who wish to become involved in the treasure hunt themselves.</p>

<p>The term Fate means: an event (or a course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future [syn: destiny]. Fate represents the future of hip-hop, and is ready to take the male dominated hip-hop/music industry by storm. Raised in Watts, Fate will be the next female hip-hop star from the West Coast. The neighborhood in Watts was full of gangs, drugs, and violence, yet Fate managed to graduate from USC. Previously, Fate (A.K.A. Nina Ross) signed a deal with a label, and worked with artists like Snoop Dogg and Juelz Santana. Shortly thereafter, Fate decided to finish college before actively pursuing a career in the music industry. Currently, Fate is working on a mixtape entitled “Best Kept Secret.” Fate has a single entitled “Gimme My Mic,” which discusses Fate’s off and now on again relationship with the microphone. Fate lays rhymes over a booming beat originally produced by Easy Mo Bee for Notorious B.I.G.’s “Gimme the Loot.” In 1997, Fate was introduced to the Notorious B.I.G. at a Vibe party. Fate informed B.I.G. that she was an aspiring rap artist, and B.I.G. wanted to meet with Fate and her brother the following day. Tragically, B.I.G. was killed immediately following the Vibe party. Fate possesses a picture taken with B.I.G. shortly before the Vibe party ended.</p>

<p>According to dictionary.com, self esteem is defined as "Pride in oneself; self-respect". So, thusly, LOW self esteem is having a low level of pride in oneself and/or self-respect.</p>
<p>Having low self-esteem could cause you to do any of the following things:</p>
<p>Hiding your body with large clothes (big jackets etc.) Overcompensating (trying to become more "funny" or "interesting" in an effort to make people like you) Making fun of yourself (if you make fun of yourself first, maybe others won't) or Making fun of others (if you make fun of others, maybe they won't make fun of you)</p>
<p>EX: Matt has a tendency to make fun of other people, even if it's uncalled for or untrue. He is never seen without a large jacket on and refuses to take it off, no matter how hot it is outside. He also repeatedly calls himself and others fat. Matt is probably suffering from low self-esteem.</p>
<p>However, not all of these symptoms automatically point to low self esteem.</p>
<p>EX: Carlos makes talks about others behind their back, even if it's uncalled for or untrue. He is often seen with a jacket, but will take it off and does not say any unkind words about himself. Carlos is probably NOT suffering from low self-esteem, but rather just has a tendency to be a disloyal friend and likes to wear jackets.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the symptoms for low self-esteem. Having low self-esteem can have long term effects on your happiness and social skills.</p>
<p><br />
Luckily, there are organizations devoted to rasing low self-esteem, many exclusively dealing with kids, such as the William Gladden Foundation. If you or a loved one are suffering from any of the damaging side effects of self-esteem, seeking out one of these organizations would be a good idea. Self help books and tapes, such as the Chicken Soup for the Soul book series, are also methods of combatting low self esteem.</p>

<p>Kikayon (קיקיון) is the Hebrew name of the particular plant in the biblical book of Jonah. The word is not known to be used elsewhere and most references usually considers it to be a castor plant (ricinus communis) or a type of gourd. Rashi describes it as a leafy, shady plant.</p>
<p>In Jonah, 4:6, Jonah, fleeing from the command of G-d, questions His decision on not destroying the city of Nineveh. As Jonah camped G-d created a plant (the kikayon) to shade Jonah and then sends a worm to eat the plant so that it whithers. Jonah feels remorseful and pity for the plant, but not for the City of Nineveh. G-d points out that Jonah put as much effort into the creation of the plant as for the City, but certainly that He should take pity upon a City of people who do not know what they do.</p>
<p>The traditional text is as follows: Hashem, G-d, designated a kikayon, which rose up above Jonah to form a shade over his head, to relieve him from his discomfort. Jonah rejoiced over the kikayon, a great joy. Then G-d designated a worm at the dawn of the next day and it attacked the kikayon, so that it whithered. And it was when the sun shown, that G-d designated a stifling east wind; the sun beat upon Jonah's head and he felt faint. He asked for his soul's death, and said, "Better is my death than my life!" And G-d said to Jonah, "Are you so deeply grieved over the kikayon?" And he said, "I am greatly grieved to death." Hashem said, "You took pity on the kikayon for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow; it lived one night and perished after one night. And I-- shall I not take pity upon Nineveh the great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and many animals as well?"</p>

After finishing university, she moved to korea with only a a backpack of clothes, and a Casio Keyboard, from there her music career took off, making records of love songs with only her voice and the 'string' effect on the Casio. Influeces included other sappy korean singers, and her lyrics were often compared to those of the late Wesley Willis. Vai was most often known to date wealthy asain men, but was also known to have a off-again on-again relationship with a Maltese man, although this relationship was purely based on sexual attraction. Her famous life ended in tragedy at a young age, when her carreeer started to slide, when she threw herself over the niagra falls, claiming that she wanted to go out with a bang.</p>

<p>GUIDELINES FOR ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY</p>
<p>In general, endoscopic sinus surgery is intended for people with chronic sinus problems who do not respond to medical therapy. Symptoms of sinus disease may include facial pain or feeling of fullness, difficulty breathing through the nose, a persistent bad smell in the nose, post nasal discharge, and occasionally headaches. Occasionally sinus problems may cause hoarseness or cough, or a variety of other symptoms, but all these problems can also occur in the absence of sinus disease. The diagnosis of a sinus problem must therefore be based on an assessment by your doctor.</p>
<p>In the majority of people with sinus problems surgery is not indicated or required. Most people with sinus complaints can be successfully treated medically. This treatment may consist of antibiotics or other medications, treatment for allergies, or environmental control (such as stopping smoking). The type of medical treatment chosen is based on your doctor's assessment of the cause.</p>
<p>Unless your doctor finds a problem which clearly requires surgical intervention, one or more forms of medical treatment are used as the primary therapy for most sinus problems. In some people however, surgery is required. This may be because of an infection or inflamed area which does not clear with antibiotics, or which keeps returning when the antibiotics are stopped, or for other reasons which you should discuss with your physician. THE EVALUATION AND FOLLOW UP TREATMENT IN ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY</p>
<p>At the initial consultation, it is helpful if you bring a letter from your physician with you, describing your past history and treatment up to this time. Previous x-rays are also often helpful if these are available. Special x-ray studies are frequently required in order to accurately assess the areas involved, and suitability for endoscopic sinus surgery. In some cases these may be prearranged at the time of the initial visit based upon information supplied by you, or your physician, in advance. They might also be performed at a later time. You may also discuss, with your own doctor, having these performed locally prior to your visit (either frontal polytomograms, or high resolution coronal or reconstructed coronal C-T scan), and bring the x-ray films with you.</p>
<p>If, after the consultation, it is felt that you would benefit from endoscopic surgery, a date will be arranged for the procedure. In many cases, the surgery can be performed on an out-patient basis; however, it is important to be prepared to be admitted to the hospital should this prove necessary at the time of surgery. Following the surgery, if no nasal packing is required, a follow up visit at approximately one day and six days following surgery is necessary to clean crusts from the surgical site. A further follow up visit(s) is then scheduled in two to six weeks. Occasionally further minor endoscopic procedures or rarely a more radical surgical procedure could be required, if a resolution of symptoms does not occur. FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY</p>
<p>Functional endoscopic sinus surgery differs somewhat from the conventional surgical approach to this problem in that it stresses a careful diagnostic workup to try to identify the underlying cause of the problem, frequently in the anterior ethmoid area, the area of the openings of the maxillary and frontal sinus. Sometimes the endoscopic examination, or the detailed x-ray studies, may reveal a problem which could not be identified by other means.</p>
<p>The principle is that if the underlying cause of disease is identified and corrected, secondary disease in the maxillary and frontal sinuses will often improve spontaneously.</p>
<p>The advantage of the procedure is that, in general, the surgery is less extensive, there is often less removal of normal tissues, and the surgery can frequently be performed on an outpatient basis without the necessity for nasal packing. In general, the techniques are similar to those utilized for an intranasal ethmoidectomy, however, better visualization is obtained during surgery by the use of endoscopes. The endoscopes also allow problems in other sinuses to be viewed directly and, in many cases, for diseased tissue to be removed. RISKS OF SURGERY</p>
<p>Bleeding</p>
<p>Bleeding is a potential risk in most forms of sinus surgery. Although the risk of bleeding appears to be reduced with this technique, on occasion significant bleeding may require termination of the procedure and placement of nasal packing. Bleeding following surgery may require the placement of packing and hospital admission. Blood transfusion is rarely required.</p>
<p>Failure to cure the problem or recurrent disease</p>
<p>As in all sinus surgery, it is possible that the disease may not be cured by the operation or that recurrent disease may occur at a later time. In this case, subsequent medical or surgical therapy might be required.</p>
<p>Post operative discharge</p>
<p>Some bloody post nasal discharge may occur for approximately two weeks after this procedure. This is normal and slowly improves. You should not blow your nose for approximately 5 days following the procedure.</p>
<p>Spinal fluid leak</p>
<p>All operations on the ethmoid sinus carry a rare chance of creating a leak of spinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain). Should this rare complication occur, it creates a potential pathway for infection which could result in meningitis. If a spinal fluid leak should occur, it would extend your hospitalization and might require further surgery for its closure, should it not close spontaneously. However, the use of endoscopes allows improved visualization and therefore should potentially reduce the risk of this complication.</p>
<p>Loss of vision</p>
<p>Occasional reports of visual loss have been reported after sinus surgery. Although the loss of vision would usually only involve one side, the potential for recovery is not good. Fortunately, such a complication is extremely rare. Temporary or prolonged double vision has also been reported after sinus surgery.</p>
<p>Blood transfusion</p>
<p>Blood transfusion is rarely required, but if necessary carries a risk of adverse reaction or the transfer of infection.</p>
<p>Other risks</p>
<p>Tearing of the eye can occasionally result from sinus surgery or inflammation and may be persistent.</p>
<p>Numbness or discomfort in the upper front teeth may occur for a period of time after some procedures. Occasionally some swelling, bruising or temporary numbness of the lip, or swelling or bruising of the area around the eye may occur. Blowing your nose in the early postoperative period might result in a temporary collection of air under the skin and facial swelling for a period of time. Although the purpose of the surgery is to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of chronic sinus disease, should it not be successful, the symptoms could be unchanged or become worsened. These symptoms include further sinus pain or discomfort, increased nasal obstruction, or a prolonged increase in post nasal discharge. Decreased sense of smell is also a possibility. ALTERNATIVES TO SURGERY</p>
<p>In most cases, medical therapy is the first form of treatment for sinus disease, and in most cases it is possible to continue to treat the disease medically. Alternative forms of surgery are also available, and you should discuss these further with your surgeon if you so wish.</p>

<p>Technoscum - A creature that has an affinity to the technical community that suggests innovations which are not applicable to solving real problems. One who pretends that they are knowledgeable about technical innovation but who knows very little about the tech matters. First used by Alexander Cohen, a high school student, in 1986 while working for a computer store in Wappingers Falls, NY The customer, technoscum, wished to purchase an Apple® LaserWriter® printer, and told Alexander how he invented the Postscript® language. The term, technoscum, rapidly spread through the computer community since it so aptly described a brand new class of people who felt inadequate in their everyday lives. The term continues with a claimed innovation of a very famous politician.</p>

<p>Blokkispace is an editable technology Blog, created by a former Accenture employee Martin Ikediashi. Using a variant of a standard wiki engine, it arranges content in a Blog style format, with the major innovation being that the content is editable. Its intention is to be a combination of publishing formats, First and foremost a Blog and Wiki, which when combined together form a "Blokki". BlokkiSpace is the news technology website on which individuals are able to edit articles and make a running Blog commentary of a device.</p>

<p>It is believed the Blokki was inspired by Wikipedia, with a desire to create up to date technology content that consumers could add to. If you have already used wikipedia or a wiki you will already be familiar with the concept of editing an article. With an individual simply selecting the review that they wish to edit and using the edit option amend the information present. The initial reviews are created by journalists, but if any information is inaccurate or omitted, users can simply amend the information as they see fit. Blogging appears in the form of the chronology of the articles posted and in the lengthy comments some users post below articles, reflecting their subjective opinions about a device.</p>

<p>Blokkispace started out as an experiment in January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> between Martin Ikediashi and Dan Levi both of whom currently play an active role in the management of the site.</p>
<p>"I started working on developing the site back in September of 2005, fleshing out different ideas with a friend Justin Robinson," Martin Ikediashi told journalists at <a href="../../../z/d/n/ZDNet_977e.html" title="ZDNet">ZDNet</a>. "It was a release from the doldrums of work, where I wasnt really doing much coding".</p>

<p>Many have expressed concern over Blokkispace's growing influence as a news source. The site's reliance on users to provide additional information, provides ammunition to those who criticize wikis in general. With the obvious concerns of the accuracy of information and the possibility of work being vandalised and thus being inaccurate.</p>
<p>Some also state the company's premise of creating a user driven website is flawed, because the initial posts are made by the company's journalists. This makes it a lot less user driven than sites like shoutwire and digg, where users can actually post stories.</p>

<p>Balcarras School was opened to pupils on 2 September 1986 and occupied the site previously known as Charlton Kings County Secondary School, which was closed as part of a secondary re-organisation scheme in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheltenham.html" title="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>.</p>
<p>This process re-shaped the local education system : it resulted in school closures and marked the demise of single sex education in the town, (except in the private sector), but it gave birth to a new school in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Kings_5ae4.html" title="Charlton Kings">Charlton Kings</a>, which was christened Balcarras . There was already a farm and a hotel that took that local place name. Now, at the corner of Balcarras Road, (which is really not more than a lane), there was to be an 11-16 comprehensive.</p>
<p>The official opening, which was hosted by the new Headteacher, Mr. Nigel Cooke, followed on the afternoon of Wednesday 12 November when the guest of honour was the Mayor of Cheltenham, Mr. Don Perry, T.D. and the vicar of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Kings_5ae4.html" title="Charlton Kings">Charlton Kings</a> dedicated a sun-dial in commemoration of the occasion. The Chairman of Governors, Mr. Barrie Anderson, also welcomed the four patrons of the school Houses named after them : Mrs. Winifred Foley, Mr. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Graveney_8f2f.html" title="Tom Graveney">Tom Graveney</a>, O.B.E., Mr. Gordon Ottewell and Mr. Peter Selvey.</p>
<p>Though the opening of the comprehensive school marked the beginning of an exciting and successful new era towards the beginning of the new millennium, formal education in Charlton Kings was well established as early as the mid-nineteenth century. Charlton Kings Boys' School was opened in 1858 and had only four headteachers between then and the time of its re-formation as Charlton Kings County Secondary School in 1948.</p>
<p>This school, known to some by the nickname "Crab End College", outgrew its home in School Road. At the time of its removal to Balcarras Road in 1958 to occupy a site of about thirteen acres there were 450 pupils in fourteen classes.</p>
<p>Mr Herbert MorrisonAt a ceremony captured on a recently retrieved audio tape, Mr. Herbert Morrison, the Speaker of the House of Commons, declared the school officially open on 8th January 1959. The ceremony was threatened by the kind of snowy January day that seemed more common at that time than now, but undeterred the school staff, (which numbered eighteen), and pupils participated in a programme of celebration : prayers were said, hymns were sung and - best of all perhaps - there was the school song :</p>
<p>'Neath these high hills Created by the strength of God, Be ye, like them, in strength unchanged, Upholding right and good. Be strong in the Faith of your fathers, Be strong in knowledge and truth; Seek strength of arm to lift the fallen, Seek strength of foot to be swift in mercy, Be strong in your God. Be strong to succour the needy, Be strong in sorrow and pain. Find strength in joy and beauty; Find strength in simple duty, Be strong in your God.</p>
<p>The accommodation comprised ten classrooms, an assembly hall, (also used as a dining hall), and stage, a gymnasium with changing rooms and showers, a library, science and rural science laboratories and special rooms, (in some cases also used as classrooms), for woodwork, metalwork, domestic subjects, art, needlework and light crafts.</p>
<p>Aerial photo of schoolThis building is now but a small part of what Balcarras has become. First of all was added the Science block, and then came the building which houses History and Maths and is connected to the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_Form_86c6.html" title="Sixth Form">Sixth Form</a> Centre. After that came the Dining Room block and then the Sports Hall seemed to bring the building programme to a close. The playing field which had formerly finished at a hedge, whose centre was marked by our famous oak tree, was extended towards the foot of the Cotswold Hills to which we are so fortunately appended.</p>
<p>Not too many of our forefathers could have anticipated what was to happen in the mid-1990s. The numbers of pupils entering post-16 education, and having to travel across the town to find it, created a demand for a sixth form in the eastern part of the town, fuelled by enthusiastic parents and channelled through a steering group of staff and governors. The pressure was irresistible and the school was granted its new status, opening its own sixth form in September 1998. Princess Royal Princess Royal</p>
<p>HRH the Princess Royal performed the official Opening Ceremony on 19th October 1998 and the school delighted in a memorable occasion, at which the youngest pupil presented Princess Anne with a bouquet.</p>
<p>Modern Languages BlockThe continued appeal of the school has led to a seemingly relentless expansion which required a further building programme in 1999 to create another new feature, the six-roomed Modern Languages block, which was opened on 23rd March 2000 by Philipe St. Andre, former French rugby international.Sixth Form Teaching</p>
<p>November 2000 saw the arrival of <a href="../../../o/f/s/OFSTED_2a6d.html" title="OFSTED">OFSTED</a> inspectors for the School's second inspection. They were greatly impressed by what they saw, with two features standing out strongly - the warmth of the atmosphere throughout the school and the quality of the teaching. The teaching in the Sixth Form was the best the inspectors had seen!</p>
<p>House Music CompetitionIn October 2001 the new Music accommodation was opened and celebrated by the first annual House Music Competition, with superb solo and ensemble renditions from every House. Just 1 point out of 300 separated 1st from joint 2nd but Graveney became the first winners!Astroturf Pitch</p>
<p>2002 saw two major developments; the opening of the astroturf pitch and pavilion, largely funded by Sport England, serving the school and local sporting community, and the extension to the modern languages building, housing the geography department and ICT.</p>
<p>Finally in 2006, a superb new art block was added onto the other end of the modern languages block, giving Balcarras some of the best art facilities in the county.</p>
<p>Balcarras has come a long way since its opening in 1986, doubling its numbers from 650 11-16 pupils to its position today as an 11-18 school of 1300 pupils and students with a national reputation for the quality of the education it provides.</p>

This is basically the idea that he has left clues throughout his life about the several secret and key aspects of the ideas of his life and the foundations of the The society of Futurists and The Brave, some people claim these clues are often very similar to the clues found in movie like Indiana Jones others claim these clues are all based on Marks own clues. What is know however is that throughout his life especially at <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downside_School_0519.html" title="Downside School">Downside School</a> he left clues for future generations, often predicting the future or letting non-members know of ways to join the secret society (The society of Futurists and The Brave).</p>

<p>One of the most famous examples of his early The society of Futurists and The Brave work was the "pinky loves zara" markings which are left throughout the world symbolising where he has been. These can be found in many places, most easily at <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downside_School_0519.html" title="Downside School">Downside School</a>. However it has to be said most of these markings were NOT done by Mark Bassett but rather done by his close followers.</p>

<p>Mark Bassett to this day, is mingled into society and few in anyone other then the members of the The society of Futurists and The Brave know of his presence. Those who do keep it a great secret. It is said however that if a non-member finds a "sacred clue" then they too can become a member of the The society of Futurists and The Brave, after giving a small donation to Mark Bassett himself.</p>

<p>The story is about Abdullah, a young carpet merchant, who lives in the land of Zanzib. Abdullah fantasizes about being a prince, living in a castle and marrying a princess. His stall is next to his friend Jamal's, and he is quite happy. He is ocassionally troubled by his father's first wife's relatives, who condescend to him and declare that they will find him wives. He continues in this existence until one day, when a somewhat rude stranger sells him a flying carpet.</p>
<p>That night, while Abdullah is asleep, the carpet brings him to the palace of the Sultan of Zanzib. Abdulleh meets the Sultan's beautiful daughter, Flower-in-the-Night, who is engaged to the prince of Ingary. She, who has never seen a man besides her father, is convinced that he is a woman. The day after that, he brings her some pictures of men to show her what they look like. By then he has realized that the carpet needs an magic word to activate it, which he seems able to utter only in his sleep. He and Flower-in-the-Night fall in love, and agree to marry. On the night they meet up to run off together, a hideous djinn kidnaps Flower-in-the-Night. The Sultan believes that Abdullah is responsible, and tosses him in his dungeons.</p>
<p>Abdullah is inadvertantly rescued by Jamal's dog, who somehow managed to fly the carpet to his dungeon. He returns the dog and gives Jamal money to escape from the Sultan's guards, before escaping into the desert on the carpet. The carpet delivers him directly into the hands of a group of bandits. Thinking that he is a magician, their leader, Kabul Aqba, demands advice about a genie which he has just acquired. The appearance of the genie scares off all the bandits, except Kabul Aqba. Abdullah discovers the magic word when he watches the carpet rise as soon as the sleeping Kabul Aqba snores. Being left alone with the genie, Abdullah begins his search for Flower-in-the-Night.</p>
<p>The genie takes him to an old Strangian soldier, supposedly the closest person who can help Abdullah in his search. Abdullah teams up with the soldier, who turns out to be a robber. They pick up a cat and her kitten as well. Abdullah dislikes the cat, who inexplicably becomes huge when angry. The soldier, however, worships it. Abdullah becomes even more annoyed when the soldier forces him to waste his wish on the cats. Abdullah decides to stop making wishes for himself as the genie is clearly determined that his wishes should cause as much havoc as possible. Instead, he wishes for Jamal and his dog to be safely transported to a life as royal cook and guard dog at the nearest royal palace apart from Zanzib.</p>
<p>The soldier managesto persuade Abdullah to wish for the magic carpet back. Unluckily, the carpet returns with Kabul Aqba still asleep on it. The carpet wakes him up when it tries to slip out from under him. When Abdullah and the soldier struggle with Aqba, he turns into a hideous djinn. Abdullah recognises him as the same djinn who kidnapped Flower-in-the-Night. He commands the djinn to explain himself. The djinn identifies himself as Hasruel, one of the greatest of the Good Djinns. Hasruel explains that his brother Dalzel has stolen his life and made him his slave. (Djinns only die if a certain part of themselves is damaged, something like an Achilles heel. Thus they remove that part from themselves and hide it.) Dalzel ordered him to steal every princess in the world, and a moving castle fro them to stay in. For each princess, Hasruel has left behind a lover who might try to rescue her. He was the man who sold Abdullah the flying carpet. He adds that he is planning to kidnap the princess of Ingary, the land they are currently in, next.</p>
<p>Abdullah goes to see the Royal Wizard Suliman, one of the two Royal Wizards of Ingary. He leaves the genie, carpet and soldier at the inn, but the cat follows him. When he gets there, he learns that the cat is actually a beautiful young woman named Sophie. She is Suliman's wife's sister, and the wife of the Royal Wizard Howl. The kitten is her baby. At this point the connection to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle_801a.html" title="Howl's Moving Castle">Howl's Moving Castle</a> is shown. Sophie explains that Howl's divining spell showed someone stealing their moving castle and kidnapping the 4-year-old Princess Valeria. He warned the king immediately. When the djinn came, Howl hid Sophie by turning her into a cat. He and their fire demon, Calcifer, disappeared with the castle.</p>
<p>The djinn kidnaps Princess Valeria while Sophie and Abdullah are unconsciously distracting Suliman and his wife Lettie. Sophie, Lettie and Abdullah rush back to the inn, only to find that genie, baby and soldier have all disappeared. Lettie stays behind while Abdullah and Sophie fly off on the carpet to the moving castle in the air. They sneak in and find Hasruel, Dalzel, Princess Valeria, Flower-in-the-Night, the soldier, Sophie's baby, the genie, Jamal and his dog, and a whole lot more princesses there. Jamal is working there as a royal cook according to Abdullah's earlier wish. They begin making plans for escape. However, the princesses have to deal with the demands of the soldier, Abdullah, Jamal and the genie (in fact, all the males present except for Sophie's baby) in exchange for their help. The soldier wants a princess to marry. He chooses Princess Beatrice of Strangia. Although she is engaged to Prince Justin of Ingary, she seems happy to get out of the political arrangement. Jamal wants a job. The princess of High Norland agrees to hire him. Abdullah gets 5 minutes talk in private with Flower-in-the-Night. The genie is promised his freedom. They finally carry out their plan.</p>
<p>The princesses drag Abdullah before Dalzel and Hasruel, pretending that Abdullah sneaked into the castle dressed as Jamal's dog. Dalzel promises to let Abdullah depart in peace if he can guess the location of Hasruel's life within 3 guesses. Abdullah suddenly realizes that the life is in Hasruel's nose ring, but pretends to guess wrongly 3 times anyway. At this point, Princess Valeria throws a tantrum and Sophie's baby begins screaming. The hall turns into a madhouse and the djinns become confused. Jamal's dog bites off Hasruel's nose ring. Abdullah declares this to Dalzel, and the bedlam stops.</p>
<p>Now that Hasruel has his life back, he has to be good again. He isn't very happy about this, as he has enjoyed being wicked. He listens to Abdullah's orders. He exiles Dalzel to an island. To keep him company, Hasruel sends along two fat girls who had earlier been chosen by Abdullah's father's first wife's relatives to be Abdullah's brides. Flower-in-the-Night lets out the genie. He turns back into Sophie's husband, the Royal Wizard Howl. Howl tells Hasruel how to get to another world, where he can be wicked if he wants to be. The castle remains in place even after he has left. The flying carpet turns into Calcifer the fire demon. Calcifer replaces the moving castle on land. The soldier turns out to be Prince Justin of Ingary, who was engaged to marry Princess Beatrice anyway.</p>
<p>Flower-in-the-Night and Abdullah, Prince Justin and Princess Beatrice get married in a massive double wedding. Each bride has 14 princesses each as bridesmaids. Flower-in-the-Night's father, the Sultan, is invited to the wedding but declines, saying that he has a 50-foot stake waiting for Abdullah if he sees him again. Howl gets the King of Ingary to make the couple ambassadors to Ingary. Abdullah and Flower-in-the-Night live near Howl and Sophie in Ingary.</p>

<p>HEp-2 (Epidermoid carcinoma, larynx, human, HeLa markers) The HEp-2 cell line was established in 1952 by A. E. Moore, L. Sabachewsky, and H. W. Toolan (Cancer Res. 15: 598, 1955) from tumors that had been produced in irradiated-cortisonized weanling rats after injection with epidermoid carcinoma tissue from the larynx of a 56-year-old male (H. Toolan, Cancer Res. 14: 660, 1954). A hardy cell line, HEp-2 resists temperature, nutritional, and environmental changes without a loss of viability. It has supported growth of 10 of 14 arboviruses (Texas Rep. Biol. Med. 15: 588, 1957) and measles virus (Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 93: 107, 1956), and it has been used for experimental studies of tumor production in rats, hamsters, mice, embryonated eggs and volunteer terminal cancer patients (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 76: 497, 1958).</p>
<p>Culture Medium Leibovitz-15 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.</p>
<p>Growth Characteristics Cells seeded at a concentration of 2x104 cells/cm2 in the above culture medium will be 100% confluent in 5 days.</p>
<p>Plating Efficiency Approximately 44%.</p>
<p>Morphology Epithelial-like.</p>
<p>Karyology Chromosome Frequency Distribution 47 Cells: 2n = 46. Occasional polyloids. Several marker chromosomes were observed along with frequent minutes, and often 2 large chromosomes with subterminal centromeres.</p>
<p>Species Confirmed as human by immunofluorescence and cytotoxic-antibody tests (dye exclusion).</p>
<p>Common Utilization Supports the growth of a broad range of viruses, including Adenoviruses; Coxsackie B; Herpes simplex Virus; Poliovirus; Respiratory Syncytial Virus; and Vesicular Stomatitis (Indiana Strain) Virus.</p>

<p>You must either buy land from a current citizen or own a land deed and purchase a property with that depending on how many Land Deed's the lot is worth.</p>
<p>This also allows for citizen mayors of cities. Citizens of their city have the availability to Apply to Be Mayor and staff will review the applications and accept who THEY think will make good mayors. Then the Mayoral Candidates can create a campaign for other citizens of the city to review and then they have 7 days to vote for who they think will make a good mayor. On the first day of every month citizens will get an announcement through the Small Updates on who will become the new mayor of their respective Power Federation cities.</p>
<p>There are currently 10 regular Power Federation cities (as of 06/11/06): Labrador, Collie, Pony, Dolphin, Wolfox, Kuvasz, Sheepdog, Eagle, Polar, and Somali. There is also 1 Staff and Head Moderator ONLY city (as of 06/11/06): Gecko.</p>

<p>Killer whale captures for exhibition purposes began in the Northwest in 1965. The second capture in the Northwest was an accidental catch of a 24-foot long, 5-ton male who got snared in a fishing net off Namu, British Columbia. The two fishermen who owned the net decided to sell him alive to the first person who gave them a bid. Ted Griffin, owner of the Seattle Public Aquarium, had dreamed for many years of befriending a killer whale. Killer whales are the largest of the dolphin family, and he was convinced that such a relationship was possible. When Griffin heard of the captured killer whale, he jumped at the opportunity and bought the whale for 8,000 dollars, the cost of replacing the net. He named the whale Namu, after the town if its capture. The main problem was how to transport Namu 450 miles from Namu B.C. to Seattle, Washington. He solved this problem by building a 60 foot by 40 foot by 16 foot deep floating pen that could be towed by boat to Seattle. The journey southward started in July 1965. When Namu was being towed southward he emitted various scream-like sounds and on the 4th day of the trip, 30-40 killer whales overtook the floating pen and seemingly tried to help Namu. They repeatedly charged the cage, but warned by their built-in sonar they stopped just short of hitting it. After several hours, most of the killer whales disappeared, all except a female and two calves. These three whales were probably Namu's mother and siblings, and they stayed with Namu for 150 miles. Namu was an instant success when he arrived on July 28 1965, in Rich Cove, 12 miles west of Seattle WA. Namu's first Sunday at Rich Cove attracted 5,000 people, and by September the number of people who visited Namu exceeded 120,000. They all came to see the 'killer turned tame'. Griffin wanted to dispel the notion that killer whales are blood thirsty predators whose only desire is to kill. Griffin knew that in order to prove this attitude wrong, he had to meet Namu on his own terms and in his own environment. Griffin decided that to demonstrate the friendliness of Namu, he had to swim with him. When people heard of Griffin's plan to swim with Namu, they told him that 'swimming with a killer whale is like risking death'. Before attempting the first swim ever with a wild killer whale, Griffin observed Namu's every move, studied his behavior, and noted his moods. Griffin reasoned that fear would not be a cause for aggression, since killer whales have no natural enemies in the wild. Namu should instead regard Griffin with curiosity. Griffin first entered the water with Namu on August 27 1965, just one month after Namu arrived at Rich Cove. Griffin approached Namu with a short handled brush. Namu did not move, so Griffin scrubbed Namu's head, nose and chin. Later in the day Griffin slid onto Namu's back and from that day on Griffin and Namu became inseparable. Griffin commented on his relationshop with Namu:</p>
<p>"It was as if my every conscious wish became the whales command." Namu and Griffin performed together for 11 months until Namu contracted a bacterial infection which damaged his nervous system. A few days before his death he became unresponsive to people and on June Namu crashed head-on at full speed into the wire mesh of his pen, thrashed violently for a few minutes and then died.</p>

<p>The Circle City Sidewalk Stompers Clown Band has been performing fast-moving, choreographed routines to upbeat music since 1976. The 12 musicians, including trumpets, trombones, saxes, bass and snare drums, and sousaphone are dressed in colorful clown costumes and entertain the crowd with comic interaction and fancy footwork.</p>
<p>The 15-minute choreographed show, followed by musical strolling through the crowd, includes familiar tunes like Zoot Suit Riot, It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got That Swing, All Shook Up, Gimme' Some Lovin', Birdland, Jump Jive an' Wail, Your Mama Don't Dance, and many more of your popular favorites.</p>
<p>Based in Indianapolis, IN, the Circle City Sidewalk Stompers routinely entertains crowds at Indiana Pacers basketball and Indianapolis Colts football games as well as at private parties, parades and the Indiana State Fair. As word of the twelve talented musicians and their high energy show spread, the group began appearing in fairs across the country such as the San Diego Fair, the New York State Fair, the Wisconsin State Fair, and the Alaska State Fair. The band has also performed in the Great American Brass Band Festival in Danville, KY for the past 7 years, as well as Carnival in Nice, France, the European version of Mardi Gras.</p>
<p>The group attributes its success to its members’ excellent musicianship and to their ability to adapt to any performance situation. Their professionalism and flexibility make them ideally suited for a wide variety of events. The popular Circle City Sidewalk Stompers also believe that today’s audiences are eager for the positive family entertainment the group provides.</p>

<p>Our Marines are in SHACKLES?! Euphoric Reality ^ | June 7, 2006 | Redhead Infidel</p>
<p>Posted on 06/07/2006 11:02:29 PM PDT by American Cabalist</p>
<p>I am shaking with fury right now. I just listened on the radio to the father of one of the Marines and the wife of the Navy corpsman incarcerated in Camp Pendleton - UNCHARGED -after Haditha. Let me tell you what's going on with OUR Marines right at this moment:</p>
<p>While "detainees" (not "terrorists", not "prisoners", not "criminals", mind you) at Gitmo are accorded every privilege - including playing soccer in the sun, praying whenever they want, white-glove Koran service, and halal meals...our Marines, who have NOT been charged with any crime whatsoever are in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT and wearing leg and wrist SHACKLES. They are allowed no exercise, and can only go outside for one hour per day - unable to move around because of their SHACKLES. They are not allowed to hug their wives or their children - and they are only allowed to speak to them through thick glass, again immobilized while in SHACKLES. They are being treated worse than the terrorist scum lounging around Gitmo on the American dime!!</p>
<p>Yes, goddamn it, you read that right. They have not been charged with any crime, yet they are treated as GUILTY until proven innocent. They are confined in solitary like the worst criminals, and THEY. ARE. NOT.</p>
<p>They are seven Marines and one Navy corpsman from one of the most storied, illustrious units in the Corps: the Dark Horse 3rd Battalion 5th Marines. Their unit motto is "Consummate Professionals" - which every Marine in that unit does his best to embody. They are not slackers, they are not newbies, they are not psychotic, and they are not untried or unblooded. They have lost their brothers in Baghdad, Fallujah, Mosul and Haditha. The Marines under investigation for the events at Haditha were on their second or even third deployment - they were not raw recruits.</p>
<p>You already know exactly where we stand on the events of Haditha. We will not ever waver from that viewpoint. We will do everything in our power to fight for the freedom and exoneration of those Marines. They are OUR BOYS, and while they've shed their blood into the filthy dust of Iraq, we will now cover them with our care and unequivocal support. And we will fight, fight, FIGHT until they are released.</p>
<p>I've been collecting info on Haditha since Murtha's assinine accusations but I haven't had time to post the entire trove in one article. Now is as good a time as any, and I'll update it as new info is released.</p>
<p>Some of the following details may be stuff you've heard over the past week, but I GUARANTEE that some of it is so NEW and UNPUBLICIZED that you have NOT heard it before.</p>
<p>You are about to learn more about that shithole called Haditha than you ever cared to know. You are about to learn details about this case that the media is hushing up. The media has finally found their fuckin' My Lai, and they will do their damnedest to ensure they get to keep it. Well, over my dead body.</p>

<p>The Treaty of 1783 was a peace treaty between the United States and the British, in which the British promised to leave American territory. Although the British agreed to this treaty, their forces did not evacuate as series of frontier posts along the Great Lakes. This treaty resurfaced in the late 1830s when there was a dispute over the boundary of Canada and Maine. This boundary had not been clearly established in the Treaty of 1783.</p>
