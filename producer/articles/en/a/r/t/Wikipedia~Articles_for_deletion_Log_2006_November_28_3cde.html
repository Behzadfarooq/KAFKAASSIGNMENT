<li><b>Keep</b>, it is a viable school.

Also, WP:DP explicitly states that an article being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason for deletion. Finally, at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> there is a proposed policy in development--I would suggest we hold off on this (and any other school articles anyone may wish to nominate) until that policy is finalized and adopted, unless there is a policy specifically requiring the deletion of the given school--otherwise, we risk removing content that may turn out to be explicitly acceptable according to a broader community consensus. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> 15:22, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> pointing to a record of "successes" (many of them kept by older, less stringent criteria than what is usually accepted today) is highly misleading. We also didn't worry much about spam or trivial subjects two years ago. Standards change, and in the last several months, there has been, in fact, a large (and fairly successful) movement to delete or redirect school articles that are merely stubs. Neither of the proposed school notability proposed-guidelines (either <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> which I favor) has reached consensus. In the absence of <i>specific</i> guidelines, we don't keep everything, we go with more general guidelines, like multiple, independent non-trivial coverage in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. I can point you to dozens of school articles that were deleted or redirected in the last month alone. That said, this looks like a fairly decent article compared to the typical piece of school-spam (and so I'll vote <b>Weak Keep</b>), but as a <i>general</i> argument, your argument fails completely! <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 16:50, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Here's a breakdown of every school AfD that originated in November and has already been closed (this is a simple count of closed discussions on the schoolwatch, not including DRV discussions): 29 articles were deleted or deleted and recreated as redirects, 19 were no consensus (and defaulted to keep), and 18 were outright kept. Thus, there's absolutely no consensus whatsoever, and any record that is thought to exist clearly does not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 17:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rewrite</b>. Most articles about elementary schools are deleted. The notability of this school appears to arise from the fact that it is private. Not a very fair basis.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> based on awards. The "designation as a historical site" was performed by the Downers Grove Historical Society, so is not itself an indication of noteworthiness beyond a purely local level.

<li><b>Delete</b> and/or <b>completly rewrite</b>. It is unquestionably notable on a local level (as are most schools) but notability on a local level is not sufficient for inclusion in Wikipedia, otherwise just about every shop on every high street would merit an article. I am not convinced about its notability in the grander scheme of things, although others apparently are. If this is kept, the article needs a complete rewrite to become an encyclopaedia article rather than a brag list. It needs to explain the awards it has received, who from and why it won them. It also needs to explain anything else that makes it more notable than A.N. Other school - there are a lot of successful selective private schools out there, so this alone is not reason enough for an article. Everything must also be backed up by reliable sources. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 22:37, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge or Delete</b> I agree to the above that it's a reletively limited and new neologism, but from the article itself it appears to define the concept poorly, I could possibly agree to an article on it if the article asserted the notability of the theory or its importance in context. I have some sociology background and I've never heard the term, maybe it's more common at the higher levels, but in my opinion, for this to be a full article it needs to A: assert the importance of the theory B: explain it better in vernacular that is understandible by the layperson and C: cite more specific sources.</li>

<li><b>Question</b>. The references on the page at the moment don't confirm the album, and therefore also do not provide a concrete release date. This is pure speculation, then. Or am I missing something?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to set the record straight (no pun intended), I will admit that there is no actual DATE of release for this album. I agree with Mikeblas, but I dont agree that my article is completely uncited, and I don't see any major crystal balling here. Mike, you ask if you are missing something, and seeing as you didn't spend the time to fully browse the references, I think you were missing something. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackjays_a434.html" title="User:Blackjays">Blackjays</a> 12:37, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. What I'm missing is useful references in this article. I keep prying away links to copyvio material. All I'm left with is a painfully bad MySpace page, and I have a hard time considering that as a real reference. If this artist is notable and the release date is certain, then I'd expect reliable references (from <i>Rolling Stone</i>, say; or a hip-hop music magazine) to not be hard to find. As it stands, a search for the artist and the album title on Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Kardinal+Offishall%22+%22Not+For+Sale%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Kardinal+Offishall%22+%22Not+For+Sale%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> gets me less than 260 hits. The only ones with release dates seem to be Wikipedia mirror sites. Is htis article original research, then? Or is it just that this title isn't notable? Or is it just that the title will be notable when it's released, and assuming it is notable now is just crystal balling? The assertions here that the release is "verified and confirmed" don't site anything, either; and those contributors haven't bothered to improve the article. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 13:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes it was me, Blackjays, I just didn't sign in at the time of the comments. One thing is for certain, more information will eventually be available for this album as we get closer to the early 2007 release, and this article is staying put (judging by the "keep support"). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackjays_a434.html" title="User:Blackjays">Blackjays</a> 13:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

Particularly since nobody here asserting that the album is confirmed or verfied has provided a shred of evidence of that confirmation and verification. Not only does <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> apply, then, but so does <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 14:07, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have added some info to the article. It has 39,000 subscribers, which is high for a relatively specialized industry magazine of this sort. It is reachable by at least 3 different online newsletter services. There are about 120,000 links in Google to articles or product reviews published there. It has been published continuously since 1997, rather long for such a publication. I would be a little absurd for a technically-oriented encyclopedia like WP not to carry it, because some of those voting thought it was about furniture. As now revised it is not self-promoting.

<li><b>Comment</b> This really isn't a "school", it's an unaccredited business college and that's a messy area. Counting the clippings isn't the only way to make a judgement. This new college only has 100(?) students and there's a concern about advertising this business for its ambitions, not its achievements. I looked at the press coverage and I wasn't convinced by it at first glance - it's launch publicity, it's uncritical, and it's not in-depth; though I accept that they include bylined items in serious newspapers. If we imagine the college closing today, would it be worth an encyclopedia article on any grounds?? (except comprehensive coverage of all business colleges in India!) Would it be notable in the enduring record of the field? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 08:26, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>weak keep</b> almost full keep. The sources all seem to be more about what the school will be when built and don't have much in the way of detail.

<li><b>Keep</b> If anyone recognises my name from other school afds, they'd be stunned by my suggestion it be kept but this one actually deserves to be included. It needs many things added to it to make it an encyclopedia article and not an advertising run, and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, but all that said I think any (attempt at a) world class post-graduate school of management built for $3.6m in a developing country is notable. India has a veritable tsunami of schools of cautious notability outside of India but I don't think this is an example due to the hubub it caused. It's unaccredited but I imagine a lot of Indian schools don't have the same accreditation standards as schools in developed countries and generally across the world business colleges are less likely to be accredited then other similar institutions. Per a couple of comments by people about it being ambitious rather than established, I agree, but it's VERY ambitious. Consider if a plan was afoot and the groundwork laid for a 2000 storey tower made out of diamonds in Australia, it's not established rather ambitious, but boy is it ambitious! Therefore it'd be worthy of an article. I think this is the same sort of thing.<b><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•E<span style="background:#206">l<span style="background:#504">om<span style="background:#702">i<span style="background:#a00">s•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 23:07, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not quite accurate to say that the position of mayor of West Hollywood is a "non-elected" position. The mayor is elected by the city council. By tradition, the position generally rotates among the councilmembers, but this is only by consent of the council majority, not by automatic right.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>: only one editor making genuine arguments for keeping in this AfD, though not being very specific. There are two NME reviews documented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ohnoitsjamie&amp;oldid=91876014#Yoriyos" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ohnoitsjamie&amp;oldid=91876014#Yoriyos" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and NME is undoubtedly a notable music publication. However, the article as it stands relies on nothing more than the subject's family to assert notability, and there's clear consensus here that that isn't sufficient. If anyone is able to create an article which asserts and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifies</a> the subject's notability independently, more than the current two-sentence stub, then this deletion doesn't prejudice against that. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 02:42, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>* Ivan and Pikel were in fact two of the main protagonists in the Cleric Quintet and deserve a page of their own. Other minor characters like like <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drizzt.html" title="Drizzt">Drizzt</a>'s favored weapons <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twinkle.html" title="Twinkle">Twinkle</a> and <a href="../../../i/c/i/Icingdeath.html" title="Icingdeath">Icingdeath</a> have a page.</li>
<li>Changing to <b>Keep</b> Didn't understand from the wording, "Residents of R.A. Salvatores Forgotten Realms Universe" that these are characters from a book series. Intro paragraph could use a good cleanup and wikilinks (for instance, how about specifying, "fictional characters from the book series <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cleric_Quintet_b961.html" title="The Cleric Quintet">The Cleric Quintet</a>"?), but now I see, from reading others' input here, that these are notable characters. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 18:09, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are hundreds of schools on wikipedia. Does someone famous HAVE to be from each of them to make them notable? I cleaned up the article's silly redlinks. If you look at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a>, you will notice that over the past two years a developing community consensus has emerged favoring keeping articles on <i>bona fide</i> schools for which there is verifiable information available. Also, WP:DP explicitly states that an article being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason for deletion. Finally, at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> there is a proposed policy in development--I would suggest we hold off on this (and any other school articles anyone may wish to nominate) until that policy is finalized and adopted, unless there is a policy specifically requiring the deletion of the given school--otherwise, we risk removing content that may turn out to be explicitly acceptable according to a broader community consensus. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> 15:01, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I'm not mistaken, there's never been a clear community consensus on keeping articles about schools of disputed notability; the articles are merely kept because "no consensus" in AFD discussions defaults to "keep". <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 18:53, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also note that in the last few months deletion decison and redirects have become increasingly more common. As to what schools should satisfy, there are currently two proposals in play <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>.

<li><b>Merge/Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florham_Park_School_District_3776.html" title="Florham Park School District">Florham Park School District</a>. Whatever little content exists should be merged to the district article. Article makes no claim of notability for school, and no evidence was found in Google / Google News to support an ex post facto claim for this school. Consensus is that such articles should be the subject of a merge/redirect which preserves article history and allows for recreation of an expanded article in the event that additional information crops up that would justify a standalone article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:14, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Said guideline states that "notability is not subjective," which rings false to me, but its point is that it's not based on "I like it," but rather "It satisfies X, Y, and Z" (which can be found in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). Properly sourced and written, Sadly, No! might be a valuable entry to Wikipedia. But right now it needs work to prove itself. In some sense it's kind of a shame that blogs need to go through such effort to prove themselves, so much so that the source text can be as much reference as explanation (in order to deflect random annoying AfDs). But, considering the arcane and novel nature of blogs, it's necessary in order to have a consistent policy all around. And Sadly, No! doesn't seem to meet it. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 22:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Retain - Do Not Delete</b> It is very important in the case of political blogs to be able to find third-party information on the people involved and the history of the blog. If we begin to pick and choose which political blog "qualifies" for a Wikipedia entry, we'd better be very careful about the political philosophies of the people recomending deletion. Why delete the Sadly,No entry and not, say, the Little Green Footballs entry? Where would it stop? Where <i>should</i> it stop? 70.89.67.161 22:04, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> - There are notability guidelines at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I personally think they're a bit too strict on blogs (versus, say, minor <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a> characters), but the Sadly, No! article really needs to have some sourcing as to its notability, and, frankly, it needs to be better-written. Right now, the article is poorly written and the blog comes off as some small humor blog that derives its humor and alleged notability off of starting "blog dust-ups" with more well-known blogs. It still might be notable — maybe it's the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_G_f9eb.html" title="Ali G">Ali G</a> of the blogosphere — but, from the entry, I just can't see how. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 22:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Sadly, No! is a blog fairly frequently linked to by "top tier" blogs like Atrios, and is certainly a moderate-traffic player in the left-wing, um, blogosphere. The article information could use sourcing, and if that means sourcing it to their "About" page, well, that would be a start. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromis_8385.html" title="User:Cromis">Cromis</a> 02:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> - An "about" page is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Links to media coverage, awarding organizations, news stories, well-established webpages/blogs, etc. are the kind of things I'd be looking for. (The last of these is not considered by some to establish notability, but I think that a blog being consistently mentioned — not merely linked to — by several top blogs is a pretty good indication of notability.) <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 02:31, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> - Well, yeah, the sourcing is problematic. To me the notability is fairly clear - dozens of links from Atrios over at least 2 years, plenty of links from other sites; if you follow Atrios, you can't help but be familiar with it. It's a B-level political blog, of which there are many, but that doesn't make them all irrelevant or identical, any more than, say, local newspaper columnists. On the other hand, if there's nothing both interesting &amp; verifiably sourced you can say about it, then notability doesn't matter so much. The problem I have is with comments indicating that it's obviously not notable because ... it's a blog? They don't know anything about it? They don't like it? Those aren't grounds for non-notability. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromis_8385.html" title="User:Cromis">Cromis</a> 64.142.81.56 21:51, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> - As for as I can tell, people aren't saying it's not notable <i>because</i> it's a blog, rather that it's a nonnotable blog.

<li><b>Comment</b> When the blog posts in question are on blogs like Marginal Revolution and written by folks like Harvard Economist Greg Mankiw, does the fact that publishing is done online necessarily make it trivial?</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Even if you open a bunch of Blogger accounts, you can't make yourself notable, because you're neither multiple sources nor independent of the subject. If, however, thirty bloggers write articles about <i>you</i>, that is a strong indicator of notability. Of course, bad faith would have to be taken into consideration... but there's certainly more than enough evidence to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on the part of the bloggers who wrote about Passey and believe that they wrote about her because they thought she was notable. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 01:54, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I mean that I'd be posing as thirty different people. There is not really anything to prevent this. And even ignoring those kinds of possiblities, I can't accept a blog post as an indicator of notability. Blogs have absolutely no publishing standards (nor should they). Plenty of bloggers are part of circles of friends that regularly talk about each other's exploits. Certainly a few buddies writing about each other can't make them notable to the world. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubSeven_abca.html" title="User:SubSeven">SubSeven</a> 13:54, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> I realize that you'd be posing as thirty people. This again goes to the notability criteria being <i>guidelines</i>... not policies, not laws. If your article is up for deletion and you want to claim that you meet the notability criteria because of your mention on thirty different blogs, people could choose to discount that evidence based on suspicion that those thirty different blogs aren't really "multiple" sources, nor really "independent" of the subject. Are you suggesting that that is the case with the multiple blog mentions of Passey? It seems highly unlikely, considering that 1) most of the published works on blogs regarding Passey are hardly complimentary and 2) many of the published works are on well-known, large blogs, which aren't likely to allow themselves to be used as sockpuppets.</li>

<dd>As far as blogs having "no publishing standards"... technically, neither do newspapers nor magazines nor any other media outlets. Anybody is free to publish whatever he wants. I can start my own newspaper and put whatever the heck I want in it; it's a free country. But <i>respected</i> blogs, just like respected mainstream media outlets, make an effort <i>not</i> to publish works on non-notable subjects.</dd>
<dd>Certainly a few buddies writing about each other doesn't establish notability. But just as certainly, a person who is the subject of articles on Kos, Huffington, Malkin, and Powerline <i>is</i> most likely notable, regardless of whether the New York Times deigns to take notice. Discarding blogs entirely as an indicator of notability makes no more sense than automatically accepting any mention on any blog as an indicator of notability. But even so, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as it is written today certainly includes blogs; it explicitly excludes other things but not blogs, and it specifically emphasizes that the definition of "published work" is left extremely broad. If you want, you can argue that Passey is not notable, and you can argue that the cited works do not prove notability. But you can't legitimately argue that she doesn't meet the guideline <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, because she plainly does. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 19:18, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That an article fails a notability guideline would be a reason to consider the article's merit, not an ironclad mandate to delete.

<dd>(boldface in original)</dd>
<dd>In the second place, Passey meets WP:BIO besides. The very <i>first</i> criterion for notability:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Okay, so what's a published work? The guideline continues:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in <b>all forms</b>, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries (2) except for the following: (two criteria which do not apply to Passey).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>(2): What constitutes a "published work" is deliberately broad.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A blog post is surely a published work in <i>some</i> form. And several of the blogs which published articles on Passey are big, well-known blogs with massive readership. Heck, some probably attract more eyeballs than most major newspapers.</dd>
<dd>Maybe blog posts should be specifically excluded from the category of "published works" in WP:BIO. But as of now, they're not. Passey meets the notability guidelines spelled out in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and this article should not be deleted.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> can you tell us how substantial those newspaper articles are? Do they just mention her name in passing, or are they entirely about JMMP? The headlines don't mention her anyway. I found the <i>Seattle Times</i> article <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002042747_blogosphere22.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002042747_blogosphere22.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, in my opinion it doesn't really count as a substantial reference, because it's primarily not about her — she only gets a few paragraphs. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 09:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Neither article is entirely about her, no. But she gets a couple of paragraphs, and the quotes I added. Basically she's given as one of a couple of examples of people with notable blogs. The Seattle Times article is about how blogs can affect politics, and the Toronto Star article is about using blogs to start relationships. She's cited in both as an example of the point about blgos that the article is trying to make. --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 15:34, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Umm, the bit that says, "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." I really don't think blog entries making fun of someone's declaration of quality count as "non-trivial". <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Buckey_988c.html" title="User:Chris Buckey">Chris Buckey</a> 18:42, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> From <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "Non-triviality is a measure of the depth of content of a published work, and how far removed that content is from a simple directory entry or a mention in passing that does not discuss the subject in detail." It specifically draws the examples of a birth certificate or a single ballot line as trivia. Other examples of trivia: "newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths." Published works focused primarily on the subject are not trivial, even if they take the form of blog posts. Even if you disagree, do you think the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Star_41f5.html" title="Toronto Star">Toronto Star</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Times_a494.html" title="Seattle Times">Seattle Times</a> are also trivial publications? <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 00:19, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Right. Verifyability in and of itself is *not* a reason to keep an article. Just because a reporter writes an article that verifies your buttocks are hairy and do indeed exist does not make them worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. Trivial subject = not notable. "The opposite exists also: things that are interesting without being really important. For example, the Guinness Book of World Records contains, apart from many world records that are "important", several "trivia" world records. So wikipedia will not mention each and every "world record" that is interesting, but only those that are also important." How is this cow important? Don't forget the conflict of interest either, or do you think that's a good thing? <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 05:27, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It doesn't appear to me as if anything about the article's changed. That leaves the COI issue. COI is not necessarily a reason for deletion, though. Verifiability, NPOV/encyclopedic tone, and "no original research" are all met. The article could probably use some cleanup, but that's also not a reason for deletion. That leaves self-promotion. I notice that the author of the article the nominator of this AfD cited is also the author of one of the article's sources, though, and that that earlier article was written in 2003, meaning this author knew of the piece and its artist long before the article existed. It seems possible to me that Mr. Spinelli took an interest on his own, so I'm inclined to give benefit of the doubt in this case. I also think it's a bit soon to renominate the article, but I suppose the new information is a decent reason. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 06:38, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, it is a valid reason to keep, since you'll see people remove nominations all the time upon realizing that the situation has been recently discussed.

<li><b>Comment</b> Aside from notability and verifiability, does it bother anyone else that the cow's owner wrote a Wikipedia article about said cow, and was then featured in a seasonal newspaper article (which was to be expected as the cow has some local notability) where he said "Just look up Gladys the Swiss Dairy Cow" on Wikipedia? I don't think Wikipedia has to take itself so seriously that we can't include a little regional folk art here and there, but I feel like we are being used for self-promotion. As far as I can tell, the only reason Gladys will become notable is <i>because</i> she has an article on WP. Isn't that some sort of logical fallacy or circular-something-or-other, possibly phrased in Latin?&#160;:) I think the cow keeper means well, but the promotion angle bothers me a lot.

<li><b>AUTHOR ABSTAINS</b> Morning Katr67 - I can understand how you might feel that there is a COI in my having referenced the article, however, there is nothing further from the truth. there is no commerical interest for me in this art, it is not connected to any business venture, and there is no value in self-promotion here, other than shating the information itself.
<p>The only reason I commented on the article was to note its existence ion anticipation of the significant public interest that a front page article generates. You'uu note that I said "you can find the history of the artwork on wikipedia" - which is a perfectly legitimate thing to say wihout even a hint of a COI - a refernce to a reliable source of veruified information on a notable piece of art, not a commercial shill.</p>
<p>One other idea - shouldn't the fifth fromt ( yet another....) page article in a huge newspaper be enought to pass notability?</p>
<p><b>Final thought - I've revealed my identity through my sign in name - had I something to hide or a COI - I could have selected a pseudonym and none of the previous comments would even be possible. There is no COI and nothing to hide.</b></p>
<p>BTW - Tony Spinelli from the post did in fact aggressively pursue the article - he pursued me for it, which means it passed the review of his editors and the rest of the publishers at the post.</p>

If some choose to consider South Western CT as a large enough coverage area to be considered a national or even regional outlet, so be it. I don't think this articifial cow, covered in different types of paint can possibly be considered "notable." Stretch, twist, and bend the definition of notability until it snaps, at the end of the day the inclusion of the cow article won't break Wikipedia, inclusion just calls the legitimacy of WP into question.

<li>Every artist has to self promote himself, else they just cease to be notable. Therefore our measure of notability is not the degree of self-promotion but the sources referenced.

<p>The notability issue appears to have at least some consensus leaning towards "notable". Perhaps the number of people aware of the sculpoture who are currently arguiing its notability may be a proof point in itself.</p>
<p>The COI piece is open for debate - but per Wiki policy ( I think) is not a reason for deletion in and of itself = especially in the very grey area of communicating facts about a notable work that has no commercial or other finnancial links.--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.lebinski_2692.html" title="User:James.lebinski">James.lebinski</a> 17:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I take your point about the artist not being mentioned in the article. However, I think that is exactly backwards and points out the WP:Auto problem. An article about a piece of art <i>should</i> mention the artist. But this article has a hard time discussing the artist, because it's written <i>by</i> the artist - that's where WP:COI comes into play. Is WP:COI a reason to delete? No - but it's a strong argument against notability, and that's why I'm on the deletion side. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Great debate trials. I wonder about your definitions however. Assuming we're not debating the veracity of the coverage - What exactly is a scrap of coverage? How many more media mentions are necessary over what time period to assume substance in your definition? How many more individuals must view the work or the published reviews? On the surface your characterization could be seen as terribly subjective.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From an obhective measure - the exposure of this art will not substantially increase with wikipedia listing - only the encyclopedic documentation of it will- which does improve wikipedia - bedause its virtual nature is the very thing that allows this breadth of topic to be covered in way not possible in paper based media (ok thats an opinion) . However, in this case, more than three years of pre-wiki notability, almost a dozen articles in three pubklications by more than five individual journalists, TV coverage, and award winning appearances appear to factually contradict your characterization.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This folk art or performance art work has demonstrated notability by virtue of numerous newspaper articles and TV coverage over a 3 year period. Its notability is better established than the vast majority of pop culture subjects which have Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia editors are absolutely not the final arbiters of what is or is not art: for them to give their opinion of the work is original research per se.Do the self proclaimed art experts also want to delete <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude_590a.html" title="Christo and Jeanne-Claude">Christo and Jeanne-Claude</a> because a structure with fabric wrapped around it is not art?

<li>This article is practically orphaned. Take away the user pages and the links related to deletion, and that would leave one disambiguation article (<a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladys.html" title="Gladys">Gladys</a>) and one redirect (<a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladys_the_swiss_Dairy_Cow_0ecf.html" title="Gladys the swiss Dairy Cow">Gladys the swiss Dairy Cow</a>). As is often mentioned around here, orphan articles are usually orphaned for a reason.</li>
<li>Not only does the article exhibit a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> for the author, it is promotional in nature. There is not one word about reaction or reception of the "performance art" at any of the venues that were mentioned in the article (except for one "honorable mention") - this almost is written in a journalistic diary style and not in the style of an encyclopedia (it is almost written from the viewpoint of the cow). Thus it is not a stretch of imagination to call the article an advert for Gladys.</li>
<li>There are far too many pictures in the "article" - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not your own private photo host</a>... and regardless of the outcome of the AfD, the Photo Gallery must be removed.</li>
<li>I am also leery of one local newspaper "supplying" all of the references for this supposedly-significant piece of art (the last "reference," the <i>Monroe Courier</i> article makes no mention of it whatsoever). I would put it on a par with a local newspaper mentioning a particular family having a six-toed cat that plays table tennis... unless there is an independent source demonstrating more than the ability of getting a little promotion in a single local newspaper, I feel compelled to urge <b>delete</b> as a NN advertisement. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 23:46, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm new to wiki so perhaps others can enlighten me on the importance of the orphan scenario.</p>
<p>Two mentions of the reaction exist - in the form of two awards in consecutive years, not just one. One was 'best appearing float" the other honorable mention</p>
<p>I'm hard pressed to see how the content or tone is promotional. Ask yourself&#160;:If I wasn;t honest enough to identify myself as the primary contributor would you feel the same way. I argue that the historical narrative of the work is unbiased. Style help would be graetfully received as edits though.</p>
<p>The sources referenced contain plenty of verifiable quotes on the reation to the art. Perhaps another editor would like to dig up the news articles to add those to the article????????? Maybe that would even be a way out of the COI jeopardy ( which we've established is not a reason for delietion I think?)</p>
<p>I think one picture per work is about right to present the image, glad to have other editors delete those that are unwotrhy. Question If picasso painted cows, which of subset his works would you propose wasn't worthy of a picture in wikipedia ( ok that's just stupid - but my point is valid nonetheless)???</p>
<p>I've added another reference from two more newspapers ( I could use some help formatting, and I still need to dig up the photo credit/author from the courier) in the refernces section - so I'll ask a similar question to the one before just what number of published references are needed and from how many sources?</p>
<p>You may wish to re-red the courier article - the presence of the art at a charity benefit haunted house is mentioned. I'll grant you thatis is a brief mention.</p>
<p>Lastly - from what authoritative source are you attributing the label "local" to the Post?--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.lebinski_2692.html" title="User:James.lebinski">James.lebinski</a> 12:30, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You've done well to paraphrase my self deprecating humor for the layman. When I wrote "Ok that's just stupid" after the picasso comment a lot of ordinary people wouldn't have gotten the joke.</p>
<p>Now onto the ntability topic. As Uncle G writes, notabiilty dioes not lie within the realm of opinion, youir, mine or anyones. This article clearly passes each of the notablity standards set in the policy and as such, your challenge to notability must be a depate of the policy and the facts here. My argument remains that this meets the definition of notability. Your job must now be to offer affirmative proof that it does not.</p>
<p>On two side notes</p>
<p>1) That charity benefit was attended by more than 2000 individuals ver three days, generating more than a on of non-perishable foods for a shelter. It's been going on for years and also has multiple media refernces - Someone mught just want to write a wiki on that as well, because iot arguably passes the wiki notability test too.</p>
<p>If you were truly born to delete cows you better hurry, because I just got an e-mail from a national publication seeking to follow up on Gladys.

<p>Lets examine the discusuon thread a bit further, but I'd prefer to stay within a fact/policy based disciussion - which can reduce the level of emoition involned. Aplogies for any ruffled feathers to date.</p>
<p>1) Can you support your claim that The Post is "local" and implication that therefore the coverage was insignificant</p>
<p>Here's my fact based argument from <a href="http://www.medianewsgroup.com/mngi/newsgroups/connpost.html" class="external free" title="http://www.medianewsgroup.com/mngi/newsgroups/connpost.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.medianewsgroup.com/mngi/newsgroups/connpost.html</a></p>
<p>"The Connecticut Post is located in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and publishes a morning newspaper seven days a week and is distributed primarily in Fairfield County, the most affluent county in the United States. The Connecticut Post also publishes the Westport News, Fairfield Citizen-News, Darien New-Review, and the Norwalk Citizen-News, weekly newspapers, known as the Brooks Newspaper Group, distributed in Fairfield County and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Daily Circulation: 77,469 Sunday Circulation: 89,306"</p>
<p>Fact: More thah 75 thousand people at a time have seen this art and articles aboiut it on the front page of this periodical ( and others) in several articles over many years</p>
<p>2) The good faith policy reference was to my contribution, not your dissent. I already assume your good faith in challenging this contribution, and I respect it - oitherwise I'd be crazy to spend such energy refuting it, and I may just be crazy anyhow. In short, I think that according to wiki-policy you must assume my good faith in making this contributiion, and therefor not consider what you think might happen in the future. On the top of that presumption you have my testimony in this AFD that I am actying in good faithe with significant content to back that up.</p>
<p>3) The facts do not support your argument that the wikipedia article is used to draw media attention. All but one of the published references were months or years before the creation of the enty. The press had noticed the topic long before this content was wiki-d. The order of events goes new and media coverage ( and lots of it) then wiki article. Not the reverse.</p>
<p>4) I accept that you do not consider this art and apologize for implying that you did. we now have agreement on a point that is irrelevant to the discussion at hand, and not a criteria for deletion in any event. Personal opinions just don't count per policy though. Compliance with notability does.</p>
<p>5) Uncle G's well wrtitten comments ( ok thats opinion) that accurately portray notability (ditto) was the reference here, not the contributor. His position, per wiki policy is that the subject passes notability - again I invite you to present a fact based counter argument that combinbes your judgement with wiki-policy.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To the fact-cave yet again...the other bobs advice notwithstanding......</p>
<p>A fact based counter argument is as follows:</p>
<p>The language reads exactly as pasted. However, the notabiilty point was not conceded, nor did the position change. Read a bit more carefully, the senstence means that anyones subjective agreement that this work can be called art is simultaneously a subject of disagrement, which can never be resolved ( de gustibus) and most importantly a topic of irrelevance to the AFD. The fact is, whether you or I think this is art is of no consequence to the discussion nor is it a reason to delete per wiki policy. That viewpoint has not changed one bit.</p>
<p>To be honest, You've stumped me on the second part. I followed the link and still have no idea what your non-notabilty refernce is, but if you'll explain in non-wiki magic links, I'll try to answer.</p>
<p>Finally, You are factually correct in that a single, and most recent of more than 7 properly referenced non-trivial independent news articles contains a quote from me that mentions the existence of the wiki-article. If you follow the date math it goes like this: First comes more than 6 notable referemces, then a wiki-article, then yet another news article in which the wiki-article was mentioned as a minor point. The genesis of the most recent news article was not the wiki-article - you'll find date-stamped proof of the pre-existing intent of the reporter to cover the story in the first AFD. The cause was instead the previous notability of the work from three years of coverage, more directly it was a follow up to the "moving" piece six months later. Moreover even if you stike that article from the record - the notability test is still passed. Add in the good faith policy, coupled with the fact that others tell me coi ( however unfounded) is not a reason for deletion and there is no case. Again, Notability was met years before the publication of the most recent article.</p>

<li>Media coverage is only an indicator, an adjunct in determining notability, but it isn't the *only* thing that confers notability on a topic. So far, it has been the *only* argument for notability. That isn't enough to prove notability. There's an article in my local paper today about a local plumber who helps old people with plumbing problems. He is verified, but being mentioned by the press alone does not make him notable. What actually makes this cow notable? (and more than *just* verified - no one is arguing that the cow isn't verified.) Verification is only one part of notability. It isn't the whole story. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>This one is pretty academic PSchemp, and I believe that you are incorrect. The primary notability policy is explicit, and im my opinion is contrary to your assertion, applying the policy to the coverage of this topic is exactly the thing that has objectively determined notability:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the record:</p>
<p>...a topic is notable if it has been been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself. <b>CHECK</b></p>
<p>What constitutes "published works" is intentionally broad and includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, published reports by consumer watchdog organizations and government agencies. <b>Many Newspapaer Articles in differemt papers - Check</b></p>
<p>The independence qualification excludes all self-publicity, advertising by the subject, autobiographies, press releases, and other such works directly from the subject, its creators, its authors, or its inventors (as applicable). <b>Many Authors/Reporters/Photographers, All from Independent sources, Check</b></p>
<p>Triviality is a measure of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and how directly it addresses the subject. <b>Multiple articles, in depth written discussions, Check</b></p>
<p>For the other Bob - your poiints weigh heavy on me in terms of not wanting to stifle legitimate discussion and avoiding the whole "own" thing. However, the notability psotion being argured is just plain inaccurate here. I'm a wiki-user of only a few days, and I've foundd the fact based content to back up the notability position rather easily.</p>
<p>Seems to me that seems to me that a more experienced user could process the data just as objectively and probably more efficiently to arrive at a policy conclusion.</p>
<p>Meeting the primary criteria is in fact, accorfing to policy the *only* argument needed</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> THREE newspapers does not equal "many". SO a reporter at one of them has a soft spot for your cow. That still isn't "many".

<li>Most people would include "three" in the "MULTIPLE" catagory (that's alot more newspapers writing about this than alot of subjects on WP).

<li>Sorry otherbob, I can't stay out of the fray - fact wise anyhow. Pschemp - its actually four newspapers. Based on previously established notability i'll offer that that the only furthering of the art is when it is carried back to the workshop to create the next piece. Gladys is art - not an empire! Wiki is the right place for the article Proof point: a free vanity website could be instantly created, and not subject to peer review, nor notability, nor any wiki rules. You'll note that none has ever existed, and that the ONLY references on the web are the idependent sources themselves.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have to go this way for now. It is written about in 3 local papers. So we have multiple sources. That means it is not OR and is verifiable. Now, the question is are these sources non-tivial? I'm not convinced that they are. But given the recent vote, I'm willing to let this stay for now. Having said that, additional sources would make this an easier call. Also given the dates and detail, one wonders where all of this data came from. Was all of it from those seven or so newspaper articles? The pictures show that the cow does exist with several paint jobs. One other point for keeping. The fact that this cow is repainted so often may make it unique which would be notable in and of itself. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 01:04, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is definitive of the problem Wikipedia has been working hard to avoid. Aside from a Tripod Website This article has no notability. In the Sports world Wikipedia is becoming a joke. This League appears to be no more than an elborate hoax which has been allowed to go on for two years on Wikipedia. There is no mention (and never has there been any mention) of this league outside of blogs, Wikipedia amd Wiki mirrors. Their website (which no longer exists was hosted on <a href="http://www.tripod.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tripod.com" rel="nofollow">Tripod</a> and gave no information on the league's Front Office structure or contact information. Aside from inconsistencies in the website, there is no mention of any of their teams in known media outlets. There is not and never hasbeen mention on <a href="http://www.oursportscentral.com" class="external text" title="http://www.oursportscentral.com" rel="nofollow">Our Sports Central</a>, which is the definitive minor league sports news website, and the league's teams do not have websites. Please delete this hoax before it further tarnishes the credibility of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 04:38, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Weak neutral</b></s> It was a tough find, and I was expecting to vote delete on this one, especially as a crystalball article, but check <a href="http://www.ssur.org/articles/items/20050811_NicknamesAreMajorLeague.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ssur.org/articles/items/20050811_NicknamesAreMajorLeague.htm" rel="nofollow">this article out</a> which independantly confirms the league and one of its teams (albeit weakly). Also, check out <a href="http://independent.mostvaluablenetwork.com/category/upper-mississippi-baseball-league/" class="external text" title="http://independent.mostvaluablenetwork.com/category/upper-mississippi-baseball-league/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> which makes the claim that the league may be a hoax. Confused? There's more. <a href="http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/illinois/champaign" class="external text" title="http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/illinois/champaign" rel="nofollow">this site</a> seems to hint that the league and ANOTHER of its teams does indeed exist. I am uncertain how to vote on this. I am willing to listen to arguements in both directions, and change my vote accordingly. If this is a hoax, it is elaborate, and extends well beyond wikipedia. Maybe a BJAODN article if it is a hoax?

<dd><b>Comment</b> I knew of the first article you stated, and the article is a mere example of how much Wikipeida is taken seriously, and should not be taken lightly. Basically that article was about names of teams, Columnists tend to gleen info for an opinion based article, often not taking the time to verify info. <b>Also</b> As it is this article was started in 2005 by, what appears to be, an annonymous user. Most people take things as true when they have stuck around for that long. The thing of it is, look at past edits to the article people have pointed out that this is not credibal. This article continually changes its facts. Its former website never was updated with any information whatsoever. Wikipedia actually had more info on this league than the League website itself. Look at the logo, it looks like something a kid made on mspaint. It would not be hard to make a legitimate looking fake basball league logo, they did not even do that. I live in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary%2C_Indiana_1cab.html" title="Gary, Indiana">Gary, Indiana</a> Which is directly next to both <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Chicago%2C_Indiana_58df.html" title="East Chicago, Indiana">East Chicago</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merrillville%2C_Indiana_3b97.html" title="Merrillville, Indiana">Merrillville</a>. No newspaper ever even hinted at a new league and two teams for the region. Think logically about it there are professional Baseball Teams in Gary, Joliet, and Rockford. New Rookie teams in the same city or area would be a terrible business concept. At first I hoped that this was true, but as time went on it became painfully obvious that it was not. No Newspapers have spoken of this League. And that "City Town Info Website" you listed is a common website that makes articles about multiple locations, simply taking info that they found to make any city look good. Facts are not always taken into account. --<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 10:19, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I just must say, this article is exactly what used to be joked about Wikipedia, People stated that due to the fact that anyone can edit it is not credible. Much has been done to change this fact but this article has just slipped by. Its own Tripod website is gone now. If this league returns again in the future (legitimately) than we should add it, but as of now it is just an elaborate hoax, I have asked on independent minor league baseball forums and no one has heard of it. They all agree it makes no sense and is just not real.

Both are sort of detrimental terms, I was just joking about how there's two words for the exact same thing with the exact same connotations. "wapanese" is used more in mainstream usage, with places like 4chan and Something Awful preferring the "weeaboo" term.

<dd>Maybe because it's completely a different issue whose information isn't already covered elsewhere? If you'd notice, the article for the DVD in question redirects to the article you keep citing, inexplicably, as a reason to keep your article. Therefore there is only one article with the pertinent information, and you've identified it. In this AfD case, there's already an article with all the relevant information and as a result this article is redundant. This is not difficult to understand. Normally I do my best to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, but your history here (and, frankly, on <a href="http://lostpedia.com/wiki/User_talk:SilvaStorm" class="external text" title="http://lostpedia.com/wiki/User_talk:SilvaStorm" rel="nofollow">Lostpedia</a>) make this extremely difficult. I'd suggest you stop attacking me on the talk pages for this article and for my user account, by the way. This isn't personal, never was, and never will be. I even helped out one of your Lost episode articles when I came across it in the stub list, or at least I tried to help it, but I see it's been deleted, too, for the same reasons this one is up for discussion. --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 23:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"MF is a collaborative or community weblog, where members post links to online content, such as websites or articles, which either amuse or provoke discussion"... so are thousands other contentless blogs with spam and google ads. 75k alexa, a ton of google hits thanks to continuous spamming of other sites, but hey, its easy to tell after the first page there are no relevant results. Delete as non-notable blog site. timecop 05:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment(s)</b>. Let me correct some misinformation. Monkeyfilter has no google ads, nor any advertisements of any kind. Monkeyfilter does not "spam other sites", unless you consider linking to web-sites to be spamming. Monkeyfilter's google pagerank cannot be altered by Wikipedia because all external links from WP are set to <code>rel=nofollow</code>. Monkeyfilter is not contentless, unless you consider comments and discussion to be non-content, in which case <a href="../../../m/e/t/MetaFilter_037b.html" title="MetaFilter">MetaFilter</a> is also contentless.</p>
<p>Now some counterpoints. First, MonkeyFilter has been through VfD in 2004, as you can read in Talk:MonkeyFilter. The consensus then was near-unanimous keep. Because of the age of the article, it does not qualify for speedy delete. About notability, MonkeyFilter passes the <a href="../../../g/t/_/WP%7EGT_7ea5.html" title="WP:GT">Google test</a>. It and <a href="http://www.metachat.org" class="external text" title="http://www.metachat.org" rel="nofollow">MetaChat</a> are currently the largest MetaFilter clone sites (clone in the sense of software), including non-trivial overlapping communities, but the three sites have very different foci. Needless to say, being a clone is not a sufficient rationale for deletion: take <a href="../../../2/c/h/2ch.html" title="2ch">2ch</a> and <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a>, for example. A better deletion reason might have been that Monkeyfilter fails to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but WP:WEB is only a guideline, and MonkeyFilter is both a website and a community. I can make a case that Monkeyfilter meets <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> and should therefore not be deleted, but I won't because <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> is not yet a guideline. Different editors will have different standards of notability for web-based communities: some, such as the nominator, may think most most blogs are non-notable; others, such as the commentators on the previous VfD, will point out that the size of the Monkeyfilter community is large enough to be notable.</p>
One remedy instead of outright deletion is to merge MonkeyFilter into <a href="../../../m/e/t/MetaFilter_037b.html" title="MetaFilter">MetaFilter</a>, This will, of course, have to be brokered with the editors of the latter article, who may not agree to the merge.
<p>Note:I am not "voting" because AfD is not a vote, I am a member of MonkeyFilter (as I have disclosed on my user page), and I have edited the article in question. I have also grown to suspect over time that AFD debates have essentially arbitrary outcomes. Lur 10:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><small>— Lur (<a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELur_1d91.html" title="User talk:Lur">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lur_a853.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lur">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li>Fair points that you make, but consider that we have a raft of policies and guidelines as well as common sense to help us make a decision. Hence, the judicious use of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and other notability guidelines which this fails. It may look like "Delete per nom" is mindless cant, but in many cases, the issue is clearcut and well elaborated in the nomination. Which is the case here. Viz: <b>Delete</b> per nom. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 14:25, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do keep in mind that several claims in the nom are outright false, as I have indicated in my first paragraph above. Therefore a delete "per nom" is a perpetuation of falsehoods. Note further that the possibility of not meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> was not part of the nom, and indeed was a point <i>I</i> raised. Lur 15:12, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the nomination doesn't state fails WP:WEB directly, it instead addresses those aspects of the guideline within WP:WEB that are germane here, so smae thing as I read it. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:43, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. Your minds are made up, as is plain from the fact that not one of you has bothered to read my comment carefully. I don't care to be your dancing monkey and MoFi does not need Wikipedia's grudging acknowledgement. Lur 19:37, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Is that an admission that the subject has not been covered in multiple, independent reliable sources. It sounds like it to me. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 00:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Article does not cite any sources; no hits on Google News; one hit apiece on Books and Scholar, but the book does not even list MonkeyFilter in the index and the article in Scholar is on p2p filesharing, so it is unlikely it discusses MonkeyFilter (a site that does not feature filesharing) much. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 00:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Interesting that you have a low tolerance for dramaqueenery, but apparently a high tolerance for outright lies being used a justification for deleting an entry. Wikipedia may not be a directory for blogs, but it's going to be awfully stupid for an <i>internet</i> resource not to highlight <i>internet</i> sites which have particular character, history or is of particular interest.

<li><b>Comment</b> - then it might interest you to note that Wikipedia is not for things that are "interesting", because "interesting" is highly subjective where as notable, according to Wikipedia policy, is not.

That sounds like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> to me, or getting pretty close to it at any rate. The game is new, so more coverage is likely.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I have greatly reduced the article, reducing unnecessary detail, abandoning it's former manual and crystal ball style. Next time I post a new article I'll be sure to add sources at the very beginning to avoid these kind of issues.

<p>"Ping-O-Matic is a service to update different search engines that your blog has updated." Yeah, right. Surprisingly high Alexa rank in 4200's, probably due to link incest/spam, since the company seems to be exactly in that kind of business. However, still non-notable enough concept. Spamming search engines with blogs is hardly new (or notable). timecop 06:06, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep or merge to <a href="../../../p/i/n/Ping_%28blogging%29.html" title="Ping (blogging)">Ping (blogging)</a></b> Ping-O-Matic is used by thousands of bloggers to promote their website. (See <a href="../../../p/i/n/Ping_blog.html" title="Ping blog">Ping_blog</a>) It acutally is not spam. The blog world evolved a service called pinging to notify the general public of when their websites were updated. This spawned services like <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technorati.html" title="Technorati">Technorati</a>. The author of the blog would simply need to put a ping url in his post. As the numbers of these services grew, the numbers of urls grew, so a service like Ping-O-Matic was formed to return to putting one single URL instead of many. PingOMatic does not spam search engines. It sends pings to <i>blog</i> search engines, which <a href="http://www.technorati.com/ping" class="external text" title="http://www.technorati.com/ping" rel="nofollow">literally want people to ping them</a>. Also, do a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ping+o+matic&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ping+o+matic&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">google</a>; 1 million hits, and the first couple pages are independent blogs mentioning the ups and downs of the service.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This list provides an ordered collection of the Pope's written works. This is entirely in line with policy and has nothing to do with Amazon. As MER-C said, it's not indiscriminate. We can't turn it into a category either without creating tens of stubs about the works in question. And it's too long to put in the main Pope article. This is fine right where it is. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:47, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per those above. This is a list of strictly defined parameters and will remain so even if the Pope does nothing but write until he shuffles off this mortal coil. It's far too long to go anywhere else, too. Additionally, the Estonians seem to have nothing against their copy of the list, so I'd say it's probably notable enough for us as well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Undeniably notable and of general interest, however it does appear that there is no similar list for John Paul II (as in one that includes pre-Pope material, too) and I recommend one be created since he was a noted writer before he became pope. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:32, 28

<li>My name is Tim the mute and I am the lead singer for the shiny diamonds. Although it was my account this was written on, I didn't personally write the entry. I did however author the new music canada page and I did forget to post our albums on it. We have three albums and a few singles, while they didn't recieve much play across Canada, they were still featured on singles and compilations and the like. I can assure you we are indeed a real band and we are just as "notable" or relevant as anything else on this website. Now in the name of sharing information on the worlds only universal medium, please do not delete this article.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't even aware that we were being considered for deletion until a newspaper contacted me about it this morning. Anyways, thank you for your time. -Tim</p>

<p>This page was created in response to other wiki's such as the "wikifur" and "encyclopedia dramatica" creating false and possibly slanderous comments about this webcomic.To the contrary of other descriptions about this comic on the internet, this article is an objective description available from a primary source, ie the creator of the webcomic this article refers to. It is my hope that this article is not deleted as it contains valuable and factual information about a popular internet meme. If I have not properly cited myself while using 3rd person language as required by wiki rules, than I would be glad to edit the article rather than see it deleted.

<li>Thanks for your assistance, Fut.Perf. My reasons for asking for deletion are the following:
<ul>
<li>Googling for "orthodox file manager" (<b>with</b> quotes) yelds a measly 305 results.</li>
<li>The term is never mentioned in the <i>Jargon file</i>, the most notable and comprehensive hacker slang dictionary.</li>
<li>The term "orthodox" is not even mentioned in the web site of <i>GNU Midnight Commander</i>, probably the most notable example of Norton Commander clone in use nowadays.</li>
<li>So, my opinion is that this entry looks like an attempt by somebody to use Wikipedia either to add authority to his own neologism, or to add "orthodoxy" to their file managers of choice. --88.149.168.128 11:11, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainly not a well-recognised term - seems to be coined <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">by this website</a>. I would guess most people would call these "norton commander clones" - that term gets far more google hits. Either <b>move</b> or <b>delete</b>. Googling for "Orthodox file manager" -wikipedia -Bezroukov gets only 400 hits. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 10:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah, but two questions: who added those links?

<li><b>Weak keep or merge with <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_manager.html" title="File manager">file manager</a></b>. From a (superficial) search through Google articles, it seems that the neologism was coined and propagated by <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">SoftPanorama/Bezroukov</a>, but it caught up to a <i>certain</i> extent.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> <s>or <b>move.</b></s> It is both obvious that the class of file managers described in the article exists &amp; it is a notable collection of file managers (and the term is preferable to "Norton Commander-style file manager" or similar alternatives). There have been no strong arguments for deletion &amp; the strongest objections come from an anonymous user. The term has been used by the developers of Krusader and other popular file managers, as well as in news articles. There is a dmoz sub-category "orthodox" under "file managers." While a google search for 'orthodox "file manager"' does produce false positives, a quick survey of some of the first hits (from 13,200 total) suggest that some people call these "orthodox twin-pane file managers" or "orthodox two-panel file managers" or other permutations of 2/two/twin/dual pane/panel. Another semi-popular alternative is "orthodox or NC-style file manager." --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 15:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why would "orthodox file manager" (305 Google hits) be preferrable to "Commander style file manager" (15000 Google hits)&#160;? What does "orthodox" mean? That's complete nonsense. So I'll say that the only "orthodox" file manager is the Macintosh Finder. Go ahead and contradict me. --88.149.168.128 16:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a discussion for DELETING the article &amp; was prompted by your comments. Now you are arguing to move (rename) the article. As such, I think this should be speedily closed as keep &amp; talk of a page move should go onto the discussion page. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 17:37, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not arguing it should be moved. I'm arguing it should be deleted.--88.149.168.128 18:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So why'd you ask about "Commander style file manager?" I'll treat that question as if it was sincere. As AoR notes, it is a clumsier term. It also promotes a particular piece of software over others. As for your other challenge, you have pointed out multiple pages that use "orthodox" to refer to a class of file managers resembling NC/mc/emelfm/krusader/etc. Playing the same google game shows only four hits for "'macintosh finder' 'orthodox file manager'" and none of the hits claims the finder is an OFM. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 22:11, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never asked for the entry to be <b>moved</b> to "Commander style file manager". I'm asking <b>you</b> why <b>you</b> are saying that a term which yelds 305 Google hits should be preferred to a term which yelds 15000 Google hits. Moreover, seeing as the number of Google hits evidently doesn't matter in <b>your</b> view, the fact that a Google search for "macintosh finder" "orthodox file manager" yelds only 4 hits shouldn't constitute a valid objection to my (clearly fictional) point that the Macintosh Finder is the only orthodox file manager in the world.--88.149.168.128 23:34, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How about the coherent content of pages? It was easy to see that none of those four pages referred to Finder as an OFM. It is straight forward to see that most of the thousands of pages which mention orthodox file managers are describing the same thing. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 00:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly, "orthodox file manager" doesn't return "thousands" of pages. It returns a LOW number of pages, which means that the phrase is not wide-spread and it's used mainly by its proponent(s). As for the fact that no one is referring to the Finder as an "orthodox file manager", that's probably due to the fact that I didn't put up a web page calling the Finder "orthodox", nor did I make up a Wikipedia entry for "orthodox file manager" where I say that the Mac Finder is the only orthodox file manager.--88.149.166.153 09:14, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The second search is not relevant because it includes all the pages where the word "orthodox" is unrelated to "file manager". 1970 hits for "orthodox file manager" is of course ridicolous, and it just goes to prove my point. It also makes sense to suppose that a considerable part of those pages have had Wikipedia itself as a source.--88.149.166.153 20:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You claimed that a search didn't "yeld" (sic) thousands of pages. I showed this wasn't the case (even the most conservative search gives close to 2000 hits). How is this "ridicouluous" (sic)? I did point out that there were false positives in the second search. However, as I also stated, it catches many other pages that refer to file managers as being orthodox (because some people use orthodox as one in a series of adjectives). --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 21:42, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>1970 pages is not "thousands of pages". The second search is useless unless you also cite the exact number of false positives.--88.149.166.153 22:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The subject is a real writer of possible notabiliy (though some of the few backlinks seem to concern another Jon Erickson), but the article contains no verifiable biographic information at all. Prod contested by User:Jandrewbz, the only substantial contributor to the article. From his original version I removed a "controversy" section with the content</p>

<dd><i>Erickson's name was tagged in Sharpie marker on the window of his ex-residence, the Bottom of the Hill House. To this day, the culprit remains a mystery. There are no suspects.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>which even if true would hardly be something of encyclopaedic importance. The whole thing smells of either a strange hoax or an attempt at an attack page, possibly aimed at another Jo(h)n Erickson than the one who wrote <a href="../../../t/h/e/Hacking%7E_The_Art_of_Exploitation_1958.html" title="Hacking: The Art of Exploitation">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</a>.

<li>I am just an everyday user so maybe I am not smart enough about this, but I don't see why wikipedia should not also be a dictionary any more than why my cell phone should not also be a calculator. Maybe wikipedia would have been bad if it was too much of a dictionary at first, but now that there is so much content it doesnt make any sense to exclude abstract terms. In fact, foreign users may not know whether a term is abstract or not and may not know whether to go to wiktionary or wikipedia. Why make them choose? I have started using wikipedia a lot more lately. Part of the appeal is that whenever I wonder what something objectively is, I can just go to wikipedia. I did that for this word and found you plan to delete it. Sure, there is another site, there is wiktionary, but everyday people like one stop shopping. Every word has a definition, a history, some famous thematic uses, etc. Even if the latter may take a long time to be noted, it should still be included. Wikipedia should answer the question "What is ________?" By finding excuses to send people to other sites for a common 5-10% of queries wikipedia makes itself less convenient. Many wikipedia entries like steel, hammer, music, and dog will be in dictionaries too. Why exclude definitions? Should google start blocking searches that include the word definition so that people can go to some other site too? Maybe barnes and noble should stop selling dictionaries and focus on being a book store. A few definitions in wikipedia might not fit the five year plan, but to the common user, unconcerned with ideology, they can only provide an additional benefit. - Marc

<li><i>everyday people like one stop shopping.</i> — Then they should use one of the several almalgamation services such as <a href="../../../a/n/s/Answers.com.html" title="Answers.com">answers.com</a> that cater to such people.
<p><i>Every word has a definition, a history, some famous thematic uses, etc.</i> — And documenting all that, for all words of all languages, as well as providing translations, pronunciations, inflections, usage notes, synonyms, antonyms, related words, and others, is the ambitious goal of Wiktionary. It is not the goal of <i>this</i> project. The goal of this project is to be an encyclopaedia. Its articles are about the people, concepts, places, events, and things that the words denote. So show by <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citing sources</a> that discuss the subject that an encyclopaedia article can be had, that will not be a perpetual stub (unexpandable perpetual stubs being deletable per our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>), on the concept of ubiquity.</p>
<p><i>Maybe barnes and noble should stop selling dictionaries and focus on being a book store.</i> — That isn't analogous, and so is irrelevant. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:10, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I was not aware of the deletion history associated with this page, but shouldn't we be judging the article on its <i>current</i> state, rather than its past incarnations? I would argue that given the <i>significant</i> notability of <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_%28band%29.html" title="War (band)">War</a>, and seeing as this band consists of more original members of War than the band now known as War, making its notability under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html#Criteria_for_musicians_and_ensembles" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">WP:MUSIC</a> criterion 6 more significant than your average side project, the subject certainly meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and the other cited policies. The current page is sourced, does not read as advertising, and is not copyright infringement. Other editors may disagree with my assessment, but I remind them to consider only the current version of the page; since the page has been modified enough not to warrant {{db-repost}}, all previous versions should be considered moot in this discussion. —<a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb"><i>talk</i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb"><i>contribs</i></a></sup> 15:55, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prod removed, which said: (1) Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a place to announce or organize conferences. (2) No evidence of outside sources/notability. So, delete.</p>
<p>I suggest <b>speedy deletion</b> because I feel the creator of this article is taking advantage of Wikipedia to announce this conference, which is going to take place next week. S/he waited as long as possible (5 days) before removing my prod, and now may be counting on this AfD to last another 5 days before the article is deleted. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:37, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm very sorry about this guys, I didn't see the "Fictional article" deletion policy. I want this deleted because it is what it was marked as: A fictional event/personages that I thought some people would find amusing. I now realize that this article in no way contributes to the Wikipedia's purpose: to give provide a <b>factual</b>, user edited database. One again I offer my deepest apologies. I hope to make substantial and meaningful contributions to "The Wiki" in the future. Please delete the Blue Bottle Boys page! P.S. It really is a lot of nonsense in a way.

<p>Non-notable company - blatant spam--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 21:57, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I find it truly interesting that <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> (who can't even spell the word "blatant" correctly, by the way) arrogates the right to decide which companies are notable and which are not. Why does he not then request the deletion of articles about similar companies in the same line of business, such as <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applix.html" title="Applix">Applix</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Objects_%28company%29_1013.html" title="Business Objects (company)">Business Objects</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognos.html" title="Cognos">Cognos</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_Solutions_6efe.html" title="Hyperion Solutions">Hyperion Solutions</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="../../../q/l/i/QlikTech_e303.html" title="QlikTech">QlikTech</a>, etc.? <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> must provide some pretty good reasons why these other companies are notable, while a very similar company such as <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimensional_Insight_0bfd.html" title="Dimensional Insight">Dimensional Insight</a> is not. Failing that, and unless he is asking to delete all <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_intelligence.html" title="Business intelligence">Business intelligence</a> vendors, I must conclude <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> is biased. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 23:42, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Well, firstly, you must define "notable company"; secondly, you must explain why and how you have become the single judge of this matter on the Wikipedia, when you don't seem to know much at all about <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_intelligence.html" title="Business intelligence">Business intelligence</a> vendors; thirdy, you must explain why you have attacked this company specifically — indeed, to the point of describing information about it as "spam", clearly without any knowledge of fact — but not <b>other</b> companies, such as the ones I have listed above, which operate in the same line of business and produce similar products. As you have not requested the deletion of those other comparable companies, I must conclude that (1) either you have an axe to grind, or (2) if this is simply an unmotivated, random attack, then you are in fact the "spammer" here! <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 15:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

I concede that I was a little hasty in labelling the article as 'spam' and I would like to retract that part of my statement.

<ul>
<li><b>I couldn't disagree more.</b> I happen to know this company well and use its products daily. When I created this article, I specifically patterned it on articles about a number of similar companies, which produce and market similar products (e.g.: <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applix.html" title="Applix">Applix</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Objects_%28company%29_1013.html" title="Business Objects (company)">Business Objects</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognos.html" title="Cognos">Cognos</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_Solutions_6efe.html" title="Hyperion Solutions">Hyperion Solutions</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="../../../q/l/i/QlikTech_e303.html" title="QlikTech">QlikTech</a>, etc.). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> says: "'If article X then article Y.' is a fallacious argument, for obvious reasons." I beg your pardon: What obvious reasons? Quite the contrary, in fact. What's good for the goose is good for the gander, I think, is the rule of thumb. The article includes a link to the company's web site (<a href="http://www.dimins.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.dimins.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dimins.com</a>) that provides all the information you need (same as for those other companies). Again, no one can tell me what the "notability" criteria are. If there are indeed such criteria, then they should be enforced for all businesses, not just this one.
<ul>
<li>Rubbish. You've already been told three times what the criteria are, both in this discussion and in notices in the article itself, all of which have linked <i>directly</i> to the criteria to apply and how to demonstrate that they are satisfied. You'll not make a case by arguing as you are continuing to do. Your only way to make a case is to do what I said to do above. So stop making erroneous arguments about some supposed arbitrariness or unfairness of the long-standing criteria that we apply to <i>all</i> companies, and start citing those sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(1) <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> seems to be asking for a list of customers and a list of directors. That is what the company's web site is for. If you need more information, you can call the company directly and ask for informational materials, but I don't see how that belongs to the Wikipedia article.</li>
<li>(2) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> asks for sources. Again, from what I can see, the company's web site is usually the only source provided in articles about other companies. What other sources do you need? Customer testimonials? They are on the company's web site.</li>
<li>(3) <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a>, apparently without any direct knowledge, asserts the company is "NN" and invites me to <b>assume</b> good faith on the part of <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a>, when in fact I happen to know quite a bit about <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_intelligence.html" title="Business intelligence">Business intelligence</a> software, while, with all due respect, <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> doesn't seem to. I say to <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a>: Please assume my good faith!</li>
<li>I am sorry, but this all seems quite preposterous to me. I have been a Wikipedia editor for two and a half years, I have made several thousand contributions, started numerous articles, and have never come across this kind of biased, targeted scrutiny. I strongly urge <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> to withdraw his unmotivated AfD nomination and I strongly urge <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> to remove his arbitrary notability warning. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 20:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not arbitrary. They are the criteria that apply to all company articles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The companies Pasquale refer to all carry at least one claim of notability. <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applix.html" title="Applix">Applix</a> <i>were one of the pioneers of integrated Speadsheet/Word Processing/Graphics office automation suites running on Unix workstations,</i> <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> created a <a href="../../../d/o/t/Dot.com.html" title="Dot.com">dot.com</a> which <i>was among the first services to broadcast custom alerts (such as stock price alerts) to wireless devices,</i> and so forth. The article on DI, by contrast, lists no such pioneering developments and is therefore non-notable in it current form--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 21:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: (To echo Edchilvers and expand a bit: <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Objects_%28company%29_1013.html" title="Business Objects (company)">Business Objects (company)</a> has about 20 times the number of customers of DI and is publicly traded; <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognos.html" title="Cognos">Cognos</a> has 3,500 employees and 23,000 customers (versus 1500 for DI); <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_Solutions_6efe.html" title="Hyperion Solutions">Hyperion Solutions</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> are publicly traded (NASDAQ), and <a href="../../../q/l/i/QlikTech_e303.html" title="QlikTech">QlikTech</a> has 3 times the number of customers. That leaves <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applix.html" title="Applix">Applix</a>, which sold office productivity software starting in the 1980s to a wide market, and so has a rich history (one admittedly not well documented in its article, which really should be stubbed).

<li>Thanks for all the clarifications, but I am still trying to understand what the "notability" threshold is here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> points out, quite correctly, that <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_Solutions_6efe.html" title="Hyperion Solutions">Hyperion Solutions</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> are publicly traded, while <a href="../../../q/l/i/QlikTech_e303.html" title="QlikTech">QlikTech</a>, like <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimensional_Insight_0bfd.html" title="Dimensional Insight">Dimensional Insight</a>, is not. However, says John Broughton, QlikTech has 3 times the number of customers as Dimensional Insight. Ha-ha! Now I am finally beginning to understand. We are down to the number of customers. In other words, Dimensional Insight will be notable when it has 3 times the number of customers. Is that what you are telling me, John Broughton? I am sorry, but this all sounds like ad-hoc argumentation, i.e. the criteria keep changing as it seems convenient from moment to moment. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 21:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><s>What is the basis for saying he's an employee? I looked at his user page, user talk page, and edit summaries to postings about this company, and couldn't find anything that said that. He says, above, <i>I happen to know this company well and use its products daily</i>, which I took to mean that he was a customer, but if he in fact is an employee then <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> applies.

<li><s>I heard this from a friend who was telling me about an employee of Dimensional Insight who had recently posted an article about the company and was defending it against deletion - without mentioning that he's an employee. My friend doesn't actually work there, but he knows someone who does. So, technically my statement is hearsay, but I have no reason to disbelieve it. Really, the article now looks just as good as those of other similar companies, but I thought that Pasquale's association with the company should be known. <a href="../../../d/y/f/User%7EDyfrgi_6693.html" title="User:Dyfrgi">Dyfrgi</a> 05:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s>This debate has clearly stirred a great deal of feeling, which I suppose is understandable. I don't deny that editors have worked very hard to create this article and I can see how they may feel that their efforts are unappreciated. Let me assure you on my own behalf this is not the case. The purpose of an AfD discussion, IMO, is to bring to the attention of other users articles which, in their current form, do not match the Wikipedia notability criteria, articles which require a little bit more information or sourcing in order to make sure that they come up to scratch. Once this has been done (and efforts have certainly been made as regards to this article, although as has been pointed out I am not an expert in this field and cannot say whether it will be enough) there is no reason why the article may not remain on Wikipedia--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 16:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<p><a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegalese_b253.html" title="User:Legalese">Legalese</a> 15:52, 28 November 2006 (UTC) The Analysis of Legal Provisions is based on the judgment dated dated 15th of September, 2000, filed under Section 18 of the Rajasthan High Court Ordinance, 1949, passed by the learned Single Judge in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 2684/2000, HIGH COURT OF RAJASTHAN, Appellants: State of Rajasthan and Ors. v. Respondent: Vijay Shanti Educational Trust</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegalese_b253.html" title="User:Legalese">Legalese</a> 15:40, 28 November 2006 (UTC) 1. <a href="http://www.countercurrents.org/hr-patil271106.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.countercurrents.org/hr-patil271106.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/hr-patil271106.htm</a>. Please see this link published in the "Counter Currents". This article deals with the two judgments and has comments by a member of the State Minorities Commission and an author of a few books on Jainism.</p>
<p>2. I am trying to scan my own copy of the Unreported Jugdment of Rajasthan High Court, on which my "analysis" is based, I'll upload it once it is done. Whichever chunk has been "pasted" has been duly referenced. A Supreme Court's judgment would have to be "quoted". Illustration's noted by the Supreme Court could not be "narrated" by me, but it is best to reproduce them verbatim.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegalese_b253.html" title="User:Legalese">Legalese</a> 15:34, 28 November 2006 (UTC) I am aghast. The claim that there could be a "blatant violation of copyright in this article" is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>I explain the constitution of the whole article as below. The article presently has four sub-headings.</p>
<pre>
   * 1 The Recent Legal Debate on Jainism
   * 2 THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
   * 3 Criticism of the Supreme Court's Decision in Bal Patil's Case
   * 4 Jainism and Other Religions: Illustrations noted by Supreme Court of India
</pre>
<p>I'll deal with each one in detail.</p>
<pre>
   * 1 The Recent Legal Debate on Jainism
</pre>
<p>This sub-heading covers the following: &gt;&gt;The Bal Patil Judgment It quotes from the Supreme Court's judgment. Quoting from a Supreme Court jugdment cannot be a violation of copyright.</p>
<p>The rest of the comments have been written by me. Check, by googling, if you can find any websites from which it has been claimed that</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;U.P. Basic Shiksha Parishad Judgment This para has been written by me. Check by googling if its been copied even a least bit.</p>
<pre>
   * 2 THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
</pre>
<p>The first para merely quotes the Article 25 of the Constitution of India in original. It is a provision of law, and there is no violation of any copyright in reproducing it.</p>
<p>The second para has been written by me. You can check, by googling it, if it appears anywhere else, it would have name "rishabh sancheti" or the link "legalese" [my wiki name].</p>
<pre>
   * 3 Criticism of the Supreme Court's Decision in Bal Patil's Case
</pre>
<p>This has been authored completely by me, with the help of certain legal provisions. Again, citing the legal provisions cannot entail any violation of a copyright. The veracity of such legal provisions may be checked at &lt;indiacode.nic.in&gt;, Government of India's official law database, by feeding the name of the Act.</p>
<p>The explanations appearing below each of the Acts have been authored by me. One can verify by googling.</p>
<pre>
   * 4 Jainism and Other Religions: Illustrations noted by Supreme Court of India
</pre>
<p>This fourth part may give an impression on a superficial reading that it is made up of several parts which might be claimed to have been copied. However, I submit with deference that such claim is baseless, and would prove to be so, if any one may be diligent enough to verify. Infact this part is a summary of the illustrations noted by the Supreme Court of India in the UP Shiksha Parishad Judgment, the original link of which has already been given. Click on the link, and it would open a page on the Judis Database of the Government of India, having this judgment. Do a simple CTRL+F to locate these paragraphs there.</p>
<p>As I'v stated above, there could be no copyright violation in quoting from a Court's judgment along with its proper reference. I have not claimed that I have authored this part, the heading itself clearly reads "Illustrations noted by Supreme Court of India". The para numbers in this part are the original para numbers of the Judgment, which has already been mentioned in the beginning of this part.</p>
<p>Now.........how is there any copyright violation?</p>

<p><a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegalese_b253.html" title="User:Legalese">Legalese</a> 20:14, 28 November 2006 (UTC)Thanks for your comments @ Isotope, harsh is good as long as it is on the content and not against the person, which thankfully is the case here. I am in appreciation of your approach. I understand that the section on Hindu Personal laws debate appears to be in conflict with the WP:OR policy. However, as I have mentioned above, it is based on a judgment of Rajasthan High Court, which unfortunately is not available on net. If required, and it seems it is pertinent now, I will try my best to give a para-wise reference so as to make it clear that this article is not wholly in defiance of WP:OR. <b>However, I do admit that a bit of it needs to be "cleaned up" by me, so that it strictly conforms to the aforesaid policy.</b> Regarding the other things you pointed out, yes, the debate is recent and if I may say, unfortunate. The debate has actually been generated as a result of a strife between some fundamentalists of either religions. The matter went to the Courts and has been resolved largely. Thus, it gains importance and I felt it important to bring it on wikipedia if any researcher is looking for a point to begin with on the debate. <b>Also, there are several other sources available on the internet which substantiate this article, however I admit that the fault lies on my part not to have referenced in detail.</b> I must also state at the same time that I am only a beginner and am yet to be too well versed with WIKI, I hope thus the formatting errors could be done away with by more experienced users, or else I'll need to put some extra hours on few weekends and understand the whole deal, to do it myself.</p>

<p>Link management is a legitimate subject for an article and the external link referencing a patented product relating to it has relevancy because it is a.) a recent patent, b.) indentified as a "new-invention" (rather than a refinement or enhancement of an existing invention) by the patent office and c.) the only patent so far issued in this entire field. There is also pertinent non-commercial, on-topic information in this article, which is far more than you can say about the tens of thousands of pure puffery articles that overflow Wikipedia like visitors in a Roach Motel.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squeezebox_network_music_player.html" title="Squeezebox network music player">Squeezebox network music player</a> for a typical example -- a complete article filled with links pimping a multi-hundred-dollar music player, complete with additions hyping each new product release in the line.</p>

<p><s>*<b>Keep.</b></s> It is a legitimate topic and notable and, most importantly, a launching pad for discussion of an important web subject. The fact that it has only one external link today and that is to a company which happens to hold the only patent in the field, does not mean that it can't have 20 external links to both commercial and non-commercial information providers on this subject tomorrow.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ekb606 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ekb606_6fb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ekb606">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Well, there ought to be an article on the subject, although this one ain't it. There was a similar article (same name? can't recall) on the subject deleted some months ago. As I understand it, link management comes down to, or at any rate includes, this basic concept: If your web site is xyz.com, and a person <i>types</i> xyz.com/products in his browsers url bar, he should get to your products page. Not to a 404 or a directory listing. I guess there's more to it than that, I dunno. But whatever it is, this article doesn't make clear. And yeah there's a spam link too. But its am actual, if obscure, concept. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:56, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I absolutely agree that WP has too many arbitrary lists with little or no sourcing which don't add to the project in anyway. However, the above list is actually well cited with informative notes. As to the choice of $100 million, I really don't see what the big deal is. It's the lowest 9-digit number which seems as good a place as any to start. Furthermore, the relatively few (compared to the total number of pro athletes) individuals who make the list give it a certain notability. I would actually like to see the list expanded to account for foreign athletes who have <i>adjusted</i> contract values of $100mil or more. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertbcole_d850.html" title="User talk:Robertbcole">→</a><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robertbcole_0dd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robertbcole">←</a> 18:35, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Rename and rework</b> I think the best way to handle this would be to change it to a chronological list of the richest contracts (Timeline of the richest sports contracts maybe?). This would make the list more encyclopedic, less arbitrary and would pass the "100 year test". I'd even support breaking it up by sport, with separate lists for soccer, football, baseball, hockey and basketball. A timeline would work well, because key events (such as lockouts/strikes, the imposition of salary caps and the advent of free agency could also be noted to illustrate their effects on salaries. Also, a timeline format would be condusive to showing benchmarks like league minimum salaries, average salaries and per capita income. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 22:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b><s>Weak Keep</s></b> Claims to be the most popular website of its type (and, contrary to nom, sources that claim). This is a claim of noteworthiness. Leaving aside the nature of Alexa rankings, the question then becomes whether its type of website is sufficiently noteworthy. I know nothing about "furry art," so I can't really say -- but given the young age of this article (less than a week old), I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. A few Internet searches (I know, I know...) seem to suggest that the website might be sufficiently notable, so I will consider the article a valid stub for now. Would reconsider if article is not at minimum sourced and preferably expanded within the next couple of weeks. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 07:28, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking as an expert in the field, I can confirm that the site is currently the most popular site for art in the furry fandom. The site will pass 300,000 submissions today, and has a daily input of around 1100 submissions. It has been reliably up for a significant period of time (finally), and has an Alexa ranking of ~23,000 over a three month period. It has <a href="http://www.furaffinityforums.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.furaffinityforums.net/" rel="nofollow">separate forums</a> (not notable, but active). The <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Fur_Affinity" class="extiw" title="wikifur:Fur_Affinity">WikiFur article on Fur Affinity</a> has a few further claims.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, you may feel that it is not an appropriate topic for an article, as there is really not that much that can be said about it that can be sourced with anything that resembles reliability. The closest we really have to an analysis apart from WikiFur would be stuff like <a href="http://www.nothingkat.com/confession/furaffinity.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nothingkat.com/confession/furaffinity.htm" rel="nofollow">this blog rant</a>, and it is already outdated, not covering the recent "pedo cub art" debate (don't ask, don't tell, <i>don't</i> pursue). It is notable within the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a>, and <b>should</b> definitely remain as an external link there.

<dd>If that's the case, then it's probably not a notable site. Encyclopedias are generally derived from knowledge that is available to a reasonably large number of people. If a reasonably knowledgeable person familiar with the area could not research and write an article about a given topic, then generally speaking it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia.

<dd>I did not say that it required the founder to contribute significantly, just anyone who visits the site often enough to figure out the community (therefore making them a <i>de facto</i> member, even if they don't have an account). One cannot write an article about a club without being even an initiate - or, one could, but the article would simply be a stub and remain a stub for its tenure on Wikipedia&#160;; non-members, after all, are the only ones who can contribute, according to "popular opinion". I hope you see the problem with that interpretation of notability?</dd>

And therefore, I cede this debate&#160;; <b>delete</b> this article. <b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlast_san_3820.html" title="User:Blast san"><font color="#DE0000">Bl</font></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlast_san_c2cb.html" title="User talk:Blast san"><font color="#FCD116">a</font></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlast_san_3820.html" title="User:Blast san"><font color="#DE0000">st</font></a></b> <small>12.03.06 1741 (UTC -5)</small> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/18px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a>

<dd>Let me make it clear that I don't think that deleting this article is necessarily the optimal solution, but it <i>is</i> in line with Wikipedia current policies and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WikiFur_343c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WikiFur">previous</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Yerf_e44c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Yerf">deletions</a>. The site has not had media coverage, or much coverage at all outside of private blogs and journals (I <i>did</i> ask the founder and he said there had been a couple of inquiries which he had declined). There is therefore little that can be considered "proven" about it - and Wikipedia prefers to rely on reliable sources. As the site gets older and more popular, it may be that this situation will change. At that point, I suspect an article will be seen as more acceptable. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 03:49, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Shall we create articles on all four hundred 2005 recipients? Or the few thousand spanning the past couple of years? Phrases like "regarded as a significant expert in his area by independent sources" are rather weaselly, even if they do come from some guideline page. I have nothing against the guy, but as far as I can tell there are significant numbers of CS people as distinguished or more distinguished than him. Practically any academic who works and teaches at a research university will garner a big list of rewards (the people I work for certainly do, but I wouldn't consider them notable enough to have pages here). -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-11-29T05:16Z</code>

<li>Basic requirements for being an IEEE Computer Society speaker: 1. Membership (several thousand people), 2. record of public speaking at conferences and technical meetings (several hundred people), 3. Published papers and books (hundreds of people), 4. Nominated by someone... I don't see this as a great criterion for encyclopedic notability...</li>
<li>I couldn't find much information on the Sigma Xi award, but considering that society comprises a membership of about 62k persons, I suspect the aforementioned award is a research grant in the same vein as the NSF CAREER award. I have to ask again, did you do your homework on this? Do you really think reception of research grants is valid criteria by which to gauge the notability of an academic? Or did you just go to Dr. Bader's website, look at his research awards, and assume these constituted notability? -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-11-29T05:29Z</code></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable academic career with impressive awards and a distinguished publication record.Sigma Xi is a scientific honorary society that is not that open to everyone (Hey, I didn't get in!). He is an Associate Prof, but his committee work and research program would be notable enough for an article if he were a full Prof. Anyway, he is tenured pretty quickly. The argument about having to create thousands of articles does not impress. We do npot have to create any of the articles if we don't want to. If someone else wants to, we can see if those individuals also have 75 pubs and the other credentials, then vote on their noms. Out of 1.5 million articles, most of them crufty stubs about bus stops, video game characters, porn actresses or garage bands, a few about academic researchers do not bother me a bit. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:45, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"there are a significant number of CS people as notable..." Yes, there probably are, and they all should be in.

<li><b>Patient Keep</b> - The article was just created a few days ago. If there is indeed a pilot episode, then it certainly deserves an entry (since all other FG episodes have articles).

<li><b>Delete</b> Wasn't the pilot <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Has_a_Shadow_faf8.html" title="Death Has a Shadow">Death Has a Shadow</a>? If so, it already has a page.

<li><b>Comment</b> That is partly true. <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Has_a_Shadow_faf8.html" title="Death Has a Shadow">Death Has a Shadow</a> was based on the pilot that the article is reffering to. You can look up the pilot on Google and watch it for yourself. Coming to think of it I am not really sure if I would call a 15 minute episode a pilot. They expanded it into the first episode. Still, I think it deserves some attention. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 21:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It was unaired but included on one of the DVDs extra features. It was for the most part the same jokes included in the first episode <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Has_a_Shadow_faf8.html" title="Death Has a Shadow">Death Has a Shadow</a> which currently has a section noting the subtle differences between the two versions. I dont believe we need a new article for it as it was such a similiar episode with few writing changes, and only a slightly different animation style <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrande13_3d48.html" title="User:Grande13">Grande13</a> 02:54, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

How about we just redirect to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Has_a_Shadow_faf8.html" title="Death Has a Shadow">Death Has a Shadow</a> considering that the article already has a full section on the differences between the unaired material and the first episode? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 06:59, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> OK, what exactly is going on here? My name is Brian Smith, and I am the manager of The Sleepers, not the imposter that keeps editing and saying he is in the band. I represent the band, and we did not authorize this page, although we would like to keep it as is. The information on the page is what is on the band's webpage, so it is official info. I guess I'm confused as to how this happened and why it happened. The Sleepers had a small page on Wikipedia as of a few weeks ago that didn't cause any problems, and all of a sudden the page changed and was flagged to be deleted. Please feel free to contact me at dpgs303@aol.com. Again, we have not authorized this other person to speak on behalf of the band.</li>

Non-notable band. The article is horribly written and probably violates <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> all across the board. It was previously <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Sleepers_%28band%29_9bcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Sleepers (band)">AfDed</a> in Jan 2005, but the AfD was never closed. Recently, someone prod'ded the article, but it was removed by an anonymous user who claims to be Tony Manno from the band. By the way, most of the article's edits come from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anthonymanno1_4af7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anthonymanno1">User:Anthonymanno1</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 20:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge?</b> I am the real Tony Manno of The Sleepers, and I was just informed of this page and the nominations for deletion. My apologies for whomever decided to put up our profile on the page. We are a legitimate band (I happen to think we're a notable one at that!), but apparently someone else believed we should have our own page. That I appreciate, but I apologize for the page creation not going through the proper channels. If someone would like to inform me, though, how I could get a legitimate page up for my band, that would be great. We have international press, a label, we tour, etc. etc. Also, anyone that knows me would know that I don't use "Anthony" as my first name. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Anthonymanno1 (<a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAnthonymanno1_4255.html" title="User talk:Anthonymanno1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anthonymanno1_4af7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anthonymanno1">contribs</a>).</small>

Someone got killed in a skiing accident? Supernatural! <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 13:36, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You don't find this even slightly weird? I'm reserving judgement at this time (both on the existence of curses and on this article), but these events are certainly out of the ordinary. After the tenth member of my family was assassinated/mauled by wild giraffes/abducted by aliens/molested by the Queen of France, I too might start to wonder, "You know, maybe there's something to this..."</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, debate on whether a curse actually exists cannot possibly be carried out; such a question is far beyond our ability to answer. Debate on whether or not to keep this decidedly interesting article must, of course, proceed.</p>
<p>The number of murders, in particular, strikes me as very odd. It appears, however, that this family had money, and could it not be argued that through their financial dealings they were inevitably to come into contact with those who would wish to harm them? In addition, does that make these murders "assassinations," as the author has said, or something less? Can a four-year-old truly be "assassinated"?</p>
<p>As for the other stuff...I mean, you have to admit that it's a bit creepy. Let me put it to you this way: if it were my Aunt Betsy, I'd be looking behind my back everywhere I went. I mean, the Kennedys (not really known for the tranquility of their lives) have got nothing on these people. I feel bad for them.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I find this whole thing to be highly improbable. It would be virtually impossible for all of these events to happen within one family, and, being as I am a skeptic of supernatural phenomena, I just don't buy it. How could one group of people attract this much misfortune? It's just not feasible.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is quite profound in places but ultimately reaches the familiar conclusion that Eastern societies are less individualistic than Western societies. I'm not sure how useful the primary/secondary society dichotomy is given that human instinct and genetic predisposition presumably form the basis for secondary society just as they form the basis of primary society. Regardless, there is no indication that the book on which it is based warrants the extensive analysis given in the article.

<li><b>Response</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If you look at <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_genius.html" title="Evil genius">Evil genius</a> you will notice that the page is in the process of revision right now. If support cannot be provided for definition and clarification outside of Original Research, I will be nominating it for deletion as well.

That ADOM, Angband and Nethack are generally considered roguelikes shouldn't be too hard to verify.

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, all or most of the sources can be found at www.mlgpro.com. Second of all, yes, we need to stick to MLG's history more, that is a big problem that needs to be fixed. So, in order to fix this problem, we need to make SUBPAGES that thoroughly explain the most successful and popular pros and teams over the course of MLG's history. I have started some of that to minimize some of the irrelevance. Check out the Star Wars wikipage and tell me how long the article would be if they included all the subpages' within subpages' within subpages' articles in the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Arrashju (<a href="../../../a/r/r/User_talk%7EArrashju_fa03.html" title="User talk:Arrashju">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arrashju_0d00.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arrashju">contribs</a>).</small> (article author)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> I strongly disagree that there should be subpages for the individual gamers who play MLG. None of them meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. User:Arrashju has created numerous articles on gamers, all of which have been speedily deleted (except for the 8 year old who was on 60 Minutes). Further, this user's only contributions have been articles about MLG and edits to other articles (such as <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">Sport</a>) promoting MLG. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 12:41, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Don't assume every article is not going to be like the one I made on LiL Poison. When I add MLG to the sports section I am stating the facts. I am not trying to promote MLG, I am just trying to have a place to show ignorant folks what MLG is about. Also, every last one of the links I made to certain players meet more than one specific of this requirement: This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries2.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - this is an irrelevant reference - there are plenty of references that are based on a belief in the existence of this angel; the question is whether Wikipedia is the right forum to judge whether these exist (and as I say below I am not qualified to decide but am willing to bow to the views of editors who are qualified to pronounce on the existence of specific angels). <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 22:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - whether angels are 'made up' is a concept that I am not qualified to comment on, not having ever met one. However, unless <a href="../../../a/n/g/Category%7EAngels_9f83.html" title="Category:Angels">Category:Angels</a> is to be deleted this one is perfectly verifiable, see Google hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Ambriel+angel&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=lr%3Dhere" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Ambriel+angel&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=lr%3Dhere" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. Ambriel has plenty of references. If we are to eliminate anything not provable. e.g. <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> etc that's fine but if not then this one has 'multiple non-trivial mentions'.

<li><b>Comment</b> You have given more information than this stub (or that I teased out of google). Helpful.

<li>Sorry, you're wildly mis-interpreting what these policies mean... the policy on verification says quite clearly <i>"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth."</i> What we're looking for is a reliable source that says "Here is the main view of what this thing is." That's the "undue weight" part of the bias guideline (a.k.a neutral point of view.) If there are not substantial, serious, independant sources for this we can't be sure that we're not giving too much credibility to what one fringe source says. The fortune city version is just something someone whacked on the internet, it doesn't have any provenance. - 152.91.9.144 01:24, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>A sorry mess of an article that has no sources, is mostly original research (including several anime characters placed there simply because they have white hair), and contradicts itself at several points.

<dd><b>Comment</b> My apologies. Vanity is perjoritive now? That's just silly. L0b0t 23:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The main problem is it's often misleading. Often articles are created by a friend, family member, associate or employee, not the subject themselves. "Conflict of interest" is a more generic term that applies anytime the article is created by someone with a personal interest. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:23, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, <i>vanity</i> implies something about the value of the article itself, whereas <i>conflict of interest</i> merely strongly disapproves of certain user behaviors. A COI article may be rehabbed with NPOV, but a vanity article is usually unsalvageable because of notability failures.

<p>This one needs confirmation, but according to comments I've received from someone who says she lives there, "The Village of West Lea" is in fact the <i>Westlea housing estate</i> in Seaham. If this is confirmed, it falls below the notability level for an article. Google isn't being very helpful, using both spellings interchangeably and giving no definite indication of whether it's an estate or a village. It's possible, of course, thatthere are two separate places, but unless an actual village can be confirmed, this should go. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Conditional (weak) Keep</b> if properly sourced. Article's depth is fairly impressive, though it's in need of some cleanup. California Distinguished School and performing at Disneyland aren't terribly noteworthy per Kicking222, but being ranked first in the state for three years running is an indication of at least regional noteworthiness, provided that multiple independent reliable sources can be found to back that.

<li><b>Comment</b> Don't you mean "major reduction" instead of "some cleanup"? I agree that the article is very detailed, but 90% of those details are either unverifiable or non-notable (i.e. they're likely published nowhere or only on the school's website). The major exception is the blurb on Ardis Egan, which if properly sourced should be in an article on the man perhaps but not the school. Take out all the stuff that doesn't belong, and we'd be left with a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">directory</a> entry. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:11, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, yes. But I usually find "cleanup" or "some cleanup" adequately covers those concerns for AfD purposes.

<li><b>Same comment</b> as to Shimeru above: Yes the article is thorough -- no, make that <i>very</i> thorough -- but 90% is either <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> or <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">non-notable</a> (i.e. the facts presented are likely published nowhere or only on the school's website). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Shimeru and Alan. Also note that the school website has a lot of high quality pictures, so if someone has time they may want to find out if any of them can released under the GFDL which would suit the article nicely.
