<li><b>Response</b> to deletion request. Maze Clays is a new shotgun discipline that was just recently launched. It is a <b>unique and newsworthy</b> topic, from the fact that it already has a following in the shooting ranges that it was introduced. We have had TV coverage that is about to air in the following weeks. The article is not an ad or vanity, it plainly states the creators of the discipline and the main characteristics. It does not go into the benefits of this game over the other existing shotgun sports. This topic is verifiable by visiting the official website.</li>
<li><b>Not a promotion</b> - it simply states the components and rules of the game. Please explain what you mean your accusations in greater detail so that I may respond.
<ul>
<li>God forbid, no accusations. I have nothing against you, and your shouldn't try to convince me, rather everybody here. The problem with your page is that I believe it violate <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and is an ad. <font color="blue"><strong><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">the.crazy.russian</a> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">(T)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">(C)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">(E)</a></strong></font> 01:59, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Details** I understand that this is a debate. I would like to know specifically, what is it that you see in this article that would classify it as an ad? Second, I have explained the fact that it is notable, because it is unique, something new a novelty, which already has a following among the hundreds of shooters who have tried it out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Basically, there are two points. (1) it looks like an ad for the website that licenses the game and sells the equipment. (2) It appears non-notable as, basically, it looks like practically nobody is doing this. The lack of Google hits makes this look like a start-up attempting to get some exposure. You claim there's a following, yet nobody seems to be talking about it.

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>First of all the article does not talk about licensing or selling the equipment. It describe the Maze Clays discipline. The link to the website is put there for verifiability purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, just because you can't find hits on Google doesn't mean that it does not have a following. What corellation exists between shotgun shooters and computer users. What basis do you have to tell me that shotgun shooters automatically are big fans of computers? The purpose of the article is to inform shooters about the existance of a new shotgun sport. What is wrong with that. The article does not mention a sales pitch which you claim that it is. Cautaro</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Notability is a guideline, not a grounds for deletion. Whether this is an ad or not is debatable (although the TM everywhere doesn't help matters). But pending some kind of third party <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verification</a> this article should be deleted. Note also that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not for self-promotion</a> - the creators of such a sport should not be the ones writing an article about that sport. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 02:38, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The author wrote the following on my page page:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
This is a quote from the notable page: "The word notable is often used as a synonym of "unique" or "newsworthy." 
</pre>
<pre>
To explain, Maze Clays is unique because it uses a new system of operating the shotgun sport. Besides that it has a new classification and no registered targets are are necessary, two new, unique things which don't currently exist. 
</pre>
<pre>
Second, it is newsworthy. We have been filmed by the Comcast channnel CSS and will be airing in the following weeks. We are in talks with other media sources who are interested to feature Maze Clays.
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that you are the producer of this product means that the article may also violate <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>. Also, Maze Clays has not yet been aired on any major media sources; whether it will be in the future is irrelavent. Finally, the article does not assert the notability of its topic and we thus have no idea how many users the product has and if that number is significant. Perhaps later it would be a good article, but not now. <b><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">Wh</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#0AB20D">e</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">re</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhere_05e5.html" title="User talk:Where"><font color="#0099FF">(talk)</font></a> <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#T1_clarification_proposal" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)"><font color="red">Clarify T1-reduce wikiStrife</font></a></sup></b> 03:00, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First of all the article describes a shotgun discipline, which by definition cannot be sold. The equipment is described to provide a better understanding of the game. Second, what is wrong with having the information come directly from the authors of the creation. In this day in age, where the internet allows creators and users to come together, why would Wikipedia be a barrier to this type of communication?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inclusion criteria: What would the article need in order to be included? User:Cautaro</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>First of all, the article insists on using the TM symbol every time the discipline is mentioned. In other words, no one can run these games without paying royalties to the owners of the trademark. Don't be disingenuous. By definition, that is selling. In addition, it seems there's specialized equipment for this sport that's also being sold. Second of all, You are under a delusion that appears to be quite common, you believe Wikipedia exists to help promote and publicize new things. It does not. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:21, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per nom.

Maybe Maze Clays will become the ne plus ultra of skeet/trap shooting in the ensuing years and it might qualify for a huge article in an encyclopedia (written by an unrelated 3rd party...) But today it simply another corporate promo item, and has yet to establish its notability. Wikipedia can't have an article on every new game/product/idea that's out there. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 17:13, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Notable</b> - I have stated earlier that according to Wikipedia in order for a site to be notable, it has to be unique or newsworthy. I believe that Maze Clays is both, and that is the reason for which I don't see the basis for not notable claim. Maze Clays is unique, because is different from all the existing shotgun sports and it is newsworthy because it has solid fundamentals that will change the shotgun shooting industry.

<dd>If it is newsworthy, the the news has covered it. Point out solid newspaper or magazine references for this subject, and it'll be considered notable. If they are 'soon to be', then the article will be deleted, without prejudice, and you can recreate it once a newspaper prints something on the subject. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 02:22, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict) You <i>believing</i> that this is unique and newsworthy is not enough.

<p><b>Comment</b> The losttargets.com site is listed as a partner of mazeclays. Should be looked at with a grain of sand. Also, the memberlist on the forums on mazeclays.com include two entries, one of which was automaticaly created by the BBS program. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 18:03, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Response</b> The LostTarget.com site is news site for shotgun enthusiasts. The fact that it appears under the Partners page is just a gesture of appreciation for their support. Second, the forum at mazeclays.com is a new addition and the list of users does not reflect the number of members. The number of users is just how many people registered to use the forums without correlation to members. Cautaro 13:13, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
