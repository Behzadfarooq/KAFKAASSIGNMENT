The page was apparently created in an attempt to see how far a bad joke could be taken (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banana_in_my_ear&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banana_in_my_ear&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBanana_in_my_ear_7902.html" title="Talk:Banana in my ear">Talk:Banana in my ear</a> which relates to an even more ridiculous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banana_in_my_ear&amp;oldid=6223351" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banana_in_my_ear&amp;oldid=6223351" rel="nofollow">older version</a>). Whatever the reason for its creation, I don't think it belongs here. As a joke, it's probably not notable enough. As an article, it can probably never be more than a stub (but see early attempts to expand the article with ridiculous made up bullshit). As a genre of humor, I am doubtful. Note that no articles link it other than <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert.html" title="Bert">Bert</a>. Maybe a sample of Bert and Ernie humor belongs in their own article, or maybe this could be moved to BJAODN, or maybe it just needs to go away. <b>delete</b> is my opinion. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" title="User talk:Lethe">Talk</a> 01:14, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for the confirmation. By the way, what do you suppose <i>verstohlen</i> would mean? From what I understand of German, the prefix <i>ver-</i> always means something nasty. For example <i>raten</i>: advice, <i>verraten</i>: deceive, <i>sagen</i>: say, <i>versagen</i>: fail, <i>bieten</i>: offer, <i>verbieten</i>: forbid.

<li><b>Keep</b> Did something change about schools? They're being nominated at a horrific rate. Usually a little effort goes into improving an article before listing on AfD. I see nothing on the talk page for this school which indicates its anything but a stub.

<li>Proposal: I suggest we keep the article, but rename it <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Providence_School_District_dad9.html" title="New Providence School District">New Providence School District</a>. Keep the category, and categories for middle and elementary, thus treating this as a proper school article. Two paras for the high school, 1 for each of of other 3 schools, and one for the board, gives 6 paras, fairly easily. That's a full separate article. Promptly create-the required re-directs before somebody makes more stubs. Anybody searching for one of the schools, will find a school article, about that school. Merging with a borough would mess up categories by merging overly distinct things. Categories are a fundamental navigation tool in wikipedia, and must be meaningfull, but flexible. I see this as a pretty fair middle ground, in between 4/5 stubs and no article fit to be in a school category. Note: my vote stays the same, since my idea does not require an AFD, and with 20/20 hindsight, is how this should have been done instead of an AFD. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 15:13, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, the author has been writing article that do belong. This is one special article the author is writing to benefit the community at large and humanity.

<li>Wikipedia isn't infinite, either. Remember, this is one attack among hundreds, and this article does not and never will give any information that isn't immediately clear from context (it's a fire attack, it involves blowing embers, fire PokÃ©mon use it). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 09:40, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>None of this is clear from the context: "In the PokÃ©mon videogames, Ember is the standard fire-type attack, and it is learnt by many PokÃ©mon at relatively low levels. When the level depends on the version of PokÃ©mon used, the level for the edition of the PokÃ©mon's first appearance is used.</li>
<li>...While Ember tends to be useful during the first stages of the game (especially for rookie trainers), later it becomes weak in comparison to stronger attacks such as Fire Spin or Flamethrower. It was one of the attacks which already appeared in the first versions of the game, PokÃ©mon Blue and PokÃ©mon Red." <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 09:43, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be clear in any context in which someone would encounter the term, either in the PokÃ©mon anÃ­me or games. As for its context on Wikipedia, this is an orphan I found when sifting through Whatlinkshere for <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="PokÃ©mon">PokÃ©mon</a>. This article is left over from an abortive attempt to document every single tiny aspect of Pokemon on Wikipedia, and most of the other articles (save the species and characters and places, which aren't minutia) have been deleted or merged.</li>
<li>And I wish I had paid more attention when I AFD'ed it.

<li><a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> is wrong. Being a managing director does <i>not</i> make a person notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it should be renamed List of famous vegetarians, or List of notable vegetarians, but it seems reasonable enough to me. It can never be completed, but that's true of many Wikipedia lists. It's unlikely that many names will end up on the list unless that person's vegetarianism is a matter of record.... what would be the point in making false claims? The section about Hitler (which I found quite interesting) shows how to deal with people who are erroneously claimed to be / have been "vegetarian". There may be disputes, of course, but that's equally true of any other article.... if that's a reason for deletion, we may as well just delete Wikipedia in its entirety. I fail to see how a simple list can be made to serve a moral agenda, but any attempt to subvert the article to this purpose should be removed, of course. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 12:29, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>3) Unmaintainable, as a massive number of notable people are vegetarian, and many people become veggie (or stop being veggie) all the time.</li>
<li>4) Difficult to research, as it is not always easy to find a verifiable source confirming a person is (or is not) a vegetarian. Potential for original research abuse. And thet {{unreferenced}} tag is ass. If an article cannot be referenced, it shouldn't exist.</li>

<dd>No, it means an encyclopedia can't successfully describe a docking list of people as vegetarian out of context and by the bye lots of these WP labels, IMHO, are unhelpful to understanding. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 12:07, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For anyone who's listed as vegetarian I presume that the link to their main article will elaborate or provide context. But in order to know who was a vegetarian in particular fields or areas of society, only a list will do. And I don't think it's "unhelpful" to describe, say, <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Hatch_751f.html" title="Orrin Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> as a Mormon, <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Gibson_be06.html" title="Kirk Gibson">Kirk Gibson</a> as an American, or <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Singer_cbda.html" title="Peter Singer">Peter Singer</a> as a vegetarian. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 12:35, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Would you change to <i>Keep</i> if the title was <i>List of <b>notable</b> vegetarians</i>?

<ul>
<li>No, I'm afraid I wouldn't, for two reasons: I don't like the concept of "notability" because I don't see why a truly broad encyclopaedia wouldn't consider anything and anybody verifiable "notable" -- I simply haven't ever seen a good reason for making Wikipedia restrictive in that way; and I have a general principle that I oppose lists that cannot be sourced on the basis that they represent original research and should not be built. It's not a strongly held principle, so I don't go around trying to get lists deleted, and I rarely even bother to vote against them, so had it been "List of notable vegetarians", I probably wouldn't have bothered, although I might have urged that it only carry the names of people who have publicly stated that they are vegetarian, with each claim sourced in footnotes. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 00:26, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, References and a title-change are needed, but lists like this are one of the best things about wikipedia... I don't think there's a better place from which to jumpstart into a real topic of study...say, if I want to do a report on vegetarians, anarchists, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Irish_Politicians_2614.html" title="List of Irish Politicians">Irish politicians</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_former_Nazis_influential_after_1945_5289.html" title="List of former Nazis influential after 1945">Nazis</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_golfers.html" title="List of golfers">golfers</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_directors.html" title="List of directors">directors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_scientists.html" title="List of scientists">scientists</a>, or pretty much anything else. It's a great resource, we just need to start citing. Hell, people are citing in the talk pages, they just need to start doing it on the main page.</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, harmless and interesting. I would have voted for a plain keep but for the presence of the category.

Define what makes Wikipedia a directory and what makes it an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> per the usual reasons. Constant nominations for school articles discourages any serious work at improving articles, since nobody wants to invest serious time, knowing it will probably be wasted. This article has *not* been made instead of another more worthy article. It has been made in *addition* to other articles. This AFD nomination has been *instead* of making more worthwhile productive contributions to wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 04:15, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

Take a look at who created that article, and you'll see it's not the "blanket keepers" who create unverified school articles. Now, for this school, I see different mentions of it in different places like <a href="http://www.maderaonline.com/news/news-6a.html" class="external text" title="http://www.maderaonline.com/news/news-6a.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, which mentions a former principal, who died in a car accident.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like all those that vote keep on schools so they can get expanded to take a break from creating stubs and actually do some expansion of the schools that survived AFD. I would also like to see less of an US bias. Voting keep and expand and subsequently leave it lying around doesn't improve my trust that someone will ever expand them past stub level. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:45, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I probably should take the phrase, "those that vote keep on schools" to be a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. Why make the assumption that it is "those that vote keep on schools" who are responsible for stub creation? Lately, "those who vote delete on schools" have been creating stub articles, including hoax schools to try to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. As to an article "lying" [sic] around - give articles some time to grow, just because I believe a school article should be kept for later expansion, doesn't mean I have time to edit and change it right now.

<p>The result of the debate was Delete. I spent a fair amount of time looking this over, the raw numbers are 19 delete votes to 4 keeps, so starting at that level there seems to be a pretty good delete consensus. <a href="../../../g/4/d/User%7EG4DGET_f4cd.html" title="User:G4DGET">G4DGET</a> put together a very detailed case for keeping the article which from the looks of it generated a lot of discussion.

In this case most of the votes cast after the case was made were delete votes.

<p>The Requirements Sin Star, Mind Pollution, and Davien Crow meet are listed in the following sections. I have highlighted the guidelines Wikipedia has set and my argument as to why all 3 articles should be kept. If anything as i've said perhaps Mind Pollution should be deleted or be merged under Sin Star and Davien Crow should be kept because of his accomplishments seperate to the band. This is as I said in relevance to Sin Star, Mind Pollution, and Davien Crow articles and their redirects.</p>

<li><b>Having 2 Albums (does not specify full length or ep) released on a record label.</b> They have been released on Mushroomcloud Records, Kid Atrium Music, Red Pill Music (self owned), and Independantly.

<p>I Think I have pointed out enough in fact. <b>FAIR IS FAIR, IT MEETS YOUR RULES &amp; GUIDELINES</b> and hopefully you will reconsider the biased delete nominations that have been made because of the voters never reviewing the information beyond what the person who first nominated said (which included false information I may add, perhaps to try to get it deleted faster) or only did so at a galance. If Anything you should leave Davien Crow and then Merge Mind Pollution under Sin Star since they are after all the same band. Another solution would be to merge all 3 and another would be to only keep Sin Star &amp; Davien Crow. Davien however has accomplishments outside of his band that are notable. <a href="../../../g/4/d/User%7EG4DGET_f4cd.html" title="User:G4DGET">G4DGET</a> 22:01, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> only for now: Halo guitars make custom guitars and push them. As for "endorsement", the Halo web site does not have a listing under <i>either</i> <u>Mind Pollution</u> <i>or</i> <u>Sin Star</u> <i>or</i> <u>Davien Crow</u> on their artists page. Lack of inclusion makes me doubt the claim that Mr. Crow is being endorsed or that Halo might be making a signature guitar unless it is just a custom order.

<li>A detailed argument deserves a detailed response. It seems that all but one of the points given don't establish notability. No one has noted a specific actual national tour they were on (their own tour, not a one or two-time guest). The music guidelines require release by a major label or major indie label, meaning one "with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable". Publishing on poetry.com also is not notable; the idea is that someone's own entire work, more than a small amount of poetry, is published. Having things on the web, whether personal or business sites, reviews, blogs, forum posts, etc. are not notable unless read by many tens of thousands of people. Anyone could join BMI, and lots of non-notable garage bands are listed on sites and forums on the same page as other names. So the notability question comes down to one point, his cult following: if it exists, Davien Crow and his band are notable. If there is a small or no cult following, they are not notable.</li>
<li>Upon examination, it seems that there is not a significant cult following. Davien Crow gets 0 mentions on a xanga search, and the same for "sin star"; one blog ring for sin star has only 4 members. Sin Star has 849 MySpace friends, compared to a random 18-year-old with 769. No actual cult following here. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/d/e/User%7EDDerby_76ea.html" title="User:DDerby">DDerby</a><a href="../../../d/d/e/User_talk%7EDDerby_b92b.html" title="User talk:DDerby"><small>(talk)</small></a> 06:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree with the assessment by <a href="../../../d/d/e/User%7EDDerby_76ea.html" title="User:DDerby">DDerby</a> that most of the facts given to establish notability aren't very relevant. To me it comes down to one thing: the band. If this guy is notable is any way, it's as a musician, right? As far as I've been able to see, certain things are lacking: There's no mention in allmusic. There's no indication of an actual national tour. There are no records on a major label or an important small label. Having rubbed elbows with more famous people doesn't automatically make one famous by extension. It's unfortunate that things got heated and that the band supporters took this Afd personally. Please understand, this is not a judgement that the subject of the article is bad or untalented. This is simply about whether this subject belongs in an <i>encyclopedia</i>. Many, many bands that are real, have played lived, and have made recordings have been deleted before. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:31, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not a memorial. Wikipedia has many articles on performers who are now deceased, but those articles are not deemed "memorials" to be deleted. A single line stating when how she died seems pretty fair and normal. Per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> <i>"has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in a large or medium-sized country"</i>. Now, I think the "spirit" of the guideline covers numerous performances in opera in multiple cities: <i>"Daniels appeared with a variety of opera companies in the United States including Houston, Washington DC, Dallas, San Diego, Cincinnati, and Portland. She also performed numerous oratorios as well as concert works with orchestras."</i> . Finally, 360 unique hits on her exact name is not bad. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 16:25, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Allmusic appears to know her name, but has no info. <s><b>Delete</b> unless shown to meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines.</s> Someone who has lived in several cities and performed in each one, for example, is not the equivalent of having gone on a "national tour". I could be convinced otherwise with more info, but to me current article content does not suggest that she meets the music guidelines. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:56, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines are decidely skewed towards popular music. I'm no authority on opera, but how many artists outside of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Three_Tenors_0902.html" title="The Three Tenors">The Three Tenors</a> actually could meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> if you discount longer term stints they may do with a local opera company? It always seemed to me that most opera performers are like orchestral conductors: they work in a particular city for a while before moving on and taking an engagement elsewhere. Maybe I'm wrong about this... like I said I'm no authority on opera... but it would seem that perhaps a slightly different set of criteria should apply to opera performers.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: You make a good point. I'd probably be willing to suggest a keep, even if she doesn't meet the guidelines, if she can be shown to be an important opera singer somehow. Just being "an" opera singer isn't enough for me, tho. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:56, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: She seems to meet point 2 of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as much as it could be applied to opera, consistently winning major roles with well-known companies, and her <i>Carmen</i> sounds like it approximated the opera equivalent of meeting point 6 for a local scene. If she'd had a full career I think notability would be clear by the end of it, so she gets the benefit of my doubt. Unlike sopranos and tenors, mezzos will rarely gain much fame outside of the opera world, so allmusic being quiet is unsurprising to me. The first viola of a major symphony is a notable violist, even though they're nowhere near as notable as those symphony's concertmasters; similarly, consistently getting lead mezzo roles makes an opera singer generally notable even if they're not as notable as the most notable opera singers are. â <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">â</a> 20:56, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> There are thousands of wrestlers working out of national guard armories. There is nothing notabale about this guy. 66.32.97.158 17:20, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. Not only was he an important part of ECW (an influential promotion), he has owned and booked his own promotion for the better part of 9 years. His accomplishments go well beyond being simply a wrestler working in armories. Yes, he is a bit of a controversial character, and not entirely popular in his chosen profession, but wikipedia is not about making value judgements, but in capturing influential and notable information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Controversy has nothing to do with it. Nothing you have listed is notable at all. There are hundreds of promoters who have ran shows for 10+ years. Also, you saw that he was an important part of ECW, yet nothing about ECW is mentioned. Shall we have an article for every independent wrestler in the United States? 66.32.97.158 17:25, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>- I doubt there are "hundreds" of promoters that have run for over a decade, but this discussion is not about other people, but rather if Ian Rotten (John Williams) is notable enough to merit an entry. While there are a myriad of other promoters, a very small number regularly book well known and well respected talents including Sabu, Samoa Joe, AJ Styles, et al. Simply put, his promotion (despite its questionable business acumen) is known as putting on highly regarded events, including arguably the most respected annual independant tournament, the Ted Petty Invitational. Outside of his ECW tenure (most notable perhaps for the already mentioned "Taipei Death Match"), he is well known in the industry for participating in (and occasionally promoting) the subset "Death Match" style. To answer your final question, yes, perhaps in time we SHOULD have an article for every independent wrestler, in the name of completeness. In the near term, however, lets focus on the more well known ones. Certainly Williams/Rotten qualifies.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This should not be deleted. Rather it should be expanded. And he is notable enough to warrant an article.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. List is overly broad, and just a bad idea anyway because it lumps all sports and all broadcast media (radio and TV) together.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Maybe Gamaliel has missed all the current controversery (e.g. <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Tawnee_Stone" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">AN/I</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/w/Talk%7ETawnee_Stone_e3b8.html" title="Talk:Tawnee Stone">article's talk</a>) surrounding this article, and is not trying to prove a point, but google has 1.6 million hits on "Tawnee Stone" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tawnee+stone%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tawnee+stone%22" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> which is certainly notable enough for me.

<li>Actually that controversy is what brought the article to my attention. In my opinion this is not a way to avoid the controversy; the controversy is irrelevant since this article does not appear to be encyclopedic. I have read the previous vfd and wish to echo Quale's comment: "Google test is not persuasive for porn. Normal bio criterio would be more persuasive: accomplishments, awards, recognition outside the porn world". That's why I listed it again for vfd. The previous vfd contained many assertions of notability but no citations or proof. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 19:53, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>No, normal bio criteria should not be used because porn identities like this are not real people, they are roles in the same way <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a> or <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge_Dredd_b7a6.html" title="Judge Dredd">Judge Dredd</a> is a role. It's a work of fiction and the only verifiable information (and the only information belonging in the article, in my opinion) is that which the marketing/production studio provides. If you want to argue that this particular role is in some tangible way less significant than the bazillions of other minor fictional entities that worm their way into Wikipedia, then alright, that's your choice, but I don't agree. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 20:18, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This AfD should be scrubbed of personal information once it's completed. Wikipedia is not in the business of investigative journalism, or of "outing" people whose real identities aren't public. What if we made a mistake? The potential risks are too large for something that isn't in our mission anyway. There's no educational value in the personal details of porn actresses, since their personal details have nothing to do with their notability.</p>
<p>Also, has anyone at any point contacted this girl to tell her what happened? She might appreciate a "heads-up" that she's been outed here. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 07:01, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You must be mistaken.

<li><b>Delete</b> Web page appears to be created recently, and it had a total of 174 hits when I checked (including mine). That it may have been created by a politician does not make it notable. Groeck 23:33, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmm. This is a tough one. While you all make good points I'm inclined to think keep the article on the condition some things are cleaned up and revised. As far as not many hits on the discused webpage it is certainly gaining popularity since the site is already up to 508. I think the date discrepincy is a little curious but not unheard of. Often times someone doing research may copy a date wrong and than finding the error go back to change it. That doesn't really mean anything. Another thing that might have to be changed is some opinions in the article. Again though I think its alright aside from a few things here and there.|Sjop 00:06, 23 September 2005 (UTC)|</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. "<i>Slanderous</i>"?! Most of the people on the list would have gladly admitted to being a womanizer. The fact that you believe it is a bad thing doesn't make it POV.

<li>Although I do like the idea, if memory serves me right merge and delete (which this amounts to) is not a valid vote because the history is lost.

<li>Agreed, though your example is really a quote, not a proverb or saying. To bring this in context, the saying discussed here would be somewhat equivalent to the American <i>The only good indian is a dead indian</i>, only that it is much less known (with 1,400 Google hits vs. 11,400 for the American proverb). Is an article for the American proverb warranted&#160;? If so, it might be warranted to keep this one, and to create an entry for the saying about indians as well.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It may well be list of songs because most songs are about romance (unfortunatly). However, I appreciate the amount of work that went into categorizing this list which makes it much more informative than it would've been without sectioning. - 131.211.210.12 10:21, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with User:131.211.210.12 that is the categorization which makes this list useful. I've seen several romance songs lists, but not one who classified them by themes. That it would never be finished it doesn't means what already is here isn't useful. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndromeda_6fce.html" title="User:Andromeda">Andromeda</a> 10:48, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak delete</b>. The structure of the list is completely ad-hoc (and will stay like that forever), since the topics are often non-exclusive (e.g., "divorce" usually implies "separation"). Why is there "bitterness" but no "sadness" (where <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yesterday_%28song%29.html" title="Yesterday (song)">Yesterday</a> would fit well, better than in the nondescript "separation")? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleph4_0f7d.html" title="User:Aleph4">Aleph4</a> 12:11, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>! This is the first serious attempt I've ever seen to categorize love songs by topic. The list doesn't need to be complete--it will never be.

<dd>Anyone who thought that the titles or even lyrics of pop songs could simply be taken to reflect Western society's attitudes would be sadly deluded.
