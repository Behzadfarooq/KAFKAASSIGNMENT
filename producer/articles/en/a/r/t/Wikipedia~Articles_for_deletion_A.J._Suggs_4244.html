<p>A non-notable college player. Suggs was primarily a back-up quarterback for 2 different teams.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I'm between weak delete and weak keep on this one. He was a starting qb on a major Division I FBS team. But, it was a position he only held for a short amount of time with no further playtime in the professional league. Ultimately, if he had played for an entire year or more or had been an All-Something player, I might have said weak keep. But in the end, I'm going with delete on this one. ↔<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmajdan_9130.html" title="User:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:11px; font-weight:bold; font-family:verdana, sans-serif;">NMajdan</font></a>•<a href="../../../n/m/a/User_talk%7ENmajdan_5041.html" title="User talk:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:9px; font-family:verdana, sans-serif; color:#000000;">talk</font></a> 19:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment- Every starting quartback for a division 1a team do not deserve a wikipedia article. If a player, wins an award, sets a record (i'd even settle for a school record, like wins or touchdowns) or plays professionally, then he should have an article. If his most notable accomplishment was being an average quartback on an average team (with Georgia Tech at least), then he really does not deserve a bio.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 22:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>He was a starter for more than a year, that means he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is the subject of multiple non-trival press reports, that means the subject is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. The fact that he started for not one but two Division IA schools puts him in a very small group of players. People are likely to want to know about him.

<li><b>Reply</b>: I don't know why you've got this vendetta against AJ. I think you don't really understand the college game. College QB's don't typically play four full seasons. College teams typically play a QB for a year or two and their backups "mature." It's a pretty common practice. Four year starters are much more rare than you'd think. I assure you that being a full season starter for an ACC bowl team is noteworthy. And he actually played in 22 games: 7 at UT and 15 at GT. -<a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcaliburhorn_1fda.html" title="User:Excaliburhorn">Excaliburhorn</a> 17:28 Feb 28, 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, QBs typically mature and then come into starting roles during the latter part of their career. This player started playing early and lost his starting job to somebody younger.

<dd>I am not sure where my "vendetta" is. I am sure A.J. Suggs is a wonderful human being and I do understand the college game very well. I just don't want every Division 1 player to have a wikipedia bio, as it would create glut of unhelpful articles. Given that there are 119 D1 teams and many times 80 or so players on a team, I would hope any college football fan would agree with my statements. Even if you broke it down to the BCS conference teams, you still have dozens of teams with most of the players having biographies and other sources online due to the fact that college football is very popular (and a huge money maker for all the networks). We should wait until they play at the highest level of college for a consistent time period, set a major record (aka <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timmy_Chang_bed1.html" title="Timmy Chang">Timmy Chang</a>) or go pro to create Wiki-bios.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 22:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
