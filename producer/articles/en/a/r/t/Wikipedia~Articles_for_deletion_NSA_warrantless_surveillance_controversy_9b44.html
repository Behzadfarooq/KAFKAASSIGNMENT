<li><b>Weak Keep</b> (*sigh*) <b>&amp; Clean Up</b> - If the newspaper reports and media leaks are true, I am opposed to this program. However, this is an encyclopedia. There are so many problems with this article including rampant POV (both overt and subtly nuanced), soapboxing, credibility of certain sources, not to mention the fact that NOBODY outside the NSA knows ANY FACTS ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT!! This article merely repeats speculation and endless analysis of that speculation!!! It's not encyclopedic. The controversy is important but it is handled very badly in this present article.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I can't believe this article was nominated for deletion. As far as I can tell, the only person advocating the deletion is some Anon user who is almost certainly little more than a neoconservative shill with little in the way of insightful reasoning as to why this article deserves to be deleted. Here's a clue: not much is known about the NSA wiretapping, other than the fact that it is indeed going on, because the NSA does a great job of covering its tracks. With that said, the article does a good job of summing up what's known. Please remove the unsightly AfD banner from the article if no one can come up with a real reason why it should be deleted. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmiddy_e427.html" title="User:Schmiddy">Schmiddy</a> 23:03, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I too can not believe this article was nominated for deletion. This issue is still developing, and I see nothing but neutral descriptive content in it as journalism or historical writing should aspire to be. I'm not logged in, but I am David C. Manchester and worked hard converting many pdf's related to this issue and put them on a site [(<a href="http://thewall.civiblog.org/rsf/nsa.html" class="external free" title="http://thewall.civiblog.org/rsf/nsa.html" rel="nofollow">http://thewall.civiblog.org/rsf/nsa.html</a>)] listed in the external links section, so I can't pretend I have no effort invested here. Even so, this article should most emphatically NOT be deleted, as most of the historical record of this issue is yet to unfold. As to length, there is no "right" length in my opinion. I think whatever length necessary for a full and complete neutral description is the proper one, whether it be 300 or 30,000 words. Organisation is the important thing. Is is navigable with tags organised conveniently? Are related articles linked in a convenient way? And so forth. As to legal analysis, I'm not qualified to give one, but the same guidelines I would think would apply as to the NPOV required of the narrative timeline text. That is, an analysis inclusive of relevant precedent and case law, and not a particular legal opinion - a summary of issues at hand, not an opinion. Any indications or probable ways the thing could resolve, should be included - as links to separate articles - and clearly labeled analytical *opinion*. That's my 2 cents. It's a good article, neutral, descriptive, and offers value to researchers, historians, and citizens trying to figure out how to deal with this question of balance between executive authority under the color of national security and civil libeties slip-sliding away. Keep it. -dcm</li>
