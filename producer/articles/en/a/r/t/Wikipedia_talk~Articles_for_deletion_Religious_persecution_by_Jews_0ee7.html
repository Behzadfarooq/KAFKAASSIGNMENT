<dd>I support that idea. Unfortunately, you will find a number of people who will genuinely argue the point that "religious persecution by..." is a good and fair topic when applied to most religious groups, but outrageous and racist when applied to <i>their</i> religious group. Plenty of people in each community who feel this way: in the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Jews_5375.html" title="Religious persecution by Jews">Religious persecution by Jews</a> VfD, see IZAK and BrianGotts for examples. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 11:08, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Briangotts, you are mistaken. I did not play the racism card. Rather, I accused <i>you</i> of playing the racism card. Unless, of course, you consider accusations of playing the racism card to be a form of playing the racism card; but then you're stuck, because then you, too, have just played the racism card (but for the second time, against my one time). Anyway, you never contributed to my new <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr_complex.html" title="Martyr complex">martyr complex</a> stub, so you have no credibility. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 20:59, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am unqualified to contribute substantively to a psychologically-oriented technical article on martyr complexes.

<dd>You have consistently misrepresented my position on this matter. The article is offensive not because the idea of Jews oppressing others makes it so but because you have failed to identify <i>one</i> credible instance of religious persecution. Those you and your fellow travelers have identified are stretching to the point of absurdity. The page was obviously created as a POV, retaliatory springboard.</dd>
<dd>On a personal note, I have no desire to continue trading snide remarks with you as I feel a)the amusement value both for ourselves and for other users is probably wearing thin at this point and b) I prefer to devote my time to more productive endeavors. Your incivility and condescending attitude with other users, and my substantive statements on the vfd page, speak for themselves. In the future, if I think a comment is worth responding to in a substantive manner, I will do so; otherwise I will ignore you with equanimity. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 21:51, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I just looked at your user page. You've made a mindboggling number of high-quality contributions to Wikipedia. I absentmindedly added myself to your list of favorite Wikipedians; I apologize for that, that was vandalism and it won't happen again. Look, I'm not trading snide remarks with anyone. That's how I talk, and no snideness or condescension is intended. I certainly have no reason to suspect I'm in a position to condescend to any other Wikipedians--I know nothing about them. Nor have I attempted to misrepresent your views. The section on the displacement of Palestinians is cited to <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Morris_4202.html" title="Benny Morris">Benny Morris</a> and other Israeli New Historians. Perfect sources? Of course not, but it's a start. Are there sources out there regarding the Hasmonean forced conversion of the Idumeans? Yes, in abundance. Are they in the article yet? No. The point is that it is a legitimate topic and the deficit in sourcing is a common problem in newish articles and can be remedied. But rushing the article off to VfD is an attempt to <i>prevent the article's improvement</i> by issuing a sort of Wikifatwa which declares the topic verboten, despite its potential. That's no good. And I'm afraid that when you support other such articles covering other religious groups-- though these articles, too, are in their embryonic stage--it looks like you have some sort of aversion to this particular treatment of this particular religious group. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 22:17, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would also support that measure. All three of these articles were started simply for the purpose of riling up different members of WP. And Babajobu, look no further than User:HKT, for an example of a user who would die before allowing an article such as the one we're debating. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiCT_a6f1.html" title="User:LokiCT">LokiCT</a> 15:22, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I prefer individual article VfDs. If you're concerned at the amount of effort put into discussion, just list them one at a time with, say, seven days in between listings. If the articles were really disruptive they could be summarily deleted, but VfD is for articles that are in this gray area.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It may be as some people say that they were created "simply for the purpose of riling up different members of WP", but since to me they seem all of them to be quite unexceptional and uncontentious, I have no way of verifying the author's intent, and in any case it is the end result that is more important to me. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:34, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also think it unlikely that the collection was developed to rile up members of WP, but I'm not sure they're articles that should be made, as you will see in some of my remarks around here. In particular, I am of the view that this section should be replaced with "Attitudes of X to others", rather than directly their acts of religious persecution which is very hard to define in terms of the group as a whole or their creed, but often in terms of sub-groups. --<a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 06:41, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). As for vote count, my tally (which may be slightly inaccurate) places this at 34 keep (after Dv and Incognito have been discounted as possible sockpuppets, and LokiCT has also been discounted), 66 delete votes, 2 merge votes and one redirect vote. In other words a very close call, with a lot of comments. There are a lot of shouting matches with a load of people emphatically holding their positions. The main concern has the neutrality and verifiability of the article. I am in doubt here. Therefore I cannot delete. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:03, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with the above decision. 34:66:2 as a keep/delete/merge vote in no way constitutes a rough consensus of the group; one-third of users should not be able to override this supermajority. Therefore, I <i>must</i> delete this article, and request that further discussion should take place on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">votes for undeletion</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeutrality_6997.html" title="User talk:Neutrality">talk</a></sup> 18:02, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would add that Neutrality has now twice deleted the article and its talk page. On both occasions a separate administrator restored them both.</p>
<ul>
<li>18:33, 8 August 2005 Kim Bruning restored "Historical persecution by Jews"</li>
<li>14:59, 8 August 2005 Neutrality deleted "Historical persecution by Jews" (Re-deleting. There was an obvious two-thirds consensus on VfD to delete. This is "broad consensus." A small minority of users will no be allowed to override the broad consensus. Take it to VfU if you must.)</li>
<li>10:03, 8 August 2005 Tony Sidaway restored "Historical persecution by Jews"</li>
<li>19:47, 7 August 2005 Neutrality deleted "Historical persecution by Jews" (VfD debate had an overwhelming vote to delete (at least 2:1).)</li>
</ul>
<p>I encourage Neutrality to list this article for deletion again after a reasonable period if he doesn't like the way the last discussion was closed. The result of the recent RfC <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Tony_Sidaway_4a42.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Tony Sidaway">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Tony Sidaway</a> suggests that there is a strong consensus for administrator discretion in closing. I, for instance, use a sliding scale for consensus between 70% and 80%. I wouldn't touch a 2/3 vote with a bargepole. But my response to the RfC has been endorsed by <s>23</s> <s>24</s> 25 people. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:07, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. However Neutrality's stated objection is apparently that he personally considers 2:1 to be a rough consensus. This is simply a disagreement between parties that have different but reasonable (well, I consider the 2:1 standard to be <i>just about</i> defensible, though I would never use it myself) criteria for rough consensus. We can't go around tearing one another's legitimate closes down simply because our standards of consensus are different--surely there has to be some evidence of an illegitimate assumption or decision being made by the closer. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:20, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can agree with that. I guess I am more focused on closures that say no consensus when there are no keep votes. This is not the case for this VfD. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 17:06, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well as a result of the RfC I've rethought calling no consensus. In future I'm emphasizing the binary nature of the decision by calling a keep unless there is a consensus to delete. The "no consensus" was really just a modifier, like the "not proven" verdict in Scottish law, and as such is easily misread as "not sure." If I call keep it's unambiguously because and only because there isn't a consensus to delete. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:17, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now you've lost me. You think that is a positive response to the RfC? Or is it a spiteful response? (Honest question.) I supported you in the RfC because your decisions were well documented and reasonable - with rare exceptions that I disagreed with but could understand. I'm not following your view on this "binary" decision. If there are 5 delete votes and 4 keep votes then you can accurately call it "no consensus" but not "keep". - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 18:14, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, recall that 24 people in addition to me *endorsed* my response to the RfC. You are one of 4 who added your signatures to an outside view by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert_McClenon</a> to the effect that I would not be abusing my authority as an admin if I refrained from closing VfDs. There's a difference there (though confusingly at least half dissented from Robert's central suggestion that I refrain from closing). So no I'm not being spiteful, I can afford to be magnanimous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No, the problem is that policy is not clearly understood. Central to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">VfD closing policy</a> is this: the article is kept where there is no consensus. Also the only important action performed by an administrator is to determine whether or not the article should be deleted (hence this is a <i>binary</i> decision.) Deletion (and acts involving deletion such as history merging) is the only action that can't be performed, or reversed, by an ordinary editor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>If a VFD discussion yields no consensus, the decision defaults to keep the article. Note that this does not preclude editing, renaming or merging the article, as those actions do not require a deletion vote.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If six people voted delete and six voted to merge, there is <i>not</i> a consensus to merge any more than there is a consensus to delete. I'll happily close the discussion saying "keep" (or, formerly, "no consensus") because that is what we do when there is no consensus. The fact that nobody voted to keep is supremely irrelevant--people thought it shouldn't be kept but they couldn't agree what to do, so I won't pretend that they did. If somebody else wants to do the merge, that's fine with me--it has nothing to do with me. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:52, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This response, and your decision, sound very spiteful. I had initially respected your "no consensus" because it was your honest opionion. This "binary" approach is a spite against your detractors.

<p>Hmmm, looks like we'll have to agree to differ. To me it's obvious that the only way to clarity is my current path--to call a keep a keep, especially when it is explicitly prescribed as a keep by policy. It is, in fact, my only defense against further attacks on me, to be absolutely clear that my actions are unequivocally directly derived from policy. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:37, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>We are not discussing whether merge/delete results should be called keep or merge. We are discussing this debate, where the result was actually a quite clean divide with 34 keep and 66 delete. In addition there were 2 merge votes and 1 redirect vote. If I place the merge votes in the "keep" column and the redirect vote in the "delete" column (since redirect usually means that the content is discardable) we are left with 67-36. This is <i>below</i> the 2:1 delete majority which Neutrality claims. I cannot understand why people think it is okay for a <i>participant in the VFD debate</i> to overrule a decision which he disagrees with. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:16, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let's get back on topic. I oppose the method which Neutrality used to perform his "re-count". First, let's remember that despite the name, "Votes for deletion" has nothing to do with "voting". We use "votes" as a very rough proxy for measuring the degree to which concensus has been reached. But the comments - the facts, evidence and logical arguments - that go with a "vote" are always more important that the mere "vote". This means that the closing admin will always have to exercise his/her discretion when closing a vote. <i>That is a good thing!</i> We select admins for their judgment. We should trust them to exercise it well.</p>
<p>That is not to say that every admin will make every decision correctly. We do have the ability to review and correct "bad" decisions. Our processes have evolved over time but they are quite effective. If an article was incorrectly deleted, it gets discussed again on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a>. By long precedent, if an article is incorrectly kept, if gets discussed again in a <i>new</i> deletion discussion thread. The new discussion should link to the old one but it should definitely be a community decision, not the decision of a single dissenting admin. We've never needed to write that precedent down before but that has been established practice for at least the several years I've been here.</p>
<p>I will support Neutrality's right to open a new VfD debate over this article. There are some serious issues which have not been resolved. However, I oppose the attempt to re-write the closing decision of the existing debate. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 13:16, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And what is the point of voting for the undeletion of an article that has not been deleted? When, as is almost inevitable, you don't get a 2:1 majority to undelete, will that be used as "proof" that it should now be deleted? If this is what <i>does</i> happen, IMO that would be a total perversion of the spirit of the Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 21:01 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
