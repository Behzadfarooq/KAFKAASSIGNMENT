<li><b>Evidence</b>. For those of you people who don't have a clue as to the popularity of techPhile....
<ul>
<li>Now as I have stated before, it is often difficult to state exact figures on the number of downloads per podcast, as often these are distributed via bittorrent (which is very difficult to track) and the podcasts end up all over the net with various other sources distributing it.</li>
<li>Another thing I'll post is a link to a post on <a href="http://www.digg.com" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com</a> (a social bookmarking site). Basically the number of 'diggs' is how many people have clicked to 'digg' it and is an indication of its popularity. See an example of a digg article posted for this podcast here: <a href="http://www.digg.com/technology/Techphile_Episode_11_From_the_TechTV_Meetup_in_Toronto" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com/technology/Techphile_Episode_11_From_the_TechTV_Meetup_in_Toronto" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com/technology/Techphile_Episode_11_From_the_TechTV_Meetup_in_Toronto</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Encyclopedic notability not established by the article, which looks like advertising. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 11:19, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, very notable podcast. It's a quality podcast that's updated on a regular basis. Which is more than I can say for most of the podcasts today. Even <a href="http://www.macgeekradio.com" class="external text" title="http://www.macgeekradio.com" rel="nofollow">my own</a>. Not to mention the work Frank has done for the Canadian podcasting community. <a href="../../../f/p/a/User%7EFpatten_7a4d.html" title="User:Fpatten">MacGeek</a> 17:54, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> yet another non-notable podcast. As before, in reference to the evidence provided, "diggs" are around 500. The biggest hit on the provided site is 1000 and that is only because that particular episode was about diggs.com. There are blogs out there that get that many hits a day... and I don't consider them notable.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:41, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The number of 'diggs' is a very, very rough guide as to the popularity of this podcast. digg.com is only one site (out of the many hundreds of other sites this podcast is backlinked from) and many people may not have clicked the digg button, but simply gone straight to the link.
<ul>
<li>OK... then it is completely worthless as evidence of the popularity of this podcast...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:36, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep(with provisions)</b> It is a notable podacast that has been recommended on both professional broadcast and print media. It is an Amateur production, in the sense of for the love of it, and this does initially put off some listeners that are used to and prefer professional or professional grade production. Once you get past that and listen for the quality of the content, it is far greater than the large majority of free podcasts. The only provision I have to keeping it is if the actual entry is improved because of its not quite "ready for prime time" entry. I do not have the time currently to do this myself, or I would.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why is this non-notable? What is the criteria to determine this? I notice that some people write that this podcast doesn't have enough viewers to be notable -- but how many viewers does a podcast need to be notable? And why that number? Please try to come up with substantial reasons for deleting articles. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 00:25, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me turn this around for a second <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a>... why is it notable? Where is the evidence that this is a popular podcast that is generating alot of buzz? Podcasts are like blogs; inherently non-notable for the simple fact that they are basically vanity projects. Anyone can start a podcast and spam it all over the internet. They can even charge to view it, but that doesn't make it notable or important. I would strongly argue that in reference to any non-traditional media of this sort the burden of proof is on those arguing keep as there is not as clear and concise of a method of establishing notability as exists with traditional media. One could certainly argue that this is simply an example of "old media" like magazines, television, etc. ignoring the "new media" of podcasts, but the complete lack of ANY coverage of techPhile by independant, 3rd party sources makes it impossible to verify any of the claims of popularity. I would therefore turn this around and ask you and those voting keep to come up with substantial reasons to retain this article beyond it being listed in some podcast guides and the contention of the random wiki user that it is indeed "notable".--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:52, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So are you saying that podcasts &amp; blogs should both be considered non-notable on the basis of vanity? I disagree: while many blogs are obviously vanity projects, it requires only a little work to determine whether their notability is "yes" "no" or "maybe". I would think that the same could be said of podcasting; I assume that there are notable podcasts out there that are not connected with established broadcasting companies. I freely admit that you could write a book for O'Reilly on what I don't know about podcasting, <i>however</i>, instead of providing the information needed by those of us who are ignorant about podcasting, all Brenneman said above is "not notable. Delete." Some kind of comparative information on audience size &amp; reach is one possible argument for his opinion, but so far from what I've seen I could easily conclude he wants to delete this article out of animosity for this podcast -- not that I do here, but more information than those three words would not only make his intent clear, it would be a kindness to the contributor, who must wonder if such a terse criticism is indended to make him stop contributing. And until it can be shown that this article <i>is</i> non notable, we should keep it. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:19, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying all blogs and podcasts are non-notable... what I'm saying is that due to the nature of podcasting (and blogging) they are intristically in a weaker position of notability than more established media, primarily because there is a lack of verifiable data out there to support their claims of notibility if nobody from established media sources is paying any mind to these podcasts &amp; blogs. There are notable podcasts out there. <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Source_Code_d3ae.html" title="Daily Source Code">Daily Source Code</a> is a good example based on it's "trailblazing" status. But here is where it we get into a philosophical debate that could go on ad infinitum: you want the burden of proof on the nominator... I put it on the author. I assume good faith in the creation of this article, but that doesn't mean the author has in any way indicated notability. Based on my own research, I've seen nothing that would indicate that TechPhile is in any way notable. the evidence posted for keeping it is unconvincing. As way of evidence for deletion, I can offer you in the complete lack of any coverage of TechPhile on any major IT media outlets, be it web, magazine, etc. It's primary return in a Google search is numerous podcast list sites where it is one of 100 other non-notable casts; not that I think that will convince you... Point is that in the end <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a>, you and I have a completely different viewpoint of where the burden of proof is... which would explain our differing votes.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:37, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, Isotope, you &amp; I agree at least that we disagree; I'm satisfied to leave the matter there. I would like to point out (at the risk of repeating myself), that had Brennerman originally wrote a more satisfactory &amp; detailed nomination &amp; touched on some of the points you had done, we would not be having this conversation -- a thought for everyone who found this discussion more tedious than informative, &amp; would want to avoid repeating the exercise. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:52, 6 October 2005 (UTC)
