<u>AFD result.</u>
<p>There is a <b>clear consensus</b> that this article should be <b>merged</b> into at least one other. Debates as to the most useful disposition of cricket match articles are not new; to outsiders (to cricket) they can be extremely confusing. I'm one of these folks, so it took me a while to go through the articles and categories to familiarise myself with the issues. Briefly:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Transvaal_v_Natal_B_1-4_January_1972_abd2.html" title="Northern Transvaal v Natal B 1-4 January 1972">The article that is the subject of this AFD</a> pertains to a single cricket match that took place during the 1971-72 South Africa cricket season. The article is four sentences long and is a short summary of the game. It is unlikely that there is much more that can be sensibly added to the page.</li>
<li>There are dozens of SA cricket seasons, see <a href="../../../s/o/u/Template%7ESouth_African_cricket_seasons_5afa.html" title="Template:South African cricket seasons">Template:South_African_cricket_seasons</a>.</li>
<li>In the 1971-72 SA season, some 32 <u>matches</u> were played. See Category:1971/2_South_African_cricket_season_matches. <i>Each</i> of these matches has been given an <i>individual page</i>, usually only a couple of sentences long.</li>
<li>Aside from individual pages for the <i>matches</i>, there are also individual pages for <i>each <u>team'</u>s</i> performance in that season. For example, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvaal_B_in_1971_2_4dd4.html" title="Transvaal B in 1971/2">Transvaal B in 1971/2</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Transvaal_in_1971_2_520a.html" title="Northern Transvaal in 1971/2">Northern Transvaal in 1971/2</a>, <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesia_in_1971_2_e29c.html" title="Rhodesia in 1971/2">Rhodesia in 1971/2</a>.</li>
<li>Aside from individual pages on single matches, there are also articles on the various <i>tournaments</i> (I hope that's the right word) within that season. In the 1971-72 season, the tournaments were <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currie_Cup_Section_A_in_1971_2_3d59.html" title="Currie Cup Section A in 1971/2">Currie Cup Section A in 1971/2</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currie_Cup_Section_B_in_1971_2_615a.html" title="Currie Cup Section B in 1971/2">Currie Cup Section B in 1971/2</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillette_Cup_in_1971_2_37aa.html" title="Gillette Cup in 1971/2">Gillette Cup in 1971/2</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Castle_Cup_first-class_matches_in_South_Africa_in_1971_2_9dba.html" title="Non-Castle Cup first-class matches in South Africa in 1971/2">Non-Castle Cup first-class matches in South Africa in 1971/2</a>.</li>
<li>The material in the articles on the <i>tournaments</i> (what I mentioned in #5), and the material in articles on <i>teams</i> (what I mentioned in #4), are all collections of substs of the <i>individual match</i> articles (what I mentioned in #3).</li>
</ol>
I agree with <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a>, <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanbrown_eb80.html" title="User:Ianbrown">Ian</a>, <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a>, and (I think) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> that these individual match (not just the one here discussed on the AFD) shouldn't be maintained. The information is all in the larger articles, each of which consist of a series of substs of the match articles. The larger articles also provide the opportunity for context that the tiny articles don't (I'm sure a bit more could be said about the 1972 Northern Transvaal team, for example, than merely a list of the matches they played). I would also like to point out that the <i>team</i> articles (ie. what I mentioned in #4), are poorly titled. <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesia_in_1971_2_e29c.html" title="Rhodesia in 1971/2">Rhodesia in 1971/2</a> may be an acceptable title for a cricket encyclopedia, but on a general encyclopedia like WP it is misleading. The disposition of articles not the subject of this AFD cannot be decided here, but there does appear to be a strong consensus, both within and without the WP cricket community, that the individual match articles be merged (and redirected if not deleted). I lend my voice in support of this idea. Finally, I'm a little mystified as to why the match articles were written in the first place, and agree with <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> that they shouldn't be in future. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>03:12, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</i> <a name="Northern_Transvaal_v_Natal_B_1-4_January_1972" id="Northern_Transvaal_v_Natal_B_1-4_January_1972"></a>

I voted to keep the 2005 English cricket season matches, but only because I understood that they would all be merged at the end of the season, and that it wouldn't be done that way again. I very much respect the authors' dedication to cricket and to Wikipedia, but I am unhappy that <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECricket_b112.html" title="WP:Cricket">WikiProject Cricket</a> is continuing to provoke so much controversy. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> 14:19, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Query</b> - I thought the whole point of the 2005 English county match reports was that at the end of the season, they would all be merged together into a week-by-week analysis or a team-by-team analysis, and that the original match reports would then be deleted. Is my understanding wrong? If so, would very much appreciate knowing what was intended originally and what happened in the end, now that the season has been over for a month or more. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripatetic_b918.html" title="User:Peripatetic">Peripatetic</a> 00:58, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your understanding is not wrong. However, because of holiday and things it's taken a great deal of time to clean all the articles up (I'm into the middle of August at the moment) - when that's finished, I'll subst them all in and ask for someone to merge page histories. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 07:08, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There was no consensus in any of these discussions. So pretending that a precedent has been established is disingenuous.</li>
<li>It was clearly stated by several contributors that the articles would be deleted promptly at the end of the season. I suspect that the vote would have been more negative without this promise. However, this has not happened, and I'm not even sure whether this is planned for these South African articles. I'm beginning to suspect that the authors quite like having the individual articles.</li>
<li>The fact that <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECricket_b112.html" title="WP:Cricket">WikiProject Cricket</a> is continuing to do something so controversial based only on the inability to reach consensus either for or against is itself worrying to me. We're not being good neighbours, and we're giving our project a bad name. Besides, we could do without wasting time having this argument every few weeks. We should be voluntarily finding a better way to do this.</li>
