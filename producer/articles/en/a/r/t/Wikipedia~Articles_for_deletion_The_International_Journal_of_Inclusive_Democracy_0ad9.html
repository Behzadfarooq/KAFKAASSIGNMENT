<li>Keep! Again the same try like before with the D&amp;N Journal, of course it is international, see the contributors&amp;IAB Board. Is it an argument that the editors are native greeks and some are living in Greece?! Well, some articles were produced before in the D&amp;N Journal BUT now they are for the first time freely to read for all how are interested. See as well the very interesting Newsletter of the Journal. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 195.179.14.235 (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.179.14.235.html" title="User talk:195.179.14.235">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.179.14.235_426e.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.179.14.235">contribs</a>) 11:47, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>It is a lie that the journal does not publish original contributions. Even when it reproduces articles (which were available before only to subscribers) it publishes mostly completely UPDATED versions of them and it even offers entire books published for the first time in English as special editions. Furthermore, as from the last issue (September 2005) the journal increasingly publishes original contributions like that by David Gabbard &amp; Karen Anijar Appleton and the next (January issue) will consist entirely of original contributions. Finally, the accompanying Newsletter consists entirely of new contributions (already 24 of them) and many of the contributions to the NL have already been reproduced in international papers, magazines, indymedia etc. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheVel_a964.html" title="User:TheVel">TheVel</a> 15:13, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> The journal, following the example of several serious theoretical journals, is offered on line. This means there is no capitalist publisher involved and therefore the journal can be offered free to all internet users and also secures a much greater degree of freedom to editors from profit considerations. The contributions are still refereed as in the journal’s predecessor D&amp;N. To say that the articles appear as reproductions is a falsification, distortion, and affront to those international authors who have contributed to the journal.

<li><b>KEEP</b>It seems to me that the same disgruntled person who began the attack against the journal Democracy &amp; Nature last month (using then the Paul Cardan nick), after his real motives (i.e. his personal vendetta against <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takis_Fotopoulos_db26.html" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a> became all too clear and the vast majority of users voted to keep the entry, came back now. In fact he cannot even hide his rage betraying again his real motive (‘vanity page –self promotion for ONE Mr Fotopoulos’)! As regards the Editorial Board, it consists of an Editorial Committee which runs the journal and its members are based in Greece (apart from Takis Fotopoulos, the editor, who is based in London, UK). The International Advisory Board consists of well known theorists and activists of the International Left. The same applies to its contributors. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">User: Narap43</a> Webmaster of the International Journal of Inclusive Democracy

<li><b>KEEP</b>****Comment DisposableAccount is a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet.html" title="Sock puppet">sock puppet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the proof: The user name DisposableAccount was first used on 00:24, 19 November 2005 (UTC) when the user, in the discussion on the AfD on <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_%26_Nature_3533.html" title="Democracy &amp; Nature">Democracy &amp; Nature</a> journal (the predecessor of The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy), wrote a comment indirectly supporting the AfD and causing an administrator to comment:"simply using an ad hoc username which hasn't been used anywere else in Wikipedia and will therefore probably be discarded soon afterwards" -- like, say, "DisposableAccount"?—SarekOfVulcan 01:12, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Finally, when <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">User: Narap43</a> above expressed the legitimate suspicion on 19:22, 16 December 2005 that DisposableAccount is a sock puppeteer who edits under more than one name (User: PaulCardan, who played a leading role in promoting the AfD on <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_%26_Nature_3533.html" title="Democracy &amp; Nature">Democracy &amp; Nature</a> and DisposableAccount, who made the present AfD on 23:43, 14 December 2005), the following interesting development took place. Just a few hours after the comment by <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">User: Narap43</a> was made, DisposableAccount added the following comment to his own account WITH THE CLEAR INTENTION TO COVER HIS STEPS AND DECEIVE WIKIPEDIA ADMINISTRATORS: “I specialize in spotting users who write either using no username, or simply an ad hoc username which hasn't been used anywhere else in Wikipedia and will therefore probably be discarded soon afterwards. Hence the choice of "DisposableAccount". Oh, the irony! 01:15, 17 December 2005”</dd>

<li><b>Get it together dudes</b>. Enough with this Sherlock Holmes business. He is so-and-so and she is so-and-so. I've only appeared in Wikipedia when I saw ad hoc usernames, i.e. sock puppets. And now you're claiming I'm one myself. (while also using ad hoc usernames, with which you haven't contributed anything anywhere else on Wikipedia) L.o.l. What's this crap about me covering my steps and deceiving Wikipedia administrators? I simply wrote on my user page what it is I do around here.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your tactics are well known since your intervention in the AfD debate on D&amp;N. This intervention had nothing to do with supporting Wikipedia’s policy and had everything to do with Goebbellian tactics! Then, when we complained that the result of the AfD debate was summarized inaccurately by an administrator as ‘no consensus’’, at the very moment when the vast majority of users sided against deletion of the D&amp;N entry, you wrote: “Of course you're going to get a majority when the same people show up and vote over and over again in favor of keeping your journal. The point however is what ACTUALLY EXISTING Wikipedians voted”. And you wrote this, in full knowledge of the fact that this was a blatant LIE, since the vast majority of ACTUALLY EXISTING USERS (as we proved) had voted against the AfD. This, excluding all those who have not contributed anything before to Wikipedia (although properly registered users) who presumably, according to some silly Wikipedia regulation, are considered somehow second class citizens! As regards your ironic comment about the “Sherlock Holmes business” you never explained the “coincidence” that you remembered to define your function in the Wikipedia, as a guardian of the above mentioned regulation, a month after you began to play this role and—again “by coincidence”—always in relation to the same journal (i.e. The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy and its predecessor, D&amp;N).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There is a simple way to prove that we are wrong: can you give us exact data about how many other interventions in accordance with your self-defined function you have made, apart from the ones related to D&amp;N and its successor The International journal of Inclusive Democracy? Also, we would be grateful if SarekOfVulcan, who as he showed in the AfD discussion on D&amp;N specializes in checking DNS addresses, could do the same with regards to the addresses used by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cardan_1994.html" title="Paul Cardan">Paul Cardan</a> and DisposableAccount. It would be very interesting indeed if he finds a close similarity between the two addresses. Particularly so if they both are found somewhere in Illinois, where it is well known that the …Greek student who used the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cardan_1994.html" title="Paul Cardan">Paul Cardan</a> username presently lives! I hope that you will not use the cheap trick again of “Sherlock Holmes” business in order to avoid a substantiated reply. User:john 19:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Request</b> How long is this going to last? Five days have already lapsed since the request and the discussion seems to have finished (with an overwhelming KEEP). I think it is quite reasonable to ask the administrators to remove the AfD banner from "The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy" --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheVel_a964.html" title="User:TheVel">TheVel</a> 18:00, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think the result is no consensus (once you exclude unsigned votes); that means a keep. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 00:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Why are the opinions of the Editorial Board disqualified and the opinions of Disposable Account (who we believe is the disgruntled ex-member of the Editorial Board who was posting also under the nick Paul Cardan) are not? We asked for evidence that Paul Cardan and Disposable Account do not have similar addresses and we haven't received a reply on this. Even if we exclude all those for whom Stifle and Sarek made dubious comments about john not signing as john sargis</li>
</ul>
<p>sandy not signing as Sandyshevack, and Stifle thanking Narap for identifying himself as webmaster of the Group, still this means that 66% of participants rejected the AfD. Isn't this a concensus? User:john sargis 21:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I just want to say that it was only a few hours ago that I realized there is an AfD on this page. Up to this point, I have NOT participated in it. I'd also like to point out that I had nothing to do with the AfD on the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_%26_Nature_3533.html" title="Democracy &amp; Nature">Democracy &amp; Nature</a> entry. As anyone who is not blind can see, that AfD got started by <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarekOfVulcan_fb73.html" title="User:SarekOfVulcan">User:SarekOfVulcan</a> who is also not participating in the present exchange -- Paulcardan 23:37, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Good! But nobody provided yet the evidence requested about your address and that of DisposableAccount to persuade us that they do not refer to the same person. Also, although the AfD on the D&amp;N entry was started by User:SarekOfVulcan, the discussion page of D&amp;N shows clearly your crucial role in supporting it. Finally, I notice that the present Afd was made on 14 December and according to WP Deletion policy the lag time on articles for deletion is five days and at the end of this period a decision has to be made on whether to keep or delete the page concerned. Still, no decision has yet been made although seven days have already lapsed! User:john sargis 23:00 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The number of people trying to push this to be closed is concerning me. I don't know why an administrator hasn't either closed this or marked it as a relist for lack of consensus yet. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 00:30, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This is scandalous! In clear violation of WikiPedia rules the AfD banner remains 10 days after it was put there by a well known malicious user--as it was shown above!!! What forces this silence????--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheVel_a964.html" title="User:TheVel">TheVel</a> 11:10, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> I vote to keep, because Stifle is suggesting to stifle my vote and be discounted because I didn't sign "properly". The Journal is extremely important as a theoretical analysis that the anti-systemic Left badly needs. User: john sargis 10:20, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> I vote to keep the Inclusive Democracy journal , for its anti-systemic stance against the transnational elites' increasing concentrations of economic and political power. User:tommy silva 11:55, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
