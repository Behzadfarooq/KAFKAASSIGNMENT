Because of Valve's Steam content delivery system, that message will have reached at least a million people. Most people within the Half-Life gaming community will know of this mod in passing at least.

<p>Not notable. This is a twenty-something former Democratic staffer. She looked up a credit report on a Senate candidate without authorization. She pled guilty to this misdemeanor, and did 150 hours of community service. Do we really need an encyclopedia article on her? I think not.

<li>You've merged too many details. Wiener is nonnotable, and the datum about where she got her degree isn't worth mentioning in the article about this minor incident. I think <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> has a good point, though, about this incident being kept alive for partisan reasons. (That Steele was a victim of this and of the Oreo incident seems to be the bulk of the rationale for making him a Senator.)

<li>The phrase "involvement of DSCC higher ups" would suggest to many readers that the higher-ups were complicit in a crime. In fact, however, according to the cited document, their involvement was that, upon learning of the incident, they ordered Weiner to destroy the credit report. They then reported their employee's misconduct to the U.S. Attorney's Office. So, yes, that's technically "involvement", but not the kind that would make the incident notable. It won't become "a cancer on the DSCC" (the Watergate analogy). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 08:53, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

Your argument simply makes the statement that Wikipedia does not have content that is unique. This movie is definitely not a main stream movie and their are many films not listed in imdb.

<p>For all intensive purposes, you ppl are neglecting the work i put into it. it took me days, literally, to get all the stuff together. you do realize that there is truth behind it and its not fan-whatever you want to call it. you can easily fix the stuff you find inconsistent without deleting it. that's why discussion pages are made in the first place. but to say that something's fanmade is just plain negligent ignorance from all your part. - <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZarbon_0407.html" title="User:Zarbon">Zarbon</a></p>

<dd>It isn't your page; it's Wikipedia's page, and this is the procedure to decide if the pages stay or go. If you think it doesn't meet the stated criteria for deletion, then argue the specific points in question. Up until the time the pages are deleted, you can freely save a copy of the pages so that you can post them later to other websites if you want to. There are probably some anime Wikis out there that would welcome them. You might even be able to incorporate your power structure charts into existing DBZ articles here on Wikipedia, but having four articles just to showcase four charts you drew probably isn't ever going to gain acceptance.4.89.242.145 19:54, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>comment</b>: you are right to an extent. ordinarily it is very non-notable when a wilderness mammal roams into an urban center. However, this coyote became a nationally (internationally?)-covered media event. It is this media event, as much as the coyote itself, that makes this a sufficiently notable topic to merit a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 22:45, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I admit it is basically a one-day-wonder event. But one day wonder events are frequently notable...see any super bowl or major disaster. They just happem, they are not dynamic or ongoing. Since so many events that anyone would consider notable would fall into this one day event category, this seems like an exceedingly weak rationale for deleting an article about a topic that gained such widespread media attention. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 07:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand, it was my fault to have created this page in the first place. I didn't know that it was against the policy to create an article relating to a website that you wanted to include. I personally don't see what the problem is, since any other similar articles could be placed alongside it on a referral page or something of that type, but there's nothing else I really have to say.

<li>And. We write articles on singular subjects, thank you. Requesting move of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> to fifty iterations of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_State_4c45.html" title="United State">United State</a>.</li>
<li>Other. Again, if this is about other things, then make the article about them.</li>
<li>Deleted. WE DELETE THINGS SO WE DON'T SEE THEM. Which is why this is brought here!</li>
<li>Nonsense. We don't tolerate nonsense here on Wikipedia: Serious Business.</li>

<p>New to Wikipedia and have edited the current entry. I disagree with deletion submission. Source is also verifiable. If necessary contact Dwayne Wiggins, Comedy Central, Eric Benet. Respectfully submitted. <b>Keep</b> --User:Krystal Cooper 1 April 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello, and welcome. It's tough to get into Wikipedia. Dozens of bands try every day. Most are deleted. There's a tough policy on how "notable" a band has to be to get in, and it's here: <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. Take a look there, please.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two key things about Wikipedia to know. First, you get written about; you don't write about yourself. See <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. Second, everything has to be checkable against some outside source; TV, magazine, well-known web site, or something like that. (Blogs don't count. Neither does your own web site.) It's all about your rep.</p>
<p>If you've been covered in magazines, add those mentions to your article. (They're supposed to be in a strict format, but if you just get the important info in there, someone else will probably fix that.) When you've been on TV or radio, list shows, dates, and songs. Or get your fans to do it. Most bands are put up on Wikipedia by their fans, not the band. That's what fan clubs are for.</p>
<p>What's killing your entry is that there's not much in Google about you. That's how everybody makes a quick check.</p>
<p>I'm not a music expert; I'm just doing cleanup tonight as a volunteer. I have no strong opinion either way. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 09:02, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, (waving) Thanks John. That helps a lot. Actually this is a fan. How do I link to outside sources, TV, Magazines,etc. I don't understand the tags. What is format for including magazine articles. I wonder if another problem is that he goes by Taz. His real name is Dante' M. Roberson. But thanks again for clearing it up. We will try to fix the entry approriately to be accepted into wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- as Fan1967 indicates, the idea arose out of Mihnea's suggestion in Talk:democracy, that "beautiful picture" often functions the same way in discussions of aesthetics that "pure democracy" does in discussions of politics. It certainly doesn't follow, as Mihnea now seems to contend, that I'm "disrupting" anything. Only that I am sometimes subject to his influence -- it's odd he should think his own influence so disruptive, especially sans evidence. The point, though, is that both phrases have paradigmatic value (in the old-pre-Kuhnian sense of the world <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradigm_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Paradigm (disambiguation)">paradigm (disambiguation)</a>), so both phrases should have articles. They are both very different from the phrase "ugly tires," as I haven't encountered the use of tires in such a context lately, but I have encountered and used both of the expressions that are involved in Mihnea's analogy. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 13:31, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree. It seems to me that Nikodemos (or Mihnea?) was making the point that just because a phrase is common does not mean it deserves an article. Either you totally missed his point, or you created this article in order to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> of your own. It does not deserve an article. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:40, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Need Further Info/Keep</b> - I think it's quite useful as I heard my friend in the US used something called the "FD Network" and had no idea what it is. I searched Wiki and it has basic information about it and the website. I don't know if it is the same one but at least I found something. I'm not a very experienced user of this(only look up random information) but I think providing information about this very real non-profit organization doesn't hurt the quality of the Wiki as long as the information is not biased. And that's what Wiki is about: finding information on things people are interested but not familiar with. I looked up the site and added a little more information to it. If everyone thinks it should be deleted then there isn't a problemwith that either. I just find it unnessasary. --CostaRican 16:10, 2 April 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E200.122.153.34.html" title="User:200.122.153.34">200.122.153.34</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User_talk%7E200.122.153.34.html" title="User talk:200.122.153.34">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_200.122.153.34_3cfc.html" title="Special:Contributions/200.122.153.34">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p><s>:<b>Comment:</b> Well, that was sort of my point. If we can't draw the line maybe we shouldn't have the list. As much as I try continually to seek a justification for having articles on various topics, this seems like something that needs a lot more editorial explanation to have any real value. Otherwise, to me, it looks like a blatant attempt to create a long list of personalities/activists/nutjobs who may have questioned, at one time or another, aspects of 9/11, or signed a petition, or supported someone who did. Anyway, the future participants here will decide. I don't have a particularly strong feeling and could move to neutral depending on the arguments. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:39, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>I'll second that. A walled garden is an isolated section of a Wiki where pages link only to each other and don't link outside. Really, Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> content, with its legions of interlinking minor character articles, could be seen as a walled garden. The 9/11 Truth Movement articles, on the other hand, link to current events and to people notable for reasons having nothing to do with 9/11: the content is not isolated. I'll also add that, if anything, Striver has been working to make the topic *less* of a walled garden, linking it to as many outside sources, such as <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Jong_ec49.html" title="Erica Jong">Erica Jong</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Sheen_87eb.html" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> and <a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J._Hammer_0ce6.html" title="A.J.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't like the title because there are more entities to disagree with than simply the 9/11 Commission Report's findings, i.e., Rice said they never imagined planes could be used as weapons but an FBI official said the opposite in the Moussaoui trial, that they'd known for years planes could be used as weapons. Many other documents also support that position, such as the war games official documents which played out those scenarios. But the content of this page is excellent - thanks, Striver.

<dd>I'll apologise again, as I mistook you, Mmx1 for MONGO, it's MONGO who is the government agent, and I'll happily take your word for it that you are not. I'm sorry, it was a mistake, I was confused, and maybe becoming senile. I sincerely apologise for the mistake... However, MONGO actually does appear to me to be censoring me by selective archival: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47037340" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47037340" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>,. I am trying to point out that if I have shown bias it is towards the conspiracy theorists... it can be amply shown that there was a conspiracy, and any explanation of that conspiracy that includes conjecture and unproven 'facts' is also a theory, so in fact the 9/11 commision's findings are a conspiracy theory. I'm not disputing facts but theories. It is a <i><b>fact</b></i> that WTC 1,2, and 7 collapsed to dust at freefall speeds after being struck by aircraft. Do you dispute that? It is a <i><b>theory</b></i> that the collapse of all 3 buildings was caused by the aircraft. <b>You</b> hold that to be fact, therefore you are biased toward accepting that particular conspiracy theory as a fact. I do not accept as fact anything that is not provable, and I object to the inclusion <i><b>as fact</b></i> of unproven theories. I am biased AGAINST conspiracy theories, at least I do not think that theories are Neutral in their point of view, or merit inclusion in an encyclopedic text, unless they are represented not as facts but as theories. I wish you could understand that. The mere fact that you assume that Striver contacted me because he thought I might weigh in 'on his side' of this issue does not make me biased.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 23:10, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&gt;&gt;<i>"If a researcher isn't an engineer, their view does not carry authority."</i> Like I said before, in the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 the person who figured out what actually caused the crash was <i>not an engineer, he was a metallurgist, working in a research setting</i>. The NTSB started off saying it was a single bolt failure and was going to leave it at that, was busy replacing all the bolts on other DC10s, and had it's engineers backing that story up. That story was wrong. It wasn't just the bolt, it was a mistaken procedure for engine maintenance that stressed the bolt beyond capacity. But it took a metallurgist examining the fractures on the pylon on a microscopic level, and then through a process of deduction, concluding that it could not possibly have been the bolts alone, to determine that.</p>

<p>This article is highly biased and unencyclopedic.

Google ("m/q mass spectra" vs "m/z mass spectra") and the scientific literature clearly shows that m/z is the most common term. The probably more correct but minority term m/q is already adequately mentioned in the cited articles.

<dd>I would guess because m/z is what was used in earlier versions of the article. On the sources issue, a journal article where m/q is used is not the same as a journal policy about the use of m/q.

<dl>
<dd>Morganite: already in the very earlyest stage of the article there was the Lorenz formula included, and in this formula q was used, not z. So there was always an inconsistency between the Lorenz formula and the m/z. This is why it was necessary to change to m/q.

However, once you use q in the Lorenz formula most journals would probably insist on using m/q in the text (maybe not in the mass spectra labels) for mass/charge, otherwise it is just inconsistent. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 14:32, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's obvious from searching that there's a fair amount of inconsistency in the usage of m/q and m/z - many pages seem to be using both. (I also ran into one page describing m/q as "archaic", which is surprising given that it seems to be the more recent development from what I've seen.) Trying to merge information on this with <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass-to-charge_ratio.html" title="Mass-to-charge ratio">Mass-to-charge ratio</a> might just confuse things further, and this seems to be an issue that should be mentioned somewhere. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorganite_5124.html" title="User:Morganite">Morganite</a> 02:04, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are correct: m/q is the more original version. m/z was introduced later by mass spec users (no longer designers), probably by analytical chemists that did no longer understand the physiscs behind their instrument. If you do the math you realize very quickly that m/z is not dimensionless. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 14:32, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Kehrli: Nobody disputes that m/q is more correct than the way more common m/z. But this is not the place to promote your personal opinion that only m/q should be used - this is an encyclopedia. Please see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> for the way how we handle such issues here at Wikipedia. Please stop replacing m/z by m/q, instead write a neutral and short paragraph why m/q is more correct.

<li>m/z cannot be used in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> page because the formulas in this article would no longer make sense. Please look it up. The m in m/q stands for mass and the q in m/q stands for charge. This is is a very different use of m/q than the one the m/z promoters claim. They claim to use m/z for the mass-to-charge ratio and they claim explicitly that z does not stand for charge and m does not stand for mass. In the formulas, however, there is mass and charge and therefore m/q MUST be used in this case. Otherwise the whole article is no longer consistent. Please, please look it up. Look up the formulas. There is no way you can have z in those formulas. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 22:21, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

To get something accepted in Wikipedia, you shouldn't prove that it is right, you should prove (with references) that it is considered right by many people. So, a reference needs to be provided which says that m/z is wrong. On the technical side, the article starts by claiming that "The concept of the dimensionless mass-to-charge ratio m/z is a misconception". However, as the IAPUC "orange book" says, <i>m</i> is the mass number, defined as "The sum of the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom, ion or molecule" <a href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/analytical_compendium/Cha12sec2.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iupac.org/publications/analytical_compendium/Cha12sec2.pdf" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, and <i>z</i> is the charge number, "the total charge on an ion divided by the elementary charge (<i>e</i>)." Both are dimensionless, hence <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> is also dimensionless. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 04:04, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not convinced by your technical arguments. Different symbols are used for the same quantity, and the difference between mass/charge and mass-number/charge-number is just a constant factor, so saying that you can only use the former to report the results of mass spectroscopy goes a bit far for me. But more importantly, for the Wikipedia article to be kept we would need at least a reference which says that m/z is wrong. The references you provide only can be used to build an argument that m/z is wrong. To take your 2+2=5 example, of course I know that it's wrong, but if there is a reliable source which says that 2+2=5 and I can't find one which says that it is not 5, then there is no place in Wikipedia for an article on the "2+2=5 misconception". -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 02:34, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>There are two major ways in which the article does not meet these policies at present that I can see. The first is that you need to link to <b>external references</b> that say that 1) m/z is misleading or incorrect, and 2) that do all of the calculations you're doing in the article, or equivalent calculations, in order to include those conclusions or arguments in the article. Otherwise it's "original research". The second is that in order to be "neutral", the article must represent opinions with coverage proportionate to the degree to which they are present in the associated expert communities. Mass spectrometrists are a community relevant to this article, and they apparently think that using the term "m/z" is fine. As far as I can see no attempt has been made to _count_ the number of scientists saying "m/z is bad, use m/q", but in order to have most of the article be a diatrabe against it, you're going to have to show that the number of scientists vocally opposing the use of "m/z" greatly outnumber the mass spectrometrists. This can't be done by hand-waving ("every scientist _should_ oppose"), but by citing bona fide statements and publications and texts and so forth that specifically state, "this is called 'm/z' in mass spectroscopy, and should not be".</dd>

<dd>ok i read it and like, i guess you have a point but my point is this line "This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page." if theres no limit why is mine worth deleting? does that make sense? i'm not trying to be mean anymore, im just asking, like in my eyes its i guess- whats the harm?i do think people will use it for outback, i dont think im promoting my site or myself, if thats it please tell me i will glady take the link and my name off of it. i really don't get why its a big deal that its deleted. its not like "oh let him have his fun" but more like why not? think of it like this- you go to best buy u get the stuff thats mainstream, and thats great. but isnt it a cool feeling going somewhere else that isnt necessarily as good of a store but you can find that rare bloodhound gang cd? i don't know, i guess to me if its not doing any harm then why kill it off? it might actually do good but i guess i have no proof of that so i'm not in a good arguing position.</dd>

<dd>can someone link me or keyword me to where it says i have to be more than just a local based game that's in the news or something equal to? once again, i'm not trying to be a smarty smarty, but i don't see it. i seriously don't see why not keep it since im not promoting myself- no where in it do i ask for sign ups or hits on my websites. Hits mean nothign to me, just signups and i like to talk in person for signups. so please if someone could hook me up with a link to where it says i have to be 'mainstream/well known' that would be wonderful. sorry for the drama drama, i just took it as an insult and i would really like to keep the article but if being small and local is against the wiki rules then i fold.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../x/e/z/User%7EXezzite_8c31.html" title="User:Xezzite">Xezzite</a> (<a href="../../../x/e/z/User_talk%7EXezzite_1e23.html" title="User talk:Xezzite">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xezzite_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xezzite">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>woot i think i found it for myself " Wikipedia is not a collection of unverifiable speculation. All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred. In particular:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include 2008 U.S. presidential election, and 2012 Summer Olympics. By comparison, the 2028 U.S. presidential election and 2032 Summer Olympics are not considered appropriate article topics because nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research. A schedule of future events may also be appropriate.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, individual items from a predetermined list or a systematic pattern of names, preassigned to future events or discoveries, are not suitable article topics, if only generic information is known about the item. Lists of tropical cyclone names is encyclopedic; "Tropical Storm Alex (2010)" is not, even though it is virtually certain that a storm of that name will occur in the North Atlantic and will turn counterclockwise. Similarly, articles about words formed on a predictable numeric system (such as "septenquinquagintillion") are not encyclopedic unless they are defined on good authority, or genuinely in use. Certain scientific extrapolations, such as chemical elements documented by IUPAC, prior to isolation in the laboratory, are usually considered encyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>Articles that present extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are original research and therefore inappropriate. Of course, we do and should have articles about notable artistic works, essays, or credible research that embody predictions. An article on Star Trek is appropriate; an article on "Weapons to be used in World War III" is not.</dd>

<p>sorry my names not andy stop accusing me of things</p>
<p><br />
you know i can sit here and cry "WP:NOT!!" over and over but again i ask you- quote the specific part that applies to me- i have asked for hours an no one has delivered. I read the terms gentlemen, I see nothing.</p>
<p>i am sorry if this sounds sour but it seems that many of the mods against this article are simply abusing their authority. They think they can say things like "WP:V WP:NOT" and that i will cower down to that. But the thing is, i have read them, please scroll up and read what i have said before you make claims against me. Where in wp not does it say nothing that isn't mainstream? It clearly says nothing not notable about the future which could not even take place- mine is about past, present future, it says no irrelevant history such as - Jon Bon jovi spells his name John now.I am promoting my site? where in this does it say go to my site? should i not link the website that goes with the event? Should I not say who created it? I think knowing why it is called Wills Outback is somewhat important, but if you want the link and my name gone i can take it away. I don't need wikipedia to promote my game, I have done fine without it. I just want wikipedia to be useful. If everything on wiki is google-able then why have wiki? So that people can troll like the information is just a forum? Seriously, take the time and try to find the specific reason why this article should be deleted. I am not andy and i do not like being accused of that, i am trying to argue reasonable, which is more than everyone here can say. Why is that? You do not take the time to read what I have to say. I have heard you loud and clear- WP NOT. I have looked through all the violations and policies and I see nothing against a small, local event/union of people. How can this be a flaw when there are articles out there COMPLETELY wrong? And if your answer is "well who looks at the vampire counts article anyways?" my answer is, well me, and if its obsolute then why doesn't it get petitioned to be deleted? Just because I am from no large corporation or business why am I being bullied by wikistuds? Think about what you are doing, and if I see someone say WP NOT one more time im going to scream, QUOTE IT WITHIN THE WP NOT POLICY thank you, i have quoted what i have found I wish people would stop posting to post and actually look into what they are doing. Thank you</p>
<p>Another question, do moderators know what they are talking about or do they just know letters? Has anyone read WP:NOT? seriously, I am for the success of wikipedia as much as you are, I think wiki is a great idea that's why i'm fighting so hard to use it. But wiki isn't going to work if people don't take time to read the rules and when someone asks for the specifics you give them more general letters that mean squat unless you read them. I don't know why I am being accused of things or why I am being bullied around, I guess this is how you treat new users? I am asking for a clear definition of the policy that says Outback shouldn't be there. I've heard 'promotion' and according to the deletion petition it says we are supposed to work on getting the article into WP form, well, what can i change to make it not promotion? I mean for it to be informative, do you want my URL or name off? I will glady do that if it means keeping the article. Please stop accusing me of things and basically binding me to intentions that are not mine. Again, I recruit through talking in person, on the phone, via networking through friends. I don't need Wiki for that, please realize this. Yes, I have only had 38 people, but I have only had 4 games so far, it isn't like I'm using wiki to exploit it. I have my own website if I need to show people a link. It's just really frusterating because no one seems to listen to me- tell me specifically what in WP:not am i violating and if everyone agrees that I'm promoting then what can I do to fix it? It just seems like you guys don't care, you just want to say deleted because you do not understand the magnitude that is Outback. Maybe if I just wait someone who is not lazy will put the effort into getting the answers I long for. And if you think I'm asking too much, then why have wiki? Why have a website only a select few can add to? You guys are really missing the point.</p>

Dear Kinu, Seriously, if you are a moderator of Wikipedia you are a horrible spokesman. You did nothing to contribute to this discussion but label me with things I am not. Made up in a school day? How about you fuck yourself, if this is what wikipedia is fuck you. Do you feel tough that you can type in a few letters? A school day, wow, I would love LOVE to see you try to make something half as good. I don't care, label me for cussing and 'hatred', fuckin ban me, if moderators are pieces of shit like this I don't care. If you want to verify wills outback i have a lot of sources you can talk to, not just chump moderators who do it for no pay, but people who are somebodies. But I mean, if that's how you want to be it's cool, I made this up at school one day and it's basically like a flag football game. No it didn't take hours and hours and hours to plan, more hours to set up and a shit ton of thinking and work on my part. I am just a young chump. Abuse your power kinu! I thought I could use this for what wikipedia said it was- to discuss what was wrong, not to say NO. But no one cares, no one wants to work things out. I guess that's why you are moderators, too lazy for a job that requires work and dedication so you click buttons and eat butterfingers all day. Well, I probably will be banned from wiki soon for this post, but I know I am going out with my head high and in the right. Bully me more, bully all the people who had dreams of creating something more than just a chump school game. This isn't senior pranks, a game of assassins, this is a game that requires more intelligence that any moderator could possess. I asked for reasons, you gave me letters....thanks. The letters were good at first but then I replied saying I wanted specifics and I just got more letters. Well it sucks guys, I really liked wikipedia, I will be using wiki a little for my next outback, but mostly the warcraft wiki (I don't even know if they are linked with this one &#160;?). But I won't be helping anymore, I know you don't care, but it's sad. Wiki should be about getting information on ANY little thing you want. I hope people don't trust too much in here, when I saw the mistakes on that article earlier today I actually laughed out loud for how wrong they were. Liches btw, are not the same as necromancers, they are actually in different armies and they actually hate each other. I tried to put some insight, information, and book power into an article incase someday some kid wants to read up on his favorite warhammer army. So Wiki, I leave you with this, and I hope you listen... You want me to verify it is all real Kinu? That it isn't a game we just made up at school? You want verification that it's not just a few guys and that it is known in, well, other countries? Well my question for you is...what do you verify? You google things to verify facts? I could make a website called napoleon101edu.org and say that napoleon was a homosexual who lost in waterloo against the duke of wellington because he was too busy giving oral to thomas jefferson. Is that verification? Would you even go as far to google it? Or just take a bite of your candy bar and say "never heard of it" DELETED? If this is what wikipedia is, well, I hope someday they get enough money to hire experts, I really do. I think this site could be EXCELLENT, but because of lazy bums who assume, label and stereotype me as a young hooligan trying to show off his website, this site will never be more than a forum. I'm sorry for any moderator who did care or tried, but seriously, it's a fucking website, I hope you feel good with the little power you have, I hope when you die you feel good that you could bully a young wikinoob around and not give him a specific reason why he is gone. So consider me a e-freedom fighter fighting for the rights of people to not have assraming dickless lazy pieces of shit moderators tell them what they should and shouldnt have access to. Oh and by the way, keep being experts on Napoleon Dynamite, it's not like everyone has already seen that movie. Keep promoting the movies you find so funny. Sorry for any true wikipedia mod who actually cares. I guess you can't really expect anyone to, it's too easy to say WP:NOT.</p>

Hey this is Xezzite. Thank you Saberwyn, that is exactly what I have been asking for. Hopefully someday soon I will have what it takes to get on Wiki and get my little article going. I was under the impression that it would fly but obviously taking the time out and giving me the reasons I have been looking for. Any suggestions for what I can get for a third party? Someone hinted at newspaper articles or something of that nature, any ideas would be very much appreciated. I understand it may look like I'm just promoting my site so I guess I'll just have to go get some proof like you said. =D</p>

<li>You'd be looking at news articles, reviews by magazines or major websites that deal with this type of project, publications.

The <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> guideline would be of more use to you on the type of material you need than I am on this matter. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 00:22, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree. There are lots of companies with profiles on Wikipedia and many of them are not yet well known to everyone. Isn't the breadth of content one of the key benefits of Wikipedia? What is gained by deleting this article? Is there a concern that people will be outraged by Wikipedia having too much information? Should Wikipedia only be about Britney Spears and McDonalds?

<p>"Hip hop singer" is a misnomer (this is a group of singers from other genres -- mostly R&amp;B and reggae -- who frequently appear on hip-hop songs - which actually would include 70% of all R&amp;B artists, making the selection of artists inherently POV) - and artists who happen to record hip hop music and other genres as well.

<li><b>Delete</b> or merge to unbirth, or merge both this and unbirth to vore. I'd stumbled across these before, and wasn't sure what to do with them, though I had merged soft vore into vore.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Note that your link to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recurrence_time.html" title="Recurrence time">Recurrence timeis</a> not pointing to that article. Note that the Poincare recurrence theorem and Loschmidt's paradox articles pointed out above do not engage into the realm of time. In that respect, they treat this aspect without a deserved depth. Even though those theories are mentioned, the consecuences of reciting them have been obscured. Please check this link: <a href="http://www.theory-of-reciprocity.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.theory-of-reciprocity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theory-of-reciprocity.com/</a> There are many deep corollaries once the acceptance of the validity of the above discussed theories is granted.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The above comment by <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> is little incorrect, I hope that I can clarify. This article - which I was only recently made aware of when attempting to find some avenue to enter into a discussion with this other contributor having left a few comments on their user page - and the AfD are not directly related to the article on <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_Organisation_e000.html" title="Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual Organisation">Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual Organisation</a>. The initial AfDs were proposed by other entirely unconnected contributors. The only connection is the reasonable supposition that 70.119.13.124 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.119.13.124.html" title="User talk:70.119.13.124">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.119.13.124_189d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.119.13.124">contribs</a>) is an adherent of the so called <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University_884e.html" title="Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University">Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University</a> and I can qualify that he/she is promoting their party line.

Believe me, it's been helping me cope with stress for quite some time now. The article could indeed be a tad corrected, with the lists perhaps transformed to some other format in order to make the ToC shorter, but deleting it is not the way to go. Finally, it's a computer game mod; don't expect any serious publications on it as there are hardly any academic monographs of computer games at all.

<p>Highly unmaintainable...in fact, so much so that this article (if it is supposed to be accurate and complete) would have to list literally tens of thousands of songs. Delete as excess, and <i>possibly</i> replace with article on list of singers who frequently collaborate with hip hop artists (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_hip_hop_singers_39f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of hip hop singers">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of hip hop singers</a>. <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 22:37, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't at all understand what type of alchemy this nom hopes to work between two articles that seem entirely unrelated to me. This is a list of hip-hop collaborations as cogently explained in the informative intro. It then lists some of these collaborations. I see no reason for it to list 10,000 collaborations or 100,000 collaborations. I also do not decide an article's merits based on hypothetical postulations about what may or may not take place in the distant editing future. The concept here seems valid based on the importance of collaborative projects in this genre. The article maybe need some clean-up, perhaps adding whatever this nom wants to add concerning singer-hip hop collaborations, but not deletion. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:35, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Deleting the article would be utter nonsense, simple as that. It is very enjoyable and significant, and I cannot see any reason to delete it. Once its coding is standardized, it will be easy to maintain, especially after I add Christian hip hop collaborations. This may seem a bit rude, but aren't there better ways to remedy boredom than marking fine articles for deletion? <sup><font size="2">|<b>phantasy phanatik</b>|<a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhantasy_Phanatik_518a.html" title="User talk:Phantasy Phanatik">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Phantasy_Phanatik_516a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Phantasy Phanatik">contribs</a>|</font></sup></li>

<li>Split and Merge if the page proves itself unmaintainable or the deletion wins the vote and people are thinking on a third solution. Just wondering how others can disrespect such a big ammount of others' work. Merging it into pages that are accessible from the main artist's article (a "50 Cent list" for 50 Cent and so on) would easly make sceptics' anxiety dissappear. But unless someone does this NEW big ammount of work&#160;:</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> would be the ideal decision. Why is it a huge problem if a page consists of lists (and maybe <i>of lists only</i>)?? Why is it so important to be maintainable and up-to-date (there are way too many articles that would require daily editing and gets one edit per month...and doesn't get deleted just because of that)? If this list are left unmodified in this stage it would serve its purpose like this. And why people are so afraid of lists and list-heavy articles? What's the matter with an incomplete list that keeps growing permanently, like every unclosed list do??(BTW the <i>incomplete list tag</i> exhorts the readers to add new info if possible) <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi">Lajbi</a> 01:50, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I just used it to research a freelance article, as I often do with the less mainstream entries in Wiki. Articles like this are invaluable for getting direction. Please don't delete just because it grosses some people out, or sounds unbelievable -- it is real, I have heard of it, and I could never find reliable info on it anywhere but in a place like Wiki!
