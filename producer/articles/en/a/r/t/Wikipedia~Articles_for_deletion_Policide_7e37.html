<dd>Since when is the Urban dictionary a reliable source? The other sources you quote don't support the content of the article at all. The article gives a very narrow view on the Arab-Israeli conflict. I won't call such articles pro-Israel, because these sort of extremist/paranoid viewes are hurt Israel too. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 12:52, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since always, policide is a generally used word <a href="http://www.google.co.il/search?q=%22policide%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:he-IL:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.il/search?q=%22policide%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:he-IL:official" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> common and encyclopedic. It has nothing do with paranoia and in fact doesn't focus only on the Israeli Arab conflict, and there are other examples and historic ones which can be expanded. It's a scientific definition. The comments all support what policide is - destruction of a state - all very explicit and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> + <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.

<dd>Then why does the article only mention an alledged intention to destroy the state of Israel and not the many cases where this has actually happened? I'm sorry, but if I write a new article on the Atomic bomb and only write about Iran's (alledged) intentions to use it against Israel (e.g. "An Atomic Bomb is a powerful weaopn under consrtruction in Iran with the purpose of wiping Israel off the map...")then that article should be promptly deleted. The fact that there exists such a thing as an atomic bomb and that it is encyclopedic etc. is then not relevant. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 13:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's nothing "alleged" about this intention as the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> show. The destruction of Israel is of course <b>the classic modern example of intended policide</b> - <i>note that this policide might be justified per other arguments</i>, this is not a POV statement but a factual one. Article was just created and other examples can be added. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 13:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AFAIK, Israel hasn't been destroyed. Tibet, perhaps has been destroyed. If this article were made NPOV, then the Arab-Israeli conflict would become a mere footnote. You'll get an article that you didn't intend create. Articles should be on specific topics, not as tools to be used to promote propaganda on other articles as you did on the Hezbollah and Hamas pages. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 13:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up. Per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">Wikipedia's guidelines on neologisms</a>, articles about neologisms must be able to show, at a minimum, that (1) reliable secondary sources discuss the <i>usage</i> of the term, rather than simply using the term, and (2) that use of the term is sufficiently wide-spread as to render it notable. Google books shows 29 published books using or discussing the term,<a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=policide&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=policide&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, almost all of which are the use currently discussed by the page, and google scholar show 39 hits,<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=policide&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=policide&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, about 2/3 of which refer to the term in an engineering context, and 1/3 are the polysci.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Seems like a pure POV nomination with little attempt at good faith editing.

<li><b>Delete</b> the article remains primarily an attempt to apply the term to the Israeli-Plastinian conflict. I would support a keep if the focus was on the concept rather than the application, or if the application examples were balanced, but this still reads as a POV article. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 19:49, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>At this point, I would recommend <i>not</i> splitting them, because (1) per <a href="../../../l/e/n/WP%7ELENGTH_908f.html" title="WP:LENGTH">wikipedia's length guidelines</a> the combined article isn't very long; (2) frankly, unless there is better sourcing, the engineering term isn't sufficiently sourced to survive an AFD vote on its own, because I couldn't find a reliable source identifying when and how the engineering term was coined; but (3) I think the existence of the engineering use is relevant and relatively notable within the context of an article about the poli sci use; and anyway (4) the paragraph about the engineering use doesn't make the article distracting or confusing, and it adds some verifiable and encyclopedic information. If future editors expand one or both sections to the point where the article gets too long, however, that would be a good place to split. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 22:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"<b>Using XfD as a "protest strategy" in an editorial or NPOV debate is generally an abuse of process and the article will usually be speedy kept</b>".

<dd>Utter nonsense. There is nothing political about this AFD. The article in its original version was so nonsensical that it should have been speedily deleted. I did mention POV issues but actually the core of the problem was something else. As I mentioned above, the problem was related to POV issues on other articles about the Mid East.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's like someone starting an article on an in principle legitimate topic like the Atomic bomb for the sole purpose of making propaganda by writing that "an atomic bomb is an extremely power full weapon that the Arabs want develop in order to wipe Israel off the map". Putting such articles on AFD is not an abuse of wiki policies at all. Such articles are sort of "POV Forks" that according to wiki policies can be speedily deleted. In this case the situation was more complicated because the the topic itself in in principle legitimate but it was used as a POV FORK nontheless.</dd>
