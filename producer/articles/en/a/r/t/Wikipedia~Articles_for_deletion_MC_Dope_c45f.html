Nothing is wrong with promotion! You know why? Because its everywhere! Advertisements, commercial, newspapers, movies, everywhere! I beleive i have the right to have this page.

<li>&#160;:: You clearly cant even state another reason why to delete it. Instead you just go, "i agree with this guy". Wikipedia wouldnt even be what it is if no one made unknown articles on here. How do we even know some of you hate rap and just want to delete it because of that? Or maybe you have something against mexicans? And i am not stating an issue over race right now, but some of you exceed your own rights on this website so dont even act like youre the innocent.

<li>Well, if you want an article here at Wikipedia, it needs to follow the guidelines for Wikipedia. This article, as has been demonstrated here, fails to do this. To be blunt, ranting about it and demanding what you think you are entitled to is not going to change our minds - providing a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> article with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> claims will, and following the guidelines about <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">music</a> would be a big plus. If you can't do this, my&#160;!vote stands. If you feel otherwise and it gets removed, take it to deletion review. This is a procedure that everyone using Wikipedia must follow, and there are no exceptions to this policy. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:42, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Simple answer: no. More complex answer: we're pretty much trying to maintain a standard here, and while those rules are a bit on the stringent side on the surface, said rules give that standard a basis - so in short, there's a method to the madness. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 22:09, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes thats true. But you guys can have that right to delete anything offensive, like i said before. If theres anything claiming that type of stuff on their page, it has the right to be deleted. And for the garage bands thing, that would be good for the website. It could show which ones are in what area of the city, country, etc. And some people have heard of small ones that are just performing at fairs, and maybe they ant to know more about the band. And some people cant afford to make their own websites, and basically if this is a free encyclopedia, they would at least put up their page right here while trying to makeing their own and they would eventually delete this one. Just give everyone a chance. And if somebody keeps overdoing their rights, they lose the privelage of making anything at all or everyone loses it instead and it goes back to the way it was in the beginning. What have you guys got to lose? I know that before maybe you guys had that feeling to promote a little something when you started this yourself. And since you couldnt, instead you just stuck with the rules. Like everyone says, rules are made to be broken. Whats the danger in doing that right now? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.83.6.10 (<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User_talk%7E75.83.6.10.html" title="User talk:75.83.6.10">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.83.6.10_8a8e.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.83.6.10">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>I certainly acknowledge that we have a clause about <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignoring all rules</a>, and certainly you're right - rules are definitely made to be broken. But this is one of those cases that would violate the spirit of that link. To respond point by point to you, though: Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not censored</a>, so offensive material will be found. Garage bands and the like must still adhere to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and therein <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> comes into play too. Making a website is easy - HTML is not hard, and there are sites that let you publish for free; Wikipedia is not such a site, it is not a means for a band to get their name out. What we have to lose is the integrity that we continually strive to maintain, and by allowing advertisements of this fashion, we lose that integrity. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 20:14, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
