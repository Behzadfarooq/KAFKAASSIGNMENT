<li>The independent sources present, as noted by others here, are weak even after the rewrite. We have one newspaper blog and one article which only mentions the subject in passing.</li>
<li>Consensus as expressed in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> as well as in this discussion therefore is to delete the article pending more substantial coverage by reliable independent sources.</li>

<p>I had put up Spiritual Humanism as <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfd_743f.html" title="WP:Afd">WP:Afd</a> but <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Spiritual_Humanism_8983.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spiritual Humanism">it became speedily deleted instead</a> causing the Afd to be closed. It was already recreated and rewritten with more links and some comments on the talk page. I think it is still just as much an Afd (see also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Spiritual_Humanism_8983.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spiritual Humanism">arguments for earlier Afd</a>):<br />
After the recreation and rewriting, I can only find links that either don't work (e.g. claim of number of members on its own site, blank page from newspaper archive) or written by the organization or its clergy (even <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1165737241.html?dids=1165737241:1165737241&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+21%2C+2006&amp;author=Victor+S.+Navasky&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.23&amp;desc=I+married+my+daughter" class="external text" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1165737241.html?dids=1165737241:1165737241&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+21%2C+2006&amp;author=Victor+S.+Navasky&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.23&amp;desc=I+married+my+daughter" rel="nofollow">admitting to have paid for clergy attributes so as to marry his own daughter</a>), besides announcements published in a (same as mentioned for its blank archive) newspaper of marriages in front of such clergyman. Not a word about 'Spiritual Humanism' having been noticed, let alone described and thereby giving a source, outside its own group of adherers. It remains uniquely self-promoting what I consider might be a commercial-religious sect.<br />
The names-dropping in the article is not corroborated by the linked articles.

Note: On the forementioned talk page, someone correctly states a link in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">Humanism</a> article to the group's website exists.

<li><b>Comment</b> As a comparison, consider the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_Church_e3fe.html" title="Universal Life Church">Universal Life Church</a>, a pioneer in the field, which is clearly notable. It was involved in a number of court fights and other public disputes in various states over whether its credentials would be recognized, and as a result a number of media articles specifically on it and its practices were published. These articles satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. This church, on the other hand, doesn't seem have similar evidence that the church specifically is notable. <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">Diploma mills</a>, which supply education credentials on-line with little or no requried preparation, have been regularly deleted unless they show evidence that they are specifically notable diploma mills. See e.g. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colby_Nolan_ca31.html" title="Colby Nolan">Colby Nolan</a>. (When Trinity Southern University granted an Executive MBA to a house cat, the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colby_Nolan_ca31.html" title="Colby Nolan">cat</a> was deemed notable and has an article in Wikipedia, but the university only got a redirect to the cat.) From the sources supplied there doesn't seem to be any evidence anyone has written about this church's history, views, or activities, which don't seem to have any independent notability. The sources show people using it to get a credential enabling them to perform a wedding. But for all the sources establish, maybe they did this for no other reason than that it charges less for the credential than the next brand down in the Google search, or has a more prominent ad, or some other non-notable reason. There doesn't seem to be anything <i>individually</i> notable about this organization from the sources supplied so far. Also, as an example of the need for <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_Church_e3fe.html#New_York" title="Universal Life Church">Universal Life Church#New York</a> section shows New York State court cases suggesting there is a substantial question about the validity of a marriage resulting from this type of ordination in New York; we have no sources to enable people to address such basic questions as what this church does prior which might help people address these issues with respect to this church. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 15:55, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article attempts to establish notability through various articles on weddings and the like in which it is mentioned that the minister belongs to the Church for Spiritual Humanism. <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> requires, at its barest, independently published articles that say enough about the subject to permit <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> and establish <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. A mere passing mention of the church that the minister performing a marriage happens to belong to surely does nothing to establish notability. Officiating at weddings simply isn't a notable activity for a church, it's a routine thing every church does.

<dd>Your link #1 mentions <i>"While clergy still perform most weddings, the ceremonies are straying ever farther from tradition, reflecting a "do-it-yourself" attitude toward religious nuptials. The minister may be an old friend, a professor or Dad, ordained online for the occasion."</i> It only mentions this particular Church/sect/commerce as 10 or 20x smaller than an apparently similar one. It describes a practice in general (of what I also see this particular 'Church of Spiritual Humanism' to be mainly doing). There could be an interesting NPOV article about this new social practice in which it can be mentioned as an example —but no article on that still unnotable example— and not present it as if it were a noteworthy 'religious and philosophical movement'.<br />
Your link #2 indeed mentions this "Church" by demonstrating it to lure people into an innocent rather funny wedding practice and then without their knowledge or consent abusing and possibly damaging their name for its own self-publicity; exactly what I see as a good reason for not to allow further abusing Wikipedia. [I already had removed the link from the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Template%7EHumanism_3c48.html" title="Template:Humanism">Template:Humanism</a> that occurs in a few dozen articles.]<br />
Your link #3, from a relatively obscure source, depicts the story of an otherwise totally unnotable man who became a Church of Spiritual Humanism clergyman to feel a bit more important himself but neither takes it very serious nor performs clergy practices: good for him but it shows the 'clergyman' not be be specifically religious or philosophical and not even as participating in Church community practices - if such would exist, no sign of that or of a 'movement' so far.<br />
Good research, and appreciating your current edits to the article, but if some of the content is to be kept or recreated, it must carry a more general title and describe this recent evolution in wedding practices etc, including criticism on dubious practices as false suggestions of a religious-philosophical movement and unadmitted usage of people's name. (Avoid <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, e.g. by your above links). Only in case 'Spiritual Humanism' would succeed in becoming sufficiently notable (one way or another not unlikely seeing its efforts), its article content might rather compare with the one on as forementioned 10 to 20x larger but possibly equally sized <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_9762.html" title="Universal Life">Universal Life</a>, which could be an Afd as well as it has no source except one <a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=Schmid+%22Churches,+Sects,+Religions%22+-wiki+-wikimedia+-wikipedia+-wikimiki&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.be/search?q=Schmid+%22Churches,+Sects,+Religions%22+-wiki+-wikimedia+-wikipedia+-wikimiki&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">untraceable</a> "book" (though <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/survey/zq.htm#001209a" class="external text" title="http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/survey/zq.htm#001209a" rel="nofollow">this lecture</a>/<a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/WIR/wir5-35.html" class="external text" title="http://www.xenu.net/archive/WIR/wir5-35.html" rel="nofollow">same (cf.Switzerland)</a> I think to be the real source) and the topic's own website; note that neither 'Church' is mentioned in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">NRM</a>. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_19.html" title="Jan 19">19 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 06:28&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Of course the article could use improvement, it is practically a stub. There is a bias on the part of some editors against religious humanist organizations and some of the movement to delete is motivated by their efforts to promote "propper" humanism (i.e. secular humanism). I have run into similar hostility on several occasions when editing artilces in the humanist subject area. Maintaining NPOV also means including articles on topics that represent all points of view. <a href="../../../2/c/t/User%7E2ct7.html" title="User:2ct7">2ct7</a> 01:38, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please remember to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. My vote was only on the notability of the subject. I've never heard of spiritual humanism before today, and have nothing against the organization. It's simply not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough for a Wikipedia article. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 02:23, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And precisely this kind of article and as I see it, this particular topic and its methods (which had caused an administrator to speedily delete upon my earlier proposal as normal AfD), do not do well for the reputation of proper religious humanism. Yes we've met on another talk page and I assume you kind of fell for Spiritual Humanism. So prove notability and try rewriting the article in a NPOV style providing decent sources from outside the topic's circles. And if it would really be about religious humanism, instead of for instance a society picking a wish-wash name that can attract as many people as possible without putting any demands regarding religion or humanism, hoping for the-more-the-merrier financial contributions for clergy 'attributes' and using Wikipedia for promotion, show so in that properly sourced and NPOV article; that goes for the claim of (already) being a 'movement' as well. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_20.html" title="Jan 20">20 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 04:22&#160;(UTC)</span>

<ul>
<li>Not name-calling, the derogatory depicting of the <i>topic</i> of the article is nicely formulated in my first AfD and whatever I could find before putting it up as such, could not at all take away the possibility. WP appearing to be used for self-promotion or for such purpose by adherers, makes it WP business. With that in mind, knowing 2ct7 to have spoken favorable about the topic before and to have recreated the article, saying that he 'fell for it' is WP:AGF and my true opinion. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_20.html" title="Jan 20">20 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 04:45&#160;(UTC)</span></li>
<li>Sorry if my posts were uncivil. The overly aggressive nature of many of secular humanist editors has left me on the defensive, especially after the speedy delete of this article which allowed no discussion. Since the subject of financial contributions has come up, let me mention a few facts about the IHEU who's secular promotions and official opinions and positions are forever dominating the Humanism related articles. The IHEU is more of commercial business then the Church of Spiritual Humanism. "Votes" on their official positions are bought and paid for. The more money your organization pays for its membership the more votes you get. You cannot become an individual member of the IHEU without paying £33 / $60 / €50 a year. Since the Humanist individuals and organizations that cannot or refuse to pay are not allowed to vote the IHEU can never represent the opinions and positions of all and probably even most Humanist. The editors that are most aggressively promoting secular humanism over religious humanism also incorporate the IHEU's agenda when editing. The secular official positions of the IHEU are bought and paid for and should not be used as the standard by which judge what is Humanism and what is not. The general tone of the articles in the Humanism subject area unduly favors secularism over religious humanism. I have to wonder if Spiritual Humanism paid the IHEU to become a member organization if this article would be facing deletion.<a href="../../../2/c/t/User%7E2ct7.html" title="User:2ct7">2ct7</a> 16:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><span style="color:#F00000"><b>Nominator's update</b>:</span> The article including improvements by <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> (see his 'weak keep' above), and during the last few hours having been further improved by myself (follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spiritual_Humanism&amp;diff=101733831&amp;oldid=101730125" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spiritual_Humanism&amp;diff=101733831&amp;oldid=101730125" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> by consecutive 'Newer edit' to see what was done and why), appears to me now to have become sufficiently NPOV and reasonable to other WP guidelines, and it may be argued that one <i>article</i> by a Washington Post staff writer on the newspaper's web shortly mentioning the Church of Spiritual Humanism and one by a Chicago Tribune columnist on that newspaper's web log, demonstrate it to have become slightly noticed. Nevertheless, I have the clear impression that the Church has been noticed for its wedding ceremonies <i><b>only</b></i>, and <i><b>not at all</b></i> for its claimed 'religious and philosophical movement'. It appears best to <b>maintain the article</b> but to <b>move it</b> towards the title <b>'Church of Spiritual Humanism'</b> at least until it could be shown that the claimed movement itself would have become <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotable_e66c.html" title="WP:Notable">WP:Notable</a>. In fact, 'spiritual humanism' is not quite a coined term but the adjective and substantive have been associated in a much broader context, e.g. in <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D71430F937A15754C0A96E948260" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D71430F937A15754C0A96E948260" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.— <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_21.html" title="Jan 21">21 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 03:43&#160;(UTC)</span> — Meanwhile, 'Spiritual Humanism' appears to be a trademark, see article. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_22.html" title="Jan 22">22 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 03:37&#160;(UTC)</span><br />

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Despite the rewrite, the references are still <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">too trivial</a> to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. It appears that anyone can become an ordained minister to officiate weddings. Compared with <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_Church_e3fe.html" title="Universal Life Church">Universal Life Church</a>, which has the same business model, churns out some half a million free and instant ordinations a year on average, the Church of Spiritual Humanism which performs an estmated 20,000 ordinations per annum, doesn't even come close. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't feel quite happy about only a large outfit getting further attention on WP and thus putting a competing more recent and thus smaller but otherwise fully equivalent outfit in deeper and continued disadvantage. This could be a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> versus <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issue, but <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_Church_e3fe.html" title="Universal Life Church">Universal Life Church</a> (not to be confounded with <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_9762.html" title="Universal Life">Universal Life</a>) is not exactly as notable as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> or as the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. Perhaps an 'Ordination mill' article should be created (like <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">Diploma mill</a>) and <i>all</i> titles fitting that shoe should redirect to it; after all ULC appears only notable for its law-suits related to being an ordination mill, and in an anglo-saxon Law system their outcome create precedents with equal consequences for CoSH. I would change my 'weak keep' vote towards this, but am not a candidate to try moving ULC towards 'Ordination mill' (in which CoSH should be mentioned much more shortly, currently available sources easily allow this). — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_22.html" title="Jan 22">22 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 04:00-04:11&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Open to reconsideration if independent sources covering the church as a principle subject are demonstrated per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, but this just hasn't occurred so far. I don't believe articles casually mentioning the church as the place someone got an ordination credential is inherently notable, just as articles mentioning the institution where <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colby_Nolan_ca31.html" title="Colby Nolan">Colby Nolan</a> obtained an educational credential were found not to make that institution notable. Other churches in the genre that have articles, like the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_Church_e3fe.html" title="Universal Life Church">Universal Life Church</a>, have gotten substantial independent press coverage, court cases, etc. to bolster their claim to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> Nothing like that has been shown here. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 21:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One <i>article</i> on the Chicago Tribune's weblog by a proper columnist of that newspaper specifically on this particular Church, and the <i>article</i> in the L.A. Times in the section 'Main news' (see the url in reference) by the ex-editor of a different newpaper (The Nation), supported by a minor mentioning in an <i>article</i> in the Washingon Post about the practices of a few institutions as this Church, might not make this Church the biggest thing since powdered milk [paraphrasing <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budgie_%28band%29.html" title="Budgie (band)">Budgie</a>], still it has been noted nation-wide — well enough for a short WP article, as I see it.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> New sources have been added from articles reporting a trend in do-it-yourself weddings in which an individual receives a no-requirements ordination from an on-line ordination mill. The difficulty here is that the articles just don't appear to say anything much about the church (and don't seem to pay much attention to it); it just seems to be listed as the place a blogger happened to pick to get his on-line ordination or casually mentioned in discussing a trend. This church/movement needs an article or two in mainstream media <i>specifically on it</i> as at least a major if not primary subject. If they exist it's notable and <b>Keep</b>. Otherwise not and <b>Delete</b>. The standard is objective, it makes no difference whether one agrees or disagrees with its beliefs and practices. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 04:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Could supporters identify a couple of sources -- the best sources -- and explain why they demonstrate notability? There are a now a number of marginal-looking sources. Perhaps a direct approach would cut through the rough and help us see the diamond. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 04:47, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
