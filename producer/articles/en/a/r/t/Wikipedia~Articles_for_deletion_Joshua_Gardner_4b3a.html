<li><b>Keep</b>, as per Kman, also this is encyclopedic because the use/abuse of the Internet (including Wikipedia) was so widely documented and the deception lasted so many months. This has become a somewhat notable case of Internet identity fraud (of which there is a lot) in the early 21st century.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I know, this AFD is doomed to failure, but I voted to delete Brian Chase as well so I might as well be consistent. There are thousands of offenders like Gardner who we wouldn't think twice about deleting, and just using Wikipedia to do something ill does not bring a person closer to meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:25, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: for me, the (minor) Wikipedia angle doesn't even enter into its notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>, news mentions doesn't automatically mean that a subject should be in an encyclopedia, though it can be used as an indicator. This is a news story that will be forgotten in time. A Wikipedia article should be relevant for a much longer period of time than a newspaper or magazine article. I'm sure there have been similar situations a decade or two ago that no one remembers. If it is kept for reasons specific to Wikipedia (showing its benefits and such), it should not be in the article namespace because such a rationale indicates that it is not encyclopedic, but <b>advertising</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The nom wrote at great length their <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/stevertigo/444.html" class="external text" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/stevertigo/444.html" rel="nofollow">reasoning</a>, but failed to give just one good reason for deletion. Its fairly obvious the person is now notable. Also, it seems the noms principal reason, is they their sympathy for Gardner. Apparently he has some problem with "<i>an arbitrary age milestone</i>" in laws regarding consent for sex, which is a POV the nom is entitled to, but shouldn't be used to justify the deletion of an article. We do properly have articles on people who have criminal convictions for things that some of their supporters don't think should be labelled as criminal. Finally, it's not our role to decide which persons, and which events should be deemed notable. Rather, we are to find what has deemed notable. That's a key distinction. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:38, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree that notability may be a standard, and in that regard, it may be better that we simply have an article which actually explains both sides of the issue. Still, it seems that deferring to either a local label or to mere news notablity is huge problem, when those labels can be so variable, when news notability can be so baseless. Putting the both of them together doesnt make it any moreso 'notable' nor encyclopedic. (There's Wikinews though, too.) For example, the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_kidnapping_5fe8.html" title="Elizabeth Smart kidnapping">Elizabeth Smart kidnapping</a> was once named Elizabeth Smart (kidnapping victim). The issue then was to disambiguate from an author (IIRC) and that Smart (then only 13) wasnt herself 'notable', and only the kidnapping was. I objected strongly because it seemed ridiculous to make an article about a person and then prejudice it of a sorts with a label of 'kidnap victim'. The person is a <i>person</i>, and though they may be notable for being a 'kidnap victim', thats not in fact what they <i>are</i> —especially someone only 13 who's got a whole life ahead of her. The same thing goes for someone only 22, who has carried the label of being a 'sex offender' since he himself was only a teenager. Minnesota AOC is apparently only 16 years, which makes the label even weaker. Even though its not in the article <i>title</i>, the very existence of the article seems to be more dependent on the label of 'sex offender' than the actual offense. The damn thing (as its written) doesnt even phrase it according to NPOV ("according to the state of Minnesota, Gardner..."), or to even mention that the AOC is only 16. Amateur writing at best. I suppose it <i>could</i> be a good thing to keep it, as a good example of a ridiculous abuse of justice. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 16:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just out of curiosity, what are you people's ages? Ive seen two or three responses from users who are only teenagers. Combining this fact with the fact that many responses are simply claiming that <i>if its on the news, its encyclopedic</i>, I'm not sure if high school kids are really capable of understanding the difference between what local news outlets consider news (i.e. a chimpmunk waterskiing) and what's actually encyclopedic. While notablity is a genuine factor, 'he made the Today Show' is not. Wondering who here is unclear on the difference. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 16:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No offense, but I don't think it is appropriate. As per my comments above, it is advertising in the main namespace under the guise of an encyclopedia article, if the reason the article is kept is because it involves Wikipedia, especially how Wikipedia "helps". The article should be kept or deleted on its merits alone, not its association with Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:43, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No way. How the heck did this help the world? They guy wasn't comitting a crime, just violating his probation. I think the whole thing is a black eye for everybody. Just because some Junior Spies used Wikipedia to finger some poor schmuck doesn't mean we should crow about it. On the contrary it makes a point for <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>'s contention that Wikipedia is a way to air out anyone's dirty laundry on a very high-traffic site. Criminal or no, this guy is not a public figure, and the idea that citizens can have low-profile lives, make low-profile mistakes, and have low-profile private sorrows is not something that I would throw away. No, this is something that Wikipedia should hope best forgotten. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
