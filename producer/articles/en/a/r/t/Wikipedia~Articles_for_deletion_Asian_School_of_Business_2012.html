<li><b>Comment</b> This really isn't a "school", it's an unaccredited business college and that's a messy area. Counting the clippings isn't the only way to make a judgement. This new college only has 100(?) students and there's a concern about advertising this business for its ambitions, not its achievements. I looked at the press coverage and I wasn't convinced by it at first glance - it's launch publicity, it's uncritical, and it's not in-depth; though I accept that they include bylined items in serious newspapers. If we imagine the college closing today, would it be worth an encyclopedia article on any grounds?? (except comprehensive coverage of all business colleges in India!) Would it be notable in the enduring record of the field? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 08:26, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's the reason I've not voted Keep yet. If it is accredited or recognized, I will vote Keep, but there is no indication of that. News coverage is mostly due to NRIs supporting the college. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As long as the college has generated verifiable sources for itself, what difference does it make if it's an accredited school or not?

I have no idea what the accreditation regime is like in India, but the fact that a school is accredited does not make it notable, and the fact that a school is not accredited does not make it non-notable.

<p><b>weak keep</b> almost full keep. The sources all seem to be more about what the school will be when built and don't have much in the way of detail. However, since the school is sourced in a wide geographic area and has enough data to write a decent size stub, I'm inclined to keep. (and if anyone cares, I think it passes criterion 1 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:32, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> If anyone recognises my name from other school afds, they'd be stunned by my suggestion it be kept but this one actually deserves to be included. It needs many things added to it to make it an encyclopedia article and not an advertising run, and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, but all that said I think any (attempt at a) world class post-graduate school of management built for $3.6m in a developing country is notable. India has a veritable tsunami of schools of cautious notability outside of India but I don't think this is an example due to the hubub it caused. It's unaccredited but I imagine a lot of Indian schools don't have the same accreditation standards as schools in developed countries and generally across the world business colleges are less likely to be accredited then other similar institutions. Per a couple of comments by people about it being ambitious rather than established, I agree, but it's VERY ambitious. Consider if a plan was afoot and the groundwork laid for a 2000 storey tower made out of diamonds in Australia, it's not established rather ambitious, but boy is it ambitious! Therefore it'd be worthy of an article. I think this is the same sort of thing.<b><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•E<span style="background:#206">l<span style="background:#504">om<span style="background:#702">i<span style="background:#a00">s•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 23:07, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
