Kurt J. Hinterbichler is a revolutionary young artist in the avant-garde scene. His artwork challenges the established foundation by presenting objects, shapes, notions, and ideas in the simplest abstract visual form. Many of his works, such as the crayon on paper work entitled "Squarz", present conflicting emotions and provide its viewers with multiple abstract interpretations. Perhaps his greatest work of all is "Tik Tak To", which expresses the notion that nothing in life really matters in the longrun; life is just a simple game. However, one must understand that life must be lived by focusing on the joyful and happy moments, not the meaninglessness of it. This crayon on paper drawing is a simple expression of this groundbreaking concept. Perhaps Hinterbichler's deepest and most meaningful work is "Opprobrium: A Study in Paradoxical Magnanimity", a poster paint on canvas work. Kurt Hinterbichler's artwork is characterised by representing complex, yet sometimes conflicting concepts, with simple visual representations that can be analyzed a multitude of ways.</p>

<p>The coolest and hottest piece of man ever created was born 4/20/1991. He was proclaimed a genius by several child psycologists and has excelled in everything he has ever done. He is a quiet man, but has an amazing sense of humor. He was knighted in 1998 for discovering a cure for Typhoid. When he was 10 he decided he wanted to live a normal life, so he left the Germanian institue for Excellerated learning to finish his schooling in a public school. He has tried to keep his amazing intelligence somewhat of a secret, but has had his slip ups Many girls have fallen victim to his charm and whitty humor. He turns on the charm and no girl, or woman can resist. He has never had an intimate relationship to stop people from truly finding out who he is. I hope he will not be mad and will accept that he is the most intelligent man ever to walk the planet</p>

<p>Scaggsville is a rapidly growing suburban community located within Howard County, MD. It is located within 20 miles of Baltimore and Washington DC, which provides residents with access to many cultural resources that many do not find so readily available. The town itself, which technically falls within the North Laurel postal code (20723) and is usually classified as part of the city of Laurel, although all residents know better. Scaggsville is dominated by single-family homes with relatively little commercial activity, although a recent influx of businesses has begun to change that situation. Local enterprises include a miniature golf course, driving range, gas stations (BP and Citgo), and a variety of restaurants and delis. The attractions of nearby towns Columbia or Laurel are within a 10-minute drive for when the town's residents have exhausted their rather limited resources for entertainment. The town does have it's own grocery store, a franchise of the national chain Bloom. Bloom replaced the Food Lion that occupied the same building in the past month, and is an upscale store, with high-end products for the more sophisticated taste, although basic necessities can still be found. Given the high price of real-estate and general affluence of Howard County, it is not surprising that Scaggsville is populated mostly by the upper-middle class, primarily Caucasian, although minority groups are not unheard of. Scaggsville is home to two churches, Roman Catholic and non-denominational, although religious life does not play a particuarly large part in daily life. There is a synogogue in nearby Fulton, although there are no facilities nearby for followers of the Muslim faith. The town's children attend one of three schools located in the town, either Fulton Elementary School, Lime Kiln Middle School, or Reservoir High School. The high school plays a large part in Scaggsville life, hosting sporting events, music competitions, and a large number of other functions. Reservoir is in high demand for such events owing to the modernity of the school, having opened only 5 years ago. Generally, Scaggsville contains no groundbreaking developments, but it is a respectable and prosperous town in a surprisingly interesting community.</p>

<p>House's Season 3 started with the episode, "Meaning". In it, you'll find that House has recovered from the surgery and could walk without the aid of his cane. In short, House takes on two cases, instead of the usual one. One was a girl losing the ability to move her body below the neck from, apparently, doing yoga, and the other, a middle-aged man that had been paralysed for eight years since his treatment for brain cancer.</p>

<p>EIRPAC is Ireland's packet switched X.25 data network. It replaced Euronet in 1984. Euronet was the first packet switched network service in Ireland which started in 1979 with the DNIC 2723. Eirpac uses the DNIC 2724. HEAnet was first in operation via X.25 4.8Kb Eirpac connections back in 1985. By 1991 most Universities in Ireland used 64k Eirpac VPN connections. Today Eirpac which is owned and operated by Eircom but does not accept new applications for Eirpac. They began the process of migrating existing customers using more capable forms of telecommunications back in late April 2004.</p>
<p>In 2001 Eirpac had approximately 5,000 customers dialing in daily via switched virtual circuit's although those numbers have been declining rapidly. Eirpac is still an important element for data transfer in Ireland with numerous banks (automatic teller machines), telecoms switches, pager systems and other networks that utilise permanent virtual circuit's.</p>
<p>Connecting to Eirpac can be done using a simple AT compatible modem. The dial in number is 1511 + baud rate. So for example to connect at 28,800 bit/s would be ATDT 15112880. The user would then have to authenticate with their Eirpac NUI. The NUI (Network User Identification) consists of a name and password provided by Eircom.</p>

<p>The Arts and Science Undergraduate Society (ASUS) is one of the oldest Student Societies of Queen's University. Founded in November, 1890, the Society has grown exponentially from its humble beginnings. It now represents over 8,000 Arts and Science Students to the Queen's and Kingston Community.</p>
<p>The Society is led by its Executive (a President and Vice President) elected to an annual term by the students of Arts and Science at Queen's University. The Executive appoints five Commissioners who are responsible for various duties within the Society. The ultimate decision making body of the Society is the Assembly which is composed of elected Arts and Science students who meet bi-weekly to discuss issues facing the Society and the broader University.</p>

SCampus, also known as "the SCampus," and "Da SCampus," is a quasi-sexually transmitted disease unique to the University of Southern California's Park Campus. The SCampus is both difficult to detect and to diagnose, as it will not show up on usual blood cultures and screenings for common sexually transmitted diseases and infections. This makes the SCampus a feared but accepted part of university life. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how SCampus is spread, but there is a direct corrolation between contact with an infected subject and the spread of the disease. The length of time spent at the campus is also a factor, as current records show 34% or freshman, 56% of sophomores, 72% of juniors, 95% of seniors, and nearly 100% of graduate students at the university are known to be infected. The symptoms of SCampus vary from individual to individual, but are known to include itching, red, swollen genitals, fever, mental retardation, boils, and tramp stamps.</p>
<p>For more information, a field study is in progress and the results should be posted within a few weeks time.</p>

The origin of the word goes back to the 'Lidcombe Pub', and is now widely used by persons across the sydney metropolitan area.

<p>Bolus is a Thornhill/Toronto-based band focussing on the not-so-common genre of progressive rock. Despite their young age, they always attempt to go the extra step and display a professional level of performance in their work. Nick Karch (guitars, keyboards, lead vocals) and Mat Keselman (drums and percussion, backing vocals) met as they entered grade 9 at Vaughan Secondary School in 2002. Shortly after, they would meet Richard Frankel (bass, bass pedals) who was in grade 12 at the time, and discover each others interests in music. After discussing these interests, the three decided to form a band. Practices would occur a few times each week, and various songs would be covered and original ones would be written. Eventually the band played their first show, a battle of the bands, at Vaughan SS in 2003 (which they placed first in, and again in the following year). It was at the auditions for this show that the name Bolus was chosen. Bolus is a function of Nick Karch's insulin pump that he uses for his diabetes. This name fit the interesting and mysterious image of the band. Once enough songs were created, Bolus decided to put together a recording. In December 2004, Bolus was ready to enter Wit's End Studios to begin recording. In June 2005, recording was completed, making way for mastering and duplication. The album, entitled "Watch Your Step" was released on October 20th 2005, and has been received well by the Bolus fans while creating new fans. The band continues to practice, perform, and write new material, in hopes of reaching new heights in musical output and public response.</p>

<p>Retailers, whether food, non-food or mass merchandisers want to quickly identify revenue and profit opportunities. To achieve this they need specific information like merchandise intelligence (merchandise planning, assortment, size, space, price, promotion, and markdown optimization) and customer intelligence (demographics, market basket analysis).</p>
<p>Traditional Data warehousing (DW) and Business Intelligence (BI) systems are built as generic platform solutions. Retail IT teams need to identify the right tool sets relevant for their organisation, and then stitch them together to meet the analytic requirements of their business managers. This process typically takes 12-18 months and involves managing a host of stakeholders - tool vendors, SI partners, consultants, internal IT, business users and senior management.</p>

<p>ARC's retail specific DW-BI architecture dramatically reduces deployment time, managerial overhead and total cost of ownership, by fundamentally changing the way retailers deploy and maintain their BI infrastructure.</p>

<p>Adlus <a href="http://www.adlus.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adlus.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is a Singapore gay group that promotes sports and outdoor activities in the GLBT (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexuals and Trangender) community in Singapore. Adlus is an acronym and it stands for Adventurers Like Us, the name is a humourous take on the vernacular "People Like Us" or PLUs which refers to gays. Adlus is pronounced "Atlas" after the mythological Greek Titan who held up heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Adlus is a non-profit group run by volunteers and activities are open to all regardless of sexual orientation, nationality, ethnicity or fitness level. Activities are organised by members on the basis of interest and personal commitment and such activities are posted on the website and mailing list for other interested members to join and these eventually form sub-groups categorised by activities of interest. Other activities are also organised by a core group of administrators and these range from social gatherings and events to planned hiking and camping trips to neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>This group was started in July 1999 by a group of friends who were avid sportsmen and divers. In a bid to gather more like-minded people for activities, a mailing list was started for gay sportsmen to keep in touch. As the group grew bigger, a website was started as well to promote sporting and outdoor activities in the GLBT community. Today, it also encourages networking and fellowship among its members and the community. Besides sports and outdoor activities, Adlus also promotes environmental awareness both actively through nature-themed events and during its sporting events. The website also provides updates on major events in the gay scene in Singapore as well as major sporting events in Singapore. It also serves as an information portal for gay sporting events in Singapore.</p>
<p>To date, Adlus has in excess of 1000 members on its mailing list with activities round the year. Regular sporting activities such as running groups, swimming, kayaking, in-line skating are held weekly. Event-based training for certain sports are also organised such as marathon training for the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon in December and biathlons/ triathlons that occur throughout the year. There is also a large following for volleyball, cycling and hiking and camping activities and an increasing interest in activities and sports like wakeboarding, backpacking, adventure races and rockclimbing.</p>

<p>Kunstterrorist was first mentioned in 2004 with series of artworks dedicated to modern destruction and mayhem. The name "Kunstterrorist" originated from the German word Kunst ( Kunst | die Kunst) which stands for "Art" and "Terrorist" which stands for a person, usually a member of a group, who uses or advocates terrorism. In this case, it's Art Terrorism. The german word "Kunst" was used instead the English word "Art" because Kunst sounds more aggresive and stronger.</p>

<p>Kunstterrorist Organisation and Kunstterrorist art has no history, follows or traditions. Kunstterrorist has many dedications. Kunstterrorist is open for any time signature, rhythm, beat, knowledge of melody, contemporaries and above all, art. Kunstterrorist organisation struggle with the dark, and respond to the light. Everything that ever was has run its course. It has all been consumed, traded, downloaded, understood, seen before, sampled, stolen, learned, revived, remixed, judged, optioned, rated and found wanting. Dispense with all previous forms of everything that has been said and start again. Year zero now. Kunstterrorist organisation.</p>

<p>Nearest Neighbour(NN) Rule requires a large amount of memory for storing the sample data and huge computational complexity while tetsing. In Condensed Neighbour (CNN) we have the notion of consistent subset of a sample set. This is a subset which, when used as a stored reference set for the NN rule, correctly classifies all of the remaining points in the sample set. A minimal consistent subset is a consistent subset with a minimum number of elements. Every set has a consistent subset, since every set is trivially a consistent subset of itself. Obviously, every finite set has a minimal consistent subset, although the minimum size is not, in general, achieved uniquely.</p>
<p>Algorithm for CNN rule can be seen in [1]</p>

<p>TINSIDE POOL Point 6 - Tinside Pool Recently re-opened after years of neglect, the Art Deco Tinside Pool is a landmark of seaside architecture. Once a popular venue for beauty competitions, people also used it for washing in during World War II.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bathing in the sea off the foreshore of the Hoe has probably gone on since man first discovered he could swim - but it didn't become formalised until Victorian times.</p>
<p>Leisure time is now taken for granted, but it's a relatively recent phenomenon dating from the 1920s, when the majority of the working population first enjoyed the benefits of reduced working hours and paid holidays.</p>
<p><br />
Tinside Pool following restoration It was around this time that the seaside lido became popular as sea bathing underwent a transformation from a predominantly health activity into a leisure pursuit and through growing interest in the continental obsession with sunbathing.</p>
<p>First opened in 1935 and described at that time as 'one of the finest open-sea bathing centres in the country', Plymouth's Tinside Lido must have been a stunning sight in all its glory. It was built in the fashionable Art Deco style with a classically proportioned semi-circular pool.</p>
<p>The pool was filled with fresh sea water pumped in through three cascades or aerators, giving a complete change of water every four hours. At night the water was floodlit from below and the cascades went through three colour changes.</p>
<p><br />
Beauty competition at Tinside Pool In its heyday the pool was a magnet for people of all ages and many of the city's children have learnt to swim there.</p>
<p>Imagine what it must have been like to swim as an orchestra played above you on the terraces. Or to watch a parade of glamorous women in swimsuits gracefully walk around the pool in one of the many beauty contests that took place there.</p>
<p>During World War II the distinctive shape of the pool proved to be a useful landmark for German bomber pilots trying to get their bearings as they flew over the coast.</p>
<p>For the war weary people of Plymouth it had an altogether different wartime use. The pool was the perfect place to wash off after clearing up the city's bomb ravaged streets.</p>
<p><br />
German bomber pilots used the pool as a landmark Sadly, Britain's lidos fell into decline as a holidaymakers were tempted abroad by cheap package holidays and many were lost forever. Plymouth's almost went the same way and closed to the public in 1992 after suffering years of neglect.</p>
<p>Only a vociferous campaign by local people saved this landmark of seaside architect from an untimely demise.</p>
<p>The pool became a Grade II Listed Building in 1998 and has since been restored to its original 1930s Art Deco glory at a cost of £3.4 million.</p>

<p>The ancient parish of Wormingford on the south bank of the river Stour, 6 miles north- west of Colchester and 8 miles south-east of Sudbury (Suffolk.), covered 2,322 a. (929 ha.). The Stour forms the northern boundary, and the eastern, southern, and western ones follow mainly field boundaries, but sometimes cut through fields. Detached fields totalling 15 acres in Little Horkesley, were transferred to that parish in 1889.</p>
<p>Most of the parish lies on a relatively high plain which drains northwards to the river Stour and southwards to the river Colne. From the Stour the ground rises southwards to reach a height of more than 225 ft. (70 metres) in the south-west. A band of alluvium runs beside the Stour and there are river terrace deposits south of that, then, as the ground rises, bands of London clay, and sands and gravels. Most of the higher south part of the parish is boulder clay, good farming land, with a small pocket of sands and gravels running south-east from Wood Hall. Wormingford Mere of 12 acres is a natural feature formed by the Stour.</p>
<p>The main road from Colchester to Bures and Sudbury (B1508) runs from south-east to north-west across the parish. Minor roads connected the parish with Assington (Suffolk) across Wormingford bridge, with Fordham, and with Little Horkesley and Nayland (Suffolk). Other minor roads and tracks and a network of footpaths link the scattered farms and houses.</p>
<p>The ford from which the parish takes its name (originally Withermund's ford) was probably that over the river Stour by the watermill, at the bottom of Church Road, where there is a sand bank in the middle of the river. A ford further east near Garnons has also been suggested, but seems less likely. The Church Road ford was replaced before 1802 by a bridge, called a horse- bridge in 1812. About 1821 Messrs. Jones, who leased the river tolls, built a new bridge, apparently a narrow wooden footbridge. It collapsed in the winter of 1895-6 and was replaced by an iron bridge in 1898.</p>
<p>The modern form of the place name, recorded from 1254, gave rise to two stories of dragons, (worm meaning serpent or dragon). The first, apparently unsubstantiated, is that a crocodile escaped from Richard I's menagerie in the Tower of London and caused much damage in Wormingford before being killed by Sir George Marney. There is a stained glass window in the local parish church (St Andrew's) which depicts this event. (<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/i.rose/wormingford.jpg" class="external free" title="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/i.rose/wormingford.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/i.rose/wormingford.jpg</a> )</p>
<p>The second, written in 1405 by John de Trokelowe, a monk, told of a dragon who threatened Richard Waldegrave's territory near Sudbury but fled into the Mere when pursued.</p>
<p>A large number of scattered archaeological finds from all periods from the Neolithic suggest that settlement was first on the flood plain along- side the Stour, before woodland on the higher ground further south was gradually cleared. Prehistoric tools were found in the complex of ring ditches and other crop marks near the Mere in the north-west of the parish; when a Bronze- Age barrow nearby was destroyed in 1836 'hundreds of urns in rows' were found.</p>
<p>The artist, John Constable of East Bergholt (1776-1837), had Wormingford associations, his relatives farming at Wormingford Hall and Gernons. John Nash R.A., who lived at Bottengoms, painted in and around the village from 1929 until 1977.</p>
<p><b>Wormingford Air Field</b> Originally a relief airfield for bi-planes in WW1 the airfield was expanded by Richard Costain Ltd and helped by a number of sub contractors during the period 1942/43. Earmarked for an Eighth Heavy Bomb Group, nothing ever came of this and at the end of November 1943 the yet to be completed station was handed to the Ninth Air Force for use by one of its Fighter Groups, and on the last day of November the 362nd Fighter Group arrived at Wormingford. The Group was assigned to the 70th Fighter Wing, however they did not venture out on their first mission until 8th Feb 1944, their operational status at Wormingford was a short one and they left on the 8th April 1994. During their stay the 362nd had mounted over 30 missions, losing five aircraft. The next group to move in was that of the 55th Fighter Group with their P38’s having come from Nuthampstead in Hertfordshire. The 55th role as a fighter group was to be a short one due to some of the disadvantages of the aircraft. However the 55th would later become renowned for ground strafing and ground attack bombing. On D/Day the P-38 groups were given the task of acting as convoy escorts for the armada of ships moving to and from Normandy. The 55th was selected to serve with the occupation forces in Germany and in July 1945 they left Wormingford for Gielbelstadt airfield in Bavaria. The old airfield is now used by the Essex and Suffolk Gliding club for more peaceful forms of flying.

Riley Brown is the single most important figure of all time in the sport of unicycle marathoning. He grew up without a father or mother figure in the orphanarium of East Germany. His father, Adolf Hitler, and mother, Eva Braun, died right after he was created; so, being the lovechild of Germany's last great leader, he is the sole heir to the Third Reich.</p>

<p>A hesher is a stereotype of a male <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal.html" title="Heavy metal">heavy metal</a> fan, traditionally ranging in age from the teens to mid twenties. Heshers are characterized by their long and unkempt hair (but not dreadlocks), skin-tight jeans, high top shoes or motorcycle boots, black t-shirts emblazoned with band names, and possibly tattoos. Frequently heshers wear jackets covered in patches and pins of heavy metal bands, traditionally denim or leather, and possibly without sleeves. The denim vest form of these is called a <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kutten.html" title="Kutten">kutten</a>. Heshers are usually very committed to the metal music scene, and they can often be seen at metal shows. Heshers are frequently the most demonstrative concertgoers at metal shows, choosing to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosh.html" title="Mosh">mosh</a>, stand in front and headbang, and raise the 'devil horns' gesture. Heshers also enjoy smoking marijuana, drinking heavily, and listening to metal from a 'ghetto blaster' in front of convenience stores. Notable heshers in the media include Beavis and Butthead, Bill and Ted of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and especially the young men portrayed in the film '<a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_Metal_Parking_Lot_6635.html" title="Heavy Metal Parking Lot">Heavy Metal Parking Lot</a>'. A variant of the word hesher is the term hessian, which can be simply another name for hesher or it can be an adjective to describe an aspect of metal considered archetypal, such as <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Maiden_6b08.html" title="Iron Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>-esque guitar harmonies or a galloping double bass beat. The use of hessian as an adjective is prevalent in the punk rock scene as well to describe song parts that borrow from metal songwriting techniques.</p>

Arafat at the UN General Assembly</p>
<p><br />
Yasser Arafat's speech to the UN General Assembly, 13 December 1988. Delivered in Arabic.</p>
<p>Mr President and members: It never occurred to me that my second meeting since 1974 with this esteemed assembly would take place in the hospitable city of Geneva. I believed that with the new position and political stands which our Palestinian people adopted during the PNC meeting in Algiers, all of which were announced amid great international appreciation and welcome, it would have been fitting for me to go to UN headquarters in New York to acquaint you with our resolutions and views regarding the cause of peace in our homeland as formulated by our PNC, which is the highest legislative authority in the Palestinian political body.</p>

<p>163.151.2.10 14:45, 6 September 2006 (UTC) Kaan Dellum was born on the planet Corellia. Little is known of his early life. First accounts report Dellum as a pickpocket and thief at such early ages as 9 or 10 years old. It was believed he lost his family when pirates raided his parents space transport. Kaan was spared and at first was kept a prisoner but eventually was given small duties to perform and gained the trust of the pirates until Kaan was old enough to devise his own plan of escape. But not before exacting revenge. Kaan had come into the possesion of a thermal detonator and booby trapped the ship and killed all those aboard. Kaan jettisoned before the craft exploded and drifted to the planet Tatooine. It was there Kaan honed his skills for survival. Kaan developed a reputation as a very skilled space pilot and this got him such jobs as trafficking spice. Befriending Han Solo, the two worked many jobs together for their employer Jabba The Hutt in smuggling the spice across the galaxy. Kaan also collected bounties occasionally for Jabba or whomever else had enough credits to hire him. Kaan had no loyalty to Jabba but his greed for wealth kept him in Jabba's service. Dellum was considered Jabba's top smuggler. Dellum's superior intellect and wit got him out of many sticky entanglements. Losing his parents at such a young age, Kaan developed no ties with his peers and had no friends. He preferred solitude and only dealt with people when necessary. Kaan was a wanted man throughout the galaxy when it was made apparent that he was selling supplies to the rebel alliance but then tipping off the Imperials as to where their secret bases were located within the galaxy. Kaan had developed the reputation of a double-crosser. A secret squadron of rebel fighters tried to intercept Dellum on one occasion but Kaan, who was a superior pilot, was able to outfox them. A cycle which would be repeated many times. Kaan's downfall was his greed though and during one of Jabba's spice runs, Kaan double-crossed the gangster. Dellum was carrying an extremely large shipment and staged his own death by selling his ship to an unsuspecting freighter pilot and then blowing it up by remote. Kaan, thinking Jabba had bought this began selling off the large shipment and gaining a fortune in the process. But Jabba had spies everywhere and one could never be too careful. Word eventually reached Jabba and soon many bounty hunters were scouring the galaxy for Kaan. Feared hunter Boba Fett came the closest to capturing Kaan. During an intense space battle both ships, Fett's Slave I and Kaan's newly aquired and modified Corellian freighter, The Juggernaut were so badly damaged they were both forced to land on the barren moon Tressa I located near Bogden. Fett finally tracked down Dellum into a cave and a firefight ensued. Fett injured Dellum with a series of concussion grenades which buried Dellum deep within the cavern. Leaving him for dead, Fett re-claimed the rest of the spice aboard Dellum's ship and then destroyed the craft. Kaan was rescued, by rebels ironically who did not recognoze him as they were scouting for potential bases. Kaan repayed the rebellion by joining their faction and becoming a member of Rougue Squadron. Kaan was believed killed while attempting a daring rescue mission of Freen Peeli, a senator from the Sullustan system. He was being held captive by the evil Prince Xizor. Kaan was shot down while in a dogfight with several of Xizor's pilots. Stories have begun to resurface after reported Dellum sightings around the galaxy. He is still wanted by Jabba and his so-called demise still remains a mystery.163.151.2.10 14:45, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Stephen Gribble is the celebrated British disco dancer and Artist, who found fame in the mid 80s with his now fabled "pogo hop" routine. Born in 1957, to Jewish parentage, he quickly found fame in the Bristol community for his extraordinary dance floor exploits. He was quickly signed up to a local agent and went on a nationwide tour with "Hot Lava" dancing troupe.</p>
<p>Internal artistic differences meant Stephen had to leave the group in the early 80s, but this allowed him to take a more experimental approach to choreography, and ultimately led to the dawn of "pogo hop",and with it, nationwide fame. The origins of the now legendary routine are unknown, but rumour has it that he developed it in local nightclubs, when he once bounced so high that he hit his head on the ceiling. He quickly choreographed this experience into a routine and the rest is disco history.</p>
<p>He retired from Disco in 1997, after injuring a knee on the "Disco Disco Disco" tour of North America. He went on to devote his life to teaching, and can still be found in Bristol rehearsal rooms to this day.</p>

Midlothian AFC were formed in 2006 by local upcoming coach, Chris Skene. The clubs first step was to advertise players, of which many have come and gone over the past couple of months. Some of the most important signings were Paul Milligan (Striker), Calum Ewing (Defender) and James Forsyth (extra). Despite these world class signings, it is the team ethic that remains that spurs the team on in their first season. The teams most notable result was against World Cup 2006 entrants, Trinidad and Tobago, who they beat 11-1.</p>
<p>Lets hope there is more of the same to come from these uprising stars, and, remember the name, Chris Skene!</p>

<p>Founded in September 1911,Chung Hwa Girls' School was started by Mr Tay Peng Teng, Mr Pang and members of the Chinese community in response to Dr Sun-Yat-Sen's call for the provision of education for girls in Singapore. Chung Hwa Girls' School became the first Chinese-medium girls' school set up by the Chinese community.</p>
<p>The original premises of Chung Hwa Girls' School was at Mohamad Sultan Road. Since its founding, the school has moved to several premises to adapt to changing circumstances and to serve the needs of the community.</p>
<p>Its role has also evolved over the years. the original objective of the school was to provide basic education for Chinese girls. In 1935, the school began to train teachers. Classes were suspended during the Japanese Occupation and only resumed in 1947, two years after the end of the war.</p>
<p>In 1951, in response to the increasing enrolment, the primary school section was seperated from the secondary school section. The secondary school moved to Bartley Road and was named Chung Hwa Girls' High School. Six years later, the school became government-aided.</p>
<p>The years 1979 to 1980 saw a drastic drop in the school's enrolment as more and more parents chose to send their children to English-medium schools. As a result, the secondary school accepted English-medium students. In 1980, Chung Hwa Girls' High School had its first intake of English-medium students and the school carried on with this arrangement of having both Chinese and English-medium classes until the time when Chinese-medium classes were phased out of the school system.</p>
<p>1984 was a significant year in the school's history as male students were enrolled and the school became co-educational. The school's name was changed to Chung Hwa High School. It also became a full-fledged government school. Following its move to Serangoon Avenue 4 in 1987, the school was given a new name - Zhonghua (the Hanyu-Pinyin equivalent) Secondary School.</p>
<p>The year 1996 was another key milestone as the school became autonomous. With greater autonomy and more funds, the school has been able to offer a wider range of programmes to enrich the pupils and stretch their potential. It has also maintained its good performances as one of the top value-added schools for both the Express and Normal courses.</p>
<p>The turn of the 20th century ushered in a new phase in the school's history as it moved into the new premises at Serangoon Avenue 3 in 2000. Equipped with IT facilities and a self-funded ceramic studio, Zhonghua Secondary School sets out to prepare students for the challenges in the IT age and to develop a niche area in art.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-07_15c9.html" title="Edit section: Josignacio a Contemporary Young Master">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Josignacio a Contemporary Young Master</span></h2>
<p>Born in Havana City, Cuba October 24, 1963.</p>
<p>Josignacio has defined and drawn attention to a famous generation of young Cuban artists called by the critics as “The Generation of the 80’s” (The most rebel of all). His own technique “Plastic-paint Medium” and his controversial body of work have redefined international expectations in Contemporary Cuban Art. Josignacio, who grew up in Cuba, (is also often credited); with helping to refocus the Cuban contemporary art world from his native Havana to the Art World of Miami, USA, the city he adopted after defecting in 1989.</p>
<p>His work has, (almost more than any other artist of his generation), became familiar via the media, particularly following his Hortt 38 Best in Show award wined in 1996, in the Museum of Art of Fort Lauderdale [an event that, at least in some ways, he relishes and uses].</p>
<p>Josignacio has addressed the exchange in his own Erotic-Porno-Shows, which confronts the relationship between Art and Sex in a wide range of “aesthetical-perception” from merely crude-explicit-figurative to an almost abstract manifestation, his work frequently reflects the world that surrounds him via “The Media and News”, the real life of Miami and his own.</p>
<p>His controversial shows named “Marihuana”, “The Miami Clowns”, “Liquid Sex”, “Hot Sex At your own Risk”, and his “Live Collages” are some of the “Hits that heated the Miami art scene”.</p>
<p>Josignacio is an “obsessive-compulsive-worker”, proof of that is the amount of personal shows (more than twenty in almost two years!) he did in Havana from his first one in march 2, 1987 to his definitive departure to Mexico may 10 , 1989. Slowing it down in Miami because his economical situation only aloud him to survive. Despite of this, he has not stopped creating his works.</p>
<p>Josignacio’s peculiar technique and his unique form to use it have derived a new visual effect, which have been a topic of study for many art students and art critics (some of them called “NEWISM”).</p>
<p>Josignacio’s work consists in a group of series, which he has maintained open for more than 20 years. Some of them are Dualism Series, Abstract Series, Erotic Series, Tauromaquia Series, etc.</p>
<p>Josignacio has been described as “The artistic representative of the Plastic Era” by Jose Antonio Portuondo, renowned Cuban intellectual, “Josignacio is a revolution inside The Revolution” by Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez and “Josignacio is a Natural Born Abstract”, by Dr. Kenwood W Moffett director of Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
<p>“…If God is everywhere and everywhere you find my art, then we have a lot in common….” - One of Josignacio’s reflections. Josignacio resides in Miami Beach, Florida</p>

<p>KAMMANADU</p>
<p>Kammanadu is an ancient geographical region in the present day <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South Indian</a> state of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andhra_Pradesh_0379.html" title="Andhra Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. The region straddled from the southern bank of <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna_river.html" title="Krishna river">Krishna river</a> <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta.html" title="Delta">delta</a> up to Kandukur (Prakasam Dt.). The word Kammanadu is derived from Karmarashtram (<a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>) or Kammaratham (<a href="../../../p/a/l/Pali.html" title="Pali">Pali</a>). <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> flourished in this region from 3rd century BC onwards. It is obvious that name was derived from the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada.html" title="Theravada">Theravada</a> Buddhist concept of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">Karma</a> (Kamma). <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharanikota.html" title="Dharanikota">Dharanikota</a>, near <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaravati.html" title="Amaravati">Amaravati</a> on the bank of <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna_river.html" title="Krishna river">Krishna river</a> (<a href="../../../g/u/n/Guntur.html" title="Guntur">Guntur</a> Dt.) was the ancient capital of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satavahana.html" title="Satavahana">Satavahana</a> dynasty which ruled <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South India</a> for five centuries.</p>
<p>The region is famous for the exquisite sculpture found in the Buddhist stupas of <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhattiprolu.html" title="Bhattiprolu">Bhattiprolu</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagarjunakonda.html" title="Nagarjunakonda">Nagarjunakonda</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaravati.html" title="Amaravati">Amaravati</a>. The ancient <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmi.html" title="Brahmi">Brahmi</a> script found in the inscriptions at <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhattiprolu.html" title="Bhattiprolu">Bhattiprolu</a> was the progenitor of modern <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu.html" title="Telugu">Telugu</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil.html" title="Tamil">Tamil</a> scripts.</p>
<p>The mention of Karmarashtram is noticed first in the inscriptions of <a href="../../../i/k/s/Ikshvaku.html" title="Ikshvaku">Ikshvaku</a> king Madhariputra Purushadatta (3rd century A.D) found at Bethavolu (<a href="../../../j/a/g/Jaggayyapeta.html" title="Jaggayyapeta">Jaggayyapeta</a>). The next record is the inscription of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pallava.html" title="Pallava">Pallava</a> king Kumara Vishnu II, son of Buddhaverma found in the village Chenduluru. The third record is that of Eastern Chalukya king Mangi Yuvaraja (627-696 AD) which goes as:</p>
<p>“Srisarvalokasraya maharajah kammarashtre chendaluri grame” (Sanskrit)</p>
<p>In all contemporary inscriptions (3rd to 11th century AD) the words Kammaratham, Kammakaratham, Karmarashtram, Karmakaratham and Karmakarashtram, Kammakarashtram were interchangeably used.</p>
<p>Pavuluri Mallana, the contemporary of the great king <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajaraja_Narendra_2853.html" title="Rajaraja Narendra">Rajaraja Narendra</a> (1022-1063 AD) wrote:</p>
<p>“Ila Kammanati lopala vilasillina Pavuluri vibhudan’’ (Telugu)</p>
<p>The subsequent inscriptions of Telugu Chodas and Kakatiyas mentioned ‘Kammanadu’ (E.g., Konidena inscription of Tribhuvana Malla – 1146 AD). During the rule of <a href="../../../k/a/k/Kakatiya.html" title="Kakatiya">Kakatiya</a> emperor Prataparudra II, one Boppana Kamaya was ruling Kammanadu with Katyadona (Konidena) as the capital.</p>
<p>It is not known clearly when the usage of the word Kammanadu ceased. However, the name survives as the denomination of a social group ‘Kamma’ (See <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamma_%28caste%29.html" title="Kamma (caste)">Kamma (caste)</a>), predominantly found in the region.</p>

<p>House Pionts appear quite frequantly in the Harry Potter books. They are given as rewards for getting the right anwser in class, in Quidditch, and just for being good. On the other hand, they can be taken away for playing pranks, duleing in the halls, and other things.</p>

<p>Lotball is a very serious game that has been passed down from ancient Greek societies. When the small city-states would play the lottery for new government positions, the way to handle angry citizens was the game Lotball. It consists of a bouncy rubber ball, about the size of a tennis ball. Only two people play this game, and it can get very intense</p>
<p>Rules:</p>
<p>First, the ball is tossed in by a person in the audience. The first person playing to retrieve the ball, starts the game. Next, the game starts. The player who is in control of the ball, starts trying to score in the opponents net, which is the size of a lacrosse net. In order to stop the person from getting a point, leg, knees, face, nose, mouth, ear, toes, fingers, eyes, lashes, skin, hair, and teeth are available to punch.</p>

<p>Alonzo Franklin Herndon was born a slave in 1858 near the town of Social Circle in Walton County, Georgia. He had only one year of formal education, but learned barbering in Jonesboro, Georgia, where in 1878 he opened his first barbershop. Having arrived in Atlanta in 1882, he worked his way to the top of the city’s barbering trade, eventually owning and operating three barbershops. One of them, the Crystal Palace at 66 Peachtree Street, was considered the most elegant in the country.</p>
<p>He invested his barbering income in real estate, becoming by the early 1900’s the largest Black property owner in Atlanta. His most significant business venture was launched in 1905, when he acquired what would become Atlanta Life Insurance Company, today the largest Black-owned stockholder insurance company in America. Alonzo Herndon died in 1927 at the age of 69.</p>
<p>Today, the Herndon Home is a memorial to the Alonzo Herndon family. It was built in 1910 by Alonzo Franklin Herndon, founder of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, and his wife Adrienne McNeil, a teacher at Atlanta University. Their son, Norris Bumstead Herndon, would eventually assume the presidency of Atlanta Life and with his step mother, Jessie Gillespie Herndon, would work to ensure the family legacy. The family’s phenomenal achievement was its rise from slavery in Georgia to leadership of the nation’s African-American business community. Its tradition of public service and philanthropy contributed substantially to the educational, social, and cultural development of Atlanta. This building, its furnishings and family papers richly document the significance of the Herndons within the broad patterns of American history.</p>
<p>The Herndon Home is a National Historic Landmark, one of a small number of historic properties in America that have exceptional value in the heritage of the United States. The house was designed primarily by Adrienne Herndon and was built by African American craftsmen. The 15-room house, which is Beaux Arts Classical in style, is a fine example of upper income dwellings at the turn of the century. The interior draws upon various design traditions, including the renaissance revival forms of the reception hall and dining room, and the rococo detailing of the music room. The house contains original furnishings and those acquired later in the century by Norris, who traveled extensively in Europe and collected decorative arts for what he envisioned as a museum in honor of his parents.</p>

<p>Anti-Dentite is a phrased coined by Kramer in the hit NBC series "<a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>." Jerry thinks his dentist, <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Tim_Whatley_fc8b.html" title="Dr. Tim Whatley">Dr. Tim Whatley</a>, has converted to Judaism purely for the jokes. The following exchange caused Kramer to call Jerry an anti-dentite.</p>
<p>Jerry: So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to him that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy. Kramer: Those people listen to yourself. Jerry: What? Kramer: You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.

<p><b>Coconuts Comics</b> (<a href="http://www.coconutscomics.com" class="external free" title="http://www.coconutscomics.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.coconutscomics.com</a>), created by Phil Nelson, is a wild &amp; unpredictable strip based on the deserted island mad antics of an unlikely cast:</p>
<p><i>Taken, with permission, from the official Coconuts Comics website:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<b>Bananu</b> is a dashingly handsome NATURAL blonde with a winning smile and charming personality. No, I did NOT write this myself! <b>Lukewarm</b> is a demented and delusional freak with a tenuous grasp on reality. His hobbies include desperate loneliness and slow starvation! Usually a very cheerful guy! <b>Little Crab 1 &amp; 2</b>. The crabs are...well...they're crabs. They were here when I got here...umm...they make great appetizers! <b>Fishy</b> is a Great White Shark who frequents the waters around the island. He is a fun-loving, gregarious Pisces whose turn-ons include playing with his food and recreational swimming. <b>Laura the Mermaid</b> is a mermaid who lives in Atlantis, which is surprisingly close considering that the island is in the Pacific, and assuming that Atlantis is in the Atlantic Ocean, and...oh yeah...she has some magical powers and the guys are in love with her, and boy does she enjoy stringin' 'em along! How TYPICAL!!! <b>Phil Nelson</b> is an amateur doodler who likes to draw pictures of himself frolicking on the beach. He taught himself to read by staring Phil Nelsonvacantly at Marvel comics and paperback collections of Peanuts. He developed his fine social skills by studying the Three Stooges and Bugs Bunny cartoons. At the age of six, he created a crude comic strip called COCONUTS as a rip-off of...tribute to Charles Schulz. Phil attended the Philadelphia College of Art from 1983 to 1984 or '85. He was forcibly expelled by the students and faculty because they were all just jealous. After despairing away in dank, sweaty, poorly-ventilated print shops for twenty years, he decided to try drawing again. He is still trying. Phil lives in Pennsylvania with his wife, daughter, sheltie and two cats, who are both vicious, bloodthirsty killers. You can view COCONUTS at <i>Mad Hatters' Review</i> (<a href="http://www.madhattersreview.cm" class="external free" title="http://www.madhattersreview.cm" rel="nofollow">http://www.madhattersreview.cm</a>), where Phil serves as Cartoon Editor. You can also view his strip on the new spring issue of <i>kenagain</i> (<a href="http://www.kenagain.freeservers.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.kenagain.freeservers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenagain.freeservers.com/</a>) and at <i>The Incredible Art Department of Princeton Online</i> (<a href="http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/bell/nelson.html" class="external free" title="http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/bell/nelson.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/bell/nelson.html</a>)."</p>

<p>The discovery of a new subspecies of ape, the monos mariposas, in the late 1970s, deep within the thickets of Gambia's Abuko Nature Reserve, caught the world's scientific community by surprise. Today little is known about the mariposas family of wild red colobus monkey (Procolobus Badius Temminckii), better known as the "Flutter." Pronounced "Fluu-ter," this name was adapted by colonists in the 18th century from a similar word used by natives meaning "flying sun-dog." With only a handful of modern-day captures, none of which has survived entrapment in captivity, it is widely believed that the Flutter subspecies of red colobus is close to extinction on many of the Gambia River's isolated islands and archipelagos. This is primarily as a result of wetland habitat loss, a number of introduced hominid viruses, and over hunting by local tribesman. A few environmentalist organizations dedicated to the preservation of the species have spearheaded initiatives with local governments throughout this part of Gambia in an attempt to reclaim vital breeding ground for the species. Except for a handful of pictorial references in cave paintings and ancient carvings, no photograph of the mariposas subspecies of colobus is known to presently exist within the public domain. Much of what is known is based on field research by biologists Erica Dawn Starin of the Abuko Wildlife Federation, as well as Carter Janis and Michael Lawson of the OJA.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-07_15c9.html" title="Edit section: Nation of One">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nation of One</span></h2>
<p>Nation of One, an influencial punk rock band that originates in South Florida, is composed of four high school students whose goal is to create amazing melodies and mind numbing riffs. Their fusion of punk and hard rock sounds, quick reflexed drumming, and melodic vocals, all combine to form the sound that is Nation of One.</p>
<p>Formed in the summer of 2002 by lead vocalist Evan Frank and their old bassist Sam Bean, the band quickly took off, and within a year, they were playing small venues in the Palm Beach area. After going through multiple bass players and problems along the way, the band has progressed to what it is today: four kids with a love of music.</p>
<p>Evan Frank, lead vocalist and rythm guitarist, is a senior at Gardens High School. Responsible for the writing and arranging of all the music that Nation of One plays, he has been with the band since the beggining and is the frontman who gives each show an amazing atmosphere.</p>
<p>Toby Weidenbaum, the drums and percussion section of Nation, has also been with the band for 4 years, and has been laying down beats that keep the band in perfect rythm since Nation's first songs. He is a sophomore at Dreyfoos School of the Arts, and spends most of his free time playing video games and eating McDonalds.</p>
<p>Sam Axelrod, lead guitarist, and shortest member of Nation of One, recently joined the band in 2005, and immediately fit right in as a very prominent and important member of the band. Also a Senior at Gardens High School, he has put forth a lot of effort, adding color and depth to the melodic sound of Nation. Sam is a young man whose hobbies include listening to music, Taco Bell, porn, and anime.</p>
<p>Jarred Nicolaou, bass player of Nation of One, recently re-joined the band in the summer of 2006, after previously leaving because of being attacked by llamas and having a broken femur and collar bone for 8 months. Happily back, he quickly picked up where he left off is now the only member to have had been attacked by those, untill recently known to be gentle, creatures. Apparently he was wearing a bad cologne, or maybe he was just looking grumpy, either way its really wierd. A Junior at Gardens High School, he is the tallest member of Nation, and also the newest.</p>
