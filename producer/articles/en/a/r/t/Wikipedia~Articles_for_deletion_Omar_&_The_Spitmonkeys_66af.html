<p>Don't Delete it. I am from Greenwood, SC, and the author of this article e-mailed me to tell me he had written it. I was at the concert mentioned in this article, and being from Greenwood, I can tell you that the Greenwood Jaycee Hut was actually quite a popular venue subsequent to Omar playing there. It should be noted that both Chip McKenzie and members of Elf Power were part of the Greenwood music scene that Omar was a pioneer member of. I think that this is a valid article, despite the fact that it may not appeal to a mass audience. Please see: <a href="http://www.flagpole.com/articles.php?fp=5543" class="external free" title="http://www.flagpole.com/articles.php?fp=5543" rel="nofollow">http://www.flagpole.com/articles.php?fp=5543</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.216.113.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.216.113.2_5b3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.216.113.2">contribs</a>) 15:16, 20 October 2005.</small></p>
<p>How many people must an article be meaningful to in order for it to enter the Wikipedia? This is a factual article about a music group which was once quite popular with numerous people in the SC music scene in the mid-1990's. There certainly is a need for articles like this in the Wikipedia. True knowledge is true knowledge, regardless of the number of people who may be in search of it. Do not delete. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.88.74.66 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.88.74.66.html" title="User talk:24.88.74.66">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.88.74.66_45e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.88.74.66">contribs</a>) 17:05, 20 October 2005.</small></p>

<dd>It is not necessarily the number of people that determine notability. It is instead determined by <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, the wikipedia guidelines for music entries. And in my opinion, this band does not meet the requirements as set forth. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">Malo</a> 21:47, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that Omar &amp; The Spitmonkeys does not meet the requirements set forth by <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, please see requirement #6: "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city..." To people in New York or L.A., the most prominent member of the Greenwood, SC music scene of the mid-90's may not be a big deal, but Omar was important to a lot of people, and other bands, in this region at this time. If you ask people who were part of the scene, even today, to name the band that best represents the Greenwood Scene at this time, the answer will almost universally be Omar. I continue to think that this is a valid entry, that people may well look for, and enjoy, and find informative. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.216.113.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.216.113.2_5b3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.216.113.2">contribs</a>) 09:08, 21 October 2005.</small>

<dd>Well if that were the case, don't you find it odd that the "most prominent representation" of their style doesn't return a single google hit. Given google is not the end all be all of knowledge or notability, but I still don't think that this band is the "Most prominent" their style, (remember "style" doesn't necessarily mean "scene"). Also please don't confuse popularity with notability. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">Malo</a> 17:02, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By invoking requirement #6 of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, I wasn't attempting to argue that Omar was the "most prominent representation of their style" (though their improvisational comedic satire and tight focus on their immediate environment as sources of inspiration is not something I've come across anywhere else), rather I was putting forth Omar as the "most prominent representative of... the local scene of a city". I think that what I said above is true, if you ask anyone about the Greenwood, SC music scene, the first name that you will hear is Omar. I realize that being the most prominent representative of the music scene of a city that most people have never heard of is not like being the most prominent representative of Manchester, England; or even Athens, GA (to use an example closer to hand); but I don't think that the lack of size or current notoriety of a cities' scene should cause it to be ignored. Athens wasn't Athens until R.E.M. and the B52's (and later Neutral Milk Hotel) made it such. Just because Omar (and the other great Greenwood bands of that time, like the ones I mentioned above, and the J.J. Kids, Cumeadus, etc.) didn't put Greenwood on the map, doesn't, in my opinion, mean that the scene deserves no reference of its existence. I hope that Wikipedia is the place for that reference. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.216.113.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.216.113.2_5b3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.216.113.2">contribs</a>) 14:14, 21 October 2005.</small></dd>
<dd>As for Google, please bear in mind that this is a band that formed in the early nineties, and broke up pre-2000. I remember that they had a website while they were still active, but I imagine it folded around when the band did. Although the tiniest local band may have a web presence in this day and age, it wasn't necessarily so at the time when Omar was at the height of their popularity. I think that may explain why, despite the fact that Omar had such a loyal and rabid fanbase in their region, they don't show up as a result of a Google search today. Sorry to have gone on so long. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.216.113.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.216.113.2_5b3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.216.113.2">contribs</a>) 14:14, 21 October 2005.</small></dd>

Don't delete the Omar article! I was at the concert at the Jaycee Hut, and it really was a landmark performance for the Greenwood rock scene, many members of which have gone on to fortify the legendary Athens, GA music scene. Anyone who says that Omar &amp; the Spitmonkeys is not a notable group is just being snobbish.</p>

<p>All of this discussion about Omar &amp; The Spitmonkeys has made me get out the old CD's and listen to them again for the first time in a few years. How dare you say this band is non-notable! As a teenager growing up in Greenwood in the '90s, Omar and the other bands of the scene meant so very much to me. The memories and emotions that came back while listening to the CD's made me think of a time and place that was shared by many people. Omar &amp; The Spitmonkeys sold tapes &amp; CDs, played concerts, and were well-known and loved in the local scene. As the Wikipedia grows and becomes more pervasive, people will search for Omar &amp; the Spitmonkeys. Personally, I do most of my factual searches on Wikipedia first, not Google, so that I can hopefully find somewhat obscure articles. Do not delete this article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.88.74.66 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.88.74.66.html" title="User talk:24.88.74.66">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.88.74.66_45e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.88.74.66">contribs</a>) 14:51, 21 October 2005.</small></p>
<p>This concert was put on by Omar and the Spitmonkeys and began as a small one band show with only a few select guests. Once word spread that Omar and the Spitmonkeys were putting on a show, the entire Greenwood music community seemed to appear from nowhere and begged to play the Jaycee Hut with Omar. As an alternative to pop bands such as Eleven Day Trip or cover bands such as Dropchord, Omar's comedic satirical songs about relevant Greenwood issues brought out many Indie rock bands such as Shutter whose founding members are now the band The Disease on the Van's Warped Tour. So this article is factual, helpful, and deserving of being kept in place. Please do not delete this article. Big Dave the sound man67.76.97.57 17:35, 25 October 2005 (UTC)DT</p>
<p><i><b>KEEP</b></i> Well, being from Greenwood, I can attest to the accuracy of the article ...even if you did not like the music ...it is all true, plus the comments from other folks from Greenwood above. The band did exists, did play, and had a loyal following. The members have all gone on to different parts of the state/country/world, but the facts of the article are true.
