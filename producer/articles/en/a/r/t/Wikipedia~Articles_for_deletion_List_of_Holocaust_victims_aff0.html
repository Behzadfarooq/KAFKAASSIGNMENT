<dd>My vote is still keep (as it is). My vote only changes to delete if the title is changed to <i>List of notable Holocaust victims</i>. However, I don't mind changing the title to <i>List of Holocaust victims with articles on Wikipedia</i> which is why I suggested it as a compromise further down. I don't think that we should call it list of <i>List of notable Holocaust victims</i> and say that inclusion in Wikipedia is the test for inclusion because without it clearly spelled out in the articles title it will be imposible to enforce the standard.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 12:17, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This sounds like a good alternative to deletion, though a rename would be in order to reflect the fact that it isn't a complete list. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 03:51, May 17, 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The criteria on that page is "This list includes notable individuals for which there is a consensus of evidence of slave ownership." The first part of which "This list includes notable individuals" merely restates what the title of article already says, and the second of which "for which there is a consensus of evidence of slave ownership" results as a natural consequence of the Wikipedia process (in there's no conscenss it's probally going to be edited out.) If the standard "List of Holocaust victims with articles in Wikipedia" was put at the top of the page it would likely be ignored or even more likely edited out by those who did not like the standard. That is, the question of what the standard is will be left to future editors if it is not in the title. Which is no different than changing the name to "List of Holocaust victims" and not adding a standard to the top of the page.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 12:27, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but ONLY if changed to "List of notable Holocaust victims". Wikipedia is not paper, but attempting to list 60 million people simply is unattainable. However a list of famous people who died in the Holocaust would be of interest. Perhaps this might work better as a category. Question: assuming that Holocaust victims were primarily Jewish, what's a Catholic saint doing listed here? I think an introduction needs to be added to explain this for those who think only Jews died in the Holocaust. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:08, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>- no way to ensure that it is accurate (exact number of Holocaust victims is not known, and varies wildly between sources). Creating a list of 'notable' Holocaust victims would be abhorrent- it would imply that some victims were more important (ie others deserved to die more) just because of their 'celebrity' status--<a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a> 13:20, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Agree with above that a article named "notable Holocaust victims" is a bad idea. However, a <i>category</i> for Holocaust Victims would serve the same purpouse and not have any ugly connotations (if a bio exists, it's pretty obvious and verifiable if it belongs) same logic should probably apply to other possible "lists" (9/11 victims, WWII Veterans, etc.) <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.94.94.154.html" title="User:66.94.94.154">66.94.94.154</a> 14:52, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: First, on of the things that Wikipedia Is Not is a memorial site. We have Wikimemorial for lists of this nature (all the 9/11 victims, e.g.), and we must reject, out of hand and a priori, any eulogy/elegy. Secondly, because the list is impossible to verify, the list fails on that score. Third, because the list cannot be completed, any inclusion is inherently POV (e.g. the list may bias toward ethnic victims as opposed to political ones, or sexual ones opposed to nationalist ones). The main reason, however, is simply that we are not a memorial. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:10, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>rename</b>. I think the word 'notable' is unfortunate - weren't they all? 'Famous' is much more neutral.

<dd>No, but it is POV if you deem some Holocaust victims notable and therefore Wikipediable and others unnotable and therefore not Wikipediable. There should be no distinguishing between notable Holocaust victims and unnotable Holocaust victims. If you make a list of Holocaust victims, you should include <i>all</i> Holocaust victims.

<li><b>Keep</b>, maintainable as long as we limit it to victims notable for other reasons than being murder victims. I don't think the creators intended this to be a list of 6 million + names.

<li>I strongly oppose having an aticle called "List of <b>notable</b> Holocaust victims". As someone else said they are all notable. I also think it would lead to very sensitive disputes over who was notable and who was not. So I propose that if the list is kept but the name is changed that it should be change to "List of Holocaust victims with articles in Wikipedia", and that it should provide links to all of those articles.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 23:09, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: With all due respect, I think this discussion is getting silly. There's a page called <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Norwegians_69e3.html" title="List of Norwegians">List of Norwegians</a>. This is not a list of all 4,5 million of them. This was never <i>meant</i> to be a list of all 4,5 million of them! It's implicit in the title that the list only covers notable individuals. As I said, the word 'notable' ought to be avoided, but apart from that the list is completely viable. <a href="../../../e/i/x/User%7EEixo_d259.html" title="User:Eixo">Eixo</a> 02:45, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>With its current title, it's by definition a list that is impractical to the extreme. Change to List of notable Holocaust victims -- and no, I don't buy for one second the claim that attaching a notability limitation would give rise to unresolvable disputes, because the criterion should be simple - whether the person has an article on Wikipedia. What WOULD give rise to disputes would be restricting entry to those who have articles on Wikipedia BUT leaving the title alone, since that would likely confuse new editors trying to add names and leave others with the unpleasant chore of deleting the names of some user's grandmother or great-uncle who fail to met the non-explicit criterion. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:24, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
