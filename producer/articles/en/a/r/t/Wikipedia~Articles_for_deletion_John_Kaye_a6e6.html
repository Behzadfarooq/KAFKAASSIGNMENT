<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but you appear to have no idea how the Australian political or electoral systems work, particularly with respect to the power balance and interplay between parties and preferences in the Senate. Note also that they polled around 7% of the primary vote in both houses, despite that they didn't pick up a seat in the lower house. As one who lives and votes here, please take my word for it, the Greens are notable. Any Australian will tell you likewise. This question is academic, as this person would not be notable even if he were an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">ALP</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a> nominee. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 00:56, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but you appear to have not to have read my comment. I accept that they are notable but, in my view, not a major party - 7% is not what a major party polls in my view - notable, influential, I'm happy to take your word for. To provide an example, in the UK the 'United Kingdom Independence Party' is both notable and influential but no-one would describe them as a major party. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:42, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

YA considers candidates from major parties worth an article; I take your view and say it depends on the candidate.

<li><b>Delete</b> They are a notable party, but Senate candidates in Australia generally are not just by dint of running for office, becuase of the way the proportional voting system works. This guy isn't notable. Only recreate if elected to the NSW Legislative Council at next election (not until next year). <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 00:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> John Kaye. He gets 77 results in a search of an Australia New Zealand media database and there is enough verifiable info about him to write an article. <b>Keep</b> David Risstrom. There are 134 returns in an Australian New Zealand database so there is enough verifiable material available to allow a reasonable article to be written. Jenny Leong is more of a borderline case with 14 articles returned mainly on the topic of gay marriage. The John Kaye article is well written too and not the usual dump of his campaign brochure which is a bonus. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep Kaye, delete Leong</b> no opinion on Risstrom. My reasoning is purely practical: Kaye is second on the Greens' announced ticket <a href="http://www.nsw.greens.org.au/media.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1144628318&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=2&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nsw.greens.org.au/media.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1144628318&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=2&amp;" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for the next NSW Legislative Council election, which is just around the corner. Seems a waste of time to delete only to have to recreate next year. Leong won't be on that ballot, which means she's not likely to win any seat anytime soon. Nick 03:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> all 3; agree Leong is more marginal but she pooled significant percentage of the primary vote and may appear elsewhere - thus adequately notable and definitely verifiable. Other two as per comemnts by Nick and Capitalistroadster--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 05:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Greens candidates who head the Senate ticket in a State. The way the Senate vote goes there is always a strong possibility that they will be elected. The Greens are now the strongest party outside the Coalition parties in government and the Labor Party, as the Democrats vote has crashed. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 09:22, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Both Kaye and Risstrom were very narrowly defeated in 2004 and in circumstances which were fairly controversial involving other parties preference deals. This should ensure their continuing relevance if not the fact that Kaye (at least) is a current candidate likely to win a state seat in 2007. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrismaltby_c1f2.html" title="User:Chrismaltby">Chris Maltby</a> 07:48, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Keep Kaye. The 2007 campaign is very much under way already and the election is less that a year away. Kaye is a prominent candidate with good prospects of entering the parliament. --<a href="../../../w/m/_/User%7EWm_3eec.html" title="User:Wm">Wm</a> 08:01, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Kaye and Risstrom. I think the lead candidate on a Greens senate ticket is notable, even if others are questionable, as they have a significant chance of winning a seat. Nick's reasoning is also a good reason to keep Kaye. Not sure one Leong, but 21% of the vote in <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Sydney_2aa0.html" title="Division of Sydney">Sydney</a> in 2004, seems reasonably notable. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:23, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Risstrom in particular is highly notable - his campaign was a high-profile one, and he only missed out on a Senate seat by a freak consequence of the preferential voting system. I'd also argue that Kaye is notable, and I see no reason to delete Leong. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 05:32, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - not notable yet, and besides, many of us wanted to delete <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Irfan_Yusuf_b560.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Irfan Yusuf">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Irfan Yusuf</a> and he got a higher proportion than these candidates.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 06:03, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I note that <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Yusuf_7a1c.html" title="Irfan Yusuf">Irfan Yusuf</a>'s page survived this process. As for the vote count, Yusuf got 14,364 votes in an electorate where he had no chance of winning whereas Kaye received 291,845 and missed out on election by 0.5% of the total vote in circumstances which remain significant. Yusuf has vanished without trace from the political process, whereas Kaye is now contesting a winnable seat. Whatever the deletion rules are they should be applied without bias. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrismaltby_c1f2.html" title="User:Chrismaltby">Chris Maltby</a> 06:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
