<li>AI created the article in view of apparent need for it to exist - there was a link to it AI noticed while browsing semiotics related articles (IIRC) and it was marked red (a double bracketed term leading to non-existing article). It can surely be improved and various terms might need further explanation or maybe I lack proper scientific vocabulary for some concepts and therefore you think these are some invented or taken out of the hat terms. You stated it well - it <i>seems</i> to be a personal essay, just like you <i>seem</i> to me to be a newbie who recently read the deletion policy and is in overzealous stage. Oh,BTW - your sentence is self-contradictory - every article on Wikipedia written by a single person is a personal essay on some subject. There are new technologies appearing every day - are you going to delete articles aboot them on a notion that they constitute a description of original thought? Again, self-contradiction. Fortunately, I managed to define it, although it should be impossible by definition to define self-contradiction. I guess there is more in me than it <i>seems</i> to. Listen to the song "As A Child" by "Suzanne Vega" (or read the lyrics on vega.net) to get my point even harder.

<li>Now at least I know there are some people who personally cannot stand me here and will do anything to delete any content I enter - even if they are too stupid to notice that the joke is on them. There is only one way to deal with bullies - a gun. If you are collecting my articles, you must to be shot to save humanity, per your own definition - a Darwin Award. I just won't contribute and stop funding. I wonder if you will still be unable to comprehend what I wrote in ten years of technological development... Just to make you less sure of yourself, I advice you to read <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antinomy.html" title="Antinomy">Antinomy</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-reference.html" title="Self-reference">Self-reference</a>. Oh, I have no idea to whom you are refering by "Deep Thoughts" producer, but being a jackass for no reason (yes, I do know you mean to insult me by comparing with some scape-goat, call that mind-reading. Go fuck yourself and meditate for an hour on the nature of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-Esteem_c304.html" title="Self-Esteem">Self-Esteem</a> in context of In-Joke. Because I said so, simpleton. No, I don't care if you delete - I have backup and don't give a damn, except the article does explain what the term means in <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-explanatory.html" title="Self-explanatory">self-explanatory</a> terms. I wasted too much time arguing with idiots and will now stop as you <i>seem</i> to me have a great experience in grabbing people to your level. When I was still playing Magic:the Gathering we called such people rules-lawyers - players who were to devote all the time in the world to argue some nonsensical ruling instead of simply playing the game. By your misguided interpretation, adding articles to Wikipedia is meant to be based on typing them out word by word from some encyclopedia printed on dead trees. And to think a British friend warned me not expect much from a thing run mostly by Americans... One more thing - how can one gather any certainty without Self-Reflexion is not it either OR. I'm going to lookup some more Self-Nomenclature as they <i>seem</i> to be amusing and then return to choking the bishop to a <a href="../../../b/u/k/Bukkake.html" title="Bukkake">bukkake</a> movie my lass Miranda McKennitt and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Thompson_a7c3.html" title="John Thompson">John Thompson</a> team made.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The introduction should be fleshed out a little but the subject is certainly notable. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrabapplecove_aff7.html" title="User:Crabapplecove">Crabapplecove</a> 01:29, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>But it is a compendium of human knowledge.

Yes, this article cites no sources at all and that should be fixed. But deletion doesn't do that.

This topic clearly is. See the published works that I hyperlinked to earlier. (I carefully omitted works published by the owners and promoters of the various balls of twine for this very reason.)

<p>This article is nebulous and I'm not sure it says anything. To boil it down: Ethical stress is stress from ethical problems. That seems to make "ethical stress" more a poetical term than anything. Solving problems about what is good or bad is called simply "<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a>". Stress undergone from that is "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Stress_%28medicine%29.html" title="Stress (medicine)">stress</a>". It does not explain how ethical stress is an exclusive type of stress, nor why ethical stress cannot be medicated, only that it can't. The article goes on to say, indirectly, that "ethical stress" is the tension of conflicting views one must have to support his well being. I think this is called <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognition.html" title="Cognition">cognition</a>. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel this makes the article redundant and an abstract medley of concepts jumbled together. It also lacks sources. For these reasons I submitted it for deletion. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBordello_82e5.html" title="User:Bordello">Bordello</a> 01:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Not because I don't think it deserves an entry, but because it's survived for a year without significant improvement. A google search returns over 500 results, some of which are reputable media entries, and a search of GoogleScholar returns 33 results. This is weak evidence of notability in my opinion, but I'm not convinced that the WP entry for the phrase is accurate. The main subset of entries seems to be in two areas, theology and economics.

<li>This article tries to deliniate the differences between how the United States has related to Turkic Muslims versus Arab Muslims.Turkic people are an ethnic group and the common ancestor of the Turkic people are the Mongolians.The Turkic people occupy lands ranging from Turkmenistan to Turkey.Turkic is not the same as Turkish .Turkish people belong to the Turkic ethnic group but not all Turkic people are Turkish.In this article I tried to explain that the relationship between Islam , the West and the United States is not black and white but is riddled with complexities.Arab Muslims have been treated very differently by the United States than the Turkic Muslims.This article is critical for a better understanding of the complex relationship of the United States to Muslims because an important area that has not received enough attention is highlighted.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephanie_thomas_77fe.html" title="User:Stephanie thomas">Stephanie thomas</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephanie_thomas_e1c0.html" title="User talk:Stephanie thomas">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stephanie_thomas_f065.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stephanie thomas">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>THE DEFENSE RESTS - I've already spent more than enough time outlining the arguments for keeping the article, so this is my final post. Like I said at the onset of this discussion, I was just attempting to share... and having an article is not important to me in the grand scheme of things. When I decided to write a Wikipedia article on myself, I was under false assumptions that wikipedia was a lot freer than I had initially thought. Everyone has done a good job of disillusioning me, and I now have a much more accurate view of wikipedia. Anyway, all my points are listed in the lengthy debate below, and I have added verifiable footnotes to the article, per request of the posters. All that needs to be done now is for someone to make the final decision for or against deleting because I know it's not MY responsibility. I want to thank all the posters who sincerely tried to help improve the quality of this article as opposed to just judging and leaving. So, whoever has been elected the final judge, it's time to make a final decision. Thank you for giving the article more than enough time to list all the arguments for consideration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ATTENTION: I just added footnotes to the article per WP:AUTO's suggestion at the bottom which would prefer verifiability through a self-published website than no verifiability at all. So, it now should coincide with the first 2 mandatory policies of neutrality &amp; verifiability. I discussed the 3rd original research policy at the very end of this article. Do a keyword search for 'physics cranks' to read it. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 13:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You know, I don't really care if it's deleted. I just thought I would try to tell you I exist, and I have had (and continue to have) noteworthy accomplishments in my life (as were stated in the biography). Wikipedia seems a bit different than it was when it started way back when as an "ideal." I believe any individual in the world should be able to tell their story to the world whether or not they have had noteworthy accomplishments or not. Notewrothy is a serious judgment call, and who is the judge? The Media? How much money you have made? No. Is wikipedia low on disk space or something? Are they worried that when you type in "Albert Einstein" you will get 500 different names and won't be able to figure out which one is the famous guy? How many other "David Eric Blackingtons" are in the world? Is this article really going to CLUTTTER up the category of other David Eric Blackingtons? Does wikipedia not have enough diskspace for everyone in the world to write their autobiography? I agree you should require a full name including middle in order to prevent the cluttered search results, though. Furthermore, website creators do meet the criteria for verifiability because you can just go to that website and look at what they are doing. If you feel the website is noteworthy, unique, newsworthy, then so be it. For profit websites should, I agree, be held up to higher standards for noteworthiness. It's really a difficult decision to be made based upon the "free" philosophy that wikipedia was founded upon. I guess as time goes on, the standards become stricter and stricter until wikipedia can just be renamed "Encyclopedia Britannica!" It just sounds a bit funny that a "free encyclopedia" would be judging whether a person's life is NOTEWORTHY to be read about by the general public. No large online dispenser of information ever wants to be in the business of being the FIRST to publish a person's life story, do they? Oh, let someone else do it. We don't want to hear about it. But wasn't that one of the reasons for the start of wikipedia? The idea was for the entire world to log on and tell their story and help write about things they know about. If you don't give people a chance to write their story, 99% of the lives of a person will go unnoticed because YOU say they are not notable. Why not let them tell their story and THE PUBLIC will decide whether or not they want to read about them or not.

<dd>Dave, we're only applying current policy here. If you think that WP policy should be changed so that "non-notability" does not exist, you should bring up the issue at the appropriate level.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The disagreement is mostly philosophical, and over the years a general consensus has been reached that Wikipedia can't be the central server for knowledge of EVERYTHING.

<li><b>Save</b>, per Wales philosophy. Quote from the wikipedia article of the founder of Wikipedia: Wales explained the purpose of Wikipedia by saying, "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing."[19] Furthermore, THE PUBLIC constitutes how many people? Are you being paid to review wikipedia articles? Or do you just have time to kill and just decide to mark a zillion articles for deletion because you don't care to read about them? Personally, I don't have time to criticize other people's lives. I'm sure there are a lot of other people's lives which other people would consider noteworthy which you would care less about. I say have a libertarian "live &amp; let live" philosophy like Wales suggested when he founded wikipedia. Believe it or not, the "sum of all human knowledge" also includes the knowledge I am offering to the public with my metaphysical research. If you delete the article, you will be depriving people of "the sum of all human knowledge" which Wales wanted to offer people.</li>
<li><s><b>Save</b></s>, Unsourced? Actually, any idiot can figure out if they go to the external link whether or not I am legit. It &gt;IS&lt; verifiable knowledge which I'm offering the public. In terms of the biography, what better source would you need than the horse's mouth? Are you going to ask my Mom if I won the Gold Medal in the Nutmeg State Games in 1990? Well, the results were actually published in a local newspaper, but no one in their right mind would want to know the name of the newspaper. Even if I was to cite that newspaper, are you really going to go check up on my source to verify my name is listed under the winners? What's a reliable source that I was born in Tolland, Connecticut? Do you want me to cite the Tolland Town Hall or something? Do you want me to upload a copy of my birth certificate? What's a reliable source I received an award for being ranked #1 in my college class? How about the college? You can call and talk to them, if you don't believe me. The fact is, LOTS of KNOWLEDGE goes unpublished. Wales knew this, and this is why he created wikipedia. His intention wasn't to bar all knowledge that was never published. His idea was for humans to have access to the "total sum of all human knowledge." He didn't say "previously published knowledge." Believe it or not, there are a lot of bits of human knowledge that go unpublished. In fact, probably at least 50% of the human knowledge base is unpublished knowledge. <s><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 10:23PM, 21 July 2006 (PST)</s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.212.73.186 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.212.73.186.html" title="User talk:71.212.73.186">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.212.73.186_7161.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.212.73.186">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>By the way, in terms of articles on wikipedia, I have seen a lot worse which haven't been marked for deletion. For example, take a look at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Baier_29d4.html" title="Daniel Baier">Daniel Baier</a>'s article. If you compare this 3 sentence biography (with no photos, no sources, and very little information) to my article... honestly, which would you rather read? Tell me how Daniel's article is a great deal better than mine? And how is his life more noteworthy? The fact is, different people have different standards of whether something is noteworthy, so there are articles which get approved which others would not approve. I'm sure there are articles which never got flagged for deletion which are worse than mine. <s><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 11:25pm, 21 July 2006 (PST)</s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.212.73.186 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.212.73.186.html" title="User talk:71.212.73.186">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.212.73.186_7161.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.212.73.186">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Oh yea, I forgot, media rules the world of human knowledge. Obviously, Wales' ideal is not going to go anywhere if he is hiring people with narrow minds. I vote that any human being who makes a good intentioned attempt to write their autobiography is given a chance to be heard on wikipedia. Onless, of course, you know of a webite that is already organizing legitimate attempts to share their life story. Is there a website out there called biography.com or maybe even wikibiography.com which houses real attempts of possibly "normal" people who are writing their biographies? (Believe me, I'm not considered "normal" by most, and I may even be considered noteworthy by some!) The good thing about wikipedia is you can just click on a birthdate, and it will give you a list of other people who were born on that day. You can then see what their professed occupations are and listen to what other people's lives are like who share your birthday. But, if someone comes online and starts a file with their name and says, "Today I went to the store and bought ice cream. It was good. Peace out!," this is obviously not an legitimate attempt to write your autobiography and noteworthy accomplishments. Again, noteworthy to me, may not be noteworthy to you, or noteworthy to someone else. If the media is used as a measure of noteworthiness, I can't imagine what type of society we will end up becoming (oh, don't tell me this has already happened?&#160;;) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 12:17am, 22 July 2006 (PST)

<li>I'd say it's time to change wiki's slogan to something other than the "free" encyclopedia. It's almost as much of a joke as calling the United States a "free nation." It's misleading. False advertising. It might be freer than some encyclopedias which don't really have a forum to argue inclusion, but it's bluntly obvious it is far from free. You might consider changing the title to Mediapedia because of your incessant need to appeal to the media to justify an article as worthy human knowledge. Also, my biography isn't a primary source. My website is the primary source which verifies the existence of unique metaphysical knowledge which is being offered to the public free of charge. It may not be of interest to you or john q public, but it may be of interest to the metaphysically-minded minority. If you're going to discriminate against all the metaphysically-minded users of wikipedia by not providing the "sum total of human knowledge" in the field of metaphysics, then so be it. Ask yourself another question. How many other metaphysical reasearch websites can you find in search engines on the net? Unique? I'd say so. In fact, I believe you should start a new article on metaphysical research and provide external links to those websites which are currently "on the case" and publishing real findings free for people to read. You can create a separate category entitled "metaphysical investigators," just like you have created a category entitled, "astrologers." Either way, whether it is now or later, this information will become part of wikipedia under some category, believe it or not. <s><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a></s><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.212.73.186 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.212.73.186.html" title="User talk:71.212.73.186">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.212.73.186_7161.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.212.73.186">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Notability in not notable</b> - Let me explain how notability is not a valid criteria to judge an article. I believe it already says this under the controversial discussion of this criteria, but let me reemphasize with an example of why. If I start a new article and entitle it "John Q Public" and then begin writing my blog, what is wrong with this scenario? I'll tell you what's wrong. The STRUCTURE. It is not consistent with what the structure of an encyclopedia article would be. Wales' idea (I surmise) was not to DISCRIMINATE against the noteworthiness of people's lives, but it was merely to ensure wikipedia was organized with the correct encyclopedic structure and articles were listed in the proper categories. Then, Wales would only need to type in "John Q Public" and read what an encyclopedia would say about his life (if he was ALLOWED in the TRADITIONAL encyclopedia). Wales would not want to type in a person's name and get their blog because that is not what encyclopedia's do. Encyclopedias include biographies of people's lives, and up until today, they have all been judged as noteable by virtue of POPULARITY. I don't believe that Wales' idea of a free encyclopedia had anything to do with POPULARITY or NOTEABILITY, but I think he would have liked articles to have the correct encyclopedia STRUCTURE, be ORGANIZED, and have the correct TITLES so people reasonably know what to expect of the content of the article before clicking on it. Again, a person wouldn't expect to get a person's blog when they click on an encyclopedia article with the person's name. However, I don't see anything wrong with providing external links to their blog just in case that person was intersted in further nonencyclopedic information about the person. So, if biographies are going to be included in wikipedia (notable or not), they should have basic encyclopedic information about the person like when/where they were born, where they grew up, their notable accomplishments... stuff you would see in an encyclopedia IF they were considered a notable person.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 9:58am 7/22/06</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, if people are so dead-set on having only Britannica-level information/biographies in wikipedia's search results, instead of trying to keep out 'non-notables,' you could provide a separate search box to search the entire wikipedia knowledge base which would include all your college professor's biographies and the serious biographical attempts of your next door neighbor who works at your local department store. This way, if you come to wikipedia to only read Britannica-status articles, you can use the 'notable-only' search box.... whereas if you want to search the entire "sum of human knowledge" which Wales initially dreamed about, you could select the "sum of human knowledge" box which would include access to the knowledge which less notables may be able to provide.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 9:58am 7/22/06</li>

<li>Yes, I believe everyone should be able to write their own encyclopedia article on their life as long as it's a legitimate attempt to write an encyclopedia article on yourself. Again, you need to include pertinent information that you would find in an encyclopedia article on a person, and THEN, and ONLY THEN, should you be able to provide your external links. If someone creates a page with their name and writes "Hi, my name is John, come visit my website at www.mywebsite.com, peace out!" Obviously, this warrant's nomination for deletion in order to urge the author to conform to the basic standards/structure of an encyclopedia article. If you are not familiar with the type of encyclopedic information to include in your biography, you can consult an professional level biography article in any local encyclopedia.</li>
<li>If you're going to judge anyone's encyclopedia article, I would hope it would be judged upon whether or not the content and structure coincides with what you might find in an encyclopedia article &gt;IF&lt; the person was noteworthy. The criteria of being popular, in the media, or considered 'noteworthy' by your fellow peers should not be a relevant argument for deletion. Questions like, Is the person trying to write a professional encyclopedia article on themselves? or, if you came down from another planet, would the structure/content of their article APPEAR like they are an unnoteworthy person? For example, if I created an encyclopedia article under my name and just started writing unencyclopedic information (like blogging or whatever), the person coming from another planet would notice that the structure/content of my article doesn't seem to fit in with the other encyclopedia articles.</li>
<li>Either that, or I vote for wikibiography.com where people can go and read EVERYONE'S professional biography as opposed to just the people who happen to win a popularity contest in our society. Furthermore, just because someone is popular doesn't necessarily mean they are 'noteworthy.' There are a lot of unpopular people out there who have a lot of noteworthy accomplishments and knowledge to share with the world. Remember, everyone is your superior in some aspect of life, and we can learn something from them (or their lives). Noteworthy does not mean popular. Noteworthy means you don't start an article under your name and start telling us your favorite color, favorite singer, and favorite sport without clarifying the relevance of these statements with noteworthy accomplishments which tie into these statements. For example, you can say, "John's favorite sport growing up with Basketball, and he went on to become the captain of his college team at Harvard Unverisity and win most valuable player award in 1993." He may not be that popular, but he still has had some noteworthy accomplishments which appear relevant to mention in an encyclopedia article under his name.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 00:12, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I read this entire discussion prior to posting. I'm quite willing to change my mind regarding entries in Wikipedia, based entirely by fact-based arguments centered around Wikipedia's policies and, to a lesser extent, its guidelines. In fact, I've been an increasingly vocal participant in the discussion of an article whose topic I personally disagree with completely, because that is what is asked of me by policy and guideline. This entry, on the other hand, does not meet the standards set in those policies and guidelines. Specifically, under <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, "Biography articles should only be given for people with some sort of achievement. A good measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources." This is clarified in the guideline <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Is it possible they are wrong? Yes, it is. Policies and guidelines have changed substantially over the history of this encyclopedia's existence. But an AfD isn't the place to argue policy. If you really want to try to sway the community, the place to do so is on the discussion pages of the policies that are almost certainly going to lead to this page's deletion -- and not here. But, as a word of wisdom, if you fashion yourself Sisyphus and wish to attempt that task, borderline-attacks on other users based on your <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">biased point of view</a> regarding their userids is going to get you sanction, not discussion. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 12:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Notability is a controversial GUIDELINE, not a policy. Plus, it says right on that page that it shouldn't be used as a criteria for deletion in itself.

<li>I agree it doesn't belong in a TRADITIONAL encyclopedia, but I thought wikipedia was supposed to be more free and open. After all, isn't it's slogan "The Free Encyclopedia"? I'm quite certain it doesn't say "the encyclopedia that everyone is used to."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I just thought of yet another reason to allow non-notables to write encyclopedia articles on themselves. Literary Incentive. In other words, if wikipedia does allow non-notables in their "exclusive group," it will encourage more people in the world to sit down and share their story with the world. It actually may even encourage some people to get off their butts and accomplish something in their life, so they can put it in their article! Ever think of that? The world will publish your accomplishments if you have them. Verifiability won't be a large problem because people would question anyone who claimed to have accomplished something REALLY noteworthy. Furthermore, the REALLY noteworthy accomplishments of people tend to be caught by the media, anyway. And, as far as I'm concerned, the ideal would be to get every person in the world to sit down and write their biographies. Wouldn't that be fascinating to be able to read encyclopedia articles on that many people? And, again, we are talking about serious encyclopedia articles where they have the content &amp; structure akin to that of a professional level article. Imagine clicking on your birthday in wikipedia and getting a list of people born on that day who wrote their own encyclopedia article? Remember, only .27% of the population are born on your birthday, so this would represent a quite unique sample of individuals. I'm always curious to see what type of people my birthday is producing (in general). You might even find articles written on people born on your specific DATE of birth which is usually only a handful of people (considering most don't have the patience to sit down and write their story, anyway). Aren't you at all curious what your birthmates are up to? A person is lucky to find ONE famous person who was born on their full birthdate, so it would be nice to have a few more than just one person to read about who shares your full birthdate, don't you think? Even if you aren't into the birthday scene, having access to all those biographies would be quite amazing, eh? I don't know of any other service on the net which is in the business of organizing encyclopedia-style biographies on every individual. As far as I know, no other webspace has standards for structure &amp; content, so visiting a person's myspace page is usually far from informative compared to if we compelled people to adhere to encyclopedic standards for writing their biographies. For example, in 8th grade, our English teacher asked the class to write their biography. They required we follow a particular structure, and we were graded on whether or not we followed it. I'm sure everyone who contributed on this talk page would help our users in writing their encyclopedia article correctly/professionally if they see people going astray. But, to simply not include them because they are considered "not notable" is, to me, a serious mistake if they are actually making a ernest attempt to write a well structured article under their full legal name with encyclopedic content.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 09:04, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I'm always open to suggestions, by all means. In addition, I just found out that Wikipedians try to follow a strict policy of never biting new users. I don't know how many users are new on this talk page, but very few people on this talk page have read this policy. I think most of the users on this talk page are still stuck in the "be bold" philosophy which is only supposed to apply to NEW comers, according to policy. The more experienced you are with wikipedia (if I read the policy correctly), the kinder &amp; gentler you are supposed to be with your words and suggestions. In fact, the problems which people keep noting in this discussion don't really come with any suggestions for rewriting or reprhasing. They just say "DELETE" and then don't have time to explain how it can be improved. Of course, if they don't want to see my face in the enyclopedia, why would they try to help me, anyway? Right? If you need me to put a footnote on my birthdate and tell you where I got the information, I will. As to whether you consider my source reliable is another story, and also a value-judgment call. So, so far, the criteria of notability and reliability are value-judgments. And I'm also noticing that a lot of the links people provide are GUIDELINES, not policies. There is a difference between a guideline and a policy. As far as I read, the "strict policy" is for everyone to be nice to new comers, all those links which you provided me to read are merely guidelines. No, it doesn't mean you can disregard them or they don't mean anything, but it also means not to apply them too strictly. Be a little loose, friendly, lighten up... all these things are in the tradition of what I have read about Jimbo's philosophy.</li>

But you really lose me with "I don't know how many users are new on this talk page, but very few people on this talk page have read this policy." First, you can click on their user names and look at their contributions to see just how new they are ... or aren't. Second, if you go to the main AFD listings and see just how often these policies are cited and linked to (including <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, which you tried to link to above) by people who can quote the criteria listed on them off the tops of their heads.</li>
<li>If you weren't so new here, I would consider the insult to our intelligence implied by that argument to be a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>.

During his legal career, my father once told me of a conversation with an appellate judge he was acquainted with. The judge had many years on the bench, and was often amused when neophyte lawyers would come before him trying to win their cases on some novel legal theory or interpretation. "I know the law," my father recalls him saying. "Stick to the facts of your case if you want to win." You would do well to consider this story and follow the same advice. Proving notability to our standards is about the <i>only</i> way I have ever seen anyone convince us to keep an article they're fond of (welll, once I translated an article from French and that worked, too). Trying to convince us to completely jettison several years and thousands of deletion debates just to accomodate your ego is most definitely the wrong way to do this.</li>

<li>Jimbo also states that the primary motivation for the policy for 'original research' was to keep out people who publish theories on wikipedia that haven't been published. As you can see by my article, I'm not a physics crank, and I'm not posting theories which haven't been already published. The only other two strict policies which are outlined are neutrality &amp; verifiability. It says on the WP:AUTO page that you can use your own website to verify personal information about one's self as long as it's not grossly self-promoting. They also mention notability, but the whole notability guideline is NOT a policy, so lacking notability doesn't automatically mean 'delete.' So, as far as I can see, the only thing I can do to help the article is to publish my personal information on my website and add a footnote to that link. Right?</li>
<li>As for Jimbo's idea about people being written about by other people if they are notable, I don't think this is always true. There are notable people who are not being written about, and SHOULD publish their autobiography. To me, that's called sharing. Sharing is a valued concept in my book. There's a fine line between sharing yourself and vanity, but being stingy with yourself, to me, is just as bad as being vain. In fact, those people who WON'T share themselves with the world by composing their encyclopedic article for everyone to read are just as vain as the ones who MUST. It is the balanced people who are not the vain ones. The people who aren't over zealous about NEEDING to be known and are also not too stingy to the point where they want to keep every single detail of their life to themselves. The very first words out of my mouth when I heard someone nominated my life story to be deleted was... well, you can scroll back up to the top of this talk page and read them. And, yes, I do mean it. Whoever has the power to delete my article, if they don't like it, I'm fine with that. All I was trying to do was to share my life because I thought sharing was a worthy value to have. Believe me, it wasn't a vain attempt for me to share, and I would never want to be part of a group who does not want me as a member.</li>
<li>So, if you don't want me in your book, I will take that as a hint that you don't appreciate what I have to offer. However, I still would say it's a value-judgment. Like Jimbo says, what matters are factual-judgments such as neutrality &amp; verifiability. As far as I can see, the article is written in a neutral tone, and I can make the personal information verifiable by publishing it on my website (per WP:AUTO)... and, lastly, the original research policy was designed to keep out crank theorists, and everyone can see I didn't publish any theories in the article, so no one has to worry to much about that. If you insist I run down the name, date, &amp; author of the newspaper which publishes my name as the winner of the Gold Medal, I will. Of course, I know no one in their right mind would spend time to check this reference, anyway, so I could just approximate from memory and no one would know the difference, right? It was a local newspaper, and it was published in July 1990... probably the Journal Inquirer or Hartford Courant. But, this really is a non-issue because isn't it common knowledge where one would find a list of the winners of a state olympics? I think an 8th grader could figure that one out, don't you think? I don't think it's necessary to cite your sources when an 8th grader would know where to find that information, anyway. Now, if I was writing highly technical information or assertions... yes, I would need to show people where they are published. I think it's ok to use a LITTLE common sense as opposed to being blinded by a hard &amp; fast policy. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave925_59db.html" title="User:Dave925">Dave925</a> 11:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s><b>Delete</b></s> (changed to <b>Move/Merge</b> see my comment further down) Insufficient material to justify an article. The few paragraphs seems to be culled from a single work. POV, whether or not Israel is "one of the most progressive nations in the world when it comes to animal rights" is an entirely subjective statement dependant on whether or not one views kosher/halal slaughter as more or less humane than other pratices. It's not clear cut (no pun intended). And the bit about whaling is just odd - Isreal's never had a whaling industry is likely because there are no whales around. That it's government voted for a ban on whaling is not especially meaningful. Homey 03:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, since the article could theoretically be de-POV'd and possibly prove useful (in much the same way as we have articles on <i>human</i> rights in different countries, <i>animal</i> rights could make an worthwhile collection of articles). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 03:12, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This appears not to be a good-faith nomination. The article was created some time ago, but I just noticed it today and tried to tidy it a little. Homey is currently following my edits because we're in a dispute. He knows I'm interested in Israel and in animal rights, so he's taking this opportunity to be unpleasant. He also hates to see anything positive written about Israel. The article does need a lot of work, but it's correct that Israel is one of the more progressive countries in the world when it comes to animal rights, so it could definitely become a legitimate article. There would also be valid criticism to add (from a rights perspective), regarding the continued use of animals in research, and so on. I doubt there's a huge amount of material out there, but certainly enough to justify an article. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:17, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, that's a POV dependant on your views on kosher/halal slaughter. If you think it's crueller than regular slaughter then Israel as well as Muslim countries would not rank as more progressive, if you think it's less cruel than they would. As for your personal attack, users should judge the article based on its merits and demerits, not on Slim's personal views about users. I don't hate to see anything positive about Israel, I just have a distaste for silly propaganda - it reminds me of the stuff you used to see from the old Soviet Union about how the grass is greener, the sky is bluer and the animals are happier - but again, the article should be judged on its actual merits.

<dd>Yes, and since I put it on my watchlist when I first noticed it last year it came up on my screen when I logged on. Thanks for reminding me about it. It doesn't seem you have very much to actually say in defence of the article itself since you're spending so much space attacking me. You write "I doubt there's a huge amount of material out there, but certainly enough to justify an article." the first part of your sentence is true, I suspect, so I don't see how the second part follows. With scant material, only one source it seems, it doesn't seem to justify a whole article. Homey 03:56, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You know, I don't remember what I was thinking in October - I suspect I put it on my watchlist because I was dubious about the article and wanted to keep an eye on it to see if improved and then it dropped off my radar and I forgot about it. Please don't embarass yourself with specious accusations because I've AFD'd one of the hundreds of articles you've edited in the past week, particularly since you know I edit Israel-related articles and have for a long time.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I've had fine interactions with each of you (many of my extra-Wiki views, I think, are a bit more consistent with those of SV than those of Homey), and I appreciate that each of you is sincerely interested in improving the encyclopedia. Here, FWIW, I don't think Slim's inference apropos of Homey's <i>wikistalking</i> is unreasonable, but, notwithstanding concerns about less-than-ideal inter-user <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> or impaired <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">collaboration</a>, where a nom can reasonably be understood as consistent with encyclopedic purposes, such that it is, relative to the project, propitious, the underlying motivation isn't particularly relevant. The nom here isn't disruptive—since several of us appear to support deletion—and can be justified on encyclopedic grounds, so, even as I'd likely conclude that Homey's conduct is indecorous, I think we'd do well to overlook it and focus on encyclopedic concerns. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for stalking, if there were a pattern of someone habitually following someone around and posting comments where they post comments or editing where they edit (see, for example, Zeq's edit below) then you can speak of wikistalking.

<li>Justification based on almost identical entries is perfectly acceptable. If this entry is to be deleted, then surely countless other entries need to be deleted as well. Marking out a lack of third-party coverage is also incorrect. Cubed3 is linked and noted hugely across a large number of gaming sites on the internet. Its right for a Wikipedia entry is just as justified as that of many other website entries also found here. Jtempertonc3 18:06, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it's noteworthy enough for a Wikipedia entry, as can be shown by media references that need to be added in (notably Slashdot and Engadget, amongst others). 2,000,000 monthly page views seems to me to be enough to support that cause. However, a case could be made for spamvertising - the admissability of the Community Features section, in particular, is debatable, as is information such as the interpretations of the name Cubed3. Such information could easily be found on the Cubed3 website if someone is that interested, and isn't of any particular wider interest. The only other problem is the fact that many of those writing the article have vested interests in Cubed3, but NPoV is largely being maintained. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobW_e648.html" title="User:RobW">Rob W</a> 23:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the editor refuses to listen and reverts again, I would take the matter to the Administrators' Noticeboard. It is not the place for content disputes, but with an AfD behind a decision to redirect, I, as an admin, would intervene. Not all other administrators might, but I think many, if not most, would. Also, if an editor was that determined, he or she could simply rewrite the article rather than reverting, especially with an article this small. I don't know if there is a technical downside to deleting or not deleting in this situation. Deleted articles are still stored in the servers so that they can be viewed by admins and undeleted if necessary. It might be better to delete articles or to just replace them with redirects or it might make little or no difference. Obviously, it would make no difference when dealing with this particular article, but it might be significant if policy were changed. Perhaps I'll ask someone. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:08, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because "non-notable" is hard to determine on the spot. An article about a notable website might be written in a way that misses out what makes the website notable. A7 is only reserved for articles with <i>no assertion</i> of notability about the subject, not <i>non-notable</i> subjects; these are not the same. For example, "xyz.com is a website founded in 2003" is a statement without assertion of notability, but "xyz.com is a website founded in 2003 and has won many awards for its design" is a statement with assertion of notability. Whether that assertion is true, is a matter for AfD to decide. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 07:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't quite see what you're getting at here.

<dd>Are you asking to close the AfD early? It's not entirely clear what you're saying. AfD's aren't a bargaining process where "if this happens, then I'll change my vote", but rather a discussion to determine if the article belongs on Wikipedia at all. If it's change you're looking for — say, to reword a part that you feel reads like an advert rather than an article — then you'll have better look bringing it up on the article's talk page, using a tag like {{cleanup}}, or another non-deletion process. If you'd like to change your comments, however, just strikeout the old ones (but don't remove them) and voice your new opinions here. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 09:34, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: This guy's the equivalent of Michael Cain when it comes to gay porn - his output is astounding. He has worked for the major studios; been in both starring and supporting roles; is versatile, had his own production company and directed as well. I have written to the producer of the Grabby Awards to ask for historical information for that award. Only the 2005 and 2006 award information is available online for the Gay Video News Awards; I'm working on other sources. (I didn't add the citations, but I'm trying to find the references.) The information that is readily available for straight porn performers is much more difficult to come by for gay performers. Remember that gay sex was illegal in many places up until 2003! Comparisons between straight and gay porn are inappropriate.

<p>Having been part of the LDS Wikiproject for a year now, I have to say that this is one of the more unusual Mormonism-related articles that I've seen. As it stands, "Animals in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" seems like a non-sensical topic... there is very little in terms of doctrine relating to animals specifically, and none that would really be considered <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. If encyclopedic content were to appear concerning this subject, it would be better inserted as a part of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_ff27.html" title="Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, as it's doubtful that it would merit its own article. In any case, this one needs to go. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 07:27, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It may seem to you to be a non-sensical topic, but as the article's references state, it's a topic that is included in the <i>Encyclopaedia of Mormonism</i>. Wikipedia should not be any less of an encyclopaedia than that encyclopaedia. The article requires citations for much of its content, but what citations there are indicate that this is, indeed, a subject that has been covered in multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of their subjects, and thus notable. This is a stub article that cites sources and that has clear scope for expansion. Deletion is not the way to fix the parts of the article that don't yet have sources. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the fact that it's a topic that's been covered in a Mormonism-specific encyclopedia doesn't strike me as the most persuasive of arguments, since an encyclopedia specific to <i>any</i> topic will naturally be able to devote more space to more esoteric topics than a general-interest one will. An encyclopedia of competitive sport, for example, would more than likely deem football clubs notable which would fail our guidelines, while an encyclopedia on the Pacific islands would be able to devote considerable space to members of local government in Samoa who would probably get short shrift here as well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 09:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a very persuasive argument against the assertion that the topic is "non-sensical". Please read what I actually wrote. The argument about <i>notability</i> is based upon the multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of their subjects, both cited in the article and locatable elsewhere. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:53, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> While I still haven't made up my mind about the need for a seperate article or inclusion in a list of unique theology, I do think that coverage in another encyclopedia is relevant. "What Wikipedia is not" clearly says one advantage of wikipedia is that it need not be limited by printing/arbitrary limits on which topics to cover. Wikipedia is not meant to be only a general purpose encyclopedia but also include everything that would be in specialized encylopedias as well. some quotes below (emphasis added) --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 16:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> discussion of undue weight is about minority and majority points of view on the same topic, not about the weight that should be given to <i>different</i> topics.

If you actually read what is cited by this article, you'll see that there's a <i>lot</i> that can be said on this subject, clearly enough for the topic to be broken out on its own. As I said above, <i>the article is a stub</i> with clear scope for expansion. Please actually read the articles being discussed and their sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:53, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I did read the article. I'm not persuaded that "scope of expansion" is a good reason to keep a stub around if there's a logical place to merge it until a separate article is needed. Better to split subtopics out of the parent article as they grow too large, than to spew stubs all over the place in hope of expansion. Stubs are to hold a place for an article when there's noplace else to put the info.
<p>Also, undue weight in my view applies to the enclopedia as a whole, not just to individual articles. That's the reason <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> is bad. It's fine to have an article about some movie of medium importance. It's also ok (or anyway it's a fait accompli) to have a bunch of separate articles about characters in an ultra-notable movie like Star Wars. It's undue weight to have dozens of separate articles about the different characters in the minor movie, especially stub articles where nobody has bothered to research whatever they thought the article was supposed to be about. This is more of the same. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Stubs are to hold a place for an article when there's noplace else to put the info.</i> — which is the situation here. <i>Also, undue weight in my view applies to the enclopedia as a whole</i> — You are still mis-applying a principle related to the presentation of multiple points of view to something completely unrelated. <i>I did read the article.</i> — I also encouraged you to read the sources. That you don't see that there's scope for expansion indicates that you haven't seen how much more is written on this topic in the sources than is at present in the article. For the third time: This is a stub article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:39, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Stubs are to hold a place for an article when there's noplace else to put the info</i>. In this instance the info can go in one of the more general Mormonism articles. <i>Scope for expansion</i> I never said there's no scope for expansion; I agree that there is scope for expansion. I explained why I think the existence of scope for expansion is not a good reason to keep a stub. It's like saying we should keep an article about some some unknown musician or author because she "might become famous". Let her become famous first, <i>then</i> we can add an article. Expand the info about &lt;whatever&gt; in some other article first, <i>then</i> split it off to a separate article once the parent article starts becoming unbalanced or overlarge. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 21:15, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it is not like that. That is another misapplication of a principle to something that is unrelated. Authors who "might become famous" have nothing written about them now. This article, on the other hand, has scope for expansion <i>from material that currently exists</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>By the way, I <i>did</i> read what's cited, and it's very, very little to work with. As BigHaz mentioned, being mentioned in an interest-specific encyclopedic doesn't do anything to establish that it's of sufficient importance to merit an article here. From personal experience, after five years in the LDS Church, I don't ever recall hearing or reading any discourses on animals in Mormon theology. Thorough citations on an unsignificant topic don't make it more important. It was a good intention, and it may find a home on an LDS-specific wiki. If consensus is in favor of deletion or a redirect, perhaps it could be userfied to UncleG so he can use it elsewhere. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 16:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are, in effect, applying the "I've never heard of it." criterion to this article. That is an exceedingly poor criterion to apply to decide whether an article should be deleted, and one that is generally rejected. If you want a notability criterion, consider the primary one from <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, et al.: A subject should be the subject of multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the subject. This topic clearly is. <i>It even cites a few of those published works.</i> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:39, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One of many criteria applied, and while "who's heard what" isn't always a good determinant of a subject's importance, it isn't always bad either. In any case, you miss my point — the intention was to illustrate how rarely the topic is brought up. If you can find any discourse, spoken or written, by a General Authority of the LDS Church (for outsiders, that is more or less what could be considered "official") focusing solely on animals in the same manner in which this article treats them, please, post it up. Problem is, I doubt it exists. This is patched together from a scattering of brief statements drawn from different sources, and even then, the article is filled with supposition. Whittle it down, and you're left with material that may be appropriate in a larger doctrinal article, but not meriting its own. I think you'd be hard pressed to find any authoritative LDS Church statement mentioning the significance of its animal theology. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 04:13, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> This article needs work, to be sure. But I think the information is interesting enough, particularly because it differs from the views of some other forms of Christianity that hold that animals have no souls at all. This difference should be noted somewhere, be it in this article, in another article on Mormonism (for example, it says that they believe that animals have immortal spirits so the article on whichever afterlife kingdom they're believed to go to, Celestial, Terrestrial, or Telestial, <i>might</i> be the right place), or in an article on the views of animals in general as Smerdis suggested. One benefit of keeping this article is that in merging, it would be difficult to decide where to merge to and the info might be broken up into many pieces (some in the articles on Mormon beliefs in before life, some in after life, some elsewhere, etc.) instead of being in one comprehensive article. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 20:21, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> This is not a trivial article or obscure point on LDS theology. The role the animal kingdom plays in relation to humanity (humans are animals, by the way) is an important theological question with perhaps more questions than answers, but a valid question nonetheless. LDS are but one Christian church whose leaders have evidently commented on the significance of animal life, but animals are important to many more than just LDS, including non-Christian perspectives. These should be included also. When article expansion is initiated, the discussion merits careful navigation to preserve NPOV simply because I suspect there are a multitude of voices on the issue. The broader Christian view needs to be navigated carefully (including LDS), but I believe it can be done. Interestingly enough, CS Lewis devotes an entire essay in The Problem of Pain (ISBN: 0060652969) titled "Animal Pain" that parses the moral and physical intracacies of animal life, especially in their relation to humanity. Clearly, animals are important in his fiction as well and take on roles of sacrifice, redemption, deceit, suffering, valor (Reepicheep), and transcendance (Lewis has remarked in Mere Christianity something to the effect..."Isn't that how the higher thing always raises the lower?...how our pets seem human, and in the end that's what they almost become," to paraphrase from memory. Thus, an article dealing with just the LDS view is, I think, a little too narrow in the broader scope of the issue, albeit very, very interesting...it merely needs expansion, context, and additional references, not deletion! I don't think we should abandon valid information, regardless if it appears to be an unfrequently traveled religious issue. There are thousands of current Wiki articles that any random schmuck could point a finger at and say "too trivial" or "no import whatsoever." Look, frankly I don't perceive this information to be in error or obscure at all. It's an important moral question. Yes, the recent edits are far from transcendant, so clearly it needs to be expanded or merged (however, given the contentious climate at the main <a href="../../../l/d/s/LDS_Church_bdf6.html" title="LDS Church">LDS Church</a> article, I doubt that a proposed merge would be adopted easily).

<li><b>Keep</b> Compared to lots of other star wars-related material in the encyclopedia, this stuff is somewhat culturually significant and is interesting to quite a few star wars fans, including the not-too-crazed. It's also relatively non-<a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>-y in that it pulls a lot of related material together in a single article instead of spewing it to 20 separate articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> Regardless of the intrinsic quality of the article, I feel that Star Wars/Lucas Wikipedia articles should have significance beyond the Star Wars community, whereas this article is by definition and in practice entirely inward-looking. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 13:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with the sentiment that Wikipedia articles should have significance beyond the Star Wars community, but that "community" is a tiny subset of "people have have seen the movies" or even "people who are fans of the movies". I think this article reaches well outside of the tiny subset that can reasonably be called the "Star Wars community". I'm not even in the largest of those groups mentioned (I've seen some of the SW movies but not all, I don't own any SW videos or merchandise, and I'm not remotely a SW fan) but I liked the article. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 21:24, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the stuff in the article is appropriate for Wikipedia, given the depth of SW-related coverage that WP editors have already deemed appropriate without serious controversy. I have some minor reservations about the article existing as a separate article, as opposed to splitting out its contents to the articles about the individual films. But that's a matter of editorial discretion, and there's benefit to putting it all in one place like that. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 01:57, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is part of a pile of spam left around by Cluster Resources, which had posted a now-deleted vanity article and also stuck spam links into numerous computer-related articles. Since this particular article is about an open source program it might have some tiny amount of merit. See also:</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> this article doesn't have anything to do with home PC's but I do think that supercomputer software is an ok topic for the encyclopedia. A quick look around shows the program is not really nn. If I can find some appropriate parallel computing article to put the info, I may merge it there.

<p>Unencyclopedic list of random cities with a claim of a certain number of hills in their vicinity. Appears to serve no encyclopedic purpose. Has been tagged for lack of references for over a month, no-one has yet replied to my query on the talk page as to the purpose of the article. I recently reverted an anon user's insertion of a line that said "this article is talking crap" which is a pov that I have some sympathy for. This page has though been in existence for over two years.

</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's informative, and encyclopedic, and I don't see how it's crufty as it's all non-trivial information. There is a growing phenomenon of "listcruftcruft" here, of which votes for deletion here are a prime example. You can't just nominate a list for deletion simply because it's a list and you don't happen to be interested in it. Save the lists. Every encyclopedia has lists. As for this particular list, many cities make the Seven Hills claim, and it is noted in the title that this is only a <i>claim</i> and not a verified fact stated by each city. To the author, if you need any help editing this to meet the criticism, I'll be happy to help, drop me a line. Superbo 15:13, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment 1</b> To clarify matters, this AfD now covers two articles. There's <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy%27s_Bucket_70df.html" title="Troy's Bucket">Troy's Bucket</a>, which is currently a disambiguation page and Troy's Bucket (webcomic), which is an article for the webcomic. <i>Warning: Administrivia follows.</i> Initially <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy%27s_Bucket_70df.html" title="Troy's Bucket">Troy's Bucket</a> was just about the webcomic and that was the article nominated for deletion. It was later copy-and-paste moved to Troy's Bucket (webcomic), and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy%27s_Bucket_70df.html" title="Troy's Bucket">Troy's Bucket</a> was turned into a dab. To keep contributor attribution in order, I have undone the copy-and-paste and re-implemented it as a proper move; it now exists at Troy's Bucket (webcomic). I split off the edit that created the dab and left it back at <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy%27s_Bucket_70df.html" title="Troy's Bucket">Troy's Bucket</a>.

<p><s>*<b>Strong delete, no merge</b> Dicdef, probably already at Urban Dictionary where it belongs. Please don't vote "merge," as that is a "keep" vote. Also, I suspect that the young woman in the picture wearing nothing but semen and a smile may be using the article as a forum for exhibitionism of homemade pornography, since she uploaded the picture herself. My suspicions are further supported by the fact that the picture does not, in fact, depict a pearl necklace, but rather a simple "facial." The idea of the "pearl necklace" is not an important topic in sexual activity, and is more of a joke than anything else (cf. the ZZTop song "Pearl Necklace"). Yes, it is possible to ejaculate on women in many different ways, none of which are encyclopedic, in my opinion. Erik the Rude 17:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<li>Hello, Jeff. I'm not surprised that you're here, as this is one of your areas of special interest, sexual slang in Wikipedia. I'll be polite and not dig up your history of time after time defending puerile sexual slang and then wave it in your face as other users do. Indeed, you must have the soul of an appeals attorney who specialises in capital crimes, and I commend you for your due diligence. Maybe there should be a Wiki project that deals more rigourously with sexual slang than does Urban Dictionary. Wikipedia, however, is not that project, nor are we Partridge's Dictionary of English Slang. All I can say is, Wikipedia is not a dictionary, Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and Wikipedia is not a dictionary. Magister Erik the Rude 23:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Having done the Hawaiian muscle fuck myself, against my own will, I might add as I was coerced by a kinky girlfriend with 36D's, I can't see how a pearl necklace is the logical end of the act. A dribbler would most likely dribble semen onto the superior sternum, which would then pool at the cricoid region and run superiorly into the carotid sinuses, lateral to the trachea and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It's also very possible that the semen would be shot between the breasts, on the belly, or dribble down the belly. A shooter would just blow it all over the chest or face in a blob and spatter pattern. To properly execute a pearl necklace, which I haven't done, one would have to dribble semen at the midline of the neck, superior to the clavicles. I don't think it's that easy to execute properly, it's almost certainly no fun because of the technical skill and control involved, which is why I think it is no more than a joke. Also, the viscosity of the semen would be a possible problem. Some semen is too viscous to "dribble" or "run." I'd be interested in some first-hand reports of successful pearl necklaces. Maybe some research could be conducted at Wikimania 2006, and if this crap doesn't belong in BJAODN, I don't know what does. Maybe merge it all to Deposition of semen during human sexual intercourse.

<li>She was sitting on the floor, reclining against the couch. I was more or less upright, and since it's almost impossible to aim one's dick, I probably would have shot on her belly.

<dd><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titfuck.html" title="Titfuck">Titfuck</a> is good and should possibly be the primary name of the article if kept. I used "Hawaiian muscle fuck" for cacophemistic humor. However, I still maintain that all the articles on shooting semen on women during sex should be in one place. Folks, it's hard to aim unless you're a professional or you're less than 6 inches from the target. Even porn stars screw up and shoot the lady in the eye. Most of us have seen that many times.

<li>I don't know a whole lot about the station except that I like it. I use wikipedia all the time to look up things but this is the first time I felt inclined to edit any of the entries. I looked up breakthru on here the other day and saw it was up for deletion. I don't really understand the editing process but I'll do whatever I can to not delete it. I've gotten to know tons of bands from lots of different countries because of this station. I even have met one of their DJ's who I assume started the entry from its record. Her and I are from the same town and I see her at every show. If she is any indication as to what the site stands for than it needs to be on here. I'm not aware of their press releases and I'm not very knowledgeable about computers but I'd think that they do get millions of listners. A lot of kids at my highschool listen and I know their friends do to. I did a google search on Alexa and it's just one type of browser right? from the people I've met through myspace that listen to breakthru, they are all from other countries. I'm not trying to defend that statement, just that I really like this station and they deserve to be on wikipedia. again i don't know alot about wikipedia (other than looking up stuff) and I'm not a writer.

<li>In regard to Tychocat’s comment “If you have multiple non-trivial articles by uninvolved third-parties, please bring them out” may I present a rip from the tv show “Car Crazy” produced by Meguiar's one of the worlds biggest car enthusiast products producer and presented by Damon Duprez, one of Australians most recognized motoring journalists&#160;: <a href="http://simon.firesport.com/ccs13divxhigh.avi" class="external free" title="http://simon.firesport.com/ccs13divxhigh.avi" rel="nofollow">http://simon.firesport.com/ccs13divxhigh.avi</a> . I also have many print media references that I would be happy to scan and upload to my server if required. Simply because you do not know of this community does not give you the right to belittle it; in fact isn’t the purpose of an encyclopedia to educate people about that which they do not know or understand? Performanceforums.com has over 11000 members and has been a great technical reference for the Australian motoring enthusiast community for over 5 years now and deserves to be accurately represented on wiki.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The Performance Forums entry is quite an accurate reflection of the online community contained within &amp; therefore should remain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even the list of facts at the end which appears to be random tongue in cheek dribble is comprised of notable quotes taken from memorable threads going back a number of years. People in the community know exactly what these references mean &amp; knowing some of this history could be of potential benefit to a new user. -Ash H</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The wiki entry will be cleaned up over the next few days, and will reflect the light hearted banter of the forum itself. It will serve as an important reference for people who are interested in the history and background of an important web resource for car enthusiasts in Australia. - signed on behalf of bigmuz/nikki Mrtwrx 12:02, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This forum is one of the longest-running Australian-based forums pertaining to automotive technology, having been around since November 2001, and is fairly well known amongst other Australian forums for it's focus on technical and performance issues related to car ownership and modification/tuning. If this article is modified to give a more historic view and neutral portrayal of Performance Forums, and remove some things like the top 100 list, surely it can be saved from deletion. -Bulgogi

<p>Sorry... I must nominate this article, even though I love Eurovision to bits. This is non-notable, and not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopædia - at least, not as its own separate article.

<li><b>Comment</b>I'd be interested to hear from you and other fans a list of who you think are the major characters.. perhaps they could keep their own pages. However ghits alone will not justify it.. for someone to have their own Wikipedia page they have to have a notable impact not only on the sci-fi universe or the fan community, but on the real world. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 15:48, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> I don't think they need seperate pages, but it's worth having one page with information about all the major characters from the show. If you're keeping individual pages for the major characters, I'd say Blake, Avon and Servalan would qualify. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 16:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is Articles for <i>deletion</i>. Only come here if you want an article <i>deleted</i>. Merger does not involve deletion at any stage.
<p>As per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lyta_Alexander_7452.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lyta Alexander">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lyta Alexander</a>, this nomination is misguided. Again, research turns up plenty of secondary source material on these characters. What is required is for these articles to cite it, to allow editors to see how much secondary source material there is on these subjects. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:19, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You could have said the above without the additional "this nomination is misguided" comment. Let's try to be nice, please. Also, the nomination mentions deletion and merging as an alternative, so having it under AFD is fine. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> 17:36, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's nothing not nice about saying that a nomination is misguided, and this nomination <i>is</i> misguided, for the reason that I gave. If someone wants something merged, they should <i>not</i> nominate it for deletion. One cannot merge content that is deleted. Either one wants the articles deleted outright, or not. If one wants a merger, then one does not. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:02, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Blake, Avon, Cally, Servalan; possibly merge the rest. Not a job for AfD either way.

<li>Whatever problems these articles may or may not have, lack of information is not one of them. There's been several books covering Blake's 7 (e.g. the unofficial <i>Liberation: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Blake's 7</i> and <i>A History and Critical Analysis of Blakes 7, the 1978-81 British Television Space Adventure</i>) as well as lots of coverage in TV and sci-fi publications like Starlog, Radio Times, Cult Times, etc. Some of the actors involved have even written autobiographies, I know Paul Darrow has. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:41, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Show is sufficiently notable that individual character bios are appropriate.

<li><b>Keep all</b> per the same arguments in the Babylon 5 AfD. Some of these characters may well be minor and should be merged into a "minor characters" article, but there is no reason to delete all.

<li><b>Keep all</b> each of these characters can be expanded on and improved. Moving them to one page will limit them. The assertion by the nominator that they are not important or interesting is subjective.

<li><b>Comment</b> My opinion is the minor characters should be deleted and the major characters should be merged. I hope people will, as Mallanox suggests, treat it with caution. I am sorry if this has been percieved as misuse of AfD.

<p>Non-notable persona (since when is every person <i>accused</i> of raping and murdering a child entitled to their own Wikipedia article?)

<li><b>Strong delete</b>* No notability as of yet, and given that his trial will not take place for some time, there is very little reliable comment that can be made. Dante Arthurs is not even notable should he be convicted of murder, as murders are fairly regular in the Perth area. I say 'strong', because it is evident to me that even while denying the James Bulger connection in the text, the author(s) are trying to promote it. That seems to be the central reason why this page has been posted. I also suspect that they are looking for a platform to publicise Dante Arthur's identity for its' own sake. This is a misuse of the open editing policy of the wiki. I note on the deletion discussion page that at least one of the authors is still defending this article on the basis of the same discredited rumour. If the rumour turns out to be true (extremely unlikely), the level of denial at government and police level will be the main point of interest. In the meantime, this article should be removed as swiftly as possible to defend Wikipedia's reputation. <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrepull_3d3f.html" title="User:Centrepull">Centrepull</a> 06:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The camera hardly ever lies. The non-coincdental similarities between the two are there for all to see. The article should remain on this basis alone. These pictures were obtained from public, unbiased sources - the West Australian Newspaper and the BBC. Elpocoloco 14:26, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote</b>. Probably some of these should be considered minor characters (and merged) while other major characters might warrant their own articles. Really though, I'm fine with whatever editors would like to do, as long as someone is willing to do the work. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 16:02, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Appears to be POV nomination based on the presumption that none of the characters are "interesting" enough. Too many articles to lump together into one AfD page. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 16:06, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Whoa!</b> This is a bit severe based on Wikipedia precedent on starring, major, and semi-major characters. I will acquiesce that several of these characters <i>are</i> too minor and NN to qualify for their own articles, but many are blatently not.
<p>For starters, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delenn.html" title="Delenn">Delenn</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zack_Allen_2f25.html" title="Zack Allen">Zack Allen</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Franklin_b894.html" title="Stephen Franklin">Stephen Franklin</a>, <a href="../../../g/27/k/G%27Kar_de2a.html" title="G'Kar">G'Kar</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Garibaldi_ea04.html" title="Michael Garibaldi">Michael Garibaldi</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Ivanova_b3b3.html" title="Susan Ivanova">Susan Ivanova</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lennier.html" title="Lennier">Lennier</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londo_Mollari_3124.html" title="Londo Mollari">Londo Mollari</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Cole_101f.html" title="Marcus Cole">Marcus Cole</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheridan_%28Babylon_5%29_aab9.html" title="John Sheridan (Babylon 5)">John Sheridan</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Sinclair_6f58.html" title="Jeffrey Sinclair">Jeffrey Sinclair</a> are <i>all</i> major, starring characters — as distinguished in the show's opening credits. They, in no way, fail <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> for their own pages, and I lean towards assuming bad faith on their nominations. Several others starred in many episodes and are integral characters in the show's several arcs and probably also deserve their own pages, (although not so obviously as the former examples) such as <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosh.html" title="Kosh">Kosh</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morden_%28Babylon_5%29_ed25.html" title="Morden (Babylon 5)">Mr. Morden</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Bester_%28Babylon_5%29_2607.html" title="Alfred Bester (Babylon 5)">Bester</a>.</p>
<p>I will not, however, contest the <b>merge</b> of several of these articles into their applicable associated characters and episodes; <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Mollari_I_5148.html" title="Emperor Mollari I">Emperor Mollari I</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Ironheart_d77e.html" title="Jason Ironheart">Jason Ironheart</a>, and <a href="../../../d/u/k/Dukhat.html" title="Dukhat">Dukhat</a> jump to me immediately. Alternatively, a List of minor characters in the <i>Babylon 5</i> universe (similar to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Firefly_universe_0b96.html" title="List of minor characters in the Firefly universe">List of minor characters in the <i>Firefly</i> universe</a> could be established for these imfliential, although minor characters.</p>
<p>Finally, <i>why</i> were all of these AFD nominations lumped together instead of being nominated separately so as to discuss the worthiness and merits of each individual article on its own? — <b><a href="../../../p/d/_/User%7EPd_THOR_e92e.html" title="User:Pd THOR"><span style="color:#CC0000;">pd_THOR</span></a></b> <sup>| <b><a href="../../../p/d/_/User_talk%7EPd_THOR_67ac.html" title="User talk:Pd THOR">=/\=</a></b> | 16:19, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</sup></p>

<li>This is Articles for <i>deletion</i>. Only come here if you want an article <i>deleted</i>. Merger does not involve deletion at any stage.
<p>There's plenty of secondary source material to be had on the subject of the major characters in this television series, and the majority of the articles listed in the nomination are major characters. These articles all should cite sources, so that editors can see that the size of these articles is based upon the amount of secondary source material available. But deletion doesn't achieve that. As per <a href="../../../p/d/_/User%7EPd_THOR_e92e.html" title="User:Pd THOR">pd_THOR</a>, <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:12, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> all, with no prejudice on renominating some of the genuinely minor bit characters in separate AFD, but this list includes the key characters. If you want to delete John Sheridan and Jeffrey Sinclair, what's next, going after <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_T._Kirk_07e0.html" title="James T. Kirk">James T.

<li><b>Keep</b>, possibly individually renominate some of the truly minor ones. Many of these are central characters and clearly notable enough for articles. Examples: <i>Londo +Babylon</i> scores 187,000 Google hits, <i>Garibaldi +Babylon</i> scores 239,000, <i>Sheridan +Babylon</i> scores 912,000, etc. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:59, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, bad nomination because it is impossible to separate the wheat from the chaff. Many of the characters are major characters of or play a significan rolls in <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a> and can have their own articles per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 19:42, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would not be opposed to combining some of the lesser characters (ones with little or no source-backed text) into a "list of minors" per pd_THOR, but this nomination seems motivated more by disgust with fictional-character articles in general, not because of their sourceable material. I can understand it, as there seem to be many more folks that would like to write about <i>B5</i> characters than, say, asteroid classifications.

<li><b>Comment</b> Amen to that. But kindly clarify something.. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> says that non-notable minor characters should be merged into one article. Surely if something is non-notable, it shouldn't be in Wikipedia at all.. or are they specially worthy of inclusion on the grounds that they are fictional characters? <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 00:01, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, per the obvious precendent of major characters from major media works having their own articles. Would be fine to have a few of those in the rather extensive nomination being combined into a "minor characters of" list, but AFD isn't really needed for that. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 23:18, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Most of these characters are all characters that are important to the various arcing storylines of B5. Granted I don't know if they all deserve their own pages but they don't deserve outright deletion. Zessa 19:06, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as a mass nomination - would vote differently on individual articles, but can't support a mass deletion like this. 24.136.38.121 04:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The show is one thing, but has anyone forgotten the mass of books? It's an entire universe. Bester has two books out of the Psi Corps trilogy written pretty much about him.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is...unreasonable to nominate so many characters simultaneously. It is beyond unreasonable when the list includes major characters (i.e., people whose names and/or portraits appear in the opening credits for any season, as another user has commented). If <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_T._Kirk_07e0.html" title="James T. Kirk">Kirk</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">O'Neill</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Bauer_3872.html" title="Jack Bauer">Bauer</a> can have their own articles, Sheridan deserves his own. This should be broken down into individual nominations since there is room for debate on a few of these. There are two big names up there that could be merged by one interpretation of the rules, but doing so would make the entire article a giant spoiler.
<p>With regards to Zarbulon's comment of 23 July about notability: the minor characters as a class are notable because they are part of something notable. Major characters are notable of themselves. A good analogy would be an organization's website, which may devote a separate page to its leadership while ordinary members get little blurbs on a single page and perhaps links to private sites.--24.178.78.179 08:37, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Future albums released by bands or musicians are all over Wikipedia (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Upcoming_albums" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Upcoming_albums" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>). If you check, this is listed on their official site (see news <a href="http://www.againstme.net/1024index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.againstme.net/1024index.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>), Fat Wreck Chord's site <a href="http://www.fatwreck.com/record/detail/716" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fatwreck.com/record/detail/716" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, and on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G73TZA/sr=8-1/qid=1153585803/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2724794-7559944?ie=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G73TZA/sr=8-1/qid=1153585803/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2724794-7559944?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. And to Artw, is that supposed to be a biased statement? Not to assume anything but it sounds like you don't want an article for a release by them because you don't like the band. Most of their other albums by the band have articles for them. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharpdust_d2c9.html" title="User:Sharpdust"><span style="color:orange">sharp</span></a><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7ESharpdust_0ad6.html" title="User talk:Sharpdust"><span style="color:green">dust</span></a> 16:36, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see Wikipedia as a place for track listings for albulms that have no inherent notability (notability that would come through widespread cultural impact of some kind). To be honest I have no idea what the actual policy is on this, and others may disagree, but it seems like a reasonable opinion. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 17:54, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To ArtW: What exactly do you mean by widespread cultural impact? Like what album released has ever made a widespread cultural impact? The only thing that comes to mind are albums released by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> (<a href="../../../s/g/t/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band_4fdc.html" title="Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band">Sgt._Pepper's_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band</a>), <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wall_cd64.html" title="The Wall">The Wall</a>, or <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevermind.html" title="Nevermind">Nevermind</a>) as they definitively made an impact on music. If that were the case, then thousands upon thousands of album articles would need to be deleted because nothing recently has made that much of an impact. As far as I'm concerned, any album released (released as in stores or online, not out of the trunk of someone's car) by a musician should be allowed to have an article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharpdust_d2c9.html" title="User:Sharpdust"><span style="color:orange">sharp</span></a><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7ESharpdust_0ad6.html" title="User talk:Sharpdust"><span style="color:green">dust</span></a> 22:23, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the general rule is that the existence of other articles which perhaps shouldn't be here (future albums etc etc) doesn't mean that any specific article of that type needs to be here - so just because there are other forthcoming albums around the place doesn't mean that this one needs to be here. Without having looked at the entire category, I can't speculate on why they're there, but it's presumably a notability thing - albums by big-name artists tend to be more notable than debuts by relative unknowns, f'rinstance. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 01:56, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To BigHaz: Notability is a matter of opinion. And this is not a debut by a relatively unknown, they have been around for awhile. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharpdust_d2c9.html" title="User:Sharpdust"><span style="color:orange">sharp</span></a><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7ESharpdust_0ad6.html" title="User talk:Sharpdust"><span style="color:green">dust</span></a> 22:23, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have to agree with deleting the article. While I like this band, the album is not out yet. I think the article should be deleted for now and then put back up when the album actually comes out.

<li><b>Delete</b>, but I take issue with those claiming this exists solely in CoolKatt's amazing imagination. It almost seems like some of the the events themselves would have to be untrue in order for the events that are to be disconnected, and it looks like they aren't. The idea that the Fox/New World and ABC/Scripps deals, at least, were connected doesn't appear to be, at least solely, CoolKatt's: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WJZ-TV&amp;diff=48810078&amp;oldid=46536394" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WJZ-TV&amp;diff=48810078&amp;oldid=46536394" rel="nofollow">[12]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WJZ-TV&amp;diff=55487635&amp;oldid=55487125" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WJZ-TV&amp;diff=55487635&amp;oldid=55487125" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, and the ABC/Scripps and CBS/Group W connection has been in the <a href="../../../w/j/z/WJZ_312e.html" title="WJZ">WJZ</a> article for a full year: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WJZ-TV&amp;diff=20617473&amp;oldid=20417172" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WJZ-TV&amp;diff=20617473&amp;oldid=20417172" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. The only event it seeks to connect with the others that seems disconnected is the formation of UPN and the WB. Yes, the name appears to be solely CoolKatt's, but if this article is to be deleted we'll want to delete references to "The Great Network Switch" in other articles, since that would appear to be a neologism. Yes, it is mostly unsourced and essentially consists of an essay, which is OR no matter how many sources you give it... but there <i>is</i> something to it.

<p>Speaking for the organization which is the subject of this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article was created by an anonymous opponent of the subject organization, and is false in most respects.</li>
<li>The article is possibly defamatory, e.g., the present section on "Acceptance by Mental Health Profession".</li>
<li>The article, and its associated talk page, will likely be the target of numerous anonymous edits that can be anticipated to be false and defamatory.</li>
<li>The subject organization does not desire to spend resources defending its reputation from "merciless editing" on Wikipedia, especially by correcting numerous falsehoods, defamations, and violations of Wikipedia policy which Administrators let stand.</li>
<li>Corrective edits by Wiki editors have been reverted and labelled "vandalism" by the creator of the article.</li>
<li>The article will likely become the object of edit wars, revert wars, or "fixated" editing on the part of supporters trying to defend the organization, which would lead to the editors being blocked, leaving the subject organization with no means of defense, and damaging the reputation and position of the editors.</li>
<li>The subject organization reserves the right to take any legal action that is appropriate if the page is allowed to continue.</li>
<li>The article was not created in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>. The anonymous creator of the article has been a participant in many talk page discussions wherein he has called a "fringe" organization. A "fringe" group by definition does not meet Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion in the main namespace, so creating it was not an act of good faith.</li>
<li>The article is not likely to contribute anything to making Wikipedia "a great encyclopedia" and more likely would be disruptive to Wikipedia and its administrators. Larry Sarner 17:12, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- <b>vote undecided</b> at moment: if you think that the current article is biased, I'd say, rather than deletion, rewrite it unless it's thoroughly unsalvageable.

<ul>
<li><b>Leave</b>The article does need more material, but it has a place in an encyclopedia:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>It is referenced in other articles and spaces in Wikipedia. Readers may have an interest in reading about the group and should have a convenient way to get information.</li>
<li>Many other advocacy groups and organizations have Wikipedia articles.</li>
<li>Controversial topics are excellent subjects for encyclopedia articles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the objections raised by one of the group's leaders, I would make the following comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allegedly false comments can be disputed on the talk page and, if there is not support, deleted.</li>
<li>Controversial topics go garner opposiing views. The Wikipedia consensus building process can manage that. If there can be articles about such "hot" topics as Nazi Germany, Abortion, etc. then certainly Wikipedia can contain and manage this.</li>
<li>Fringe groups are certainly do have pages. See, for example <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi-Skinheads_517f.html" title="Nazi-Skinheads">Nazi-Skinheads</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I can appreciate Mr. Larry Sarner's concerns, I don't believe those concerns should lead to the supression of information that may be of value to Wikipedia users. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 18:23, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - if I were pressed at the moment, I'd say "weak delete" based on non-notability (though some research on the subject might change my mind). However, I'm with Nlu on this; there are other ways to resolve POV issues without having an article deleted. Please see if any resolution can be met by discussing these issues on the article's Talk page. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 19:55, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<b>Keep Article and Add to it'</b> -- This is a subject worthy of an article. The group is cited in several Wikipedia articles and is linked to a notable and sad story. I come to Wikipedia to get information (and occassionally to edit pages). Having access to information, even if difficult and conflicted, is important.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is relevant. The group has published a book and several articles to advance its cause.

As such it is a legitimate topic for a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkWood_41ab.html" title="User:MarkWood">MarkWood</a> 15:59, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> The fate of the attempts to edit (correct and improve) the article while it has been pending has borne out the nominator's initial concerns about the article. It is not even possible to call for the verification of possible misstatements of fact (reverts immediately ensue when attempted). No secondary sources are cited about the subject organization (just its own website). If the article is kept, is it possible to keep it on a "probationary" basis so that if the article fails to develop in a reliable way, it can be again nominated for deletion without the nominator being accused of vandalism or some breach of good faith? I would invite all uninvolved commentators here to please visit the article from time to time to see what is happening. Larry Sarner 23:41, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No article ever has such a sacred status that it can't be nominated for deletion if there are good reasons for it. In this case, it seems the article will be kept primarily because it should be allowed to develop. In my experience, after about two months of relative inactivity, claims that the article "could improve" wouldn't be taken so seriously. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 01:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Further query:</b> Would "inactivity" be the only standard? For instance, would it be a reasonable basis for nominating it for deletion if the article failed to improve beyond being an original essay by the subject's critics, as it is now? I can foresee that there might be plenty of "activity", but it is all just making the article more and more of an original essay, with a major part of that activity being nothing more than reverting (or defending) changes concerning lack of verifiability. If that indeed happens, and such is actually a basis for deletion, how should one judge the situation reasonably to bring the article's back here? Larry Sarner 17:59, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I can understand your frustration in wanting this article deleted and that not occuring, but let's not try to get agreement on how it will be deleted if this or that occurs.

<li>Agreed, this is turning into a bit of a mess. Anybody commenting here should be looking through each article, not looking at a couple and then commenting. They can't do that if articles are getting added during the process. I suggest that this discussion is restarted with a fixed number of articles. If any other are identified later, they should be added to a new discussion.

<p>Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety. One measure of publicity is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line). Less well-known people may be mentioned within other articles, in this case within the Konnie Huq (her sister) article. Also this page is incorrectly listed under the British Politican stub, This person was merely a candidate and failed to be become a Member of the European Parliament for the North West 84.69.85.231 18:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety. Which is exactly the cast with this article on Dr Huq. She is the most substantial female politician to emerge from british asian women. At the moment there is not one single british asian women in parliament depsite the significant contribution that asian women make to british society. Therefore being twice a parliamentary candidate is a significant achievement that should be recorded on wiki, which is supposed to be a comprehensive source of information and not open to political manipulation.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It needs clarification and consensus as to how far down the system football clubs in England go and still rank as "notable". This lot play at Level 18. Most of the clubs down to about Level 11 (and an ever increasing number of those below that) appear to have their own article. I love non-league football (semi-professional/amateur football below the top four divisions for those of you not in the UK!), but I think what we've got now seems a bit over-the-top. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 20:10, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I could call many commercial movies commercialcruft too but I don't want to delete them. Projects should not be judged only because it's fan work otherwise someone could have the stupid idea and call even Wikipedia fancruft because it's not commercial and made also by amateurs. Deleting of articles about important fan films would be a great lack for Wikipedia and there is absolutely no need for it. The fan film scene is an important and growing scene and should not be excluded by Wikipedia. It should not only be made a decision for not deleting these articles but a general decision to keep articles about fan films with a certain popularity with perhaps at least 500 or 1000 Google entries because such article get requests for deleting from some ignorants with no good reason frequently. Someone who is not interested in this stuff should just ignore these sites but not request to delete them. I'm also not interested in every article of Wikipedia but I don't make a request for deleting. 217.184.70.211 23:38, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First off, I am the article's creator, apologies if I should have stated that. I thought it may satisfy the third criterion as the site's content is also distributed as part of the wide <a href="../../../a/m/n/AMN_bb89.html" title="AMN">AMN</a> network, which is also responsible for the site's hosting. Additionally, the site's podcasts can be found on iTunes. The Alexa rank is low only as it has dipped in the past month or so - it has been 80,000 and higher. I guess another argument would be that of Futility's on the AMN AfD page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Advanced_Media_Network" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Advanced_Media_Network" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> - which is that there are many other sites like this which do have articles. Nintendorks, <a href="../../../n/-/s/N-sider.html" title="N-sider">N-sider</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_GameCube_73ff.html" title="Planet GameCube">PGC</a> - all of the same popularity and visibility online. In my opinion, to argue that this needs deletion would be generalising that many, <i>many</i> other sites would have to be deleted too. <a href="../../../t/p/h/User%7ETphi_9358.html" title="User:Tphi">Tphi</a> 23:03, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> please don't take it personally. The only reason I didn't nominate PGC is because they do have mentions in major newspapers, like USA Today. On the other hand, the third criteria has limits to it as well - you can't host a page on Geocities and say it satisfies the third point. With the footnote, I find that the third point is strongly tied to the first. In addition, the Alexa rankings (though I do not always trust them) are actually vastly different for these "similar" sites. In fact, a lot of web articles get deleted (and sometimes we miss some - we are only human), because Wikipedia isn't really a web directory. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 16:51, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I see your points, though Cube/Revo Europe has similarly been mentioned in the mainstream media, for example BBC News <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/1542906.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/1542906.stm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, which incidentally PGC is mentioned too in. <a href="../../../t/p/h/User%7ETphi_9358.html" title="User:Tphi">Tphi</a> 23:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The site is recognized among European Nintendo gamers. The previous owner, Tim Symons, was offered a job at Nintendo of Europe's HQ if I remember rightly; at the very least then the site is well-known within the industry. As has been said, Revo-Europe also comprises part of the AMN network.

<p><b><s>Delete (or</s> massively rewrite<s>)</s></b>. I have been watching this page for a while now and doubt that it can ever truly be NPOV. The included links are arbitrary, it would seem. Typically I would want to clean up a page like this, but I'm not sure how it could be done in an NPOV manner. I'd certainly withdraw the AfD nom if this article improves substantially. I would love to see this go from a list of random tourist sites in the US to an article about the tourism industry in the US. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENationalparks_868d.html" title="User:Nationalparks">Nationalparks</a> 21:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Its certainly a valid spin-off from the main subject, and its current trailer park state should warrant heavy editing, not deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>, the choice of links is inherently POV. What is the cutoff for articles to include in this? Why include <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zion_National_Park_94b9.html" title="Zion National Park">Zion National Park</a> if you aren't including <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Rainier_National_Park_338f.html" title="Mount Rainier National Park">Mount Rainier National Park</a>? Why include the cities in the list, but not others? Where do you draw the line? Inclusion of the articles might imply that one park or site or city is definitely better than another, hence my POV concerns. I wouldn't mind an expansion of the lead paragraph (but in generic terms) and a removal of the list items entirely. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENationalparks_868d.html" title="User:Nationalparks">Nationalparks</a> 22:33, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

Whatever you contribute to Wikipedia is not necessarily useful or interesting to everyone. But it can be good, useful, and informative to the people of the related country or certain region. Wikipedia is a very broad educational site it should not reflect with someone’s likes or dislikes. I do not feel there is any hero-worshipping. I support this article. I agree with <b>Obie09’s “Revise” July 24, 2006. (Not for deletion).</b> July26,2006</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I totally disagree with Ambuj Saxena’s comment. His objections are totally baseless and prejudiced. It seems to me that due to negative approach or attitude he is denying the facts.</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> as having little or no context. The articles give no indication of who Bable is, what it means to be a wrestler on this list, or where and for what purpose this list exists.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm sure we all feel sorry for your plight if you can't discuss things outside of the site, but that doesn't necessarily mean that an article on the Wikipedia is what you need. By all means report the manager of the site for vandalism (since it's not "his article" to decide what goes into it and what doesn't), but I'd suggest you look elsewhere for a means to discuss if that's the only reason you have for keeping it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 01:48, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I agree there and we have taken actions to file a complaint against the managers. But the point remains that the UGCC has become more than just a Forums, it has become also a haven for people and a large ammount of contraversy is caused because of it that is worth being addressed, even as a subarticle of the GraalOnline (which it really is meant to be) --<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarcaptain_c047.html" title="User:Warcaptain">Warcaptain</a> 02:21, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are lots of places we could put it, but the managers claim that when we link (before we just linked right to the UGCC instead of to this wikipedia article) that we were advertising by making every mention of the UGCC a link.. ie: having something in the criticism section like: "Many people have created fan forums for the game as a reaction to the strict rules, ie: the <a href="http://www.graalians.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.graalians.com/" rel="nofollow">Unofficial Graal Communication Center</a>." They make a big effort to say this is not allowed because they 'do not allow this link to be posted on graal sites' even though we tell them that Wikipedia is not Graal Online, it is its own entity. As soon as the managers User:Graal unixmad and User:Stefan Knorr are blocked from vandalizing the Graal Online article, I will have no problem deleting this article. Until then there really needs to be a page where the concerns of the players can be heard. --<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarcaptain_c047.html" title="User:Warcaptain">Warcaptain</a> 02:49, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are misunderstanding us. It is a large part of the Graal community. It has as much relevance to Graal, and belongs there just as much, as the official forums. Most, if not all, of the UGCC forum users are former official forum users. I agree that it shouldn't need its own article, but it certainly does belong in the GraalOnline article. <a href="../../../d/i/4/User%7EDi4gram_0c4f.html" title="User:Di4gram">Di4gram</a> 02:45, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And therein lies the problem. If it's relevant to the rest of the community, it belongs with the rest of the community. It doesn't appear to have enough notability on its own. If you can't get it into the main article for whatever reason, complain about the behaviour of those who are allegedly vandalising the article or take <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a>'s suggestion and set up a page elsewhere.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't imagine an encyclopedia without an entry for "Grocer". Grocer certainly does not equal "Supermarket". The article certainly needs expansion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 18:41, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Jessemonroy raises valid reasons to keep this article, actually, with a major rewrite discussing the historical evolution of the word. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 20:14, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I do think it deserves an article, but someone has to write it. It's not going to be me. If someone champions this, let it continue, else squash it now. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessemonroy650_0a9e.html" title="User:Jessemonroy650">meatclerk</a> 23:47, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
