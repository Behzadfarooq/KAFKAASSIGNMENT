<li>I'm still not persuaded about this guy. He's a minor academic who's written a book or two, at least one of which got pasted.

<li>To be entirely fair, it should be pointed out that he actually published (at least, but probably no more than) four books (another one is an omnibus reprint of three earlier ones in one volume). One of them (<i>Mammals: Their Latin names explained</i>, 1979) was given a pretty devastating review by Bryan P. Glass in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Quarterly_Review_of_Biology_839f.html" title="The Quarterly Review of Biology">The Quarterly Review of Biology</a></i> 1980, p. 85.

<li>According to the article he was "a retired teacher of physical education, anatomy and biology". He presumably had <i>some</i> academic education, but I see no evidence that he was actually a scientist. His books on Latin names of animals (three of the four books I could find) seem to have been rather unsystematic collections of curiosities, at least if the other ones were similar to the one I found a review for. There are certainly amateur scientists who have done important things, but Gotch does not seem to be one of them. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 14:29, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'd gently question <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a>'s logic. Monographs, whilst often not widely read, may have an important impact within a field {e.g. obviosly <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Species_3432.html" title="Origin of Species">Origin of Species</a>, and in my own field Quest of the Historical Jesus or Paul and Palestinian Judaism are good examples (I can't believe they just went red!)- but there are plenty of less well known ones). Reference works may be more widely read, but their contents are derivative and their intellectual impact usually negligible (and there are dozens of 'Dictionary of ....' 'encyclopaedia of ...' and 'introduction to...' in every field). Whilst obviously some have cultural impact (e.g. <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> many could have nothing more said about them than 'contains lots of info on the subject - and sold a lot of copies'. My own test for any non-fiction work would be: is it possible to write a paragraph on the 'influence and impact' of this work - if not, list it under 'references' in the relevant article (which is what I think <a href="../../../a/p/w/User%7EApwoolrich_41a8.html" title="User:Apwoolrich">Apwoolrich</a> should do here). --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 08:49, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I may not have been clear enough. I wrote "important but not yet classics", and was actually thinking of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Species_3432.html" title="Origin of Species">Origin of Species</a> as one of the works definitely belonging to the "classics" category. Normally, even a fairly significant monograph on some smaller topic would not be important enough to be treated as a subject of its own but is better treated in an article on its topic as well as mentioned briefly in an article characterizing its author (if s/he has done enough other things to deserve an article). A reference work such as this could possibly be mentioned in an article on the profession of railway engineering, but it is much more likely to be used around here the way <a href="../../../a/p/w/User%7EApwoolrich_41a8.html" title="User:Apwoolrich">Apwoolrich</a> is apparently using it, as a good reference source for articles on individual engineers. as such I think an article describing the work is useful. In either case, standards for including articles on books seem <i>de facto</i> to be quite inclusive. Just look at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Category%7EBook_stubs_1cd1.html" title="Category:Book stubs">Category:Book stubs</a>, and its subcategories, such as <a href="../../../n/o/n/Category%7ENon-fiction_book_stubs_f29c.html" title="Category:Non-fiction book stubs">Category:Non-fiction book stubs</a>. I occasionally get the impression that it is easier to get an article on a single book pass VfD than an article on a scholar who has published fifteen books ("just another nn college prof - publishing is what they do"). In either case, I think this is more useful than many other books for which we have articles and would like to see a policy discussion before I am willing to vote to delete this particular one. — A reasonable compromise, especially considering the size of this article, may however be to merge this with similar minor and specialized biographical dictionaries in a list in the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biographical_dictionary.html" title="Biographical dictionary">Biographical dictionary</a> article. Perhaps only the large multi-volume works with a long history (like <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_National_Biography_5c24.html" title="Dictionary of National Biography">DNB</a>) need to have articles of their own. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 09:48, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

I would be happy, if pushed, for the compromise of <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a>, if the alternative was deletion. In the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">Encyclopaedia</a> article is a listing of many historical ones, including several specialist titles, which might, I am sure, be argued for VfD on the grounds of non-notability. They are there as an historical record, and, more importantly, as a resource for readers and editors who might otherwise never get to learn of them - and use them in their writing. The internet is very weak indeed on information of this kind, and Wikipedia enables a record to be maintained, - hopefully in perpetuity.<a href="../../../a/p/w/User%7EApwoolrich_41a8.html" title="User:Apwoolrich">Apwoolrich</a> 18:23, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd suggest that if it's used as a reference in a wide range of articles, which I gather from context it is, then it's probably worthwhile <b>keep</b>ing - I mean, we think it's notable enough to use as a reputable source! Perhaps it'd be useful to link to it when you reference it on those pages, though? It means you can keep all the bibliographic information centralised; I've expanded it a little from catalogue research to cover both editions. Some notes on scope of the entries would be helpful, and make it a bit more than a simple catalogue entry - how summary is summary? is it good, accurate, well-written? - but I can't add those without reading a copy. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 02:11, 17 August 2005 (UTC) (Also, can you check if there are any illus.?

<li><b>Objection</b>: We do not infact know that it is a copyright violation. In fact, since <b>definitions can not be copyrighted</b>, it can not be a copyright violation and every dictionary seems to have the exact definition in question. Futhermore many articles are listed on Wikipedia, that are in fact copyrighted, including quotes from magazines and the results of various studies, but they are not presented in such a way as to take credit for the studies and sources are typically given. I would argue since the dictionary is given as a source and no one took credit for the definition, it is impossible for it to be a copyright violation. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaviX_e136.html" title="User:LucaviX">Lucavix</a> 00:07, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> seems to be a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free.html" title="Free">free</a> encyclopedia, NOT an encyclopedia enslaved to GFDL license. Thats why other licenses are also allowed here, although, most of the times, not in the main articles space but in users' pages</b>. The existence of many other licenses in many wikipedians users pages is against the GFDL <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/foundation_issue" class="extiw" title="m:foundation_issue">foundation issue</a> argument of yours, which is also supposed to apply to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> projects in general and not to wikipedia encyclopedia specifically. Wikipedia, having many different types of licenses in many user pages, seems to be an exception of the GFDL foundation issue. For example, have a look at the homepage of a wikipedia administrator which agrees with <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html#Dual_Licensing" title="User:Thryduulf">Dual Licensing</a> instead of having a single GFDL. As you can see, the userpages of wikipedians are already free from the GFDL slavery. One step beyond, lets free article space from GFDL dictatorship too, and let cached copyrighted documents to reside (for legal reasons only as protected ones) in the main article space, along with the rest GFDL licensed articles. And as long as wikipedia does not comply accurately to the foundation issues, give to the encyclopedic articles having any other license the chance to become wikipedian articles.</li>
<li>And here is another argument showing that <b>wikipedia does not comply to the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/foundation_issue" class="extiw" title="m:foundation_issue">foundation issues</a></b>. According to the third foundation issue, "<i>The wiki process is the final authority on article content</i>". <b>If wiki process is the final authority on article content then why locking or protecting pages is allowed here?</b></li>
<li>Could you also please tell us what is the exact copyright violation here? <b>You accuse that there is a copyvio here, without pointing to the exact copyrighted document!</b> If it is a dictionary copyvio, please tell us its name and its ISBN number.

<p>I would had liked to contribute to the artice, giving examples of proponents of various things, but since <b>someone</b> suggested a copyright violation even though the definitions of words can not be copyrighted, it seems I can not. Oh, and to that special <b>someone</b>, MSN, Google, and Dictionary.com all share the same definition. Gee, are they all committing copyright violations against eachother? Can you even provide evidence that a definition can be copyrighted? Since the US Supreme Court and the patient office both seem to dismiss attempts to copyright any definitions (typically by corporations like Microsoft) I highly doubt it. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaviX_e136.html" title="User:LucaviX">Lucavix</a> 00:14, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can still contribute to the article. I think the problem is not article's title, but article's content. Someone accused the content of beeing copyvio, and we are trying to find out whether the text contained inside the article is copyrighted or not. On the other hand "proponent" may be considered to be a word and not an article. If it is a word then according to policy (wikipedia is not a dictionary) both the content and the article title should be moved to wiki dictionary. Of course some names can be both articles and dictionary words. For example, have a look at the words <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a> or <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beautiful.html" title="Beautiful">Beautiful</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supporter.html" title="Supporter">Supporter</a> which can be found both here, and to wikidictionary. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemodike_059e.html" title="User:Demodike">Demodike</a> 06:39, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Google just pulls dictionary information by spidering and caching pages (which is why many times Wikipedia articles are found using the define: operator). And also, if the dictionary from which the content was <s>stolen</s> borrowed was made by a private corporation, and its contents not explicity licensed under Creative Commons, the GNU FDL, or put into the public domain, it <b>is</b> grounds for a {{copyvio}}}. <a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHosterweis_526c.html" title="User:Hosterweis">Hosterweis</a> <a href="../../../h/o/s/User_talk%7EHosterweis_7995.html" title="User talk:Hosterweis">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hosterweis_1012.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hosterweis">(contribs)</a> 03:11, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for answering to my first question. Could you please answer to my second question too? Supposing that all internet search engines that pull (and show) information by spidering and caching pages are illegal and guilty for copyright violations, then why they are still operational? And I have another question now. Internet search engines are caching for at least 10 years billion of billions of pages, and, as far as I know, they have not yet any serious legal problem. Do you think that wikipedia will be in danger if (and supposing that the content of "proponent" article is really a copyvio) we decide to keep, cache and protect the page instead of deleting it?<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemodike_059e.html" title="User:Demodike">Demodike</a> 06:41, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Because Wikipedia has quite a stricter copyright policy than most search engines, pretty much just to be on the safe side. And actually, many search engines (read: <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>) have been slapped around a bit with C&amp;Ds, not only for copyright stuff (and the DMCA), but for other things such as providing a medium for such content to spread.

<li>Hmm. This is <b>clearly</b> a vanity page. Equally clearly, this person is not well-known, and would ordinarily not be viewed as a person of sufficient significance or importance to merit mention in an encyclopedia. The greatest claim to fame appears to be in regards his political activities: eg. he's a member of the Democratic party, a delegate to various DNC conventions, etc. Most of the page lists his membership of organizations such as the NRA and various gay committees and groups. There is a curious section entitled "Politcal ancestry;" like everything else in the article it is unverified. There are two references, both books; it is unclear how relevant these are as source material for the subject (one is on the Sundance Film festival, the other a history of Salt Lake county). <b>Problems</b>: massive. This is an account of a largely unknown individual, which seems to stress his society memberships. The <b>notability</b> of any of it is difficult to see. All of the statements are unreferenced and most of the statements will be practically impossible to <b>verify</b> reliably without a great deal of primary research by Wikipedia editors. It is highly unlikely that the User is the subject of genuine research or <b>reputable study/reporting</b>. The <b>autobiographical</b> nature of the article gives rise to concerns of balance. All this results in a severe <b>NPOV</b> problem.

<li><b>Comment</b> Mr. Nelson, thank you for your comment. I agree with you that the article was well composed. WP has certain policies in place that are meant to encourage the creation of encyclopedic entries of notable subjects, and as a community we are all bound to uphold them. It is important to note that criteria like "notability" refer only to significance <i>with respect to the encyclopedia</i>, and not the enormous importance and significance all of us have to our own communites and the people around us. While the above autobiographical venture may not be especially suited to WP, a writer of your obvious talent and diligence is bound to be a valuable contributor to the project. I hope you will reconsider and decide to stay. Kind regards—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 06:14:02, 2005-08-16 (UTC)</li>

<li>With emphasis: I structured this article to resemble others. How exactly is it more NN or VAIN than, say, that of my acquaintance and Wikipedian Pete Ashdown (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Ashdown" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Ashdown" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Ashdown</a>)? I wrote mine; he wrote his. I described my more than 25 years in local, state and national politics and government; he described his ... months of experience. I'd hoped to include my more than 200 mainstream news media references (not knowing I'd be tarred "vain" in less than a day thereby making editorial additions seem moot and reactionary); he's apparently happy with a few hundred words about his rave dances and what amounts to an unauthorized political advertisement. And on, and on, and on. No, I'm certainly not going to reconsider staying on with the kind of group this is. Your "expert" Wikipedians leave much about writing and editing to be desired. They're seemingly more interested in quick-on-the-draw intellectual one-up-manship. And, Neurophyre, yes, I can, I did.

<ul>
<li>Hahnchen, that is truly an unsettling thought, isn't it? For a second it made me search myself, to wonder if that could possibly have contributed even an iota to my vote. I'm solid in the conviction that it couldn't, but the thought that people might face systematic bias in this way is always upsetting. My reaction to David's article was pretty straightforward. I thought it illustrated perfectly why writing about oneself is always problematic: if one is very famous and there is an embarrasment of sources available, there is the danger that only those supportive will be used; if one is less famous and there is little or no independent source material, there is a chance biases may not even be detected. The other problem is that people tend to focus on things that are personally important to them when they write about themselves. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, but an encyclopedia article is meant to be an unbiased, neutral exploration of many important aspects of the subject — including those important aspects that the subject may not believe are important. I noted the policies I thought this article contravened, and voted accordingly. I do wish to note here, though, that I, and I'm sure all editors who voted here, bear no ill will whatsoever toward Mr. Nelson. Participating in VfD can be very painful, and sometimes we say things factually that we could afford to say more accomodatingly. I'm always trying to find the balance, and I hope I wasn't too badly off here. I addressed only the article and meant no offense to the person, and hope the comments weren't construed as such.

<p><b>Comment</b>. The comments that follow, apparently part of an email exchange between David Nelson and Kat Walsh, were pasted to this VfD by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Nelson_f9fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Nelson">David Nelson</a> at 2005-08-21 00:57:05 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/David_Nelson_%28Democrat%29&amp;diff=21467566&amp;oldid=21329966" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/David_Nelson_%28Democrat%29&amp;diff=21467566&amp;oldid=21329966" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p><br />
Hello and thank you for your message, Kat.</p>
<p>I wonder if those who wrote the messages that you described as "unkind" and "uncivil" will be treated as I've been by receiving warnings about their unapproved writings, temporary suspension or permanent cancellation of their publishing abilities, or other equitable restrictions for their actions that have violated Wikipedia policies and guidelines.</p>
<p>If not, why not?</p>
<p>If you agree, as others have, that my submission was "well-written," why delete it? This kind of policy of strict democracy and majority rule seems egalitarian, but, as some of those who voted to delete my submission also wrote, they know little if anything about the topic of gay politics. What other topics are they judging from a position of little or no knowledge? I wonder if the idea of "tyranny of the majority" is a Wikipedia topic.</p>
<p>Instead of deleting my submission, why wasn't there any official Wikipedia opinion voiced during the voting to consider EDITING? Your policies often and strongly encourage this approach lest the submitter take the path of least resistance and simply leave Wikipedia altogether. That's exactly what happened here.</p>
<p>As for the frequent claims that my submission violated the policy against vain and non-notable submissions simply because I wrote it myself, I wonder if all submissions are held to the standard of no autobiographical information. Too bad. I guess the autobiographies of Helen Keller, Benjamin Franklin and Marilyn Manson would be equally substandard for Wikipedia. I can point out several topics that would be equally vain and non-notable, but enjoy publication by Wikipedia, so it appears that the policy is applied arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Furthermore, would my submission be alright suddenly if I asked a friend to publish it?</p>
<p>Do you see where the policy of strict democracy and majority rule gets us? It's at best clumsy and at worst punitive. Hardly the stuff of "bringing encyclopedic information free to the world."</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that the Bomis ownership and management of Wikipedia and its subsidiaries is an uphill battle without the added trouble of appearing to censor information that is published elsewhere. But that's just my advice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'll be working with other online pedias which take a less strident approach of exclusion.</p>

<dd>Quite simply, no. David, you seem an intelligent chap, so why can't you see if we let every person who use Wikipedia create their own article, there would be madness. Thus we have a in-built "notability" idea (notability is actually not a reason for deletion, but that's not the issue).

<li>And why is it that you woke up NOW to delete this particular article? There are tens orperhaps even hundreds of articles about unsuccessful election candidate, but you woke up to suggest the deletion of this particular one just NOW, when the seat where he stood and might stood again was vacated. I know that can't be a coinsidence. You know, that if he will be selected as a candidate, this article could be justifiably recreated even in the case it would now be deleted, thus your motives to suggest that it should be deleted NOW look rather suspicious.
<ul>
<li>If it means that much to you, if he's selected I will personally go out and leaflet for him. But honestly - nobody is going to vote for him because they've seen him on wikipedia. It is of no significance anywhere outside wikipedia.

<li>You would? A promise? The poimt isn't whether somebody will vote for him or not becaus he is in Wikipedia, but there is no rational reason to spare this article till now, and delete it NOW when it is topical again.

<li>I have my reasons to remain anomymous, and I'm not going to tell you, what they are. And you didn't illustrate anything.

<ul>
<li>If you don't sign in then how can we know all edits are coming from the same person?

<p>This is non-encyclopaedic. Constituency agents and parliamentary researchers are not notable or even public figures. YBF is of minor importance in itself and Mr. Smith's greatest significance is as a board member of a Conservative Party pressure group. I also suspect (I can't determine this because it's transwikied from wiktionary) that it's autobiographical. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">Matthew Platts</a> 22:15, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Someone with an op-ed piece in a free 'zine that made 5000 copies would have a very hard time convincing anyone they were notable for that. Similarily, I don't think you've done enough to prove that you're notable, and as an admitted vanity piece, you need to really make sure you done that. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 17:06, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>"The vanity of others offends us only when it offends our own vanity." -- Nietzsche.</i> This is just a followup comment -- I do not think the entry is a vanity piece, unless it is only by definition. Free Inquiry's subscription numbers are 30,000, not 5,000, as is easily discovered by a search. I agree that one op-ed piece isnt notable, but its a regular contribution and column to that and other magazines (do a google search). Moreover, the magazine isnt free, it is subscriber based like the Nation and New Republic. And I clearly pass the google test. Its confusing why if the guidelines are followed people would so fluster. If there is really consensus that the entry should be deleted even after my showing that the guidelines at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> have been followed, I'll delete the posting and consider the Wikipedia to be more for officious folks and less in the spirit of important knowledge compilation such as the Encylclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert. But if you have guidelines, and people follow them, you ought abide by the guidelines. <a href="../../../d/j/g/User%7EDjgrothe_c5ff.html" title="User:Djgrothe">Djgrothe</a> 1:28pm, 16 August 2005</li>

<li>If no one has the time or motivation to vote to include this entry, I respectfully suggest it just be taken down. I was merely trying to broaden the Wikipedia to include an entry that clearly followed the guidelines at at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I think it is a shame that not but one of the votes for deletion, which itself seemed based on a misunderstanding, followed the guideline "All Wikipedians, however, should try not to appear terse, gruff, and abrupt in their VFD postings. All Wikipedians should do their best to treat contributors with respect and good will," as stated in the Guide for Deletion. Again, such tiresome officiousness. <a href="../../../d/j/g/User%7EDjgrothe_c5ff.html" title="User:Djgrothe">Djgrothe</a> 20:12, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the guidelines are followed, why get all officious. It is explanatory to see the comments that others have said about these knee-jerk deleters. Some of them seem to confirm the negative reputation wikipedia has. <i>"This is a work that cannot be completed except by a society of men of letters and skilled workmen, each separately on his own part, but all bound together by their zeal for the best interests of the human race and a feeling of mutual good will." -- Denis Diderot, when writing of the original collaborative Encyclopedia project, which was a crowning achievement of the Enlightenment.</i> <a href="../../../d/j/g/User%7EDjgrothe_c5ff.html" title="User:Djgrothe">Djgrothe</a> 00:35, August 17, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am sorry you have taken umbrage, but the point is clear that vanity pages are unacceptable; not only are they usually obnoxious in and of themselves, they further reflect poorly on the encyclopedic project as a whole. It is understandable that people who make good faith efforts editing and correcting entries will take issue with such clearly unimportant, self-promoting fluff. Recall Denis Diderot's admonition: <i>fools have been and always will be the majority of mankind</i> <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 02:13, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I havent taken offense, but have just been puzzled by the sourpuss rejoinders and reasons. And yes, Diderot was the best of examples: an atheist working for the betterment of humankind while at the same time realizing how annoying and unhelpful humanity can be. <a href="../../../d/j/g/User%7EDjgrothe_c5ff.html" title="User:Djgrothe">Djgrothe</a> 02:51, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Thank you for the feedback. I will update the company description accordingly. As for who determines what a "significant impact" on the world is, are there guidelines for this? Or is this just a subjective judgment on the state of Intuit? I'm sure if you ask each and every company (and their respective founders), if they have had an impact on a certain industry, they will all tell you that they have. Are you using specific measures such as: company revenue, # of employees, or something else? Again, I firmly believe that ZipRealty is changing the real estate world - but that is just my opinion. With respect to Wikipedia, I only want to abide by the guidelines setforth. Thanks for the input - this is a learning process for me. Please feel free to let me know if there are any other 'commercial' pieces in the article. I'm open to all suggestions. Thanks. -- 67.111.191.10 5 August 2005.</li>

Publicly traded companies file SEC reports and are definitely verifiable.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an interesting article about how the scientific method can ferret out incorrect results and it shows that even Science can publish bad research (that shouldn't come as much of a surpirse to anyone who has tried to repeat the experiments in an "old" Science paper (by old, I mean before supplementary materials were made available electronically). However, I do not see how it qualifies as scientific misconduct. Is there an NIH investigation going on? Did Ricaurte intentionally switch vials? Was he working for a pharma that would benefit from his article? It sounds like shoddy book keeping on the part of Ricaurte's lab and/or the MDMA supplier, but is there an accusation of intentionally falsifying results? Where is the misconduct? <a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrlasky_93b5.html" title="User:Srlasky">srlasky</a> 18:28, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

EG: the "cutaneous" sense - "cutaneous" refers to the skin, not to the sense of touch. The vestibule is a bony cavity and not a sense. There are a few useful things in it (such as noting the term kinesthesia is synonymous for proprioception) and these should be cut and transferred. If the article was rewritten to explore the neuropysiological subject of sensation, as opposed to providing an innaccurate overview of sensory physiology, then it should stay. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManning_Bartlett_95ec.html" title="User:Manning Bartlett">Manning</a> 06:24, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The User Talk page was originally a list of links as well.

<li>It doesn't really do any harm deleting it; someone can re-add the welcome template if they're so inclined. This prevents reversion back to the advertising, and adds weight to the community disapproval for such tactics. I don't imagine that the user in question cares much about the page either way—he hasn't edited under that name since April 2004, and his only edits were to create the spam user pages and add a spam link to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_%28search_engine%29.html" title="Google (search engine)">Google (search engine)</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 01:37, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> i have seen him play in Washington DC and think he is amazing. I made the page and follow his tour with other fans when he plays with his band. This is most certainly not a page about vanity or promotion. It is simply acknowledging that there is a singer in the Washington DC area who has just released his album and will be touring Central Asia in September of 2005. How much more to the point without vanity can you be when you have only just relased an album? I don't think it should be deleted.

<p>Hay everyone! Im new here and new to this deletion stuff. I think this page should be deleted because it is just nasty! I mean, what kind of woman does that to herself? She is SO ugly. Also she is very non-notable, she is just here so sicko-nerds who dont like to surf out of wiki can come here and masturbate I think. Also we shouldnt promote this kinda harm, she probably has back problems, what if some woman comes here and thinks "id like to be like that" and decides to have an augmentation that completely destroys her health because of Wikipedia? Also, what if kids come here, they will be shocked and traumatized by those sick breasts. I also heard that a lot of libraries and stuff block Wikipedia (which is a great tool!) from there computers because it has porn on it like this "lady". Delete her! She is no good!

<li>What about the "random article" feature, which is very prominent on the main page? If people need to avoid it, perhaps it should be taken down. Just because Wikipedia was started by groovy permissives it doesn't have to stay that way. Providing free publicity for porn merchants isn't one of the Five Pillars of Wikipedia, so it is negotiable.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Inclination to keep on principle (the deletion arguments from "nastiness" or "self-mutilation" should be strongly opposed), but I really wonder about the subject's actual notability. Realistically, will we try to cover every adult entertainer? Everyone with a breast size over N inches/mm? Does breast size (or, conversely, penis size for a male performer) confer notability? (That's a serious question, not rhetoric.) <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 06:45, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>In fact there does seem to be a major push on to accomplish just that - there are literally dozens if not hundreds of porn stars listed on wikipedia already. As for As for size and notability, I say the answer is certainly yes. There *are* porn stars who are famous mostly because of the size of their attributes.-<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPirate2000_9343.html" title="User:Pirate2000">Pirate2000</a>
<ul>
<li>Dozens or hundreds is not unreasonable, considering that there are undoubtedly tens of thousands of adult performers. Separating out the actual "porn stars" from the universe of "porn actors/actresses" is worth doing to some extent. In past decades most people -- well, most people who pay attention to such things -- could name the dozen or so top porn stars. I don't know if that's still the case. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 07:22, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. <i>Just because you do not like someone, it doesn't mean that you can just delete her from an encyclopedia!!</i> Just because you don't promote something doesn't mean it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. One of the rules on Wikipedia is to submit neutral, non-biased entries, and as far as I can tell, this entry meets those guidelines. Just because there is an entry here on something, doesn't mean that that is a promotion for it. There are entries on Hitler and Stalin here too! Should we just get rid of those?!?! <i>"what if some woman comes here and thinks 'id like to be like that' and decides to have an augmentation that completely destroys her health because of Wikipedia?"</i> I honestly don't think that seeing an enry about someone or something on Wikipedia will influence someone to do something a drastic as that unless they are already considering it, and besides, if seeing an image of something like that on the internet will influence someone to do that, than they will be influenced to do a lot of things during any single simple search or click on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> or any part of the web. <i>I also heard that a lot of libraries and stuff block Wikipedia (which is a great tool!) from there computers because it has porn on it like this "lady"</i>. The picture accompanying the entry hardly pornographic. Unless you consider <i>un</i>exposed breasts pornographic, and that would make your views seem slightly paradoxical. Honestly, you come across as a naive, selfish, zealot who thinks that just because they have any sort of power or influence, that they can just take advantage of it for superfluous, selfish and spontanious things. It took a lot of effort not to simply type "<b>YOU'RE STUPID</b>" in all caps and continue a short response with an excessive amount of exclamation points and personal attacks, which I only could resist because i am better than that, which you evidently aren't, judjing by your entry. "<i>She is SO ugly.</i>" Please, also, a reccomendation, if I were you, I would keep the amount of spelling and gramatical errors in my entry to a minimum, so that no one will draw conclusions about your level of intelligence. Which I know I did. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe9file_cfc8.html" title="User:The9file">the9file</a></li>

(IMHO, the criteria for "notability" in professional wrestling is at least two television appearances with a major federation (In the USA, that'd be WWE, WCW, NWA, ECW) for pretty much anyone after 1975.

<p>My main concern however is all the spinofff pages on the interent that use wikipedia as a source. A simple google search is flooded with wikipedia articles on this guy at hundreds of sites. Does anyone know whether or not they'll go down. I hate to see wikipedia responcibble for spreading false info throughout the interent. On a side note I just wanted to point out that the Egypt/Libya example was added by the same guy who started saying this guy was fake. Also I think this might be a reason to beef up our security. I mean look how many people edited a completely ridiculous article and with all those edits look how long it lasted. And the only reason it ever got deleted was because some rogue pointed it out, if not for that it probaly still wouldnt have been deleted. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary123_ad90.html" title="User:Gary123">Gary123</a> 13:25, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you want to know my reasons, they are the same as the ones I gave in the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_Charms_fe03.html" title="Chelsea Charms">Chelsea Charms</a> VfD. I mean, this is just lunacy. Plus one more very important additional reason is that she is even LESS notable than Chelsea Charms because she is not as big as her and is not the biggest in the world or whatever, which is a horrible title to have anyway. Who here finds her attractive? I just cant believe it. She looks like shes 30 and shes had a kid and shes just fat and people find this stuff sexy? Well, like I said, she is not notable, also look a her page, it says NOTHING about her, just advertisements and stuff about sex dolls and I dont know what else. I really wanna hear from women here because I think some men who have deviated from a godly path might be attracted to this kinda junk so we need some less-biased voices around here to show their opinions, I think theyll agree with me.

<p>Article lacks ANY verifiable information. Not ONE citation. Subject is a completely unnotable pornographic star with very internet presence other than her own pornographic website (with a completely low Alexa rating), and mirror sites. Only notability seems to be 1. Her extremely large breasts 2. Being one of the few neo-fascist big breast stars 3. Her heroin addiction, none of which qualifies her whatsoever under current AfD rules.

<li><b>Delete</b>, wikiproject numbers has a pretty good, though not perfect, system, and this doesn't fall into it. I think the idea about no uninteresting numbers is "proved" false because some number would be interesting for being the smallest uninteresting number, making it interesting, and so on up the scale to infinity. Obviously wikipedia is going to cut off consecutive integers at some point and 256, as a power of 2, is as good as any, I guess. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:53, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an amazingly jaundiced comment. I assume that I am the 'Anon IP' to which you refer. My apologies for not having registered: I thought this was not a requirement to comment, and I can only say that my IP was withheld by employers firewall. I am now at home, have registered and I am very happy to defend myself against your flaming. I am not an employee of, nor am I currently even a member of the BCI - to allege that because I mentioned the BCI once, this amounts to me 'pimping' all over the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_continuity_planning.html" title="Business continuity planning">Business continuity planning</a> page and associated articles is ludicrous. The entry itself is not a good description of the BCI - describing it as a 'for profit' group selling business continuity plans is completely wrong. It is a member-owned professional body.

<p>Unverifiable <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> 17:05, 16 August 2005 (UTC) (My first VfD, be gentle.) <b>Delete</b> as unverifiable. See Talk:Branin for a very long list of queries I had about the article and its sources. It has been two months and not one has been addressed. I can't find the Austrian city mentioned in the article and I remain unconvinced that you can take three languages and four etymologies to come up with multiple spellings and call them variant spellings of the same surname. I spent a morning in the local reference library with some very large dictionaries indeed and was unable to confirm a single assertion of the article except that <i>brenin</i> means king in modern Welsh and that <i>brân</i> means crow. Which is not really a lot. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> 17:14, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Brennan is a common Irish name, and the text about it relating to the Irish word "braon" is verified elsewhere, but that's about it. The idea that a single name would have Irish <b>and</b> Welsh <b>and</b> Anglo-Saxon roots doesn't make sense, and the name "Branin" I have never encountered. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a> 17:48, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Suggestion</b>: Hello Telsa. I heartily commend your exceptional diligence and patience in researching this, and maintaining an interest in it for 1 month and 17 days. If I understand correctly, Branin is claimed by the article to be a variant of the name Brennan. Various etymological attributions and associations are also claimed. You have researched this and been able to verify just two facts in the whole article. My first instinct was to vote delete, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but I wonder if your obvious knowledge of this subject may benefit WP more in another way. Would you be able to write an article on what in your opinion is the correct rendition of the name, perhaps <b>Brennan</b>? You could include all relevant, verifiable etymological and historical details in that article. Then, we might get the Branin page (blanked of everything save the title) to redirect to Brennan. However, if you feel "Branin" is completely unremarkable as a name or version worthy of encyclopedic record (ie., if you think Branin is essentially bogus as a historical name), then we can <b>delete</b> the Branin page. For the purposes of this VfD, I vote <b>delete</b>, unless you specifically confirm that Branin may find use as a legitimate redirect.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 19:36:40, 2005-08-16 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b> to <i>Recess (TV series)</i>. I count 5r-2k. The "merge or redirect" vote implies a redirect either way.

<li>Eh, this is getting too confusing. Maybe some of them could use separate articles, if they are completely distinct albums. I mainly objected to two separate articles when the second was identical to the first, but with a couple bonus tracks. I have no real interest in Queen, but if I feel like it I'll take a stab sometime at sorting them all out. I think there could be some cleanup due all around. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:44, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It appears they are not specific enough, as there is considerable disagreement over what constitutes a "Major local political figure", as well as "significant press coverage". We have articles on people who got less than 1% of the vote in an Ohio primary for Congress. Some people seem to think the very act of being a politician is notable in itself. "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events", can be used to justify anyone involved in an election, certainly a newspwrthy event. More than these brief sentences are needed, I fear. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:03, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here's one way of looking at it: <i>Coverage in newspapers is primary source material</i>, as long as it isn't simple repetition of material provided by the subject itself (i.e. clandestine <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a>) and as long as the newspaper is a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a>. From primary and secondary source material, a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> encyclopaedia article can be written, if there is enough useful primary source material. The question thus reduces to "How useful is the source material, and how much source material is enough?". The answer to that varies from case to case, according to what is actually written in the sources, and according to what the sources themselves are. Press coverage saying "He ate a whole bowl of nuts at the Republican national convention." is less useful source material than press coverage saying "He gave the opening address at the Republican national convention." Similarly, press coverage in the <i>The Independent</i> of East Hampton doesn't augment human knowledge as much as press coverage in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_%28disambiguation%29_5e73.html" title="The Independent (disambiguation)">The Independent</a></i> does. For the politicians that <i>do</i> get into the newspapers (unlike the subject at hand here) this is where the discussion lies.
<p>Addressing your example about "anyone involved in an election" with this as a basis, it can be seen that though the newspapers may write about the election, if they don't write <i>about the specific candidate</i> then there's no source material for a biography. Mere <i>involvement</i> in something that newspapers cover is not enough. People generally don't get encyclopaedia biography articles for passing out leaflets, because newspapers generally don't cover the individual people that pass out the leaflets, and there are thus no sources to be cited.</p>
<p>Taking another example: <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Ross Perot</a> didn't win the election to national office, but there was extensive news coverage of him and thus extensive source material for an encyclopaedia biography article. "renown or notoriety" equates to lots of humans knowing stuff about him, those humans in fact having obtained that knowledge from the very news media sources as are cited by the encyclopaedia biography article.</p>
<p>In essence, our criteria for the inclusion of biographies try to approximate and to codify the notion that human knowledge about politicians is augmented through news media (the only source for unelected politicians) and through (for politicians that hold office) public records of their activities (such as voting records, official journals of legislatures, and the like). It is knowledge that we are here to collect and to summarize. Addressing the issue by asserting that "all candidates are notable" is to be building a directory of people (indeed a directory of people's autobiographies), not an encyclopaedia of knowledge.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> while individual losing candidates may not pass the test, consideration could be given to creating omnibus articles for defeated candidates. This approach has been adopted for Canadian losing candidates. In this case, one might create an article called "UKIP candidates in the UK general election, 2005" that would gather together the stories of various unsuccessful candidates. See, for example, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Party_candidates%2C_2003_Ontario_provincial_election_2588.html" title="Freedom Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election">Freedom Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> RESPECT unfortunately elected an MP in the last election, so it clearly is a notable party, unless you can point me to some Wikipedia policy guidelines over what constitutes political notability, I would say keep it as being the MP candidate of a notable party seems notable enough to warrant mention. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 13:37, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Were we discussing <a href="../../../r/e/s/RESPECT_The_Unity_Coalition_505f.html" title="RESPECT The Unity Coalition">RESPECT The Unity Coalition</a>, our article on that political party, your argument about the party being notable would apply. However, we are not. We are discussing a candidate for office who is simply a member of that party, and moreover a candidate that both <i>didn't win</i> (by a massive margin) and that is not infamous for losing spectacularly (as some candidates are). Notability is not inheritable from a political party by all of its individual members; and your argument about the party being notable is thus inapplicable. A person who has done <i>nothing else</i> to satisfy the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> (as this person has not) has to have <i>won</i> the election to national/state/provincial office that xe has stood for. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:27:56, 2005-08-17 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree with Uncle G--the notability of the party is clearly an issue. Both Caerwine and I believe that major party candidates should be kept; therefore, the notability of RESPECT is clearly a factor, at least in our votes. I, however, come down on the opposite side of Caerwine. Electing one member of Parliament does not make you a notable party. If they achieve more significant success over a longer period, then their candidates can get articles--until then, they remain (in my eyes) a minor party. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 14:42, August 17, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The notability of the party is irrelevant. Candidates (that don't satisfy the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> in <i>any</i> other ways) don't get articles <i>unless they actually win the elections</i>. This is long established here, and is also clearly laid out in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> themselves. There are millions of candidates for office around the world, and neither winning nor having any other criterion whatsoever going for you, is where by consensus we have consistently drawn the line. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:41:04, 2005-08-17 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This wretched song was number one in the UK charts for longer than just about any ever. For that fact alone it should be kept, as testemant to the general poor musical taste of of a great many brits and the suffering of the rest of us. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 01:45, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not personally a fan of articles on individual songs, and would <i>much</i> prefer to see <i>all</i> song articles merged into the albums from whence they came, but as long as general consensus continues to favour distinct articles for songs, this one, while undeniably ugh-inducing, is as legitimately notable as a song can get. <b>Keep</b>. (Oh, and by the way, nobody named "Brian" Adams was involved with this song in any way.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:04, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please bear in mind that not all <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song.html" title="Song">songs</a> are <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_song.html" title="Pop song">pop songs</a>. There aren't necessarily "albums from whence they came" in the first place. The idea that the only form of music is pop music is a widely-brought accusation of systemic bias that is levelled at Wikipedia. Please fight it. Also please note that even in the specific case of pop songs, not all songs "came from" albums, or have been released on albums. The pop music industry hasn't always worked, and still doesn't work, to the simple scheme of producing an album and then releasing songs off it. To see famous examples of how this neat and tidy idea is not actually followed in practice in the real world, read the histories of some of the individual songs listed on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_discography_224d.html" title="The Beatles discography">The Beatles discography</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:53:25, 2005-08-17 (UTC)</li>
