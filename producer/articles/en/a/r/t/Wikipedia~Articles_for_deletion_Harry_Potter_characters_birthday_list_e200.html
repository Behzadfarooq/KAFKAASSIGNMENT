<dd>And is that a problem? if you look below you will see that while he asked me to look here, I have voted to merge.

<dd>I can certainly agree that this shouldn't be a problem. The HP Wikiproject has <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Harry_Potter_AfD_4bbf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Harry Potter/AfD">a subpage</a> specifically to notify users when articles are up for AfD, and looking at the history of articles advertised there will show you that members of the Wikiproject have voted in a variety of ways. In fact, I notice that the two recent AfDs weren't placed there, so I will place it there myself. I would also note that he asked me to take a look simply because I am familiar with Harry Potter articles, not because we agree on this subject matter (as a matter of fact, we've had our disagreements). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 00:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolute importance is not a good sole criteria for inclusion. It is necessary to consider relative importance to people. I spent £50 on HP, and so did hundreds of millions of other people.

<p>I was saying that if you think an article is by its subject matter irrelevant, then you are automatically bringing in a prejudice against it. Also, I was not aware that wikipedia moderated article existence/length based on importance.

<dd>It makes it easier to find, however, than being spread through various articles. Would you delete a list of presidents, because that information was already included in their articles? What about the articles detailing the British peerages? The only difference here seems to be that a list of Kings and Queens, say, is historical, as opposed to fictional. Leading me to wonder whether any of you have a bias <i>against</i> articles regarding works of fiction. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 19:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Untrue. Birthdates may be important information within the context of a given article.

<dd>I'm not interested in Harry Potter wikis, or in posting fan rubbish. I'm interested in making Wikipedia as thorough, useful, easily-accessible, readable, and organised as possible. Which is why I am trying to create this article, in order to get the information in a thorough and clear, easy to find and use manner. I understand that we are coming from rather different directions here - I value the Harry Potter series and am trying to ensure that its articles are of the best standard, whereas most of the contributors here clearly have no respect for it and obviously have no desire to actually give any thought to the matter. As to why I am comparing the article to a list of Peers or Presidents: those are relevant to you. This article is relevant to those interested in Harry Potter. You may not like that, but you have to accept it. From an absolute perspective, <i>of course</i> the birthday list is not as important as a list of historical presidents. But relatively, it is important enough to the Harry Potter project to merit retention. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 20:34, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Michael, nobody is saying that the Harry Potter series is unvalued, and is not relevant to Wikipedia.

<dd>There are times when I wish to know when a character's birthday is. I might be interested in finding out how many birthdays are known without digging around on the Rowling site. I might be interested in which character birthday is on a particular day. There are plenty of valid reasons why any Harry Potter fan might wish to see it, all of which comply with Wikipedia rules, and which you are blatantly IGNORING. Do you hold yourselves to any standard? You are showing a blatant disregard for the interests of other readers, measuring article relevance by your own yardsticks - despite the fact that your very lack of interest in the subject makes it impossible for you to grasp how it can be relevant!

<li>No, because there are probably very few other movies or books where 25 characters's birthdays have been noted.

<li><b>Merge</b> with Dates in Harry Potter (although 'Dates' already has a section on characters birthdays, which very probably contains all this information already, so little 'merging' would be required). I'm not convinced the title really makes sense as a redirect... I always though a 'birthday list' was a list of presents I want for my birthday. But I find the arguments advanced above (broadly) that wiki should not give comprehensive coverage to a phenomen like 'Harry Potter', which probably interests more people than the majority of all articles as extraordinary, and on the lines of 'cutting off your nose to spite your face'. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 16:36, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Merge</i> Unlike the previous AfD discussion, this is about a lit containing no unique information; though birthdays as such are mentioned in the book, they are not generally a major plot element, and finding out who was born on a particular day is merely fan trivia. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 02:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
