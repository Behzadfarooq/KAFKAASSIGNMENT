<li>Nick, I would be surprised if you could provide any evidence of your accusations that Tilman is "promoting himself to be someone who is is not <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup>". In fact, I would be highly surprised if you could provide evidence that Tilman is promoting himself at all. This is in stark contrast to Johnny Lee Clary, who if I'm not mistaken created the original article on himself and (quite <b>obviously</b>) has been the recipient of heavy promotional efforts since. Johnny Lee Clary is not the first aggressive self-promoter we've dealt with. He isn't the first to try and <i>demand</i> his own article that reads like a press release; he isn't the first to interfere with the AfD on his article by erasing other people's words, and he surely wouldn't be the first self-promoter on Wikipedia to exaggerate modest indicators of notability and describe them as if they were proof (i.e., to use a notable example that I'm sure sticks in many Wikipedians' minds, "featured in the New York Times" turning out to mean "mentioned as an example in a single New York Times op-ed piece".) Clary may choose to make paranoid allegations about neo-Nazis on Wikipedia trying to oppress him (and you've chosen to go along with him) but in reality he has himself to blame. When Clary has shows that he has no moral scruples against making vicious, slanderous accusations against people who disagree with him,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Johnny_Lee_Clary&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51223316" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Johnny_Lee_Clary&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51223316" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and shows that he has no moral scruples against tampering with a discussion to try and force it to come out his way,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FJohnny_Lee_Clary&amp;diff=51325502&amp;oldid=51298010" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FJohnny_Lee_Clary&amp;diff=51325502&amp;oldid=51298010" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> no one is going to take vague claims like 'he appeared on <i>Oprah</i>, at some point, and on <i>Donahue</i>, at some point, and that's proof that he's notable' at face value. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:11, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Administrators? Can we close this discussion?

He has appeared all over the Nation of Australia on ABC Radio as well as ABC's "Enough Rope" hosted by Andrew Denton also appeared with the Australian KKK leader on the Today show in Australia. What has Tilman got? Nothing. He is not notable. Also this deletion is warrented.

<li><i>sigh</i> You know, it's <b>really</b> not necessary to copy and paste the <b>entire</b> laundry list of everyone who has ever purportedly deemed Clary worthy of attention every time the subject comes up. We've heard it all before and strangely enough, we <i>don't</i> really need to see it again on an article that has <i>nothing to do with Johnny Lee Clary</i>. As for whether this article was nominated on "the same grounds", that's obviously untrue: this is the <b>only</b> article on Wikipedia about Tilman Hausherr, unlike Johnny Lee Clary who had his article <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> nominated because it was redundant with the already-existing <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Angel_%28wrestler%29_5296.html" title="Johnny Angel (wrestler)">Johnny Angel (wrestler)</a> article. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:21, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>delete</b> Tilman Hausherr is a nobody. He is just a little computer guy in Germany obsessed with with celebrities and hatred against minority religions. If Wikipedia portrays such people, it loses credibility. Hausherr is a bore. If you give him a Wikipedia page, you have to give one to thousand other Usenet loons too.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. This is a transparently bad faith nomination. The previous debate closed as a consensus keep, and the only people in favor of deletion are single purposed accounts with less than 10 edits. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 18:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
