<dd>Cool... have also asked Dragons flight. Either way, both of you would be very good! Just remember to apply the 100 edit rule carefully, if removing the vote add a reasoning. Don't engage in commentary (my bad), remove all anonymous editor voting to the correct section and <i>instantly</i> remove any commentary that might be construed as trolling (I have removed several suggestions that slashdot and GNAA members may not vote by anonymous editors).

<dd>I have shown sufficient impartiality in my actions as admin of this page. As an administrator I have a fair amount of leeway in VfD, and as I have shown myself to be without fear or favour in my administration of this vote another VfD based on irregularities of this VfD would need some <i>very</i> good reasoning behind it.</dd>

<dd>This said, there is some method behind my madness. As a rule, anonymous users <i>can</i> be counted when it comes to VfD. This VfD is different, mainly because past VfDs have shown that anonymous editors have harassed editors who voted in those VfDs. Their have been accusations that this effected the vote. This time, I am not allowing anonymous users because it is more than probable that they are GNAA ring-ins - the GNAA, by their members' own admission is a trolling organisation designed to harass and cause problems for Internet based websites. I will not let the GNAA membership cause this vote to fail. The irony here is that for this vote to have a good chance of succeeding, the GNAA would do well to stay out of it because, based on what I have seen in the previous 5 VfDs, the Wikipedia community wishes to keep the article. If the GNAA edits the article, they will only hurt themselves as they will make the vote <i>appear</i> less legitimate.</dd>

<dd>I would like to take a moment to point out that anonymous editors may still makes civil comments in the "Comments" section. Editors who participate in this VfD should be aware that the purpose of the discussion is to achieve consensus upon a course of action and that the votes themselve are merely a means to gauge consensus, and not the ends in themselves. It would pay for <i>everyone</i> to keep this in mind when participating in this VfD. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 9 July 2005 01:28 (UTC)

<dd>That is <i>normal</i> policy, which seems to have been disregarded for this particular VfD in favor of an 'iron-fist' and strictly-by-the numbers voting methodology--by none other than yourself. I'm not saying I disagree with this completely--by the 6th VfD it's about time to get a <u>final</u> and unambiguous decision. But I do think some people will question your rather arbitrary modification of the rules--especially since it seems to favor a <b>keep</b> decision.--<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasDex_c4f8.html" title="User:TexasDex">TexasDex</a> July 9, 2005 18:31 (UTC)

<dd>At this moment in time (and everything may change as the vote continues) There are more disqualified keep votes than delete ones.

<dd>Well yes. That's becuse more regular wikipedians want it kept than want it deleted.

<dl>
<dd>I do not think it has to do with the rules of VFD. The admins are running this with strict accordance to VFD and sockpuppetry rules. If people are bitching about this vote, again, then we need to figure out what to do next. I do not propose setting up another pointless VFD, but see if we need to get higher-ups involved, try to have people vote on the basis of article merit, not because they want this shit to be over and done with, and explain fully how VFD works. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 08:00, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey I dont suppose any of you have noticed, but WE WIN. - GNAA</p>
<dl>
<dd>To the GNAA member: we don't particularly care that you feel that you have "won". In fact, this little skirmish has very little to do with your organisation: this has more to do with the removal of an article about an offensive organisation, and the way we deal with our deletion procedures. As the votes for deletion is not going to be mentioned in the article (this is an internal Wikipedia matter, and nobody in the GNAA actually directly caused the issue), not many people will know about it from the article text. Sorry that it didn't turn out how you expected, but I guess that's life for ya. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:24, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are absolutely right, people are tired of this particular Vfd. That however, is not a reason to vote keep/delete. Voters should be encouraged to give a real reason why they want the article to be kept or deleted. I started a very lengthy discussion on this very topic and others on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America_df30.html#Possible_new_Vfd_comments" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Gay Nigger Association of America">Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Gay Nigger Association of America#Possible new Vfd comments</a>. I had hoped to have more sorted out before any new Vfd's, but this is the third one since I started that discussion. As it is now, there are users doing null edits, just to get their edit count up, and other users voting just because they are tired of voting. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who"><font color="#FF0033">&lt;&gt;</font>Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 12:07, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am quite confused by this change. Are we still bound by the at-least-100-edits arbitiary rule or rather individual cases where the user is judged to either be a sockpuppet or not? I do not know if I am eligable to vote on this VfD, yet noticed that some of the discounted votes have been readded as valid on the basis of them not being sockpuppets. Could you elaborate? Kryptops 22:40, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The closing admin will always apply judgement to votes. Obvious sock puppets will be discounted. At this point it's fairly clear that a vote to delete will not be possible since 60+ keeps really says there is no consensus to delete.

Gmaxwell, this is an issue that has gone on for a while and with folks who have organized this vote carefully to make it completely transparent and above the board.

<dd>Fuz, the new rules have introduced significant bias into the vote... and plenty have complained about the process.

<dd>Well I already have in several places, new policy would be the '100 edit minimum' and the active modification of the running vote.

<dd>The 100 edit minumum is already enforced here, since that is a number used by some on Wikipedia to determine if one is a sock or not. As for the admins, they do run the vote tally, and with an article like this, we sure need a bunch of them. Most VFD's do not get this bad at all. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 00:08, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A single closing admin makes the judgement. I suspect that TBSDY knows he wouldn't be able to close the VFD himself due to accusations of bias due to his prior involment. That doesn't mean he should be able to influence the outcome by reordering the votes and pulling new rules out of a hat. If you look at some of the disenfranchised users, it's very clear that some of them are almost certantly not socks. The use of any sort of any edit yard stick for sock testing by itself is almost universally regarded as a bad idea. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 00:15, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with that. If our intension was actually to close the issue and reduce it being reVFDed that would have been a perfectly agreeable way to go about things. ... at this point it doesn't matter, no matter how many more delete votes go in, the closing admin would have to be off his rocker to claim there was a consensus here to delete. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 00:15, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cripes folks! (Sorry, not directed towards anyone in particular, only a displeasure with the whole assumption there is some "ideal" process we are deviating from). The process for VfD for administrators is so vague and "loosey goosey" in the first place if you read: <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators</a>. The policy on that page <b>is worse than what TBSDY has enunciated at the top of the vote</b>. The policy right now for VfD allows administrators to, in fact, unilaterally and inconsistently interpret and rules, and I quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Administrators necessarily must use their best judgement, attempting to be as impartial as is possible for a fallible human, to determine when rough consensus has been reached. For example, administrators can disregard votes and comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such "bad faith" votes include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Can you see how "loose" and inadequate that is, and how people have disputed this vote five times now? So actually making the rules explicit at the top of this vote is a step forward, and not the work of a rogue administrator. It's an attempt to get the sense of the community, with rules that are well known beforehand. The policy of VfD now is actually a step backwards from where we were a year ago, when we were talking about this with real metrics and hard guidelines - <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_Archive_November_2003_to_October_2004_b968.html#Major_Change_Proposed" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy/Archive November 2003 to October 2004">Wikipedia_talk:Deletion_policy/Archive_November_2003_to_October_2004#Major_Change_Proposed</a>.

<dd>TBSDY, you are moving perfectly valid votes out of the VFD. I have as much right as any other editor to disagree with your vote reclassification and to propose changes. The judgment of a VFD is a task for the closing admin, and not for you. Because of your previous involvement with this subject it would obviously be inappropriate of you to close this VFD, and it is just as inappropriate for you to go inventing policy right now. By telling users with low edit counts that they can not vote you are creating a bias and denying the closing admin the ability to see all the votes. The current protecting of the page is needless and inappropriate, if there were consensus to keep the previous policy I would have gladly changed it back to the previous version myself. As it stands no such consensus exists, and <b>I am not frightened by your threats to block me on my talk page</b>. Please stop disrupting Wikipedia to push your voting agenda, and please have respect for those who just recently supported your readminship discontinuing threats of administrative action against editors who have disagreed with your unilateral imposition of new policy. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 01:04, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi Gmaxwell. By adding back into the count a duplicate vote, unsigned votes, votes by obvious sockpuppets, you undermine your argument somewhat. Note that Ta bu shi da yu merely moved all votes into a discounted section. The closing admin can still see them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 01:09, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't move any duplicated votes actually, I removed them as the user with the dupe vote had wished. I attempted to only move back the ones which were removed in violation of the normal VFD practice. You are incorrect with the claim that the closing admin can still see them, because many users didn't vote because they followed the instructions at the top which instructed them not to vote, this much is clear from earlier discussion on this talk page. Many Wikipedia users whom are not involved in our politics are unaware that admins are not special beyond a few janitorial powers and are unaware that admins have no special ability beyond other users to impose policy without consensus. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 01:15, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gmaxwell, let me ask you - do you recognize that this (#6) vote is not your typical Vfd but the result of sock puppet abuse in past votes, especially #5? There has been massive "protoyping" of ideas and plenty of discussions with 1-5. So the alternative would be what? To have this one be overrrun with so many sock puppet votes so as to be completely unintelligble until the last moment when an admin riffles through them all? I would be interested to find out what your solution would be to this. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> | <a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzheado_fba0.html" title="User talk:Fuzheado">Talk</a> 01:39, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look at the wider issue. We are here to create an encylopedia, not argue trivialities. Consensus is pretty bloody clear here. This is not a close run thing. You are playing into the hands of trolls. Everytime a vfd on the GNAA comes up member of the GNAA create multiple sockpuppet accounts and vote to keep the article. Detracters use this as an excuse to say the vote was irregualar. By dissallowing new, inactive and obvious socks we ensure that the vote results are unarguable. " A bunch of regular wikipedians voted to keep the article" end of the matter. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 01:32, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even when we take the socks out, the consensus still says to keep.

<dd>Right, it's pretty clear that there is no consensus to delete (which I'm sure is what Zscout370 was intending to say), even if you exclude votes by those not in the wikipedia top 5k, you find there is far too much <b>Keep</b> to make an honest claim that there is consensus to delete. so.. yes, the vote is moot. But it was moot long before this whole disruptive process was started (by someone who was a likely sock, none the less). The problem here is that these new voting 'rules' set for this VFD are non-standard and bias the vote. We are excluding from participation editors who are clearly not socks, simply because they didn't match the 100 edit threshold. It's bad to look like there are irregularities in the vote, but it is far worse to actually create such problems and we are instructing valid voters that they may not participate in the process or meta process less they suffer banning by an admin. This is not the right message. If TBSDY wants to have an indisputable vote, he could do so without further disrupting wikipedia by applying your vote winnowing to the previous VFDs... none of them would have been decided <b>Delete</b> by any sane method of excluding voters.<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 01:44, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we are arguing from different perspectives here. You are arguing that it's every wikipedians right to vote, and we shouldn't deny them that right just becuase they haven't made many edits. I am arguing that that an individuals right to vote isn't important. What is important is that we gauge the consensus of opinion. In order to do that we don't need to include everyones vote just a fair sample. I see no reason to suppose that reular wikipedians who have made &gt;100 edits will vote differently than those who have made &lt;100 edits. In hindsight I agree that 100 edits is not the best critereon. I would have gone with 20 edits <i>in the article space</i> and account created at least the day <i>bef're</i> the vfd start.

<p>Please explain why my vote was diqualified. This is not normal Wikipedia policy. If it was, I would have gotten a username. A quick glance at my editing history would reveal that I'm neither a sockpuppet nor a troll and that I have more than enough edits. Is this too much work?</p>
<p>Also, could anybody explain why Ta bu shi da yu is administering this vote? Anybody who know of him from <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuro5hin.html" title="Kuro5hin">Kuro5hin</a>, knows that he is a self admitted and notorious troll, a GNAA fanboy (and/or possibly member). That he's considered a respected admin here shows how easy it is to game the system. It will be exciting to see when he starts showing his true colours (if he hasn't already). <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.203.115.12.html" title="User:80.203.115.12">80.203.115.12</a> 14:44, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An IP address resolves to a computer not a person. Contrubitions from that computer may come from one person or many. There is no way of telling. Your opinion of Ta bu shi da yu does not agree with that of the wikipedia community. He can administer the vote becuase he is respected by that community. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 14:53, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If this is your decision then I question your understanding of the subject and its bearing on this new policy. An IP address does not necessarily resolve to one specific computer, and a logged in account does not necessarily resolve to a person. That is beyond my point however. What I don't understand is how admins can create new policies on a whim.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I understand that Ta bu shi da yu is respected here, I said as much. What I find amusing is that his other online personality openly admits to trolling and disruptive behaviour. Reading through his last request for adminship is quite enlightening. The comment from user Fnord is most appropriate to this Vfd:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Ta bu shi da yu is an example of the worst of administrators. He has arrogated power to himself that no one was ever supposed to have. He deliberately and disingenuously ignores written policies that are intended to limit administrator power to specific tasks at community instruction. Ta bu shi da yu writes his own instructions, using editorial discretion that should be used only for editorial work. He will get the power again, of course; but he will not deserve it, and he will abuse it."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As an editor who has always edited and contributed in good faith to the Wikipedia, I find it disheartening to be disregarded by a group of admins that have banded together to abuse their power, especially when the article in question is an article about trolls and the admin in charge is know for displaying exactly the disruptive and antisocial behaviour that is considered trolling. This is wrong on so many levels, but I understand that I have no say in the matter. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.203.115.12.html" title="User:80.203.115.12">80.203.115.12</a> 15:40, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What difference does it make which administrator administers this vote? What specifically is Ta bu shi da yu doing inappropriately? Administrators have always had the leeway to discount anon votes in vfd, and in most votes on Wikipedia they are explicitly disqualified as a matter of policy anyway. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 15:44, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please explain what strong evidence points to my vote as being in bad faith. As for Ta bu shi da yu, I'm complaining about his policies for this Vfd and about the blatant conflict of interest here which puts the whole process in a bad light. As I've said before, he is a self-admitted troll with the long-term goals of disrupting and making a mockery out of community based efforts. That he, of all people, admins a Vfd on the GNAA page, a group which he has expressed admiration of, and a group whose explicit goal is to destroy and disrupt Wikipedia, is bizarre to say the least. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.203.115.12.html" title="User:80.203.115.12">80.203.115.12</a> 16:22, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, I get it. I have been trolled, I have lost. This is meta-trolling on a whole new level Ta bu shi da yu, congratulations. I hereby withdraw my obvious <b>bad faith</b> vote. If any of you admins could go through all my edits, who are also obviously done in <b>bad-faith</b>, and revert them, please do. I look forward to your usual K5 comments on how you made a fool of all the Wikipedians Ta bu shi da yu. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.203.115.12.html" title="User:80.203.115.12">80.203.115.12</a> 17:16, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

While I can see you've made some fine edits, it's better if you have a name attached to them! Once a username becomes familiar people recognise and trust that user knowing their work. But an IP is just an IP, and can never become respected in that way as it could (potentially) be anyone, for example <i>my</i> IP changes about every 30 hours, and if I fiddle with my firewall it changes even sooner! If you had already signed up this situation wouldn't have happened, and, after signing up, it won't happen again.
