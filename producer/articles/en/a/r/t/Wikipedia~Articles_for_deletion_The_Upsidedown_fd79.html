<li>You keep saying that. <i>How</i> has it been asserted? I still can't see how it passes <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. They've received a few magazine blurbs and been the opening act on a couple of small tours. If you could tell us "This passes because of criteria X", that would help your case. I don't think meeting the criteria for you guys is too far off, so I'm changing my "protect" opinion. Give it time. If you guys are really that good, you'll make it soon enough, and someone else will write the article about you (it's very, very hard to get an article in that's about yourself, see <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the info and feedback. I've read the <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> criteria and improved upon the original, and will continue to try and meet what's expected.Note: The Upsidedown headlined most shows in Portland and Seattle and on tour. 2 of the members of the band were formerly from bands that are on wikipedia. the record was produced by Tony Lash who's also represented on wikipedia.The Out Crowd and The Village Green, also represented on wikipedia are friends and recommended we submit an article. The Dandy Warhols are working with us in the studio to finish our new record.</li>
</ul>
<p>there are 20 or so write-ups from press around the country, including The Boston Globe, The Nashville Scene, etc. should I reference them all? I don't see huge press detail on other band articles. I think this passes because The Upsidedown is an established working band, has released a record that has gotten good reviews and airplay in west coast markets(kexp-seattle,knrk-portland,littleradio-LA) , and been used on soundtracks to recent television shows.

<dl>
<dd>If other band pages don't cite their sources, they need to be edited or deleted as well. For this article, we need <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The Boston Globe would qualify, so please add that citation. Random appearances on TV shows aren't necessarily notable. Exceptions would be if it were <i>central</i> to the episode, or became a theme througout the series. If there are any reviews of the band or their album in notable publications, that would go a long way towards resolving this. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 23:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

For what it's worth,please note that nowhere in the article am I promoting or linking any of the band's music, products or sites.

<li>Glad to hear it. I see you've been attempting to add information, but it's not easy to follow. Make sure you're <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">properly citing</a> the references.

<ul>
<li>I've rewritten the article a bit for you, added a template, some categories...I'm not too good at this stuff yet (if someone wants to cleanup my cleanup, be my guest). In your zeal of adding stuff, things got a bit messy. Much of the information was either condensed down to the template, or really not needed (more than half of it was article quotes...if we really need to see them we can look up the articles). I also threw in a link to your homepage and Reverb's homepage. I believe the sources now establish notability, but I dropped the indy magazine ones, they don't carry a lot of weight (The Globe and The Oregonian do, though). Feel free to add in some history, a discography, what have you...there's more to be done.And even if it still doesn't pass AfD, don't be discouraged. As I said earlier, you'll get there eventually. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 11:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The first external link doesn't pull up anything for me. The second (Boston Globe) seems to be a collection of media mentions, but they all seem to be blurbs about upcoming shows that the band is going to be part of with other, frankly more notable, bands. I don't see anything that meets <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> beyond the Magnet mention. The article as you've rewritten it <i>looks</i> much better re: formatting. But I feel like the the original author is just having to stretch too much to make the case for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 19:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>They're not the Stones, no. But I'd call it "multiple non-trivial published works". Just because a band just does opening acts doesn't make them non-notable. I think they're borderline, but I think it qualifies. Oh, I screwed up the links, they're fixed now. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> After the latest updates, the article looks <i>much</i> better. The references are still somewhat weak, but the article has received a drastic improvement thanks to Upsidedown8. More references would be good, but at the moment I'd say it just <i>barely</i> passes <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. I'll let other editors improve this article. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 03:58, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Changing to<b>Neutral</b> The article looks a million times better than it did when the AfD was started--in sources, clarity, and NPOV. I still have my doubts that the sources cited qualify as "non-trivial" mentions, but if the consensus seems to be going in the "keep" direction, I can certainly understand that. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 04:12, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Can I suggest this be re-listed if nobody else chimes in? A lot has changed since the original AfD tag, and I think there needs to be more input on this one. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 09:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for everyone's input and help on this article. I added a discography per <a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a>'s suggestion. Upsidedown8 02:34, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
