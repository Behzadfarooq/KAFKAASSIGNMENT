<p>Yasuhiro Wakabayashi, usually known as <b>Hiro</b>, was born in 1930 to Japanese parents living in China. Hiro is a famous American fashion photographer. Presently he is a freelance commercial photographer.</p>
<p>Originally from Japan, he arrived in America in 1954, entered the School of Modern Photography in California, and began working with the iconic fashion photographer <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Avedon_62d1.html" title="Richard Avedon">Richard Avedon</a> in 1956. In the late 1960's, Hiro became a star fashion photographer in his own right. He made significant contributions as a staff photographer to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harper%27s_Bazaar_5411.html" title="Harper's Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>, working under the luminary <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexey_Brodovitch_c235.html" title="Alexey Brodovitch">Alexey Brodovitch</a> from 1956 to 1975; one of his most celebrated photographs is a 1963 shot of a Harry Winston diamond necklace placed on a bovine foot. Surreal and unique, Hiro's photographs are noted for their elegance and clean appearance. These qualities are established by liberal use of uncommon lighting, along with unusual props, the juxtaposition of exotic elements, and his signature use of color.</p>
<p>Hiro is well-known for his unique aesthetic, extreme originality, and the precision of execution of his vision. The trade magazine <i>American Photographer</i> devoted an entire issue to the work of Hiro in 1982.</p>

<p>Cryptovirology is a field that studies how to use cryptography to design powerful malicious software. It encompasses overt attacks such as cryptoviral extortion (using a cryptovirus, cryptoworm, cryptotrojan, etc.) as well as covert attacks in which the attacker secretly steals private information such as private keys. An example of the latter type of attack are asymmetric backdoors. An asymmetric backdoor is a backdoor (e.g., in a cryptosystem) that can only be used by the attacker even after it is found.</p>

<p>Michael "Piano Squall" Gluck started out as nothing more than an anime and video game fan who loved to play the Piano, but his love and devotion quickly grew into something more. He started attending Conventions cosplaying as Squall, a character from the game Final Fantasy 8 and he became quite the popular attraction and started performing concerts at Conventions across the state. He performs a wide array of video game and anime music on the piano and is well known for his kind disposition and ease to work with.</p>
<p>Piano Squall has also been doing several <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_concert.html" title="Benefit concert">benefit concerts</a> as of late to help raise money for different charitable organizations. He has composed his own video game music for a system that attaches to exercise bicycles and so far this year he is already booked for many Conventions.</p>

<p>Moshe Schrauth was born on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. Moshe was born in Hermann, Missouri. At the age of 13, he began writing poetry. After 6 years, his style is still developing. He ranges between horror, romance, comedy, etc. Moshe has a stack of unpublished poems, and is currently seeking a publisher willing to at least give him 50 cents for half of them. Moshe has two published poems, which can be found on <a href="http://www.poetry.com" class="external free" title="http://www.poetry.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.poetry.com</a> Under the name Moshe Schrauth.</p>
<p>Moshe's Work can be described as emotionally evocative, and painfully honest. The few satires he has done are many-layered, filled with double entendres and striking metaphors. An overabundance of colorful adjectives create vivid imagery in the minds of his readers, of which he claims there are 5.</p>
<p>Moshe can best be described as jolly. He constantly cracks jokes, points out problems in other people's logic, and attempts to make anyone around him who's depressed cheer up through a combination of slapstick and stand-up.</p>
<p>Recently, Moshe has cut his long, curly hair. This change in pace is one of many in his life, as he's seeking to change his life for the better through a change of scenery.</p>

<p>Kashimashi ~ Girl Meets Girl ~ (かしまし ～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～) is a Japanese anime published in 2006 by Studio Hibari. The main character is a boy named Hazumu who was injured by a crashed alien spaceship. He was mortally wounded, but the aliens rebuilt his body with one difference---he now has a female body.</p>
<p>This anime is heavily <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoujo-ai.html" title="Shoujo-ai">shoujo-ai</a> themed: Hazumu liked girls when he was male, and after becoming female, still likes girls. Moreover, the two girls (Yasuna and Tomari) who liked him when he was male still like him after she is female.</p>

<p>In the early 1970s Jacob Holdt, a young man from Denmark, arrived in America with only $40. He ended up staying for five years and hitchhiking over 118,000 miles across the country. Most notable is that he discovered that his genealogy goes back to ancient Egypt. He related to almost every historical figure including Alexander the Great, Jesus Christ, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and over 10,000 other people from 2-3000 years back.

<p>A cosmic sea monster. Talmud call him the "Prince of the Sea," echoing a Canaanite name for their sea god, "Prince River." God slew him when he refused to help in creating the earth. The lethal stink of his carcass is concealed by the oceans, which is why they smell so strange (B.B. 74b). Rahav may be an alternative name for Leviathan, though some sources treat them as two different entities.</p>

<p>Adamson, Sir (William Owen) Campbell (1922–2000), Industrialist and Liberal capitalist who raised the profile of the CBI and pioneered a banking revolution at the Abbey National</p>
<p><br />
Adamson was born on 26 June 1922. He was educated at Rugby School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he read economics. Being rejected by the armed forces due to hereditary night-blindness, he had a brief wartime stint with the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Subsequently Adamson decided to go into the steel industry where he began to gain recognition for his ideas. On 26 May 1945 Adamson married (Ada) Gilvray Allan (1921/2–1998), a sociologist, with whom he had two sons and two daughters.</p>
<p><br />
A distinguished record in the steel industry drew Adamson to the attention of Harold Wilson's Labour government, and he was invited in 1967 (the year that the steel industry was nationalized for the second time) to join the relatively new Department of Economic Affairs. Adamson's role was that of senior industrial adviser, in charge of co-ordinating all the other industrial advisers.</p>
<p><br />
After two years at the job, Adamson was glad to leave. He and his wife Gilvray planned a safari drive across the Sahara—a long-cherished ambition. As they were about to depart, John Davies, the founder director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), following its initial four years, rang to suggest that Adamson might be interested in the CBI job, which he was leaving. The Adamsons left for their holiday leaving poste restante addresses in in Algiers and Cairo. On return to Cairo, Adamson recieved the somewhat surprising news that he had been appointed to the job.</p>
<p><br />
Adamson's seven years with the organisation were among the most turbulent years for British industry, and the economy, since the war. He always claimed that his biggest achievement was persuading the CBI, in 1971 to 1972, to hold back price rises, without which Heath's pay and prices policy would never have taken off. He was certainly the main architect of that policy, and it helped to halve the inflation rate. In retrospect, Adamson's most significant legacy was in carrying the CBI in support of Heath's pro-European policies. He was one of the first British industrialists to be convinced of the need to link with Europe, and his leadership was crucial in influencing Britain's largest companies.</p>
<p><br />
In 1974 Adamson was involved in the widely publicized ‘Heath episode’. He had never been a strong supporter of Heath's Industrial Relations Act (1971). Two days before the general election of February 1974, which Heath lost, Adamson made a speech to the Industrial Relations Society at what he thought was a private meeting. Asked what the Conservatives should do with the Industrial Relations Act if they won the election, he replied: ‘If I were them I would try to get close to the unions and hammer out something better’ (The Times). These words caused a political sensation. The unlikely claim was made by Heath that Adamson had cost him the election by his remarks. Adamson tendered his resignation, which was refused, partly on account of strong support from his staff, but his reputation undoubtedly suffered from this episode. He stayed at the CBI until 1976, when he was knighted.</p>
<p><br />
Adamson's personal life also went through a period of dramatic change. He separated from Gilvray, and in 1984, married Josephine Logan (Mimi) Lloyd-Chandler.</p>
<p><br />
Adamson was, however, still widely respected, and accepted several part-time board appointments. Then in 1978 he was appointed chairman of the Abbey National Building Society. Here he led a revolution. He was convinced that the building society movement needed to modernize itself, and he set about changing the status of the Abbey National from mutual ownership to a public company. Adamson retired from the Abbey National in 1991, having seen the new company make a prosperous start.</p>
<p><br />
Adamson also served on the boards of many other companies, including Renold Chains, the Imperial Group, Yule Catto, Tarmac, Revertex Chemicals, and Lazards. As well as being on the boards of many charities, he was a govenor of rugby school.</p>
<p><br />
So many of Adamson's qualities can be gleaned from his Who's Who listing; brass rubbing, music, walking, arguing (in later years, he omitted brass rubbing). No one who walked with him was ever in any doubt about his unusual mix of qualities - immense sensitivity, a strong, ethically-based vision, and mischievous humour coupled with self-deprecation. (The Guardian)</p>
<p><br />
Adamson, survived by Mimi, and two sons and two daughter from his first marriage died August 21 2000.</p>

<p>The Rabbit died, a colloquilism meaning that someone is pregnant. In time past Rabbits were used as a pregnancy test - the urine of a suspected pregnant female was injected into a female rabbit - and after a time the ovaries of the rabbit were examined to reveal follicles growing on the ovaries of the rabbit - which had been stimulated to grow by the hormones in the woman's urine.</p>
<p>If no follicles - then not enough hormone meaning the woman was not pregnant.</p>
<p>Hence the term "The rabbit died"</p>

<p>This is Lucky Ali's 4th private album. Although it does contain some conventional Lucky Ali songs but he has experimented with his music in many songs. He seems to be diluting his brand in many songs.Though nota great chartbuster like Sunoh, It did gain considerable amount of popularity. Title track was most famous</p>
<p>The Track list:</p>
<ol>
<li>KABHI AISA LAGTA HAI: The title song is good and brings about a positive feeling to the litsener. Great music and matching video.</li>
<li>TERI YAAD JAB AATI HAI:Second videofrom the album. Sung in memory of his brother Macky. A sad song with really moving lyrics. He really looks sad in this song.</li>
<li>JABSE MILI HAI: This is the real Lucky Ali style happy song which can make anybody smile. This song shows that he has not lost his good old ay of singing.</li>
<li>TANHAI MEIN BASI: Another sad song. Not as good as previous songs but better than most of its successor songs from the album.</li>
<li>EK PAL MEIN HAI: A weird track. Not composed by Lucky Ali which is clearly visible. But some portions from this song are good.</li>
<li>KABHI AISA LAGTA HAI INSTRUMENTAL: Another song only to add to the list. Not bad but certainly not expected from Lucky Ali.</li>
<li>YEH DIL DEEWANA HAI: It is hard to believe that this song has been sung by Lucky Ali. He seems to be experimenting. Although this song would dissapoint most Lucky Ali fans but its not so bad after all...</li>
<li>THAPPA THUPPY CHUPPA CHUPPI: As it is said "All is well that ends well". Although this is also an experimental song, it sounds great. It has unconventional lyrics and beats. Really rocking song that would shake even those who don't like Lucky Ali.</li>
</ol>
<p>KALH was definitely not the best from Lucky Ali. Lets hope that he returns in a bigger and better way.</p>

<p>[BC's Quest for Tires]</p>
<p>BC's Quest for Tires was an Apple IIe game based on the comic strip of the same name created by Johnny Hart. It was published by Sierra On-Line Inc and developed by Sydney Development Corp.</p>
<p>In the game the player controlled Thor as he traveled on his famous stone wheel to save Cute Chick who has been captured by a dinosaur. Thor would have to jump or duck obstacles, creatures and other characters from the BC world (such as the Fat Broad) as he progressed through the game.</p>
<p>The game was released on a number of systems of the period, such as the Commodore 64, MSX, PC, ZX Spectrum and Atari 400/800/XL/XE. These games obviously had minor differences, such as differences in graphics, but the gameplay and premise were identical.</p>
<p>The game's earliest release was in 1983, although the writer cannot locate with certainty the year of the Apple IIe release.</p>
<p>A sequel was made called "BC's Quest for Tires II: Grog's Revenge" was released in 1984 on a number of systems including the C64, MSX and Colecovision, but does not appear to have been released for the Apple IIe. <b>A record label that hasn't released any records is not notable. The computer game you've included in the same article is also not notable enough for an encyclopedia.

Although its size, the symposium is still organized by the International Students' Committee (ISC), a voluntary students group (about 25 members) from the University of St. Gallen.</p>

<p>In 1969 five students at the University of St. Gallen set up the ISC. Their aim was to contrast the hard-line student upheavals and protests of 1968 and create a Management Symposium in order to offer a neutral platform for constructive intergenerational dialogue.</p>

<p>The Hauppauge Industrial Association, which has a membership of approximately 1,000 companies throughout LI, is a grass-roots, pro-active 27- year old business organization that focuses on the economic health and well-being of its member companies and that of the entire Long Island business community. HIA provides services and programs focusing on international trade, human resources, business development, government affairs, manufacturing, technology, environment, education, engineering, transportation, energy and much more.</p>
<p>HIA offers many networking opportunities at monthly luncheons, educational seminars, trade shows, golf outings, fishing and ski trips, holiday parties, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, HIA successfully spearheaded an effort to have New York State construct an exit into the Industrial Park from Northern State Parkway. This exit is used daily by hundreds of business people and is appreciated by all. By working closely with town, county and state government agencies and departments, the safety, health, ease of transportation, and general business assistance for the 1300 companies and 55,000 employees in the Hauppauge Industrial Park are ensured.</p>
<p>From the installation of much-needed traffic lights, to the repaving or widening of critical roads, to stop signs, street lights, bicycle lanes and a state-of-the-art daycare center, the HIA has successfully championed them all. Placement of a Suffolk County Police Department COPE medical emergency vehicle in the Industrial Park and recent approval by the Suffolk County Legislature to assign a larger vehicle equipped with advanced life-saving equipment protect 55,000 of our fellow Long Islanders in the Industrial Park during medical emergency situations.</p>
<p>Scholarships for Long Island students attending colleges or trade schools right here on Long Island are presented annually by HIA to maintain Long Island's workforce with competent employees.</p>
<p>The 27 member Board of Directors and 18 committees keep the organization on the right path.</p>

<p><b>Acoustic holography</b> is a method used to estimate the sound field near a source by measuring acoustic parameters away from the source via an array of pressure and/or particle velocity transducers. Measuring techniques included within <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoustic_holography.html" title="Acoustic holography">acoustic holography</a> are becoming increasingly popular in various fields, most notably those of transporation, vehicle and aircraft design, and <a href="../../../n/v/h/NVH_0fcd.html" title="NVH">NVH</a>. The general idea of <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoustic_holography.html" title="Acoustic holography">acoustic holography</a> has lead to different versions such as near-field acoustic holography (NAH) and statistically optimal near-field acoustic holography (SONAH).</p>

<p>Vitamins</p>
<p>Vitamins are organic molecules needed to support most life functions. If something (living) lacks a certain type of vitamin, it will suffer from disease, then death. Vitamins are seen as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. If they are fat-soluble, they can be stored with or as fat. If they are water-soluble, they are immediately digested. With the exception of Vitamin B12, which is stored in the liver. And only two Vitamins are made inside the body, Vitamin A (byproduct of beta-carotene (orange photosynthetic pigment) digestion) and Vitamin D (created when the skin is exposed to ultra-violet light). The term Vitamin was first coined by Biochemist Casimir Funk in 1912. Vita- in Latin means Life, -Amin is short for Amine, because scientist at that time thought vitamins were Amines (an organic compound containing nitrogen).</p>
<p>Long before vitamins were discovered, people knew about the importance of certain foods. Ancient Egyptians figured out that feeding a person liver (High in Vitamin A, Retinol) can help cure night-blindness. In 1747, James Lind discovered that eating citrus fruits (High in Vitamin C, Absorbic Acid) prevents Scurvy, a nasty disease. In 1881 Nikolai Lunin fed one mouse milk, and the other the separate ingredients of milk, it died. He then stated that there must be some other tiny ingredient necessary to life.</p>
<p>There are 13 Vitamins necessary to human life. They are as follows: Vitamin A- Retinol, Fat-soluble, Deficiency will cause keratomalacia. Vitamin B1- Thiamin, Water-soluble, Deficiency will cause Beriberi. Vitamin B2- Riboflavin, Water-soluble, Deficiency will cause Ariboflavinosis. Vitamin B3- Niacin, Water-soluble, Deficiency will cause Pellagra. Vitamin B5- Pantothenic Acid, Water-soluble, Deficiency will cause Paresthesias. Vitamin B6- Pyridoxine, Water-soluble, Deficiency will cause nothing. Vitamin B7- Biotin, Water-soluble, Deficiency will cause nothing. Vitamin B9- folic acid, Water-soluble, Deficiency will cause nothing. Vitamin B12- Cyanocobalamin, Water-soluble, Deficiency will cause Pernicious Anemia. Vitamin C- Absorbic Acid, Deficiency will cause Scurvy. Vitamins D1-3, Deficiency will cause Rickets.</p>
<p>Deficiencies</p>
<p>Keratomalacia is an eye disorder, leading to a dry cornea. Beriberi is a nervous system disorder, causing weight loss, emotional disturbances, impaired sensory perception, weakness and pain in the limbs, periods of irregular heartbeat, and swelling of bodily tissues; causes death from heart failure. Ariboflavinosis is a disorder causing dry lips, magenta tongue, sore throat, and hyperemia. Pellagra causes diarrhea, dermatitis, weakness, mental confusion, and eventually dementia. Paresthesias causes numbness. Pernicious Anemia causes inflammation of the tongue.</p>

<p>Eric Wainaina (born on 28th August 1973) is a Kenyan Kora Award-winning singer-songwriter whose career was launched with his debut album, Sawa Sawa, in 2001. Wainaina's music is a blend of Kenyan Benga rhythm and East African guitars, with some modern harmony.</p>
<p><br />
Wainaina was born in Nairobi, Kenya, to George Gitau Wainaina and Margaret Wangari Wainaina. He has one brother, Simon Wainaina. His love for music started at a young age. He got a piano at age 4, originally intended for his brother Simon who instead took keen interest in football. Wainaina thus grudgingly took piano lessons. He actively participated in choir throughout elementary and high school at St. Mary’s School, Nairobi, save for a short stint in basketball. Whilst growing up, Wainaina was influenced musically by international artists such as Papa Wemba, Youssou N'Dour, Lokua Kanza and Paul Simon.</p>
<p><br />
Wainaina first stepped into the world of music with Five Alive, a gospel a cappella group. Five Alive consisted of Victor Seii, Bob Kioko, Chris Kamau, and David Mageria, who was replaced by Joe Kiragu. They drew their musical influence from Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Take 6. Dominating Kenya's airwaves in 1995, Five Alive released their debut album ‘Five Alive’ in 1996, and even went on to tour Europe the same year. Despite the fact that they went in search of fame and fortune and found none, this experience convinced Wainaina to pursue a professional career in music. In 1996 he performed and appeared in the video for Get in the Driver’s Seat, a song commissioned by the United Nations Drug Control Programme for a highly successful anti-drug campaign spanning 20 countries. This not only set the stage for his eventual emergence as a solo artist, but also got him into the social concern and activism that characterizes much of his music</p>
<p><br />
When the group disbanded in 1997, Wainaina went on to join the Berklee College of Music in Boston—USA, from which he graduated with a degree in Music, majoring in Songwriting and Record Engineering. He graduated with honours.</p>
<p><br />
During his years at Berklee, Wainaina and his band traveled to different parts of the country to perform, as well as holding regular shows in Boston. He worked to produce a sound that would be distinctively Kenyan both in the music and the content of the lyrics. In order to do this, he made sure that he released a new track every time he returned home for vacation, This was well received by his growing fanbase, with his performance at Kenya's 'Beats of the Season’ concert in December 2000 being watched live by 15,000 fans and broadcast nationally.</p>
<p><br />
His notable releases include 'Kenya Only', a song that instantly made him Kenya's favourite modern musician. After the 1998 terrorist bombing in Nairobi where over 200 Kenyans lost their lives, 'Kenya Only' was adopted as the unofficial song of mourning, receiving extensive radio and TV airplay nation-wide. His adaptation of a Kikuyu folk tune 'Ritwa Riaku' was added to the playlist of every radio station in the nation soon after.</p>
<p><br />
Wainaina returned to the top of Kenya's musical agenda after he released 'Nchi ya Kitu Kidogo' (‘Land of Bribes’ in Kiswahili) in 2001, a song that launched his crusade against rampant corruption in the country. With the chart success of 'Nchi ya Kitu Kidogo', Wainaina received international accolades. Transparency International (Kenya) supported him as an artist who would help educate people on the negativity of corruption, appointing him an ambassador. He was also appointed Ambassador for the Kenya Human Rights Commission and by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights for his commitment to fighting the abuses to justice through music. This anthem against corruption (Nchi ya Kitu Kidogo) was not so highly appreciated in all quarters, however, with the government of the day putting up resistance to it by refusing to air it on the national broadcaster, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. In one instance several attempts were made to keep him from performing at a national event, the Kenya Music Festival, including intimidation and attempts to switch off his microphone.</p>
<p><br />
Following the suspicious death of Father Anthony Kaiser in 2003 , Wainaina was commissioned by the Mill Hill Fathers to write a song about this. This became Ukweli, a call for justice despite efforts that were being made to cover up the true nature of Father Kaiser’s death, which was reported as suicide despite strong evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p><br />
In 2001, Africa Almanac.com listed him amongst the top 100 Africans of the year 2000, which included high profile names such as Nelson Mandela, Joseph Kabila, Yash Pal Ghai, Baaba Maal and Ousmane Sembene. His first record, Sawa Sawa, released in 2001, remains one of the highest selling solo albums in the country.</p>
<p><br />
Wainaina returned home from Berklee in August 2002 after his graduation with two degrees. He was also honored with the Jack Maher award for his exceptional performance as a songwriter. The annual award is given to students who have been recognized for their potential to become leaders in the international music industry.</p>
<p><br />
Wainaina's music receives international appeal. He received the MNET (South Africa) award for favourite male vocalist in February 2001, and was one of the first Kenyans to receive an award for Best East African Artist at the pan-African 7th Annual KORA All Africa Music Awards on 2nd November 2002. He is also the only Kenyan artist to have performed live at the KORA ceremony. He was nominated for another KORA Award in 2003, and in 2005 he received his third Kora nomination, this time for the prestigious Artist of the Decade award.</p>
<p><br />
In 2002, he played at the launch of the International Criminal Court at the UN Headquarters in New York, presided over by Koffi Annan. He has toured in Switzerland for 4 consecutive years and has performed at Holland’s Festival Mundial (2003) as well as Harare’s International Festival of the Arts (2003), receiving outstanding reviews for both performances. He also performed at the 2004 Sauti za Buzara festival in Zanzibar, a celebration of East African Music.</p>
<p><br />
In December 2004 Wainaina premiered a 21- song musical theatre piece, “Lwanda, Man of Stone”, based on a local folk story. One of the first of its kind in Kenya, the show ran for a hugely successful theatre season, and a concert version of the same show continues to be performed at major cultural events.</p>
<p><br />
Wainaina is engaged to Sheba Hirst and they are expecting their first child in April 2006.</p>
<p><br />
He is currently working on his second solo album, which he expects to release later in 2006.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-26_ff65.html" title="Edit section: Pomeroy, Co Tyrone, N Ireland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pomeroy, Co Tyrone, N Ireland</span></h2>
<p>Pomeroy was first settled by Neolithic farmers from about 3000 B.C.and has for many centuries been associated with the O'Neills, O'Donnellys and O'Loughrans.</p>
<p>In the early 17th century, at the time of the Plantation, Pynnar's Survey mentions that there was just one English family on the estate of Sir William Parsons some of whose lands passed into the hands of the Pomeroys, an English family of Norman origin, who gave their name to the village. The main village is situated in the townland of Cavanakeeran and it is said that oak forests once covered part of the area - as the names of some of the townlands (Killay - woody place, Munderadoe - a bog of the black oak wood) - seem to indicate.</p>
<p>During the late 17th and early 18th century, the area was said to be infested with robbers and bandits. This is a reference to the activities of the famous Shane Bearnach O Donnelly, who had headquarters at Altmore, from which he preyed on travellers on the main Dublin to Derry road. He posed such a threat that a barracks was built at Altmore, Pomeroy. The famous song "The Mountains of Pomeroy" by noted Irish scholar, Dr. George Sigerson, is said to romanticise Bearnach's exploits.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Altmore produced another famous son, General James Shields, a prominent general and politician at the time of the American Civil War. Near Altmore stands a well said to have been used by King James II to water his horse on the road to Derry in 1689.</p>
<p>The present village dates from about the beginning of the 19th century and was associated with the Lowry family who came from Fintona about the middle of the 18th century. The village became famous for its markets and fairs, especially the monthly fair on the second Tuesday, which still takes place today. The Lowrys played a prominent part in the life of the area for about two hundred years. Their 'big house', now demolished, once stood on the site of the present Forestry Training School.</p>
<p>In 1775, the Church of Ireland parish was formed from 42 townlands out of Donaghmore. The first Church was built at Crossdernott in 1782 and the Church in the Diamond - Altedesert Parish Church - was consecrated in 1841.</p>
<p>The Catholic parish was formed in 1836, also part of Donaghmore and the first Church was built in 1824 on the site now occupied by the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes and St Bernadette and by the Old St Patrick's Cemetery. An old schoolhouse, dating from about 1830, adjoins the old Church site. Previous to 1824, Catholics had to worship at a Mass Rock in common with many other Catholics around Ireland as a result of the Penal Laws.</p>
<p>The first train on the line from Dungannon to Omagh passed through Pomeroy in 1861 and the last passed through in 1965 when the line closed. The longest-lived person was George Fletcher of Killay, who died in 1906, aged 118 years. Two years previously, he had received a gold snuff box from Edward VII in recognition of his being the oldest citizen in His Majesty's realm.</p>
<p>Pomeroy is also the highest village in the north of Ireland.</p>
