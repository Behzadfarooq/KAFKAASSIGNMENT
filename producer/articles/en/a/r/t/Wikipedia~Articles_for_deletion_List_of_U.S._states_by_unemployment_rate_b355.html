<p>A list using nearly 5-year-old census data, which is only linked to a bunch of other random US states lists ({{US state lists}}, which includes <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._states_by_postal_abbreviation_ddc8.html" title="List of U.S. states by postal abbreviation">List of U.S. states by postal abbreviation</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._states_by_time_zone_fa07.html" title="List of U.S. states by time zone">List of U.S. states by time zone</a>, among others) which link among each other.

<li>Hello? Perhaps you should address what I write, as opposed to what you believe. My points are listed above: it's 5-year-old employment data! This data is collected <b>monthly</b> by the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="http://www.bls.gov/sae/home.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bls.gov/sae/home.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, making this list not only outdated but actually misleading.

<li><i><b>I created</b></i> this? Dude, you need to step away from the computer. The article under VFD <i><b>WAS NOT</b></i> created by me. I've formatted it, but did not create it. No one has the <i>responsibility</i> to update a page. Wikipedia is a <i><b>community</b></i> effort. Instead of wasting yours, mine, and others' time voting, how about you update the page when you feel like it? <b>YOU</b> are the one unsatisfied with the date of the data so <b>YOU</b> are more than welcome to update it. <b>DO NOT</b> pawn it off on others as their responsibility.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Mountains of statistical data are published by governments at all levels. You can cut this data many different ways, by geography, by income, by race, by gender, etc, etc, almost without limit. All or most of these tabulations are potentially of interest to someone. They are NOT encyclopedia articles in themselves. If there were an article on, say, Variation between U.S. States in Employment, this data would be interesting in that article. One might also expect to read various theories about the reasons for the variation. But just a raw tabulation of data from the decennial census or monthly BLS statistics is not an encyclopedia article.

<li>This is <i>one</i> list in a set of lists by state. No one is proposing to make this a statistical database. And unemployment isn't an obscure statistic to have.

<li>It was based on the 2000 census and there hasn't been another census since. I guess it is the fault of the article another census hasn't been performed. Besides, your point is moot.

<li><b>Delete</b> Impossible to keep updated enough to be worthwhile.

<li>And the list can serve as a source for those numbers. Each state can reference the list. Much better than listing a source in 50 places (the link could change). The list also serves to consolidate the data.

It's not impossible, just not done. Besides, with a source link on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._states_by_unemployment_rate_328e.html" title="List of U.S. states by unemployment rate">List of U.S. states by unemployment rate</a> a visitor can get up-to-date data if they so desire. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 20:57, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>At 10 to 9 to delete, it would appear the dividing line between those that think it's unencyclopedic &amp; those that think it is encyclopedic; and those that think this list makes wikipedia a statistical database &amp; those that think it is not. I think it is necessary to note that the merits of statistics is not listed on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> nor <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, ergo it's not grounds for deletion. I think it is also necessary to note that other pages (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_film.html" title="2004 in film">2004 in film</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">2005 in film</a>) have a much higher degree of volatility yet are maintained, ergo "unmaintainability" is necessarily groundless as the article has been updated after being noticed it needed updating. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 20:55, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: I consider this article to be a violation (however well-intentioned) of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files</a> case 3 - a "mere collection of public domain or other source material". This information is copied directly from the US Labor Dept statistics. The link is even provided right on the page. Comment 2: The timestamp does not, in my opinion, invalidate the maintenance concerns. The title of this article is not [[2003 list of US states...]]. Even if you did change it, that's not what the articles linking in are trying to find. Comment 3: "200x in film" articles are not actually more volatile than this in the long term. They have more current edits this year but once the year's over, they will become highly stable. This article never will. This is an article which will have to be maintained year in and year out. If no alternative were available, we might have to accept that cost. However, an easy alternative <i>is</i> available - the link to the US Labor Dept report. No change of vote. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:56, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>So you're saying that there won't be <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_film.html" title="2006 in film">2006 in film</a> to update next year and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_in_film.html" title="2007 in film">2007 in film</a> the year after that.....that these articles just stop? I hadn't heard of the movie industry foreclosing at a definite point in time. I'm also confused as to your using part 3 of the link which says "other source material that are only useful when presented with their original, un-modified wording." Maybe I'm just a dunce here, but are you saying that unemployment rates aren't useful in a modified form? Having just spent no less than 5 minutes trying to find the numbers, I can't possibly see why it shouldn't be desired to have a copy of the numbers of wikipedia. (This is not where I'm a dunce with nearing my 3rd engineering degree and whom I can think of only a hand full of other equal or more computer savvy users. The BLS site is just hard to navigate.) From the linked page on the article, it takes 3 sequential clicks to get to data as displayed in the article. Even then it's preformatted text in a table form. This article improves the readability of the data and sorts it. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 07:44, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The full text of the criterion you cite is "Mere collections of public domain or other source material; such as entire books or source code, original historical documents, letters, laws, proclamations, and other source material that are only useful when presented with their original, un-modified wording. Small or otherwise for the context critical source material, either in text or image form, is needed. (But of course, there's nothing wrong with using public domain resources in order to add factual content and wording to an article -- such as the use of the 1911 encyclopedia)" This rule was certainly not made to exclude every public domain collection of data that can be found elsewhere, but probably to prevent things more suitable for WikiSource from appearing here. For example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_area.html" title="List of countries by area">list of countries by area</a> is pretty much public domain raw data with a few explanatory notes about it, and a version of the same list could easily be found and linked to on some other article, but there is nothing about the subject matter or the data itself that makes it unencyclopedic and no reason to kick it off of Wikipedia. I think the same goes for this article. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 16:38, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: I should have been clearer. If we were, in fact, using the Labor Dept numbers in a modified form or using them as illustration in a larger article, that might be a reason to keep them. However, I do not believe that we are modifying the raw data or even the presentation of the data in any meaningful way. That is, of course, a judgment call and reasonable people can disagree. This page still feels to me like a raw data dump, not what I expect of an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 17:30, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
