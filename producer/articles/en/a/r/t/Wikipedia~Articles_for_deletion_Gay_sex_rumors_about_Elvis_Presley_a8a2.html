<dd>This is what this user constantly claims in order to denigrate my contributions. As everybody can see, I frequently cite my sources. Administrator <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a>, who knows that there is an edit war going on, has recommended to create a new article on the <s>gay sex</s> rumors about Elvis Presley. See <a href="../../../e/l/v/Talk%7EElvis_Presley_f65c.html" title="Talk:Elvis Presley">Talk:Elvis Presley</a>. As it is a fact that these claims exist, I think it is a fair compromise to exclude this material from the main article and put it in this new article. Perhaps an administrator could add a link to this new page in the "Relationships" section of the article on <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> which is still protected.

<dd>O.K., you are right that you were not primarily thinking of Elvis, and I still think it is a good idea to have Wikipedia articles of this kind. There is one important point. When I explained to gay historian David Ehrenstein the problem that some contributors to Wikipedia try to suppress every reference that some Hollywood stars were gay, as everybody can see from the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENick_Adams_3fe6.html" title="Talk:Nick Adams">Talk:Nick Adams</a> page and the related archives, the <a href="../../../j/a/m/Talk%7EJames_Dean_cee1.html" title="Talk:James Dean">Talk:James Dean</a> page, etc., he answered,
<dl>
<dd>The problem is cultural. <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">Heterosexuality</a> is regarded as universal and a self-evident truth. Everyone is supposed to be heterosexual, therefore "proof" of same-sexuality is required. Standards of "proof" change constantly. In her memoir of her brief affair with Dean, "Dizzy" Sheridan (Jerry Seinfeld's mother to zillions of TV viewers) spoke quite candidly about the fact that she knew Dean had an affair with producer Rogers Brackett. [I have used this sentence for the James Dean article.] Gavin Lambert has spoken of Sal Mineo's affair with Nicholas Ray (with whom he had had an affair as well) and Gore Vidal made mention of the Ray-Mineo affair too. Gavin Lambert makes mention of Nick Adams' gayness in his biography of Natalie Wood -- who had a great many gay friends. In sort there is nothing unusual about being gay or bisexual particularly in Hollywood. It's the Heterosexual Dictatorship (Christopher Isherwood's useful term) that can't handle the truth.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>These are wise words indeed. Query: do you really have problems with the fact that there are some authors who say that some Hollywood stars were gay or may have had homosexual leanings? You may think about this, instead of condemning my article and rashly saying "delete". <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 20:02, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is somewhat off-topic, but I'm not sure that the idea of <i>Celebrity rumours</i>, or <i>Gossip about actors</i> articles, as mentioned above are a particularly good idea. Firstly, I imagine libel laws would be an issue. Secondly, rumours can be indiscriminate, baseless, unsourced, and all the things which Wikipedia shouldn't be. Perhaps this argument is best saved for when those articles come to AfD themselves though, as this debate is already fairly convoluted as it is! <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 22:28, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that my remarks are off-topic, as the suppression of different opinions which are not in line with the opinion of some fans is a real Wikipedia problem.

<li><b>Reluctant keep</b>, reluctant because I'm opposed to the continual assumption that every famous male is gay. However as noted above this does appear to be well-sourced although I personally would delete the Guardian quote as being taken out of context since it, in turn, references a scandal mag and therefore weakens the thesis. Also the last paragraph, despite the sourcing, needs to be recast for NPOV.

Given the National Enquirer being a source can we expect an article on Living on the moon rumours about Elvis Presley? If the article is being used, as alleged above, to promote a book, then it skirts dangerously close to being personal research. The article is inherently POV, and would most likely remain so even with a name change. Given that the article cites its very weak sources at length, I see nothing to suggest that it could be expanded further with the addition of new information. I see nothing to suggest it could ever be an encylopaedic article. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 07:18, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I read the archives prior to casting my vote (or whatever we call it now that VfD has become AfD). I didn't 'rashly' vote delete. I'm not part of a 'heterosexual dictatorship'. I'm not a rabid Elvis Presley fan, or a rabid homophobe, or a rabid rabbit. As far as I remember, I came across the article via AfD, rather than searching for it. I have no agenda here with regards either sexuality, Elvis Presley, Hollywood, or anything. My only agenda here is to contribute to an encyclopaedia to make it as good as it can be, which is what I feel I did with my vote and stating my reasoning. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 20:35, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

There is a positive Dutch review of Bret's book. So I have presented at least half a dozen independent sources (published and unpublished books, reviews, articles, plays) which deal with the topic. The article is a compromise in order to exclude the material from the main article, as many Elvis fans do not like the rumors about the singer's homosexual leanings. Perhaps the title of the article may be changed.

<li><b>From a review of David Bret's book:</b></li>
</ul>
<p>March 30, 2002</p>
<p>Elvis Presley's Gay Secret</p>
<p>by (RGS/TG/BRC)</p>
<p>ELVIS PRESLEY's HOLLYWOOD YEARS</p>
<p>According to BRET, the legendary rocker's "greedy" manager COLONEL TOM PARKER blackmailed him into virtual slavery by threatening to leak reports of the romance. Bret says, "Parker held secret information about a homosexual affair between Elvis and actor NICK ADAMS over his head like a sword. He made it clear that... if Elvis didn't toe the line, he'd let it get out. At that time, it could well have ruined his career. That's why Parker had so much control over him." Presley's sexual experimentation began with a "teenage crush" on actor JAMES DEAN that grew into an obsession, says the book. The star saw REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE 44 times and eventually became close pals with Dean's Rebel co-star Nick Adams. Bret says, "Adams claimed that he had a brief affair with Elvis after Elvis 'agreed to be his date' for a preview of Nick's 1956 film THE LAST WAGON." Presley, by then a sex symbol sending legions of women swooning, became smitten with Adams and even tried unsuccessfully to get him a part in his first movie LOVE ME TENDER, says Bret. In 1958, "Nick Adams and Elvis stayed in the same room of the same hotel in New Orleans while Elvis was filming KING CREOLE there," the author reveals. Many journalists' attempts to 'out' the star in the past were thwarted by his manager.</p>

<li><b>an additional source</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I found an interesting discussion concerning Elvis's sex life and his homosexual leanings. The author says,</p>
<dl>
<dd>The excitement about rumors about Prince Charles opened up in Europe the discussion about the sex-lives of other prominent personalities. To them belongs the unforgettable Elvis Presley, who was stationed as a young soldier in Germany. Up to now it has been a tabu to publicly speculate about the sexual predisposition of Elvis Presley. While the "King of Rock" has been spared by the media, other prominent personalities were forced to come out of the closet. ...</dd>
<dd>In order to bring light on the private secrets of deceased Hollywood stars, a team of experts in Europe is collecting information also about Elvis Presley. One source are eyewitnesses, who have been privately associated as friends and acquaintances with Elvis Presley.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One of the sources they present is this personal photograph, presumably taken by a gay friend, from the beginning of Presley's military service showing Elvis half naked with one of his male friends: <a href="http://www.meaus.com/elvis-and-boy.JPEG" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meaus.com/elvis-and-boy.JPEG" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The author adds,</p>
<dl>
<dd>The question is already now: how will the Elvis fans take the possible bisexuality of their idol? Will it bring protests and denials, or rather tolerance and understanding for the great singers? A sensitive side of Presley could even increase people's affection for him, according to the opinion of some Presley fans.</dd>

It seems more sensible to provide a link to my reply, rather than just copy and paste what I said. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 11:33, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Another published book claiming that Elvis had a homosexual affair</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In his book, <i>The Boy who would be King: An Intimate Portrait of Elvis Presley by his Cousin</i> (1990), Earl Greenwood, Elvis's second cousin who paled around with Elvis for many years before and after his success, says that Elvis had an affair with <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Adams_3506.html" title="Nick Adams">Nick Adams</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>From the review in the <i>Library Journal</i> (by David M. Turkalo, Social Law Lib., Boston):
<dl>
<dd>Having literally grown up with Elvis Presley in Tupelo and Memphis, Greenwood also served his cousin for some years as his press agent, claiming a front-row seat for the best and the worst of rock music's late king. As with so much written about him, this book is simultaneously interesting and lurid and often the former because it is the latter. But its saving grace, in addition to being well written, is Greenwood's closeness to Presley, rendering this an eyewitness account (the first ever by a blood relative) to the formative childhood years and the inner workings of the Presley family that played such a large part in the musician's personality development. Revelatory and credible in these and other areas, but never descending to either blathering idolatry or merciless crucifixion (a la Albert Goldman), this fast-paced, no-white-wash look at the rock icon will surely find an audience among the millions for whom Elvis Presley still holds fascination.
