<li>It's not terribly complicated, just labour-intensive.
<ul>
<li>The transwikied article's talk page must include the original article's edit history (for preference, properly marked up).</li>
<li>The transwiki logs at both the source and destination projects must record the move.</li>
</ul>

<li>But I note that you haven't actually transwikied anything. You've just made a redlink in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gee" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:gee">Wiktionary:gee</a>. I'm half sure that that's enough. There's pretty much nothing to salvage from this article — no etymology, no usage notes, no citations — that makes transwikification worth doing.

<p>Hyper-trivial, misinformative, and un-encyclopedic.</p>
<p>Reasons why this page should be deleted:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is extremely trivial -- even to fans of the show. The information given is so obscure, given its source, that most <i>Simpsons</i> fan sites don't provide this sort of thing (though there are a few that do)</li>
<li>The vast majority of characters on the list have never been mentioned on the television show itself. The source for this information is a long out-of-print tie-in book that was put out in 1991, which an extremely small minority of the show's famously obsessed devotees have ever read, and which most of the present staff that writes and produces the show have never even heard of. This family tree also has been contradicted by the show in the 14 years since it came out; for example, Homer and Marge's mothers have different names on the series than they do on this chart, and even though the article notes this contradiciton, it still underlines the fact that the book cannot be taken seriously as continuity. Put simply, its irrelevance (not simply its obscurity) makes it a poor reference source.</li>
<li>This doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Something like a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Simpsons_3821.html" title="List of characters from The Simpsons">list of characters</a> does because it's integral to understanding the show. This family tree is just ephemera that adds nothing useful.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think it is of relevant interest to the show, and shows how things in shows can be contradicted from their beginnings and onward. While inaccurate, it still gives some accurate references like the connection between Homer and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Powell_7996.html" title="Herb Powell">Herb Powell</a>. It is also interesting to note the ancestory of the families, as well it is interesting to see that Homer and Mr. Burns are distantly related.

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge (though with this much material, probably better to keep).

<li>On looking at it a second time, it does not yet appear to be copyvio since it is only paraphrasing and summarizing only a portion of the family trees. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> | <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">Talk</a> 15:22, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> though I admit this was a bit of a difficult decision for me. On one hand, this is both fairly trivial and also bordering on copyvio. I know real family trees can't be copyrighted, but a fictional family tree that appeared in a book... I'm not sure. On the other hand, I consider the book an official source (it was me who changed the birthdate in the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart Simpson</a> article a few months ago) and this is genuinely interesting information that can't easily be found elsewhere. Plus, with the two images and all, it looks like a good bit of work was put into this, so I'd prefer not to delete without good reason. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:32, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why would we want to keep false information? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:22, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, as I said, I consider the book to be an official source (as would most Simpsons fans, I'd imagine). The official-ness of the book is without question, as series creator Matt Groening is the book's author. It's true that some of the family tree was later contradicted in the series... but then things within the series were later contradicted by the series as well. For instance, Smithers was a black person in the first season. Any time a fictional work grows past a certain size, continuity problems are bound to slip in, and such continuity problems are of great interest to fans. In any case, the parts of the family tree that conflict with the show are specified and discussed in the article, so readers aren't likely to be confused unless they merely glance at it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 21:43, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Which means Larry Burns is too, being the son of Monty Burns.

I mean, it's noted in here that Comic Book Guy's real name is officially "Jeff Albertson", though Matt Groening said in some obscure interview it was "Louis Lane". Why the name change, anyway? Did Groening or some other writer forget that comment?

<p>This is pointless. You might as well add every politician from every Western country. Christianity is the predominant religion of almost all of the Western world and such a small list doesn't even come close to covering every Christian poltician (probably not even 1% of 1% of 1% of them), and such a list would be impossible and pointless. 65.123.220.255 05:05, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Can someone explain the difference and significance of the lists and categories? It would seem to me that categories would only list those composes who are significant enough for their own page while a list could have everyone, notable or not, entered within it. This then begs the question of why would we want to have a list of composers with those not significant enough to have their own page?

<li>Well, yes. The <i>idea</i> behind categories is to deprecate (non-annotated) lists. The <i>reality</i> is that both lists and cats have some functionality that the other doesn't, so in practice many topics are covered in both a list and a cat. This seems undesirable, and is due for some serious revision, but that would require an upgrade to the server software first. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:13, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The whole point of (annotated) lists is to organize and merge things that are inherently short, or extremely interrelated. For instance <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orc_%28Middle-earth%29_802b.html" title="Orc (Middle-earth)">Orc (Middle-earth)</a> as an (annotated) list is more comprehensive than short articles on each individual orc.</li>
<li>Of course such lists require (some) watching, because if I write my own cello piece then that does <i>not</i> warrant me listing myself there.</li>
<li>Oh yes, and I'd like this list kept, but <b>given the size of each lists, merge the lot of them</b> into a single article rather than 26 of them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:15, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, thanks for the clarification. In that case I think I vote <b>keep</b> but <b>merge</b> them into one long list. If the list becomes too long it can be split back into parts again. --<a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzball%21_0d08.html" title="User:Fuzzball!">Fuzzball!</a> <a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzball%21_4d48.html" title="User talk:Fuzzball!">(talk)</a> 00:49, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the content, but I think <b>merging</b> them together is the best idea. Ultimately it could be a fairly long list, <a href="http://www.modernworks.com/repertoire/solocello.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.modernworks.com/repertoire/solocello.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> for example providing the 20th-21st century repertoire of one performer (which notably excludes the Crumb and Hindemith, so that list is quite incomplete).

<li>It's ridiculous that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_solo_cello_pieces.html" title="List of solo cello pieces">List of solo cello pieces</a> is a redirect to Category:List of solo cello pieces. An article should <b>never</b> be a redirect to a category. The redirect should be changed into a summary article of all the alphabetic letters combined. A list is proper here rather than a category because it should contain many pieces without individual pages. So <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_solo_cello_pieces.html" title="List of solo cello pieces">List of solo cello pieces</a>, <b>eliminate redirect</b> on the latter, <b>no redirect</b> on the existing alphabetic lists, and <b>CFD the category</b>.

<li><b>Merge</b>. The point of this list is that the pieces are listed <i>by composer</i>, which is information that can't be practically preserved in a category. Raven42 09:31, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Save It!</b> We're not discussing, we're explaining. Every time there is a fact, it is added. I agree it needs to be cleaned up a little, but it is informative, not an ad. "A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically" We are making a reference. This page is very similar to the Google wiki page. Simply an explaination. Google is a website, owned by a huge company, however instead of being a game it is a search engine. You coud argue that you are advertising for Google, but you aren't. You are explaining. What happens when someone wants to know what this game is all about, where will they turn for a reference???

<li>p.s. I'm new to wikipedia, OurColony.net's history does not have the same "(started article)" as Ourcolony, so I may be wrong on the start date, or this might be because the page was started anonymously, I'm not sure.</li>

If he wants to improve the article, that's fine and even encouraged by Wikipedia policies, but improving an article on the same subject that's not being considered for VfD is just a way of circumventing the process. Improve the one under consideration now, not the one you know isn't under the gun. It's a bad faith move, in my personal opinion, though perhaps some leeway can be given for inexperience. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 12:55, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li>In all honesty the only reason I moved from working on <a href="../../../o/u/r/OurColony.net_e9be.html" title="OurColony.net">OurColony.net</a> to <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ourcolony.html" title="Ourcolony">Ourcolony</a> was because it was a cleaner slate with which to work. I voted early on to keep this article and only once I found the second did I reverse my decision on that voted and post the information here. It may have been a mistake to work on <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ourcolony.html" title="Ourcolony">Ourcolony</a> while <a href="../../../o/u/r/OurColony.net_e9be.html" title="OurColony.net">OurColony.net</a> was under review, or it may have been a mistake to report the existance of <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ourcolony.html" title="Ourcolony">Ourcolony</a> here; I thought I was doing the right thing by reporting it, as there is no need for two articles. At the time <a href="../../../o/u/r/OurColony.net_e9be.html" title="OurColony.net">OurColony.net</a> was poorly formatted, and a cut and paste job from the ourcolony.net website, while <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ourcolony.html" title="Ourcolony">Ourcolony</a> had a good start, thanks to <a href="../../../u/v/u/User%7EUvulabob27_00fb.html" title="User:Uvulabob27">Uvulabob27</a>, who created the article.

<li>I started the OurColony.net entry without knowledge of the other one. I created beause I knew and visited the Haunted Apiary entry and saw how much publicity it got. I know I'm not very good at wiki, seeing as it was my first entry ever, but I believe that with sufficient clean-up, and given time to gather more facts, this entry will be worth it. This is an event in history, I mean how many people know what the first Emperor of China's name was, now how many people know what an Xbox is?

Katefan, if you are so against it...there are PLENTY of other wikis you could read. Let us have our space and go back to doing whatever you were doing before this witchhunt. 1st off from your summary as to why it needs to be deleted you were misinformed (a.k.a. made wrongful assumptions). As a result of those wrongful assumptions you attempted to delete something on false pretenses. This ARG deserves to be in wikipedia. It is informational and historic amongst others uses. Realize that you were mistaken about it's purpose and leave us be. Otherwise ilovebees shouldn't be allowed to exist either. This is not meant as a personal attack anymore than your attempt to delete our communitie's wiki is a personal attack. Find another witch to hunt..leave us alone.

<li>Seniority does not change the validity of one's vote. If a user with 2000 edits can vote without explaining the reasoning behind it, a user with 2 edits should be permitted to as well.

<li>Anon votes or votes by people with very low edit counts are still votes, but they can be discounted at an admin's discretion when the vote is closed, as per Wikipedia's policies.

<li>Apologies, I missed your earlier comment regarding ilovebees.
<dl>
<dd>I think there should definitely be a bias against deletion of articles. As long as it's not nonsensical, what is the harm in keeping? It has, as others have said, drawn new readers (and contributors) to Wikipedia, and it's <i>information</i>. It may not be of terribly wide interest, but I'm sure the reign of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_the_Lion_424f.html" title="Henry the Lion">Henry_the_Lion</a> isn't of terribly wide interest either. Five years from now, somebody will say to himself, "Hey, remember that OurColony thing? I wonder how it turned out." Is there any reason why he shouldn't be able to come here and find out?</dd>
<dd>Regarding your earlier objection, it should be clear by now that this article is in no way a "discussion forum", but an encyclopedic description of the game and a list of challenges. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason"><b>VoiceOfReason</b></a></dd>

<li>I agree that it's vastly improved over what it was before, and I did consider whether I should change my vote... but ultimately, the article is about what amounts to a gigantic advertisement for Xbox and its parent company. I'm against Wikipedia articles that function as corporate press releases, and it doesn't change my opinion that this one is presented in the form of a game or challenge. I do appreciate your enthusiasm though and can see how someone could get drawn in. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 21:04, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)

Much pop culture originates as marketing campaigns. The article itself isn't an advertisement; it's an article <i>about</i> an advertisement. Providing factual information about the advertisement should be kosher. (In the nature of full disclosure, I should add that the aforementioned parent company happens to be my employer.

<li>Keep- As a centralized place for information, even if it is a marketing campaign, it is a website that people would like information about. I for one used wikipedia to glean information on the ilovebees.com campaign. This was mentioned on CNN, and NPR.

<li>Keep- The Ourcolony game/event/marketing campaign is a notable subject with not only immediate relevance, but probably historical interest as well. It is unsurprising that the people contributing to the article are fans and participators. I have no doubt that the people contributing to the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> article, for example, are also fans and participators in Harry Potter activities. On top of that, the article's existence is a positive influence on the Wikipedia community -- drawing new members who would otherwise be unaware of the encyclopedia. Personally, I feel the mere fact that the article is up for VfD sends the wrong message to all these new eyeballs: It suggests that this is an insular and snobbish place, rather than the open and communal environment I believe it to be.--07:52, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)~ <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Bacon_73e6.html" title="User:Justin Bacon"><b>Justin Bacon</b></a></li>

<li><b>Heavy Revision Required</b> as I mentioned before there are some inaccuracies in the present article. The original author has left out some critical information regarding the origin and development of Dake-bonoism. There are a number of theories with regard to how the idea came about but it is not an "internet spoof religion" per-se. At least not in it's original form. It did in fact originate in the 1980's before the internet became the one ubiquitous presence it is today. I did not author the original document, though did offer some revision on the commentary page. Dake-Bonoism has developed into a "pseudo-religion" of sorts, especially as the term has spread over the internet. Nonetheless the concept of Dake-bonoism is grounded in real historic events.--Bezbaq 18:31, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I do not think this article is in need of the heavy revision some apparently desire. This article isn’t so much inaccurate as it is incomplete. Keep the article, but <b>revise</b> and <b>expand</b> as necessary. As I have already noted in the Dake-Bonoism discussion page, the article places an overemphasis on organized Dake-Bonoist groups (some of which are now defunct). The historic-critical approach of the current article doesn’t really do the subject justice. Taking into consideration the way Dake-Bonoism has evolved in common usage over the past few decades, I think a more phenomenological treatment would be appropriate. The current information could be included for historical reference while elaboration is provided with regard to Dake-Bonoism in contemporary usage and understanding.--Stevejohnsenson 18:47, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b>. Rather than proselytizing, I would view it as a description of Catholic views. Of course, some of the language needs to be changed to be more NPOV, but that is more a matter of choosing different wording.

<li>I apologize, I didn't mean it as an attack on you; I just disagree with listing the views of a belief as proselytizing.

<li><b>Abstain</b> because I have been involved with the group, but to respond to android: the U of M has many student groups (over a thousand are listed but almost all of those are defunct, so a reliable estimate is difficult), but this is one of the oldest and best established, as well as one of the most vocal in local media. It is also one of the very few (~20) that receive direct annual funding from the University. Also, nationwide, it is one of the largest and most notable student freethought groups - in fact, it could even be counted among the most notable American local freethought groups altogether. CASH deserves an article not by a raw calculus of its size, but by a more nuanced examination of it relative position within its unique and certainly articleworthy movement (perhaps the solution to "too many redlinks" would be to create new articles, not delete them).

<p>Issues with this page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Highly POV term used as a synonym for <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a> in a manner that does not allow WP users to understand the context of the puroported synonymy;</li>
<li>Very little used term, which I believe is used principally by German right-extremists as an analog of the somewhat more common German term to suggest a moral equivalence between the deaths in this ethnic cleansing and Jewish deaths in the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoah.html" title="Shoah">Shoah</a>;</li>
</ol>
<p>I propose that this page be deleted, and it and its correctly capitalised version be blocked. Furthermore, the highly POV summary of <i>Prussian holocaust</i> at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Holocaust (disambiguation)">Holocaust (disambiguation)</a> will need to be rewritten to accomodate its removal.</p>
<p>Point of order: this page was originally a redirect to <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a>, which I edited to make clear was POV. Possibly this page should have been submitted to the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a> page with its slightly lengthier process, however I think that the issues raised are more appropriate to a VfD process, and the page used to be an article with an active talk page.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The Oxford English Dictionary defines <i>Holocaust</i> as: • noun - destruction or slaughter on a mass scale. Is anyone arguing that what occured in Prussia was not destruction or slaughter on a mass scale? <i>The Holocaust</i> is defined as: the mass murder of Jews under the German Nazi regime in World War II. If it was "The Holocaust" I would vote delete. But it isn't. People who are interested in this topic will likely refer to it as Prussian Holocaust. No vote as yet.--<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChammy_Koala_0670.html" title="User:Chammy Koala">Chammy Koala</a> 23:36, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you google for the exact term "P.H.", you will find that Wikipedia is on several of the first ten results; we already influence the rankings with the term.</dd>
<dd>First result offers a page where Users like Schlesier might get some of their informations from: <a href="http://www.nccg.org/ezion_geber/preussen2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nccg.org/ezion_geber/preussen2.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> It does not appear to be a Nazi site, but an obscure royal-christian-backward-nationalist- antisemitic mixture I cannot identify easily. The writer offers literature (scroll down page 7) which should be investigated for its origins and backgrounds some time.</dd>
<dd>The "Young Prussian Landsmannschaft" (which I believe is one of Schlesiers favorites) was organizing the last big gathering of right extremists from all over Germany on February 13, 2005 in Dresden, marching and shouting with their parole "bombing Holocaust". Intention of use of "Prussian Holocaust" is the same, I think. (Greetings for Charles!) <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 23:02, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, if you google the same term in German ("Preußischer Holocaust"), you find NO result at all for the exact combination. So much for the encyclopedic relevance. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 23:02, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Excuse my arguing, but I suggest you look at the links of "<a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a>": one of them is "<a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Terrible_Revenge_a434.html" title="A Terrible Revenge">A Terrible Revenge</a>" which I suggested for VfD also. The author of that book is known as Revisionist in Germany. Listing his book as a main scientific source for the article is highly POV I think.</dd>
<dd>Then, if you look at the Link <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemmersdorf.html" title="Nemmersdorf">Nemmersdorf</a> on "A terrible revenge", you find an external weblink <a href="http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv/47aa15.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv/47aa15.htm" rel="nofollow">Nemmersdorf: New aspects of a crime <i>One of the dark chapters</i> by Thorsten Hinz (in German)</a> leads you directly to the "Junge Freiheit", which is known as right extremist German publication, being watched by state officials.

<p>It looks like this VfD is more controversial than I anticipated. I'd like to suggest what I view to be credible alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>What I initially proposed in this VfD;</li>
<li>A redirect to some page such as Politically tendentious terms for historical events, rather as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> is (currently) a redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">List of political epithets</a>;</li>
<li>An article discussing the current political controversy around this name. I doubt there is enough non-WP material at present to support a genuinely encyclopediac article along these lines, but in future there might be.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I regard as unacceptable are either:</p>
<ol>
<li>The situation before I filed this VfD, namely a redirect to <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a>; or</li>
<li>The current situation, namely a link to that page with a little bit of boilerplate indicating the controversy;</li>
</ol>
<p>Opinions welcome. Please don't vote keep until you have thought about these alternatives. A point of order: it is ambiguous which of the two unacceptable alternatives I summarised a keep vote actually prefers: if you do vote keep, please indicate which is preferable. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:57, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that the term is sometimes used is not an endorsement to an encyclopedia entry. nearly any two words may be put together side by side to mean something.

<li><b>Keep</b> - These two words put together could mean nothing else. if you find the term itself objectionable, that is your own POV.

<dd>You can't show that they are syndicates, particularly since the article in WP is called Evacuation of East Prussia, and the wording used in the article is not the same as the wording used in the sites I found by googling. The point is, that people do use the term, you have no real evidence to suggest the term isn't suitable, other than the fact that you feel it's a nazi term and you hate nazis. I'm Australian and I've never heard the term Aboriginal Holocaust (and we all study the history in school), but I wouldn't vote to delete that redirect which is used on WP. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0786416157/ref=wl_it_dp/102-5519304-8348911?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;coliid=I1FKX8HXEX6CLK&amp;v=glance&amp;colid=OW3SNIX6O7JB" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0786416157/ref=wl_it_dp/102-5519304-8348911?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;coliid=I1FKX8HXEX6CLK&amp;v=glance&amp;colid=OW3SNIX6O7JB" rel="nofollow">Book on Prussia</a> --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChammy_Koala_0670.html" title="User:Chammy Koala">Chammy Koala</a> 11:52, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the German expression for "Prussian Holocaust"? As fas as I see, the English expression is of hardly notable usage. Most google links seem from wikipedia&amp;mirrors amd a couple of hate speeches.

<dd>The exact term in German would be "Preußischer Holocaust"; as I pointed out earlier, there you find literally NO links at all. No serious historian uses that term, no published books either, only some right extremists. The links you find in English are indeed <i>only</i> Wikipedia copies, <i>all</i> of them: scroll down any of the sites Chammy provided and you find Wikipedia as the source; doesn´t matter if they have earlier versions, they remain to be copies. So there are no substantial reasons to keep it. Wrong comparisons don´t change that, because other terms are in use somewhere: This one isn´t. Political views shouldn´t influence VFD decisions: exactly! The term is only a redirect here because the editor had a political view on it. So vote for Keep is no political view? This is definitely against Wikipedia rules not to build up new theories. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 21:57, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - because the number of U.S., British and other Coalition soldiers dying in the recent war was so low, and because media scrutiny actually makes it possible to know quite a lot about them, it <i>would</i> actually be plausible to have articles on all those who have died. The question is - why should we? A list of them with brief biographical details would probably (hopefully!) survive VfD and would be my preferred response. In the absence of a list, why keep an individual article? Has an individual American soldier done something noteable in the recent war just by dying in it? The answer is, arguably, yes - WW2 and Iraqi deaths in the war are bad analogies because that would involve making far more articles on individuals for whom there is often little information. Local press coverage of deaths in the recent war is pretty extensive, and the impact on a local community of a "local hero" dying in the war shouldn't be overlooked. From the point of view of the entire USA, most individuals will be non-notable but from the point of view of a (substantial) local community an individual may well be. The fact that Menusa was the first person from the Philippines to die in the conflict does swing me towards a keep vote, for now, but if somebody put a list together, I'd rather set this as a redirect to that. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaEmilyDavies_9249.html" title="User:VivaEmilyDavies">VivaEmilyDavies</a> 21:04, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>While it may be unorthodox to list a user sub-page for deletion, I believe that this page and the so-called "organization" or "agency" it promotes violate the spirit of Wikipedia. The introduction reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the Sam Spade detective agency Our goal is to provide top-notch investigative service to our clients, promote justice and discourage corruption, and to combine our efforts as effectively as possible. We collect data regarding dubious persons and circumstances, and put them to good use at the appropriate time and place. Those wishing to be public members may contact me on the talk page. Those wishing to remain confidential may contact me by email or IM.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Any unofficial, unsanctioned, ad hoc organization that seeks as it's stated goal to collect "evidence" of other editors that they consider "dubious" for later use in actions like RFC/RFAR smacks of witch hunts, is antithetical to wikipedia's spirit, will have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas that Sam &amp; crew deem "dubious," and will lend itself to abuses in the form of <a href="../../../v/e/x/Vexatious_litigation.html" title="Vexatious litigation">vexatious litigation</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malicious_prosecution.html" title="Malicious prosecution">malicious prosecution</a>, etc. Consider the group's statement of purpose: <i>"We collect data regarding dubious persons and circumstances, and put them to good use at the appropriate time and place."</i> This there anything that more utterly violates the spirit of wikipedia? Taken with <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html#On_FM_Copyvio" title="User talk:Morven">Sam's recent history of frivolous actions</a> these new efforts to amass evidence prior to any specific charges and recruiting others to do the same on his behalf show Sam to be little more than a vexatious and mendacious litigant looking to expand his reach and scope. Furthermore, the fact that this is a privately organized effort directed at selected individuals will heavily discount the value of any "evidence" this group obtains and presents, and will cast serious doubt on the motive of any subsequent action that Sam or any of the crew that he assembles are party to. <a href="../../../v/e/x/Vexatious_litigation.html" title="Vexatious litigation">Vexatious</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malicious_prosecution.html" title="Malicious prosecution">malicious prosecution</a> are serious concerns at wikipedia and far too common, and this sort of experiment lends itself to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barratry.html" title="Barratry">barratry</a> quite easily.

<dd>In addition, if consensus should be we <i>do</i> decide this sort of thing on VfD, I'd like that to be said more explicitly.

Alternatively, don't try editing Wikipedia when you're busy with other stuff.

<li><b>Keep</b>. (1) User pages are generally free to have whatever content you want. I know plenty of people who have frivolous content and even anti-wikipedia sentiment on their User pages. (2) How is this "agency" any different from letting people contact you on your talk page about issues they want your help with. People do that to me all the time. All Sam is doing is creating a separate page for it and adding a little more organization. Perfectly fine. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 17:55, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>. Deleting this page will not delete the agency. Sam has been open about his project, and it is being monitored. if this page goes there is no way to monitor what the agency will do, which I think would be a bad thing. If people want to stop his agency here is not the place to do it, and as long as his agency is legitimate then this page should be too. I urge those who want to stop his agency to go through the proper procedure and debate it in the proper forums, then put a Vfd here, --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:08, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

It is a user sub page and compared to many user subpages that are maintained this one does not merit deletion. Regarding starting any kind of "organization" as far as laws and concepts regarding "freedom of association" are concerned I do not think that "we" could stop such a move by Sam and his friends if we tried.

<li><b>Move</b> to Wikipedia namespace and make it a public organization. Run it in the same way as other voluntary and unofficial organizations, as was (eventually) done with a group that had rather similar aims and methods. That should keep potential abuse well in check—but would make it redundant with at least two other groups.<br />
Or: Leave it alone, watch it carefully, and publicize its actions well. Let it stand or fall on its own merits. Perhaps it will acquire a reputation as a stalwart defender of the bullied and downtrodden. Perhaps it will acquire a reputation for bullying and treading down. Perhaps no-one will use it and it will fade into obscurity.

<p><b>Comment.</b> I'm not sure on the page, but the actions describe within should be examined and rebuked if they make Wikipedia a less open and community-based system. Tabs should be kept to make sure this group doesn't get out of line or becomes some sort of police force for Wikipedia, but I don't think the userpage is all that significant until that occurs. If this little detective agency moves forward and violates the community, then my vote becomes a vote to delete.</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking edit histories, I must conclude that Exploding hasn't contacted Sam about this page, before listing it on VfD. It therefore seems proper to close this VfD, give Exploding the time to contact Sam, and then have Exploding start a new VfD if he deems it necessary. This does sound needlessly bureaucratic, and seems unlikely to actually help. Indeed, this VfD seems likely to end in 'no consensus' either way.</li>
<li>Therefore, the best solution seems to be to take the matter to RfC - that applies to both (and separately) the alleged conflicts between Sam and Exploding, and any disputes regarding existence of a detective agency on WP.</li>

<p>Fine. Let's cut out the needless bureaucracy: Sam, what's the deal with this page? It seems highly inappropriate and I'm concerned also that you're advertising it on other pages as well as embedding it in your user name whenever you sign a post. I have no desire to antagonise you; I would have listed a similar page started by <i>any</i> user, because this type of "organisation" is, in my view, completely anathema to the spirit of Wikipedia and has vast potential for causing problems. Please see<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a>'s comments for a much better analysis than I've provided here of why such a page and such an organization is totally inappropriate here. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 18:27, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have never suggested we vote to delete any user.

<p>Very good articles. Although, I think they should merged to the poor <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_grammar.html" title="Portuguese grammar">Portuguese grammar</a> article. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanmartin_df27.html" title="User:Sanmartin">José San Martin</a> 00:33, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: I think it would be better to merge just a summary, not the entire articles. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:53, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> both articles. (They don't even have VfD tags on them.) While <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_grammar.html" title="Portuguese grammar">Portuguese grammar</a> is not yet overlarge, it could quickly become so, so there should be no merger. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub>comhrá</sub></a> 05:02, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>They do now.

<li>You can carry out the merge yourself, or use <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">Wikipedia:Duplicate articles</a> if you don't know how.
