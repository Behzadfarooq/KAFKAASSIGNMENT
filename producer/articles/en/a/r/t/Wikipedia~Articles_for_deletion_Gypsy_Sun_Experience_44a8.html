<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. This certainly satisfies the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines by virtue of its illustrious members. Several gigs are referenced, and even if there were legitimate doubt that those gigs ever materialized this is sufficient to document the fact that gigs were arranged and advertised.

From the Google results, if we remove two bios that have been replicated across the web, the overall hits plunges dramatically: Exclude this result: "including a Hendrix-tribute outfit called The Gypsy Sun Experience," <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22cox+continues+to+play+to+This+day%2C+including+a+Hendrix-tribute+outfit+called+The+Gypsy+Sun+Experience%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22cox+continues+to+play+to+This+day%2C+including+a+Hendrix-tribute+outfit+called+The+Gypsy+Sun+Experience%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22cox+continues+to+play+to+This+day%2C+including+a+Hendrix-tribute+outfit+called+The+Gypsy+Sun+Experience%22&amp;btnG=Search</a> And this phrase: "Mitch is now involved with the Gypsy Sun Experience" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Mitch+is+now+involved+with+the+Gypsy+Sun+Experience%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Mitch+is+now+involved+with+the+Gypsy+Sun+Experience%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Mitch+is+now+involved+with+the+Gypsy+Sun+Experience%22&amp;btnG=Search</a></p>
<p>And the hits fall by 60%. Of those that remain (including the samples from the above), we have:</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.wtv-zone.com/ruexperienced/visitors/billycox.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wtv-zone.com/ruexperienced/visitors/billycox.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Billy Cox has recently reunited with Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell, and guitarist Gary Serkin and done a series of shows under the name Gypsy Sun Experience. No evidence of their having actually played anywhere or existing.</p>
<p>this page is replicated through the results. (e.g. <a href="http://www.jcrmusicnews.com/affprod.php?lang=uk&amp;ind=874" class="external free" title="http://www.jcrmusicnews.com/affprod.php?lang=uk&amp;ind=874" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrmusicnews.com/affprod.php?lang=uk&amp;ind=874</a>)</p>

Cox continues to play to this day, including a Hendrix-tribute outfit called the Gypsy Sun Experience, which also includes former bandmate Mitchell on drums and Gary Serkin on guitar (Cox was also the recipient of his own model bass, when the Cort guitar company issued a Billy Cox "Freedom" model bass in the late '90s). But no evidence that they really exist.</p>
<p>3) <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=3401035" class="external autonumber" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=3401035" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> A myspace page of someone (Gary Serkin?) who is 72.

<p>6) Some 404s (including all the VH1 pages that at first glance appear to provide substance to existence) <a href="http://www.roadie.net/resume62.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roadie.net/resume62.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://shop.vh1.com/namepage.aspx?pid=P67012&amp;type=P&amp;loc=33703" class="external autonumber" title="http://shop.vh1.com/namepage.aspx?pid=P67012&amp;type=P&amp;loc=33703" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>7) Finally, we have a mention in a student paper, <a href="http://www.uwf.edu/StudentAffairs/division/publications/studentnews/index.cfm?emailID=11089" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uwf.edu/StudentAffairs/division/publications/studentnews/index.cfm?emailID=11089" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> but no evidence that they actually played a gig - no reviews, or fan comments, or anything. ('On Saturday night there will be a “Woodstock Party” at Seville Quarter with a concert by “Experience” Billy Cox and his Gypsy Sun Experience.<i>)</i></p>
<p>8) And again, another phantom gig is referenced, but no furter evidence of having existed <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:HhUOG-sK0wwJ:classicrock.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa081699.htm+%22Gypsy+Sun+Experience%22+-wikipedia+-answers+-%22Mitch+is+now+involved+with+the%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=11" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:HhUOG-sK0wwJ:classicrock.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa081699.htm+%22Gypsy+Sun+Experience%22+-wikipedia+-answers+-%22Mitch+is+now+involved+with+the%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=11" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>9) This mentions a gig (the same one referenced above) but the audio and review is missing and the guy actually never saw them. <a href="http://www.chopperware.com/azar/mitch/bio/nineties.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chopperware.com/azar/mitch/bio/nineties.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>There are another handful of results, but I refuse to believe that this could be the total web presence of a band, had it really existed, that features such members. It looks almost like a hoax. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 22:00, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What, you don't know to click the "cached" link when Google indexes a later-deleted page? And, as I said quite plainly before, check the member pages at allmusic. You could, of course, also go to the relevant Usenet groups and finds concert reviews by concertgoers, but perhaps you'll claim those are hoaxes, too, since Billboard doesn't meets your definition of a reliable source on music, either. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.jimi.hendrix/browse_thread/thread/2a1b8034424448d/8684b2462aa4370f?lnk=st&amp;q=%22gypsy+sun+experience%22&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#8684b2462aa4370f" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.jimi.hendrix/browse_thread/thread/2a1b8034424448d/8684b2462aa4370f?lnk=st&amp;q=%22gypsy+sun+experience%22&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#8684b2462aa4370f" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 22:25, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability established by Monicasdude, verifiability established by Eusebus. The Allmusic biography (which is copied at VH1 and Billboard) and usenet concert info would not be enough to establish notability of an unknown artist but is enough to verify that these notable artists have performed together in this group. Merge would be a poor choice since the info would have to be copied into <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitch_Mitchell_fa2d.html" title="Mitch Mitchell">Mitch Mitchell</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Cox_a594.html" title="Billy Cox">Billy Cox</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_Experience_25c1.html" title="Jimi Hendrix Experience">Jimi Hendrix Experience</a> and <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy_Sun_and_Rainbows_c93c.html" title="Gypsy Sun and Rainbows">Gypsy Sun and Rainbows</a>, so keep as a separate article. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:53, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Thatcher's fine analysis. I should say that I do not ascribe bad faith to the nomination and do not think such ascription to be fair; if anything, one's willingness to engage in a debate as to the propriety of our using certain sources, even where one appears exorbitantly recalcitrant, would seem to suggest that he/she has a deeply- and sincerely-held belief apropos of the notability (or verifiability) of a subject. Though one could, I'm sure, couch a bad faith nom in verifiability terms, I think the willingess of Eusebeus to engage in a genuine debate (making conclusions that, though perhaps not the same as mine, are surely not wholly unreasonable) disposes the question (especially in view of our presumptions in favor of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
