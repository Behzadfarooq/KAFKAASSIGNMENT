<li><b>Comment</b>. In case anybody missed it, I've transwiki'd the page to Wikiquote. This essentially "keeps" the material, but in the more appropriate place, namely, at the project specifically set aside for collections of quotations. It would seem repetitious to keep the page in Wikipedia. Do we really need it in both places? For pages that reference this quotation collection, instead of a link to a WP article like this: <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28excerpts%29_f947.html" title="On the Jews and Their Lies (excerpts)">On the Jews and Their Lies (excerpts)</a>, one would put in the WQ template like this:</li>
