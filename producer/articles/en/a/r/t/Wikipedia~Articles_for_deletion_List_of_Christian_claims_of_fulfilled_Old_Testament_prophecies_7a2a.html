It claims to be evidence "supporting the claim that Jesus has been promised by God to be born as a human."</p>
<p>The "Messianic prophecies of Jesus" is the exact same listcruft claiming "Many Christians believe that the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament) contains certain Messianic prophecies of Jesus, or references that predict the coming of Jesus." No sources, no explanations, no context. It just has a list of vague subjective meanings of parts of the bible. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 22:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep of the latter</b> These are all well-known examples of biblical verses which support the idea of the coming of Christ. All of these have been frequently interpreted and cited as examples of this. So, rather than deleting it and doubting the obvious fact that "Many Christians believe that the Old Testament contains certain Messianic Prophecies of Jesus", let's <i>find sources</i> and improve it. Excepting a bit of POV language, there is nothing incorrect or OR in this article. None of the reasons given by the nominator are accepted reasons for deletion. Find sources. Explain. Provide context. At the very least add a template. But for the love of Wikipedia, don't delete it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 23:25, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> This article has been in this poor state since 2002. In four years no one managed to find a source and contextualize the "list"? I'm not sold on "well-known" or even the validity of these examples. ---<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll work on it. Also, the point isn't that they're <i>valid</i>, but that they are commonly believed by Christians. Also, I created it in July of this year, so you must be referring to the other list. All of these have the potential to become like <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaiah_53.html" title="Isaiah 53">Isaiah 53</a>, another article I created. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 23:42, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The list was created in 2002 and the prophecies article, which is the same information, was created in July 2006. What I mean by valid is that they aren't contextualized and thus, a particular claim without a source could be incorrect. Reading some, I think that is the case. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:45, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The prophecies article is <i>not</i> the same information, because it contains detailed explanations each, whereas the other article merely lists them. What happened was this: I created section headings for each of the examples, hoping to fill them in later, but an anon IP actually did to my delight. I haven't had time to fully review this information being as busy as I am, but I plan to. I am also confused by your claim that they are "without a context". It is just a list of claims that Christians often cite as referring to Christ. It's one of those situations in which the "no context" problem can be solved by fixing up the opening paragraph. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 23:49, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When you quote something you take it out of a larger work. That larger work is context referring to acts, premises, and events that give the quote meaning. Both articles are simply quotes without that larger meaning of what the quotes were centered on. Even if the article is deleted you can create a sandbox to improve it for reposting. And the articles are nearly identical, they both have examples about propechies of Jesus and use, say, Isiah 53, Psalms 22 and many others. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:55, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and merge per Tarret's suggestion and Adam's comments. This topic is a well established concept in Christian theology and evangelical interpretation of the OT testament. I have added references to each of the scriptures quote in the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_prophecies_of_Jesus_bfbd.html" title="Messianic prophecies of Jesus">Messianic prophecies of Jesus</a> article to answer the nominator's concern. The links all go to either scholarly journals or published books where the authors deal with the messanic nature of the scripture. I have also added further reading sources as well as external links to skeptical and jewish analysis.

<li><b>Delete the first; Comment on the second</b> For List of Christian claims of fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, there is no uniform <i>Christian</i> position on what claim have been or are yet to be fulfilled, none of the references listed for this article claim that there is and it would be OR and POV to select one author's view of what's in and what's out. Moreover, all the claims of fulfillment presented in the article are quotes to the New Testament which (a) not all Christians agree is literally true; (b) is internally inconsistent (see <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_consistency_and_the_Bible_6601.html" title="Internal consistency and the Bible">Internal consistency and the Bible</a>). There are no claims of fulfillment advocated by numerous Christian groups from evident outside of the Bible -- especially eschatological harbingers. For <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_prophecies_of_Jesus_bfbd.html" title="Messianic prophecies of Jesus">Messianic prophecies of Jesus</a>, the whole premise of the article is that "many Christians believe" but there is absolutely no reference to which denominations on each point and how "many" is "many" (see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words</a>); unless this can be somehow corrected verifiably the whole article is no more than a collective set of authors' opinions that someone could claim yadda yadda yadda. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:39, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> 1st, <b>Delete</b> 2nd. The list is pointless. The latter article, while better, makes a grave mistake in using the generic "Christian" appelation, as there are so many diverse brands of Christianity that have existed.

Just as the "Jewish scholars" statements are used in the context of their sources. The authors of the "Christian sources" all identify themselves as Christian and present their interpretation of the messianic prophecy as Christian. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 06:20, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete Both</b> even the second article is a collection of Bible excerpts.

<dd>Should we not have these articles because the common wikipedian isn't interested in them? And by the way, if you want the second article to be more than just "a collection of Bible excerpts", add to it. I would also add that it is <i>not</i> simply a collection of Bible verses. Read through it and improve what you think needs fixing. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 21:34, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> the first, <b>Weak Keep</b> the second. The first is an incurable case of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Who's to say what prophecies "Christians" consider fulfilled? I find it inconceivable that there is any sort of concensus among Biblical scholars on this subject, and all we can offer with a list is the opinion of one or more editors, particularly without citations - and even with citations, well, I'm sure you could find a citation claiming <i>some</i> verse fulfills just about every prophecy. The second article is better, as it's about a major theme in the Bible which is worthy of treatment, and is a fairly well-written article as well. I also agree that these should have been listed seperately. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 23:12, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> first and <b>Keep</b> second per Adam Biswanger, Elmer Clark et al. Pace Danntm, the second is not just a subject for theologians, it is also appears in historical works on the early Christian Church, and even if it were "just theological", that would be no reason to delete the article. I share Haeleth's concerns that the joint nomination is likely to result in ill-informed "delete both" votes (and I mean votes). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 10:40, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> While these are not cited, that's largely because they are well-known in Christian circles. It will be very easy to find references to back these up.

<li><b>Delete</b> since Wikipedia is not a concordance. The problem is that these assume the historical truth of both old and new testaments; they might have a place in a Christian encyclopaedia (if they were properly sourced), but not, I think, here. To be fair the second article is less bad than the list and could perhaps be saved, but I don't see that our coverage of Christian theology is lacking sufficiently to justify yet more subjects. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 18:40, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is a lack of coverage on Messianic prophecies in Christian Theology (which, if done right and in accordance to NPOV, NOR, etc would be larger then what the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Prophecy_4d7d.html" title="Biblical Prophecy">Biblical Prophecy</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a> and general <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Theology_76ac.html" title="Christian Theology">Christian Theology</a> articles would be able to accomdate). Messianic prophecies are a major component of Christian Theological thought and they direct relate to how Christianity relates to Judaism, Islam and even skeptical thought. There is quite a bit more that can be done with the second article but I would say the bulk of work already in there is worth saving so that this article can grow organically. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 10:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
