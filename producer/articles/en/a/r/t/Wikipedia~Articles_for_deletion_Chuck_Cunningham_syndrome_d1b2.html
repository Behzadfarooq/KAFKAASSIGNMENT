<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result was <b>delete</b> as original research. This is a tough one, and I'm frankly not completely comfortable closing it at all. But if I shy away from the tough decisions, then I'm not very useful as an admin. If you treat this AfD as a vote, it is clearly no consensus or keep: discounting participants with less than 100 edits, I see nearly twice the number of editors advocating keep vs. delete. I'm making that clear up front so that when this is inevitably brought to deletion review, no one will accuse me of trying to play games with numbers. The problem is that those advocating keep — with the exception of a single commenter, who cited a comment on jumptheshark.com — are not at all responsive to the central claim. Summarizing broadly (and I apologize in advance to anyone who feels I am unfairly paraphrasing their words), three voters say that the articles should stay because they are interesting. Seven say that they have a personal belief that the article is accurate and the term is "well known" or in wide use, but do not provide any verifiable source. One keep comment is a complete nonsequiteur.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">deletion guidelines for administrators</a> say:</p>
<pre>
Note also that the three key policies, which warrant that articles and information be verifiable, 
avoid being original research, and be written from a neutral point of view are held to be non-negotiable 
and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines or by editors' consensus. A closing admin must
determine whether any article violates such policies, and where it is impossible that an article on any topic
can exist without breaching these three policies, such policies must again be respected above other opinions.
</pre>
<p>Given that, I am deleting this article because the arguments that it is original research are persuasive. As written, the article is original research along two axes: first, it is original research in the sense that no source is cited that demonstrates that the term was established in common usage outside of Wikipedia. It is also original research in terms of the long list of examples (by which I mean, if Roger Ebert says "Madeleine Kahn disappearing in the <i>Cosby</i> show is an example of "Chuck Cunningham Syndrome", that is not original research, but when a Wikipedia editor makes the same inference, it is.) <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 00:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Television is a solid fixture in the world today. The information pertaining literally to the original Chuck Cunningham situation is all true. It has only been given a name here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.131.70.153 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.131.70.153_844c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.131.70.153">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>No, you haven't. You've posted a link to someone asking whether a character was "a victim of Chuck Cunningham syndrome". The question doesn't explain what "Chuck Cunningham syndrome" actually is in that context. There's no way to know that it is the syndrome described in this article, and it <i>certainly</i> doesn't constitute a source to support the content of this article. Five days ago, I asked for a source that (a) describes what Chuck Cunningham syndrome is in detail and (b) isn't derived from this Wikipedia article. No-one has yet cited any such source. If you have such a source, please cite it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, but after giving it some thought, I've decided that a new title that refers to "continuity issues" is just as much a cruftmagnet and a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> violation, because what constitutes a continuity error is often in the eye of the beholder and a matter of personal opinion. If a new article was to be created that revolved around a similar concept to this one, it would have to find a way to be very specific about what it is supposed to be a list of, and would have to be cited and sourced. Either way, renaming this article solves nothing because the text would still be inherently POV and OR. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nice of you to have responded here and not on your own talk page, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipediatrix_ce2c.html#We_can_..._end_this_destructive_conflict" title="User talk:Wikipediatrix">where I first proposed this to you, oh, <i>a week ago</i></a>. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 21:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you go back deep in Wikipediatrix's contribs, you'll find she was actually a major contributor to the article at one point (early June of this year, about), as well as to all these other articles she's waging a <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">jihad</a> against lately. It seems that with her usual complete lack of tact, she went and deleted whole hog sections without first trying to discuss it on the talk page. This upset people, and they reverted, and she reverted back until she just got tired of it, it seems.
<p>So, obviously, since the other editors couldn't see what a genius she was, the article needs to be deleted. Clearly within the deletion criteria. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 21:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That appears to be entirely false. I've been through the history of this article, and I find exactly one contribution from <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">User:Wikipediatrix</a> in June 2006 — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;diff=61314458&amp;oldid=61313338" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;diff=61314458&amp;oldid=61313338" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, making the very assertion that this article is original research that xe is making in this deletion nomination, followed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61419033" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61419033" rel="nofollow">this attempt to discuss the matter on the talk page</a>. Those belie any assertion that xe didn't try to discuss this first. Xyr removal of unsourced material and repeated requests for sources followed that, the next month. Removing unsourced material and <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-July/050766.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-July/050766.html" rel="nofollow">insisting upon sources</a> is entirely in accordance with what we should be doing here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:18, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;offset=20060718085852&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;offset=20060718085852&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this section of the history</a>; I meant July 2006 (sorry). There's quite a bit of editing there.</li>
<li>Yes, I do insist on sources and have planted {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a>}} on quite a few pages that I otherwise have nothing to do with myself (see <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Diamond_99db.html" title="Neil Diamond">Neil Diamond</a>). I also believe that with doing so comes a need for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a> (which you have demonstrated quite amply here and elsewhere, I should add). That means you bring up things like this on talk pages (as I did <a href="../../../n/e/i/Talk%7ENeil_Diamond_896a.html#POV-statement" title="Talk:Neil Diamond">with the Neil Diamond article</a>). It's part of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>.</li>
<li>Wikipediatrix's discussions on the CCS talk page go from what's qualified for inclusion to whether the name is justified (both legitimate questions IMO) and generally seem to favor keeping the article. BlueMoose then more or less dares her to nominate the article for deletion and, without even responding on the talk page, she calls his bluff (at least with the subpages like Lazarus Cunningham, Reverse Cunningham and then here. I think it merited more discussion on the talk page as to why deletion, a rather drastic step IMO, was necessary for an article that had been on Wikipedia for longer than Wikipediatrix herself, and the development of some <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> as to that step.</li>
<li>As it is, taking it here strikes me more as akin to responding to a losing chess position by knocking all the pieces off the board. Not behavior we should encourage. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 03:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So it needs to be cleaned up quite a bit and have all the entries sourced. This is not beyond the grasp of a few people who are actually willing to do it themselves. <b><a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMightyMoose22_ffee.html" title="User:MightyMoose22"><font color="blue">MightyMoose22</font></a> <small><sup>&gt;<a href="../../../m/i/g/User_talk%7EMightyMoose22_eb3f.html" title="User talk:MightyMoose22"><font color="blue">Abort,</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">Retry,</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MightyMoose22_0ee8.html" title="Special:Contributions/MightyMoose22"><font color="blue">Fail?</font></a>_</sup></small></b> 20:57, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>

<dd>OK. After reading through the deletion discussions on the various subpages, and this, I looked at the history. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedfarmer_d952.html" title="User:Redfarmer">redfarmer</a> created the page back on December 23, 2004; obviously we should ask him where he heard this term. I doubt that will elicit a reply as he has not edited since last November.
<p>However, in another sense it doesn't really matter anymore. Standards here were a little more loosely enforced back then (believe me). If he did indeed use Wikipedia to create reality and seed his own term, there is nothing we can do about it over a year and a half later. Whether it came from here or not, it's now out there on Google and is part of the reality Wikipedia must reflect. Renaming this article cannot put that particular genie back in the bottle. We can only all agree to be that much more careful and diligent in the future.</p>
<p>I therefore submit that this whole debate in this subsection is moot.</p>

The Cunningham disappearance itself rates an entire section in <i>What Were They Thinking?: The 100 Dumbest Events In Television History</i> (2004) -- thus notable in the context of <i>Happy Days</i> -- but not the term. It may be TV writer jargon as well as online TV fan jargon, but probably not. I don't think the article as it's constituted is notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article itself, the main definition and the reference to Chuck Cunningham I believe should stay, however the page needs significant modifications. It is a pop-culture neologism that does seem to be used in real life, but that real life usage has a sketchy and nebulous definition, and this article should reflect that. What should definitely be deleted is the long list of other shows, all of which can easily be rolled into the specific articles on those shows. There is no meaningful reason why these various character departures are grouped in this way, and this grouping and the inherent decisions about inclusion <i>is</i> original research. Anyway many entries in the list seem to break some aspect of the criteria of the syndrome as described by the article (eg the character's departure <i>is</i> briefly mentioned later). Of course that criteria is sketchy because the entire concept cannot be pegged to an concise external real-life definition, so this article cannot contain the multi-examples. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 08:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. If these syndrome articles don't get deleted (and they should), I propose we remove the long unnecessary lists of opinionated/subjective examples from each of them, and add some sort of infobox that notes "This is NOT a list" or some such language, hopefully discouraging other editors from turning it back into the cruftmagnet <b>"how many more examples can you think of?"</b> parlor game. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Although it's been asserted by many that I created my own reality on Wikipedia, I did not. In the early television forums on the Internet, frequently questions would be asked like, "What happened to the youngest daughter from <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Matters_da6e.html" title="Family Matters">Family Matters</a>" or some such question. The short answer was: <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome_4787.html" title="Chuck Cunningham syndrome">Chuck Cunningham syndrome</a>. I will be the first to admit that this term hasn't caught on as well as <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">jumping the shark</a>. However, if you look at the early versions of the entry that I edited, they did refer to it as a slang term.

I hope whoever is keeping score notes that most of the "Keep" people are basically saying the article shoud stay just because they like it, not out of any policy-based concerns. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrabapplecove_aff7.html" title="User:Crabapplecove">Crabapplecove</a> 01:56, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Most of us are saying that it should stay because the phenomenon it illustrates is encyclopedic and we are amenable to renaming. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 02:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The charge is that the article is original research. Simply asserting that one thinks that the article "is encyclopaedic" does not refute that charge. <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Citing sources</a> does.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> is acting in good faith; this article, together with most of <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a>'s similiar articles, should have the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (including all lists of examples which cannot be sourced as having a third party refer to as the name of the article (now) or section (after merger)) removed. I'm not convinced that any of this can be sourced, but certainly the lists must be removed. I'm convinced that none of it <b>has yet</b> been sourced in the article. If kept, I'm going to delete the <b>entire</b> list of examples as none of them has a source. (I don't want to do it now, as it might prejudice this AfD.) — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 19:28, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And <i>why</i> aren't you convinced that the lists have been sourced? What exactly do people have against television-related articles on Wikipedia lately? And yes, I did read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> thoroughly, so my argument isn't due to ignorance on my part. I mean, this article was up for months (maybe even years), and now, all of a sudden, it's being proposed for deletion? As I said before, it's not like these important characters <i>didn't</i> vanish from their respective shows. I am also one of the many people that had heard of the phrase "Chuck Cunningham syndrome" long before I even heard of Wikipedia.
<p>If anything, maybe the examples could be made into a list on its own page, but as far as deleting them entirely (as well as deleting the main article), I am still strongly opposed to that. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECOMPFUNK2_6eee.html" title="User:COMPFUNK2">Anthony Rupert</a> 02:05, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That an article has slid under the radar for a long time does not give it a magic pass that enables it to be free of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. If you have heard of the syndrome outside of Wikipedia, you should be able to cite sources. <b>Please cite sources.</b> No sources have yet been cited for this syndrome, despite all the editors who are arguing that this is not original research being asked several times to cite some. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. How is any of this original research when all you have to do is be a fan of a particular TV series, watch it regularly, and have a good memory? <a href="../../../w/l/2/User%7EWl219_bdc1.html" title="User:Wl219">Wl219</a> 21:58, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's original research because there's no evidence that the notion of this syndrome exists independently of Wikipedia, given that the only sources that can be found that discuss it all refer back to this article as <i>their</i> source. There's no evidence that this wasn't simply made up in Wikipedia. The creator has been asked to cite sources, but as yet all that we have are assertions and <i>no sources</i> to give them foundation. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Having the list of shows (where someone - a WP editor - makes a personal decision about what might or might not be a case of CCS) is also original research. I'm happy to have an article if an external source exists and can be referenced. That said, <i>all</i> the content on the article must be sourced, we can't only source the term but then also have the unsourced list of shows. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 20:12, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Possibly rename but definite keep as it has very good relevance and I personally wouldn't judge it to be original research (except maybe the title), on the grounds that it has been demonstrated simply from the list, that it is widespread. - <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedHotHeat_15fe.html" title="User:RedHotHeat"><font color="#F80000"><sup>Рэд</sup></font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedHotHeat_e9f2.html" title="User talk:RedHotHeat"><font color="#FF8A0D"><sub>хот</sub></font></a> 16:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>And this is the crux of the matter: will WP articles get deleted <i>in spite</i> of evidence that such deletion is not deserved?

<li>I <i>still</i> haven't seen any evidence that this deletion is not deserved. Even if someone else <i>did</i> coin this term in 1997 or 1998, that still doesn't make it notable, and I still don't see how there can be an article that definitively states that such-and-such show is or is not part of this silly concept.

And the 1997 one is fairly descriptive - "this character has disappeared and the rest of them are acting like he didn't exist" "that's called Chuck Cunningham Syndrome, after the character in Happy Days".
