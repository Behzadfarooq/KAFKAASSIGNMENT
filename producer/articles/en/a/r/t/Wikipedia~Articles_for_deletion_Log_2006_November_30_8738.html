<p>This very minor list is being misused as an advertising vehicle (causing it to have false information), and there is a growing concern that this list is non-maintainable and of too wide a scope to be useful.

<li>Is it UGLE's formal policy to recognize any lodge recognized by those it recognizes? Can this be documented? (Sorry; with so much "secret", and thus unverifiable, information related to such organizations, and with so much false information put out over the last several centuries by Templar-hunters and propagandists, we need to be especially vigilant about citing reliable sources and checking seemingly reliable ones for bogosity.) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do not believe so; as a matter of fact, there was a lodge added to the list that was recognized by the Grand Lodge in Scotland (which is recognized by UGLE), but was not itself recognized by UGLE. I would like to point out here that there's actually quite a lot of good (and verifiable) information available on Freemasonry - you just need to look at books in commercial bookstores more than at Internet sites and self-published pamphlets. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:32, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is only a very small number of <i>private</i> material in Masonry (about 9 actually), unless you believe the conspiracy theorists. Recognition isn't secret, but it's complex and heavily influenced by political machinations. In principle should one GL recognise and unrecognised GL then either the third GL would be recognised by the first, or recognition of the second should be ceased. That should illustrate the maintenance difficulty.ALR 09:25, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - there seems to be a general consensus on Wikipedia that high schools are always notable, and that middle and elementary schools are not.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually recent trends seem to make that claim difficult to accept. Among other issues, more highschools have been closed as "no consensus, defaulting to keep" than "keep" and recently some have even been deleted. There is therefore no such general precedent. Furthermore, I am unable to find much in the way of mainstream press on the matter. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:15, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I disagree that middle and elementary schools are not always notable. Currently all towns/cities/villages/communities are automatically considered notable - even if they're just a spot in the road. It stands to reason that a city's municipal functions - such as public schools - are included. Until there is an official policy/guideline on schools (currently there is not), there's no basis for deleting this, nor is there any basis for saying "No assertations of notability" when no one knows what constitutes notability for a school here yet. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 02:25, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's why closing admins should look at the comments and not just votes. Voting Keep and just saying that you think all schools are notable isn't enough and should pretty much disqualify your vote since that isn't a reason to keep an article. That wouldn't fly on any other AFD, so why should it be allowed on school related AFD's? <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 06:04, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That argument is made when places are put up for AfD, and no-one seems to think that it's a problem there. Anyway, I see "delete because it's a school" arguments too so I don't see "keep because it's a school" as being less valid. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Many of us aren't happy with the attitude towards places and in any event if someone did argue "delete because it's a school" that would be just as invalid and should be given correspondingly low weight by the closing admins. There seems to be an almost two wrongs making a right attitude towards the above comment. In any event, the closest I've seen anyone come to "delete because it's a school" are people who when pressed actually mean "this is a school, schools have no inherent notability so delete as default setting" or something like that which is more of an issue of poor phrasing and shorthand than anything else. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:30, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> All schools are notable to the immediate community and those attending them--my elementary school was the most lasting positive experience in my life. But this article does not assert notability,nor could it prove it. Many many other high schools, including some of perhaps equal intrinsic merits, are more fully done, and demonstrate the reason they're here. I do not think we have a procedure for <i>article on probation--improve it by this time next moth</i> but that may be what we need. In its absence, the best we can do is delete, with a suggestion that the resubmit. The school district idea is a good one, but I think the se articles are inspired by local patriotism or perhaps school projects. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 06:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, when there is consensus or little likelihood of objection. But merging a school stub into its community's article is almost certain to be controversial to those who consider all schools (or all those of a certain level) to be automatically notable, so the nominator did right to bring it here for discussion. Sadly, little of the discussion is focused on how <i>this specific topic</i> and its current stub meets or fails to meet WP policy (as compared to either side's proposed guideline which lacks consensus). Other than an unencyclopedic "two schools merged", nobody has presented either a single reason that this particular school might be notable, nor a single source showing actual coverage by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm confused by the idea expressed in several of the above comments that there is precedent or consensus that all high schools are notable. This particular article doesn't establish the notability of the school and of the dozens or even hundreds of articles on Wikipedia considered for deletion (AFD, speedy or otherwise) every day because they don't assert the notability of their subjects, I don't see why this one (or any other article about a questionably notable school) should be kept. Anybody could make a similar plea for their pet subject. Two schools were merged - so what?

<li>I have always felt that this is exactly the danger in making the blanket statement that "all schools are notable." We don't allow the statement that all structures are notable, or all people are notable, or all books or all bands. Each one must prove its own notability. Why do we exempt schools from this? Now, granted, there are some categories that are granted instant notability, such as incorporated communities, regardless of size. This, however, is official policy. In the absence of official policy on schools, all we have to go on are the policies that DO exist, and one of those policies is that an article MUST assert its notability. "I think all schools are notable" is no better than "I think all people are notable." --<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 03:54, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to forget that policy is not static but dynamic, consensus driven and constantly subject to reevaluation and change. I find minor Pokemon characters inherently unnotable and would vote to delete them on that basis alone. I find schools inherently unnotable and vote to delete them as such. You can disagree, but as fas as I am concerned, schools default to delete unless they are clearly and substantially noteworthy. It is quite simply a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a> to argue that we somehow need to justify a decision to delete based on some reference to policy, when by the simple dictates of community-driven consensus mean that the accumulated weight of opinion one way or the other is itself sufficient. The problem, of course, is that there is no such policy regarding schools, as evidenced by the failed attempt to beat out a compromise at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>.

<p>Keep- This article is most certainly notable. Florence High School is a wonderful school that provides excellent eduations to over one thousand students in Florence, Alabama. Anyone who has ever walked into the doors of Florence High School knows that it is a fine learning facility. It is apparent that all Florence High School students have a close rapport with one another. The percentage of Florence students who "keep it real" is astonishingly high. Florence High School is seen by its students as "extra crunk" and many graduates have been quoted as saying that they miss the days when they had the opportunity to go to Florence High School "every day of their lives." Florence High School is a top-quality high school that should be broadcasted over the internet so that the world may know of its existance.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Davis_Price_ded6.html" title="User:Andrew Davis Price">Andrew Davis Price</a> 21:20, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't made up my mind on this school but there are some references I was able to find. First, note that since there are many schools witht he same name as this one it isn't easy to go through google searches (it appears that there are Florence High Schools in at least Alabama, Missisipi, Colorado, Montana, Pensylvania, Tennesee and South Dakota). The school has what seems to be exactly one student who has done anything resembling anything of note- one Jennifer Ann Taylor who was an Intel Finalist and seems very accomplished in a variety of fields(although <a href="http://www.sciserv.org/isef/results/grnd2004.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.sciserv.org/isef/results/grnd2004.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a> lists her at a different school everything else puts her here). See <a href="http://www.intel.com/education/sts/visits.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.intel.com/education/sts/visits.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/winners_2005.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/winners_2005.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20060128/fob7.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20060128/fob7.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.wef.org/LearnAboutWater/ForStudents/SJWP/2005StateWinners.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wef.org/LearnAboutWater/ForStudents/SJWP/2005StateWinners.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/yes/fs/winners_0506_regsemifinal.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.collegeboard.com/yes/fs/winners_0506_regsemifinal.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.queuenews.com/NewslettersMay06/Alabama_Education_4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.queuenews.com/NewslettersMay06/Alabama_Education_4.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. The school has a smattering of minor awards and students with minor scholarships such as <a href="http://www.horatioalger.org/geninf/pressrel/pdf/05%20National%20Scholar%20Announcement%20Final.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.horatioalger.org/geninf/pressrel/pdf/05%20National%20Scholar%20Announcement%20Final.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> and two of the school's athletes have been all-american <a href="http://www.hindscc.edu/Athletics/Soccer/WomensSoccer/Honors.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hindscc.edu/Athletics/Soccer/WomensSoccer/Honors.aspx" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>(I think, I may be misreading that). The school also at one point had apparently one very talented teacher <a href="http://www.una.edu/foundation/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.una.edu/foundation/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. However, all media mentions of the school give us little or no information.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Unless all high schools are automatically notable, this one is not notable. I commend the probable efffort of the students to join in editing WP, and, now they have mastered the mechanics, they should be encourage to learn about finding evidence. If Andrew DP is among them, I suggest he look for some famous alumni as a first approach. The thorough investigation by JoshuaZ is a model of diligence, and comes to about as strong a proof of non-notability as one could get. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> (<a href="../../../d/g/g/User_talk%7EDGG_49c8.html" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DGG_009a.html" title="Special:Contributions/DGG">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>I'd also like to say that my own view is that having "famous" alumni is not per se notable, though I recognise that some people disagree with me. Since people have to be educated somewhere, the fact that some schools produce famous people seems to me to be a random event, and thus not notable. If a school consistently produces important physicists, say, or actors, this suggests that there is something non-random and thus notable going on - perhaps the school has a special teaching process for physics, or has special skills in training aspiring actors in voice production. Something like that is notable, but just doing a job isn't. Show us how this school does something that other schools don't, and I'll gladly vote the other way. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:19, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus on some and delete the rest.</b><br />
This discussion amounted to over 150K. Much of it (too much) was spent debating the merits of an AfD nominating so many related yet distinct articles in a single nomination. The prospect of <s>85</s> 59 separate AfDs containing the same arguments from the same set of editors is even more frightening than the debacle that this AfD nearly became. I find no merit in the arguments against the form of this AfD other than the observation that historically these types of nominations become a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Warcraft_character_articles_84a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Warcraft character articles">train wreck</a> with no consensus emerging after day upon day of discussion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some progress has come from this AfD. Reading through this (yes, every word of it) consensus was clear (yes, clear) on several issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>The level of detail, in-universe style and sources of all of the articles fails to meet <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</li>
<li>The information is single sourced with possible copyvio issues from <a href="http://www.mahq.net" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net" rel="nofollow">MaHQ.net</a>.</li>
<li>All of the information has already been transwikied to <a href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a></li>
<li>While the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundam</a> series itself clearly meets the notability requirements of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, the majority of the articles listed in this AfD do not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if this were a vote, then the result would be "no consensus". However, consensus here does not mean consensus that <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, but consensus that the material here meets established guidelines and policies that have been developed through consensus. In this regard there were strong arguments in favor of deleting everything, however, I find that there is <b>no consensus</b> whether the following articles meet the notability requirements of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, and are thus kept by default:</p>

<p>I am not only nominating this article, I am nominating <s>every page</s> all 84 pages in <a href="../../../c/o/s/Template%7ECosmic_Era_mobile_weapons_eb3f.html" title="Template:Cosmic Era mobile weapons">Template:Cosmic Era mobile weapons</a>. They are all listed and lightly mentioned on <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_Mobile_Units_e1af.html" title="Cosmic Era Mobile Units">Cosmic Era Mobile Units</a>, therefore a merge is not required. All of the information has already been transwikied (<a href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>). The information appears to be stolen from <a href="http://www.mahq.net" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net" rel="nofollow">MaHQ.net</a>. Deletion is the only option. Before you defend the existence of these articles, please observe how these articles defy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, an official policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought
<dl>
<dd>There are no sources on most of the articles. Therefore the articles break this rule. Until you can come up with a reliable source not <i>dedicated</i> to Gundam, it will violate this.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information
<dl>
<dd>The policy states "works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis". None of the articles have this.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There we have two policies that the article clearly violates. If that's not enough, here's a violation of the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters." The main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character.
<dl>
<dd>Seeing as most of the articles contain mostly trivial information, they are minor, and therefore violate the guideline.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, on various articles for deletions, these points have been raised to keep:</p>
<ul>
<li>it would be nice to keep these articles
<dl>
<dd>That's not a reason for keeping them.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first.
<dl>
<dd>That's irrelevant. This one has to go, it doesn't matter what order it's done in.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>they're not harming anything or against Wikipedia policies that I'm aware of.
<dl>
<dd>Yes they are, I mentioned the policies they're violating.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>If these articles are deleted you would have to delete about every single anime character plus Star Wars and Star Trek articles
<dl>
<dd>That seems like a very good idea. Just because that hasn't been done yet doesn't mean this can't be done first. Furthermore, a main character in Star Wars is a lot more important than every single quartenary robot.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless.
<dl>
<dd>There are various rules and policies that state the articles are useless.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Most of the information is actually translated directly from various sources, including direct references in the show, books, magazines, and model boxes and instructions.
<dl>
<dd>Those are primary sources. Articles require secondary sources. If there aren't any, the articles should not exist (in most cases)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you. Please, base this on importance, not your liking of the series. Adhere to the rules, not your opinion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 00:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b><span style="color:red">COMMENT:</span></b> Many people in this discussion are stating that they think some of these articles should go but some should not, or complaining that individual AfDs should be created for each separate article. What they are neglecting to state is which articles they think should go and which should stay and stating their reasons. It is perfectly within process to nominate a group of related articles in a single nomination, and the above referenced template lists the included articles. That means that if your position is that not all of the articles should share the same fate, then this is the time and place to make your case for the fate of individual articles. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 12:33, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and refer to a relevant WikiProject for how to best merge, transwiki, or otherwise organize this information. Yes, we have a situation where numerous articles of questionable value exist - but trying to deal with that situation with one gigantic AfD almost guarantees throwing some babies out with the bathwater. Major elements of notable fiction do generally receive articles on Wikipedia, and that is in no way incompatible with Wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 01:21, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>: It has already been merged and transwikied. There are no babies in the bathwater. Using that comment is simply an excuse to keep the articles, and until you actually find a "baby", your claim is incorrect. Look through every article in the template and I guarantee none of them are of importance. These are not major elements of notable fiction, as I have stated, and it does violate policy. Please read my nomination next time. Your keep vote is simply invalid. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 01:32, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not going to take your word for it that a group of 85 articles contain no information that are important to a clearly notable anime. There is probably no group of almost 100 articles I'd vote a blanket "delete" on, <i>especially</i> when a dozen or more of them have already undergone the AfD process - and survived. It seems disrespectful to all those discussions to try to supercede them by having the entire category deleted. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 01:55, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Any robot in Gundam is non-notable. In a very popular series, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_f5dd.html" title="Metal Gear">Metal Gear</a>, the Metal Gears are the star of the show. They are the most important, and each one serves a very important aspect of it. However, they are all in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28weapon%29_c96f.html" title="Metal Gear (weapon)">Metal Gear (weapon)</a>. This is good example to compare to, because Metal Gear articles are actually representative of a good set of editors, not a group of fans. I realize it seems disrespectful to previous discussions, but I have already argued against all of the points mentioned in those discussions. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 02:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is literally no comparison between Metal Gear and Gundam. Gundam is a genre-defining show in literally the same sense that Star Trek defines the "guys in a spaceship fly around solving other people's problems" subgenre of television sci-fi. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 17:00, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>You misunderstood the comparison. I was trying to say that in Metal Gear, the MOST IMPORTANT antagonist-related thing is in a list, while in Gundam, every single robot and his robot-dog has a full article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 05:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li>Prove had been shown. You just ignore them to the convinience of your own argument. If someone have published a book to show others how to 3D model these units, if someone have published magazines on how to model real world models on these units, it is enough of a real world impact. It does not impact you, but the real world of the modeling industry and publishers and 3D modelers. No one went to improve the articles yet because you have listed too many and coined all of them to be the same. No, your ignorance is never an argument of you having good enough IQ to disrespect others. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 06:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b>: I am nominating everything in the template. It has to be realized that we cannot keep these articles just because one <i>might</i> be useful. That's simply a terrible excuse. Actually putting the deletion template on all articles would be a ridiculously lengthy task and a waste of time.

<li><b>comment</b> [edit conflict] Wikipedia has procedures put in place for a reason, you cannot expect them to be ignored on the basis of your own personal laziness.

That doesn't even count the constant replying and defending I have to do with doubtful editors. However, the reason why I am nominating them as one is because they are all cruft - I have looked at all of them, and even if I didn't, fictional objects similar to this don't pass guidelines. The only argument towards keeping it is <i>your</i> laziness - you are the one who guesses there might be important articles in the template instead of looking for yourself. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 02:28, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> <i>Until you can come up with a reliable source not dedicated to Gundam</i>. What do you actually mean? different series should be separated sources, or everything gundam related is a no? Does something like the sales of a gunpla count towards a source not dedicated to gundam, or someone writing a book stating the impact of specific gundam series to <i>name anything here</i> counted as dedicated to gundam? And what about Super Robot series? Just asking, because this is not clear enough. I limit the sentence to <i>Gundam Seed and Seed-Destiny anime and official guide books</i> for the moment.
<p>P.S. The WP:OR quoted here have been taken to a liberty of extending it to an out-of-reach limitation. Different authors writing different articles for the same series should not be counted as original research, like different authors writing different physics book should be counted as separated sources, both primary and secondary. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:23, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The nomination is flawed. The assertion is that these articles are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, and that the only way for readers to check them is to perform the primary research of actually watching the series directly.

(See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>.) The nominator has shown the first, not the second.

<li><b>Comment</b> This AfD is horrible. There is no explanation made anywhere why any particular article of the set isn't worthy of an article. Perhaps they aren't, but in order to perform a blanket nomination, <i>every single article's reason for deletion must be stated</i>! You cannot simply call them all "non-notable" without an explanation.

<li>These articles are all pretty much the same. All the complaints in the nomination/comments apply to all of them, in particular that there's no reputable secondary sources that provide the level of detail that would justify so very many articles instead of one or a few covering the whole topic. Are each of these lines of robots even central to the actual series? There's no hint of this in the articles, I don't even see episode/series/movie titles listed. It's just a dump of technical minutiae written as if they were real. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 13:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then wishfully there will be someone with enough knowledge and time to modify them to better articles, one by one. I never have both and I have no interest in working extensively on CE related stuff and thus I only care about this deletion process and how much it really follows WP. From what I see now, the WP is explaint in a pretty twisted way to justify the deletion of all the articles. I am more for the idea of deleting most of them, but the arguement is not made in a good way.

Additionally, it seems like a good part of this articles coul be made encyclopedic easily by adding a few lines of "the introduction of these suits had this and that impact on the series, as ----- commented in an interview." I never watched Gundam, and I'm no fan of the genre, but I know a <i>major</i> anime series when I see one, and coverage should abund if someone takes the pain to look into it.--<a href="../../../%24/y/d/User%7E%24yD%21_1c61.html" title="User:$yD!">SidiLemine</a> 16:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - There is but one catch to this deletion process: People voting here do not know what they are voting for. There is no direct link to <b>all</b> the pages that are nominated. Yes, there is a function called <i>What links here</i> however, it is almost certained that most people would not know its exsistence and still vote on the subject. And thus making the nomination not reputable just because there is no way to tell if people even know what there are voting about other than <i>a bunch of supposedly OR pages</i>. If users who voted above saw this comment, please edit your vote to reflect you have at least looked through all the pages and <b>know what they are about</b>, to show that the vote is reputable. The list contain <b>2</b> pages.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly - The <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> does not extend to fictional characters that appears in an anime(Seed and probably Seed-Destiny), in manga(Seed Astray, Astray-X, Destiny Astray), in settings(Seed MSV, Seed-D MSV), Official guide books(Seed data file characters 1~4, Mechanical file 1~4), and a Gundam Mobile Suit guide book for most Gundam series instead of Seed and Seed-D dedicated(MS encyclopedia 2003 and 2006). Some even appeared in the Super Robot Series(Super Robot Wars) that is not dedicated to Gundam but almost every single major mecha anime. Yes, it is very likely that these pages will recieve a lot of fancruff and OR in it if left unattented, however, this is not a reason of deleting any article just because they <b>may</b> contain OR.</dd>
<dd>More reasoning could counter arguments made by the nominator:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><i>Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought.</i> - No, this is not publishing an original thought, the page is <b>not</b> created by the author of said <i>characters</i>(mecha), and there are more than one source backing them up (I know not all the pages include their sources, and I have no will in doing). No, they do not have to be <i>not dedicated to Gundam</i>, They just have to be not dedicated to the series, i.e. not a comic retelling of the anime, not a novel written by the same author, etc. If someone published a book talking about these <i>characters</i>, in a different way than the story plot itself, it is justified to be a secondary source. Which actually means that the articles not just justified the WP:NOT test, but can also be written to justify the style of an <i>out-of-universe</i> view.</li>
<li><i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i> - Yes, but per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, <i>Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article.</i> <b>and</b> <i>The difference between 'major' and 'minor' characters is intentionally vague; the main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character. Some books could plausibly have several dozen major characters.</i> Here, in the list of AfD, I see quite a lot of important mecha that major characters used. Therefore, at least some of the articles here should not be deleted under this rule. In fact, a <i>citation needed</i> is what you need in these articles.
<dl>
<dd>And yes, I agreed with the fact that <i>There is no reason for keeping them</i>, most of them, at least. However, some of them should be kept, but the nominator indiscriminately list everything here, and thus it is too generic to vote for a yes.</dd>
<dd>And another yes, it does not matter which one goes first, but it should always be done in the correct way, with correctly informed voters, with correctly listed reasons.</dd>
<dd>Also, per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Minor_characters_9616.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters</a>, <b>Fictional characters which are cultural icons transcending their appearance in a particular work of fiction, or who cannot be neatly tied to a particular work of fiction or fictional universe deserve articles of their own, regardless of other circumstances.</b> This is not an official policy, but a consensus. If they appeared in Super Robot Wars and SD Gundam G Generation, than it cannot be tied to a particular work (It is not Mobile Suit Gundam Seed's Cosmic Era anymore) and thus <i>deserve articles of their own, regardless of other circumstances.</i> The fun thing is, there are a few listed mechas actually showed up in series that are not related to gundam at all, like freedom in <i>Magical Nurse Komugi</i> and <i>Comic Party</i> and various units appeared more than once in the magazines <i>Hobby Japan</i> and <i>Dengeki Hobby</i> as iconic model kits. If the nominator is going to do anything similar (I mean this kind of mass deletion) to the UC timeline of Gundam, be informed here that most units in that timeline is also showed in <i>Keroro Kunsou</i>, <i>Genshiken</i>, <i>Plamo tsuguru</i>(TV show teaching how to build plastic models).</dd>
<dd>I am all into deleting most of the pages listed, however, due to above reasons, this nomination did not completely followed the rules and is just too generic and took too much liberty in explaining the wiki policy, I am going to vote a:</dd>
<dd><b>Keep</b> per above reasons. However, after the voting period, if the articles are to be kept, I will <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html#Being_bold" title="WP:FICT">be bold</a> and merge(redirect) the ones I see that are not suitable to have its own page when I have time. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 18:56, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b>: The initiative previously failed because of a lack of information. I have provided everything required, making the decision much more clearer. I am trying to argue against this "potentially valuable" information argument. You're only assuming the information might be valuable because of ignorance, but I have looked through all of the articles, and none of it is valuable. For you to decide whether it is valuable or not, you will have to look at the articles. Otherwise, voting "keep" is just as foolish. You can't base a vote on ignorance - whether it's "keep" or "delete".
<ul>
<li><b>Follow-up</b>: To do as you are asking is to delete dozens of articles which probably have not been read individually by us editors. I will read each one on a case-by-case basis, but I don't have the hours required to sift through each article in a blanket VfD. Are we to simply take your word that each and every article has no potentially valuable information AND is in violation of WikiPolicy? To vote based on such would be irresponsible &amp; the height of ignorance.

<li><b>Keep</b>. the Delete admin stated the following (roughly): The only ones who wants to know said gundam is X meters high is a gundam fan!

<dd>No, the nominator (not a "delete admin", just a regular editor: anyone can nominate articles for deletion) gave numerous reasons for deletion, one of them being that these articles violate one of our core policies, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Since these articles seem to be not only not verified but actually unverifiable (from secondary sources), they are a violation of what Wikipedia is supposed to be, and should be deleted. It doesn't matter if anyone likes or dislikes the subjects (we have many articles on subjects I utterly dislike), we should only look if these articles are conform to the policies of Wikipedia. They are not, and thus should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:55, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all.</b> No matter your qualms with the <i>procedural</i> value of this nomination, there have been no arguments made that successfully defend against the charges leveled by the nominator. The current poll of votes shows 16-19 "keep" votes, but digging beyond the numbers game reveals a clearer picture of what's going on here. Eight keep votes reflect reservations about the way the articles were nominated, and say nothing about the content of the articles. Four "keep" votes are simple <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> statements. Another "keep" vote is a regurgitation of the "worse articles exist, therefore this should be kept" fallacy. That means that 68.42 percent of the keep voters are ignoring the actual policy arguments, and chasing their tails in some rhetorical netherworld instead. It is my sincerest hope that the closing administrator realizes this. How on Earth is information like the following a worthy inclusion to the encyclopedia?</li>

<p>Please, by all means, explain to me how that information is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>? Our guiding policy here should be <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, which gives us this gem of useful information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These articles are written entirely in an "in-universe" style of prose, thus invalidating our first premise. They are unsourced, invalidating our second premise. They make no reference to their cultural value outside of the series, thus invalidating our third premise. In the end, they are a summary of Gundam-specific <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treknobabble.html" title="Treknobabble">treknobabble</a>, regurgitating plot specifics. What have we learned, then? Not only do they fail to meet any of the <i>positive</i> criteria set forth, they specifically violate the <b>only negative</b> criteria. Seriously. What's going on in here?</p>
<p>It has already been argued that the Gundam Wing series is a cultural staple and thus important to the encyclopedia as an article reflecting the significance of anime culture. Fine. That's why we've got an article called <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_7037.html" title="Mobile Suit Gundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a>. It covers the psychological and historical value of the franchise without vomiting up huge amounts of made-up statistics and histories for its myriad of plot-specific devices and characters. So stop saying we need an article about a futuristic backhoe to explain how the world is a better place because of the Gundam anime.</p>
<p>This debate needs to focus less on how much of a dick the nominator is (whether he is or not), and get to the crux of the issue: do these articles meet current Wikipedia policy for inclusion?

<dd>This depends on who know their exsistence and who voted. There are unfortunately too many Cosmic Era fans who just walk by and do random edits. There is no method in stopping these. I can foresee these pages be recreated again and again after every deletion if there are no redirects that led them to a list(At least that's what happen to a lot of similar page in the Chinese and Japanese wiki). Actually, this is already a sign of what level of impact those things are influencing our real world. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If they are recreated after deletion, the proper response is to delete them again, and salt the earth from whence they rose. The fact that a lot of people edit an article is not an indicator of real-world impact, but rather an indicator of fan base. This was one of the major criticisms raised against Wikipedia in its humble beginnings: it was biased towards popular culture and current events articles because no one was interested in writing an article on hard science or math theory. The standards in <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> go beyond "real world impact," also, a fact which continues to be ignored in this debate. Despite the "hundreds of editors" who've worked on these articles, not a one of them has bothered to put any non-fictional context into the article. You tell me how big its fake guns are, how fast its fake engines can go, and how long its fake legs are, but there is <i>absolutely nothing</i> about the artist who designed these units, or how they play into general themes of the anime, or how they've influenced the realm of anime-robot-drawing. The reason for this is simple in some cases -- the subject of the article '<i>just hasn't done any of those things</i>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 05:11, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is you POV, not wiki's. People <i>say this</i> people <i>say that</i>. Your argument based on a lot of elements that could be called original research, without a source, and violate the NPOV rule. Where on earth does wiki policy states that wiki should be only hard science, math theory? (though I really like those, too) I agree they should have some level of real-world context, they should have information on who designed them and by the influence of what (of course, sourced information). Again, I must tell you that these articles just did not have anyone with the knowledge and sources to edit them, you cannot just coin that to <i>they can never be improved</i>. And face it, popular culture <b>is</b> a real world impact, and I have already included sources that show how some of these articles can be improved to show real world impact. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:28, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that you have introduced this new term to me is ironically true that it can be used on yourself. You have strayed the discussion on saying how people critized wiki, without source, and expect me to say nothing about it? Back to the discussion. Face it, what I have listed are enough to write a good article on how some of these fictional characters made a real world impact, they have at least impacted someone to write a book on how to 3D model them, they have impacted people on writing published articles on teaching how to model using them as a reference. Even published POV critics can be included in wiki's article, therefore, a third party company publishing magazines and books referencing these fictional units, not talking about the plot, but just using them as a good tutoring material that a lot of people are familiar with, is a good source of indicating real world impact. If only I can scan a fan poll listed in magazine on which of these are more popular, there will be even more real world context, I do not have the magaizne, and I have no interest in finding one, therefore I never said anything about using it as a source. However, for a show having that kind of popularity in Japan, compared to any other anime, they always put up polls just to do a marketing research on which unit they can make a model kit and gain profit on.
<dl>
<dd>No. A straw man fallacy is when you take someone's argument, and reconstruct it in a weaker, more-easily disposed form. I said, historically, there has been a bias towards popular culture instead of hard-science, and that caused criticism. The bias existed because people wrote about their interests, and not necessarily on what people deem academically "important" for an encyclopedia. That there are a lot of people interested in a topic does not make it important. Somehow, you transformed that into me saying, "we should only have articles on hard science and math," which is not only disingenuous, but flat out <b>wrong.</b> Stop it. Even if you're only misusing the term straw man and instead arguing that I'm shifting the debate, it's still a non-responsive argument. I'm probing deeper into why these articles violate <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>, and you're regurgitating the same word-vomit that you have been all thread: "it's notable and important because people make models of them." What you have yet to address is the fact that, despite the hundreds of edits and dozens of eyes that have passed over these articles, no one has taken the time to meet the criteria for writing on fiction. No matter what <i>might be</i>, we're here to deal with <i>what is</i>. And unless you can prove to me that each of these cartoon fabrications has single-handedly reshaped the way people think about drawing 3D stuff, you can't slap a blanket on them and say, "They all belong."</dd>
<dd>Hell, the fact that they wrote a guide on how to model a Gundam isn't a very strong argument in the first place, because <i>not a single friggin' article talks about how these robots significantly affected the world of 3D modeling.</i> "So what?" you say, "People wrote about it in a third-party publication, so it's automatically noteable enough to merit an article." That's bunk. If we grant your premise that the Gundamspooge has rocked the world of 3D modeling -- which I <i>assure you</i>, it hasn't -- that's information that needs to go in the article on 3D modeling. Stop dodging the question and answer me: <b>which of the eleven characteristics of out-of-universe writing do these articles demonstrate?</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 05:31, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Question</b> where on earth do you see a policy saying it has to shake the whole world of 3D modeling before it can be said that it got some impact? Given, if a third party published a book of using it to teach 3D modeling, it means that it got enough credits and popularity that someone actually paid the copyright in order to use the designs for their books. No, it can never be so shocking that it moves the whole 3D modeling community, and thus it is not suitable to be mentioned in the 3D modeling article. However, a book written is a verifiable source of <i>its popularity among the general public</i> and <i>the influence of the work on later creators and their projects</i>. A third party publishing a book about these units is a very good demostration on how these units influenced the work of later creators and their projects. These articles currently contains none of these is a sign of they needed to be improved, if any of the fans cared to do so. Not a sign of deleting them. I have provided the sources, and the argument, and already said that if no one is changing them, I will merge them into a list. I never said anything about they should be kept as they are, and this is why I said the term you have introduced to me is ironically suitable for yourself, while I never said it is not suitable on what I said earlier about your unsourced argument on how people think wiki is biased towards popular culture. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The concepts of fame and importance have implicit in them the notion of a target population — a subject is famous amongst a group of people, a subject is important to a particular set of people. Notability has no such implicit notion. Notability is independent of specific groups of people. To understand this, consider that the primary notability criterion makes no mention of readership. A subject is not notable under the primary criterion if it is widely read about. It is notable by dint of people writing about it. It is the source writers, not the target readership population, that is relevant to the primary notability criterion.</p>

<dd>Like I have said, having books published satisfy the idea of <i>It is the source writers, not the target readership population, that is relevant to the primary notability criterion.</i>, while you keep ignoring. Yes, they are not of a mainstream press, in America, but do I have to tell you that wiki is an international page, and the publishers are at least mainstream in Japan, if not Asia. The Magazines I have quoted are <b>not</b> Gundam or Anime based. Half of Hobby Japan talks about real world machine models, like cars, aeroplanes, ships and such. And your hatred in Anime does not take away the credibility of a magazine focusing on Anime is not a mainstream publisher and is biased on Gundam. Dengeki Hobby is more figure related than Gundam related. Yes, in your view anything that you have no interest in is not mainstream, because you simply do not need to pay any attention on it, and thus I have the idea of no matter how many sources I can include, you are just going to be able to say they are not notable, not mainstream. From the original Arguement of the nominator of having sources <i>not dedicated</i> to Gundam, you have moved the level higher onto an argument of needing to have sources <i>not dedicated to Anime</i>, and probably you will yet try to raise the bar to any sources dedicated to any sort of fan base, including models, anime, comics, novels, games, and any other thing you cannot name of but have a certain group of fans, and maybe just in case some star war fans are interested in Gundam, too, should not carry enough notablity as they are not mainstream, because you simply hate the fact that they are a source countering your argument. Oh, and I can add it up for you, a newspaper becoming immediately not mainstream if they have said anything about any of these Gundam mechas, why? because they are fan based, they are anime based, and center on the Gundam universe. Face it: <a href="http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/d_original/hobby/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/d_original/hobby/index.php" rel="nofollow">Dengeki Hobby Magazine</a> is a mainstream modeling and figure magazine that is even translated to 2 chinese version(Hong Kong and <a href="http://www.ching-win.com.tw/hobby/hobby.php" class="external text" title="http://www.ching-win.com.tw/hobby/hobby.php" rel="nofollow">Taiwan</a>), <a href="http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/hobbyjapan/" class="external text" title="http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/hobbyjapan/" rel="nofollow">Hobby Japan</a> only have Gundam as one of its nine sections, with at least 3 sections not related to Anime. And if you wanted to say that the section itself is not maintream publishers, anyone could have the same argument on anything, because you can even ignore any sources from CNN or BBC if you say that particular news is written by who is biased towards that topic. And No, wiki never states its sources have to be mainstream, if it got published, by a third party company, it is good enough as a source. It doen't matter if it is anime oriented or not, it is available on the market, people can read it and learn about what is written in it, it is good enough to be listed as a source stating how anything impacted anyone on writing that article of that particular thing. As a matter of facts, the Tokien Companion is a perfect source for books of J.R.R. Tokien. And thus a third party publisher writing anything on a topic should be a perfectly valid source.<a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 16:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Along the way, I've had to defend against the notion that model kits inherently equal notability, but you'll notice I end each response with a return to the original question. Tell me, dear sir, how these articles meet the expectations placed upon them by the guidelines of our encyclopedia? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 21:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>And I have answered it many times. I never said anything about keeping all of them, and I never said all of them are important, I am just saying the ones that recieve out of universe treatment, like having a model made and appearing in another anime not made by the authors and company of the original anime, and appearing in a published magazine, serveral times, satisfy having <b>influenced the work of later creators and their projects</b>. Since these are not real human acting, the people who design them(including original design and finishing and redesigns) should be listed and replace the point of <i>the actor who portrayed the role</i>. The real world factors that have influenced the work can be found in an interview(listed in the Official website) of the director and two other interviews of the mechanical designer(listed in Data files) who said the designs are influenced by some of the previous Gundam productions not designed by him. Reception by critics can be sourced from the model magazines which over and over stated these designs reference too much from the previous Gundam series and some even referenced non-Gundam series. More could be found in Game Express Magazine published in Hong Kong that Critically analyze by Jeto(similar pronounciation) the series of main mechas(in separate issues) about how the main characters use auto lock on instead of real piloting skills in massive genocide and how the other mechas are being just paper boards without even moving and aiming.(The last one I never state because even though I totally agree with him, I know that that critic does not recieve much credit for his articles of constantly bashing on new series and is being criticised for that) How some of these articles can meet the expectation of our encyclopedia is simple. It cannot cover every single point, but at least some of the articles can have enough coverage on how much it was influenced by previous productions and how much influence they have on the real world modeling, 3D modeling, and anime production of later creators. And sources are posted over and over again. And no, I keep saying the articles at their current state does not meet any of the guidelines and must be improved, and I am assuming good faith on people who are interested in them with the sources I have provided will do a good enough job. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 02:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, having real world context is essential, but an article not having them maybe just needed to improve, especially sources indicate they can be.

I know 1.3 states WP:NOT as a <i>may be needed for deletion</i>, however, again, I must say that this is only a straw man's explanation on the WP:NOT policy. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> have nothing stating about these kind of articles and obviously a lot of list articles here falls into <i>Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article</i> This is why the nomiation is doomed to fail. It should not have started anyway. The nominator should just be bold and started merging them in the beginning(and no, a transwiki is just different from having a list on wiki unless we can redirect people to there without using an external link).

<dd>Yes, keep ignoring the sources, everything that indicate they have an impact is <i>dedicted to Gundam</i> and should not be used, should not be listed and should not carry any notability since they are against <b>your</b> argument. Face it, the series is made by Sunrise, the models are made by Bandai, which are two different companies, that is enough prove of every single model made is an impact on the real world. The magazines are published by different companies, the books are published by different companies, anime made by other companies with no relationship to Sunrise that may infringe copyright problems are also shown as a proof and your common sense is ignoring anything that is against your argument, you have shown clear prove of ignorancy and yet you try to use personal attacks, POV and bad faith just to try to hook to your own nomination without even trying to link all of these together. Like I have said, I am not against deleting most of the articles, I am only against deleting them all blindly. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 06:39, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Excuse me? Ignoring this sources? I clearly explained why the sources do not give leniancy to separate articles. This is because the "model kits" for each robot are part of a SERIES of model kits - it's not just this one little robot, it's all of the robots - they're not uniquely important - that is why a keep vote is complete nonsense in reference to those sources. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 21:48, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep All</b>But condense the information... However, I think the whole premise of this motion is outrageous! Many of the points that the main person opposed to these articles (EmulatorGuy) has raised are vague, personal opinions which seem to have been raised on the basis of a personal vendetta. I like the way this material is called "useless" - useless to whom? It seems only to be useless to the people nominating the article and there are evidently plenty of people who find it quite useFUL. If we apply his model to the whole of Wikipedia: there will be no articles remaining for anyone to discuss or do anything with. It is obvious that many people want these articles to remain. This is supposed to be an open, public contributed resource of information, regardless of what spurious guidelines you care to spout out, (which seem more inane to me than most inclusions in these articles). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.18.135.215 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.18.135.215_ed6f.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.18.135.215">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 195.18.135.215 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.18.135.215_ed6f.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.18.135.215">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

However, if consensus is to "keep", Wikipedia does seem to support polling, since nearly all of the "keep" votes are ill-founded and ignore all of the issues brought up. But of course, there'll be a generic "no-consensus" just because there are more fanboys than people with common sense. I've yet to see one valid argument towards keeping the articles.

<dd>Ok, I had some human error in my counting, but you made you biased your list in the opposite direction. Ben's redirect should be considered a delete (since you have to delete to redirect) and SidiLemine and Kerochan no Miko only said keep unless it was transwiki-ed. So that's at least 18 to <s>16</s> 17. wtfunkymonkey's vote probably shouldn't be considered, as it's both a delete and keep statement, so I say the voting stands at 18 to <s>15</s> 16, delete being the majority. --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 01:25, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think that IAR, is for situations like this, when somebody, so badly wants something deleted, that they try to cover all of there bases.

<dd>That all depends on what you think "improve" means. Because the encyclopedia is intended for normal people, not Gundam fans (no offense), the rule would not apply.

<dd>I'm sick of defending every argument here. It just isn't worth it, no one wants to accept it and keeps ignoring logic. From here on I'll just stop and let the nomination get a "no consensus", which was clearly going to happen from the start. It's beyond me why anyone thinks these articles are notable, have reliable sources etc. etc. etc. I shouldn't bother, regardless of any of my arguments, Wikipedia administrators will base it on amount of votes (like they always do) and not the integrity of votes. I give up, you can have your articles if the administrator says so.

<dd>You're misinterpreting the guts of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. The fact that some of these things appeared in another anime about big robots does not mean that they significantly impacted said anime. These big robots haven't significantly affected <b>anything.</b> The television show, perhaps, has made a dent in the Great Big Timeline of Stuff, but I'm willing to bet, when it all comes down to the line, no one is going to say, "Thank God for the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-600_GuAIZ_af9c.html" title="ZGMF-600 GuAIZ">ZGMF-600 GuAIZ</a>. Were it not for this twenty-meter-tall, eighty-ton mass of metals and guns, my life would be completely void of meaning." WP:FICT makes the argument for real-world reference and analysis because Wikipedia <b>is not</b> a Gundam fan site, and the sum cultural value of the Gundam series is not going to be that Pilot X stole it from Evil Nemesis Q, who was going to use it against Innocent Population T, but instead managed to defeat Otherworldly Monster N, and is the reason for the ring of space debris floating around Planet U. The fact that someone else has devoted time and webspace to listing these facts does not make them worthy of encyclopedic apotheosis. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 21:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I hadn't read the X-Wing article until now. Having done so, I'd say it's pretty crappy, and a poor example of writing on a fictional topic. Only three or four of the paragraphs relate to real-world content, with the other 4/5 of the page devoted to Star Wars <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treknobabble.html" title="Treknobabble">treknobabble</a>. That article needs cleaned up, purged of irrelevant and trivial knowledge, and polished, but I digress. Since I'm not familiar with the intimate details of Gundam stuff, I'll trust you that some of the units mentioned are of value to the series. Could you give some examples of the ones you think should be kept, and provide a rationale for them? I don't mean that as a mean-spirited challenge: I'm not attacking you and demanding you come forth like some kind of deletionist McCarthy.

<dd>I've already conceded that the "grunt" units should be compressed into summary articles by nationality (ZAFT/PLANT, Earth Alliance and Orb are the relevant nationalities).

<dd>I'm in complete agreement with you there, and I think that's an acceptable compromise between the two extremes being presented in this debate.

<p><b>Comment:</b> I've never seen any Gundam, but I have a strong feeling that most, if not all, of these articles are about things that only appeared briefly in an episode or two. Any character/etc. that does not have at least ~30 minutes worth of focused airtime is too minor to have an article about. Can it be established that <i>any</i> of these weapons have had enough focus within the series that they need to be kept? It just gets worse outside of the nominated articles.

<dd><b>Reply</b> I agree that some of these articles deserve AfD-ing, but the majority of them do not. This was a bad nom period.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Its better, but I wouldn't suggest making mass deletion noms out of principle. For example, the Skygrasper in this new Nom is one of the more featured air/spacecraft of the show and some of the main characters involved in the story fly them. A lot of those articles I agree should go, or at the very least be merged together.

<dd>From what I see in the series, its worst. The mass-production models appear in the series as paper boards and have probably less than 5 actions each. They fly out and get destroyed by the main characters without even having the need of dodging or aiming(aiming is done by an automatic fire control system, much less powerful than the F-22 onboard FCS). The same sequence keep on and on just to show how <i>powerful</i> the main characters are(failure attempt to most people with normal level of judgement, i.e. that are not blind). That is why I am really into merging those into one big list. As per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. No voting is needed according the WP:FICT for minor characters to be merged into a list, if there isn't already a AfD tag on the page, I would have done so when I knew pages like this exsisted. I only followed a vandal's path of vandalism and figured these mecha have their own page and someone tagged AfD on it so that nothing can be done to blank them, yet. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 14:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

It's not like we're considering deleting all or even most of the articles dedicated to a single franchise; as far as I can tell these don't even touch on the plot, characters, fanbase, criticism, impact on the real world, etc., just the props. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 18:23, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Some of the articles should be merged. That's not the point. The Gundams used by the major characters <i>are</i> important enough to warrant individual articles, because like the <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-wing.html" title="X-wing">X-wing</a>, they are <i>really important</i>, unique props which are used by <b>main characters</b> of the show through a significant part of the story arc, and are practically characters in their own right. Grunt suits, no question, should be merged together by nationality for convenience's sake, there <b>are</b> useless articles in the AfD.

<dd>ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice and ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom be merged to Justice and Freedom, they are not very notable other than being the mecha main protongists pilot, esp when they are just kinda like upgrades of those two: Anime <i>Sunrise</i>, Model <i>Bandai</i>, Game Bandai, Manga <i>Kondasha</i>, Manga <i>Kodogawa</i>, Book <i>Media works</i>, Game <i>Banpresto</i>.</dd>

<dd><b>Arguable items</b></dd>
<dd>The GS and GSD both have a team of three piloting three different Gundam units that the main protongist fight against, these units mainly appeared only in the series and games by Bandai, they are not even a main element in the plot(none of them stayed in the series for more than half of the series). They recieve a little more treatment by having models in the GS and GSD series but not much in the Bandai regular series like the MG models. (Almost all important ones have MG models). I do not view them as having any appearance in the model because it is only one of the GS and GSD series models which are named as dedicated to those two series. Even if they exsist outside the main lists, they should be merged to the three in the team instead of having their own page.</dd>

<dd>Emulator, all you have done in this whole discussion is continued reassertion of your initial premise. It's already been firmly established that you believe there is no viable content to be had from these articles, which is debated by other posters (including posters who are not fans of the Gundam Seed universe), so further reiteration of this argument is pretty well pointless. If by this point, where viable post-AfD plans have been mentioned and posted, which satisfy the requirements of policy, you are still sticking to your original premise and demanding that the entire article complex be thrown away, in spite of all apparent evidence that contradicts your original argument (which was based on a pretty twisted interpretation of policy to begin with), you simply have nothing meaningful to contribute to this conversation from this point on (really, you have contributed nothing meaningful since the initial nomination). The consensus appears to be <b>keep some, merge most,</b> and that is probably what the discussion should be closed on. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 23:05, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

Because of this, any conclusion made as a result of this AfD will be invalid. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 23:19, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, fine, have it your way. If you require 7 months to get rid of the articles (that's how long it's going to take) instead of 2 weeks just for "individual merit" reasons, that's fine, I give up. I've claimed to give up many times, but only because the constant ignorance infuriates me to keep coming back. I'll let you ignore the fact ANY separate article for a weapon in Gundam is against policy, because obviously we need fucking "individual merit". Before this bastard of a debate closes, just tell me one thing - A FUCKING VALID ARGUMENT TOWARDS THE POLICIES GUNDAM WEAPON ARTICLES VIOLATE. It hasn't happened yet, and I don't think it will.

<li><b>Comment</b> It may be that this needs to be broken into smaller chunks. However, the other side of this issue is that having the same people make the same arguments in 84 different discussions is also not useful. It would be helpful if the people arguing for a finer-grained deletion discussion could delineate some middle ground between 1 and 84 AfDs so that we can move forward instead of stagnating. Without wanting to prejudice the discussion, I will say that it seems to me that at minimum there is a consensus here that some of the articles should go, so maybe some consensus can at least be reached on which ones those are. For at least that reason, I think it is premature at this time to close this discussion. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 00:02, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The nest is well and truly stirred, now let's all take a deep breath, and find a place to discuss which articles are good and which ones need work. AfD is NOT the place for that discussion.

<li><b>Reply comment</b> I guess it is because it happened that all the 84 randomly selected articles are not of good quality? lol I must admit the work going into these articles are towards a not very good direction. Most of them are just going for 1) plot summary of what happened to that unit(or the series of them) and 2) the settings spec of them. While little can be found on what they have impacted, even with the handful of sources I can just pull up that should be included into the articles long ago. (I have not read any of these articles before, even if I made like a little edit on them, it is most likely that I am tracing a vandal's path of vandalization and only revert those without actually looking at the articles.) Most of them could be improved, at least the lot of Seed mecha can be said to have impacted the Seed-Destiny mechas and have appearance in Super Robot wars. However, little was included in these, and I have no interest and time in improving these because I have an even longer list of Universal Century Mechas to work on, before some deletionist list the few hundred mechas AfD, I have to do what I can to either merge them or improve them to a point where it is good enough to meet any policy creep keeping criteria. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 14:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> In this case, the original poster should not have used the afd process in this manner.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd just like to say that this AfD is a complete catastrophe, and that each article should , really, be AfD'd seperately. If this goes through it will end up in DRV because of the Inclusionists here. As a Deletionist, I'm not really ... happy ... with the way this is laid out, since it's a bit of work to look through all the articles and Gundam makes me see red anyway. That being said, some of these articles are possible copyvios. Some are just summaries. Some could, theoretically, be expanded. Mass AfD's rarely succeed since most people will not axe huge clumps of information without being sure every single one deserves the axe. This one will go down as no consensus, so a good and careful look at most of the articles in this series is needed by those voting to keep on how to expand them, or in a few days I'll go through AfDing the crap ones and voting they get salted. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 15:44, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the sake of all that is non-flamewar-causing, let us do some editing and merging before any new AfDs go out. This AfD is a train wreck because the initial poster was so goddamned determined to get the whole mass AfD deleted without any sort of compromise that he was willing to ignore policy to try to get it done (recall that he threatened to immediately re-nominate the whole thing if the result came up "no consensus" and to "teach the administrators a lesson" if the result came up "keep"); emotions need time to settle before further delete action should be taken, IMO. And I don't think ANYBODY will benefit from a precedent that shows that a huge group of articles can be summarily, collectively deleted by somebody with an obvious axe to grind. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 16:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reasons for merge of others - Strike Freedom is more of an upgrade of Freedom, although it is going to have its own Master Grade model soon(December, 2006), more have to be shown in a keep since it does not influence anything, yet. I see no reason for keeping it for now, if it can recieve more attention by publishers and the company, it could be split back out at any time.
<dl>
<dd>For Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice: Not quite usual upgrade. Not even a variant. That why we place F-15 and F-15E, F18 and F18E/F, separately. They are quite distinct, they have quite a story (Though original Freedom has more). Though they take much previous design, it is quite different, except some source say so. I never see any source which say they are upgrades. This may be only speculation, however, Freedom, Justice, Strike Freedom, Infinite Justice, receive different code (X10A,X9A,X20A,X19A respectively). I may agree if asked to merge Infinite Justice, but not the Strike Freedom based on notability. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 12:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reasons - They are pretty much the same thing, but the model recieved a bit more attention for the Gold frame is an event limited item in a Japanese model convention not dedicated to Gundam. Also for the new technology in modeling in hiding the cut between the useful pieces and the backbone of the injection moulding piece. It is not the first to have such treatment, but the second of the Bandai modeling series, after Hyakushiki. And since the other astray articles should tag along, I'd say merging them to a page for the Astray series is not a bad idea.</dd>

<ul>
<li>ZGMF-X23S Saviour, ZGMF-X24S Chaos, ZGMF-X31S Abyss, etc. that starts with ZGMF-X??? that is not 1X are called <i>Second series</i> on the official Japanese page, they generally recieve the same treatment altogether, and should be merged to a page other than the mass-production ZAFT mecha. This includes <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X56S_Impulse_Gundam_32f8.html" title="ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam">ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam</a> and <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X42S_Destiny_Gundam_5c98.html" title="ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam">ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam</a> due to their not so important figure out of the series. At least until something special about them is released, I'd say this is good enough.</li>
<li>ZGMF-X09A Justice and <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X19A_Infinite_Justice_2bee.html" title="ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice">ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice</a> are not even satisfied as a main plot device to some certain extend. They might be a little more important to the series, but is definitely not having any special impact to the real world. The latter actually is less popular than a Zaku unit in the series(per the series models having it out so late that it is 11 months later than the last Zaku unit.) (for the 1/144, it is even 1 month later than the Dom units) For a unit appearing pretty much the same time as the Freedom, its attention is way lower and my view on this is that its popularity is not high enough for the modeling company to release it early. Therefore, I'd say merge it to Freedom, its partner and let them tag along to increase that article's notability instead of being evaluated to be deleted soon after this.</li>

<p>I would like to say the others should be deleted, but redirects to big lists would greatly reduce the chances of them being recreated by randomly dropped by fans. Since merging everything left into one page is definitely going to exceed 32kb, I propose 2 methods of merging:</p>
<ol>
<li>Merge by fictional nations</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: Easy links from the fictional nation page (though I kinda think they should be merged to one page, too) Easier explanation on which is the predecessor of which.</li>
<li>Disadvantage: too easy to get the articles into another mess of in-universe article, and is hard to organize the whole thing to let people without any knowledge to comprehand which one is from which story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Merge by series</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: Easier to let people know what appeared in which series (All the manga Astray series viewed as a whole) which from my point of view, it is better served as an out-of-universe view of things. (Most people walking by is not going to understand what is ZAFT and Orb and etc.)</li>
<li>Disadvantage: Units appearing in more than one series is going to make a big mess.</li>

<p>I will not work on the above articles until I have finished a major part of the Universal Century mechas having similar pages like this one. I have provide sources and what I have listed in this page should be enough to improve the articles I have listed as keeps to a point where they meet wiki's policies. If nothing has improved for some while (like more AfD pops up), I will not back up those pages any more. Because it is obvious enough that nobody cared to improve those pages. However, I see that there are people who seems to be willing to do so in the above discussion and I am assuming good faith on this. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 07:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge or Keep</b>: A lot of stuff is noteable and I would suggest that since a lot of debate is being brought out about all the mobile suits in one of the Gundam Universes then shouldn't this affect the mobile suits from the other Gundam Universes as well. Anyway after taking a look at some articles I can say that some ideas I have to towards trimming an article down is not to go into so much detail over Mobile suit capablities since that had resulted in mutiple paragraphs also the triva section should be trimmed down to remove any speculative, and unneccessary material. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 06:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>One other comment to post: It would help if for the Gundam articles not to go into extra detail on the Technology used in that Gundam such as Phase Shift Armor, N-Jammer Canceller, and DRAGOON System since there are already sperate articles for them and it wouldn't be ripping off the Gundam website MAHQ.net of their style of explaining this technology in their Mobile suit summary. An example I have is of the Gaia Gundam <a href="http://www.mahq.net/mecha/gundam/seed-destiny/zgmf-x88s.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net/mecha/gundam/seed-destiny/zgmf-x88s.htm" rel="nofollow">ZGMF-X88S (RGX-03) Gaia Gundam</a>. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 06:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think we can all agree that things shouldn't stay, as they are now, for these articles. What to cut and what to keep is the question now.

<ul>
<li><b>Further comment</b>. This is a tangent but I admit that the policy on patent nonsense drove me up the wall until the new deletion procedures were introduced. An article that consisted entirely of "Tomatoes are devious items. They haunt my dreams" would get tagged as patent nonsense, and someone would rebut and say "it parses in English! it's not nonsense!" However, read the second part of the <a href="../../../n/o/n/WP%7ENONSENSE_9fee.html" title="WP:NONSENSE">patent nonsense</a> criteria - does this not fit under that rubric?--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 05:17, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sure, and we could argue that point, but you know how some editors can be.

<p>This article is clearly useless. It is a page probably written by the creator of the "roadway blogging" idea and was added here to further his agenda. This "roadway blog" theory is only apparently used by one blog and is therefor obscure.

<p>No sources to support anything, all of the information seems to be bogus (the IMDB pages for all of the people mentioned say nothing about this project). I think that this was originally supposed to be about the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aardman.html" title="Aardman">Aardman</a> project called <i>Tortoise vs. Hare</i> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378894/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378894/" rel="nofollow">IMDB link</a>). That film was first <a href="http://movies.ign.com/articles/301/301178p1.html" class="external text" title="http://movies.ign.com/articles/301/301178p1.html" rel="nofollow">cancelled</a> to make way for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Wallace_%26_Gromit%7E_The_Curse_of_the_Were-Rabbit_c06e.html" title="Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit">Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</a></i> back in 2001, and then postponed again until Aardman's 3-film contract with <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamworks.html" title="Dreamworks">Dreamworks</a> was complete. Now that the Aardman-Dreamworks contract has been <a href="http://www.animationmagazine.net/article.php?article_id=5971" class="external text" title="http://www.animationmagazine.net/article.php?article_id=5971" rel="nofollow">called off</a>, the film that was supposed to be made before this one (<i><a href="../../../c/r/o/Crood_Awakening_7bd3.html" title="Crood Awakening">Crood Awakening</a></i>) seems to have been cancelled as well. In short, there is currently nothing to suggest that the film is being made, and the article doesn't seem to contain a single accurate thing anyway, and hasn't since its creation. This seems like a case of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">crystal ballism</a>. I would normally support salvaging any article which has usefull information, but this one has no accurate information in it in any case; it shouldn't be very hard for someone to recreate it if the film actually does enter production, and nothing will be lost if it is deleted. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 04:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>- It did win a second place in an annual design award, which may well make it notable, as far as I'm aware there isn't a guideline for the notability of devices. And as to the COI issues: there are mentions of design drawbacks of the clock which seems to rule out strict vanity. Sections might need cleanup "Future plans" is a boarderline WP:Wikipedia is not a crystal ball violation and the detail given to the construction methods and design team may be excessive. I'd say 'weak' keep based on the boarderline notability and writing issues. Oh, and to the author, just because wikipedia has worse isn't a reason to save this one. Your arguments weren't bad, but they also didn't assert a grounding in wiki policy to keep the articles. The number of people that see the clock and mention it unfortunately isn't verifiable, and isn't really a source of wikipedia-defintion notability (a lot of peopel see the donut stand on the corner of North and Oakland too, and it's very distinctive architecturally, but it hardly deserves a wikipedia entry (donutcruft?)). If the design award can be proven, then that's the strongest argument in my book, as would non-trivial articles or mentions in notable press, heck, even the thesis paper the designers wrote, if published in a reputable journal would go a long way.129.89.68.218 22:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I know that this is not exactly an iron-clad source, but hopefully you will believe me when I say I did not spend my weekend creating this certificate. I think that this certificate, plus the articles in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hamilton_Spectator_8f5f.html" title="The Hamilton Spectator">The Hamilton Spectator</a> and the Toronto Metro, in addition to all the McMaster literature (calling these sources 'college newspapers' or 'student newspapers' as above is incorrect), are sufficient to show notability. The MacEngineer especially is an Alumni publication, with little to no student input and a predominantly off-campus circulation. I believe they certainly address the (legitimate) comments above regarding the broken link to the CSME award and the need for multiple, independant sources. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurtonpe_6ce9.html" title="User:Burtonpe">Burtonpe</a> 04:25, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Basically see what Uncle G says below, to whom you people should have listened. You guys have provided a tremendous deal of argumentation but no actual <big><b>sources!!!</b></big> about this guy other than some blog and entries on CDBaby and IMDB, which aren't terribly hard to get. This AfD debate has, bizarrely enough, had evidence of reliable third party coverage presented about it, while none could be found on Matthew Dallman himself beyond the blurb in the Washington Post, which doesn't really constitute non-trivial coverage on him. Since this is a high profile AfD, I really suggest people read and understand what Uncle G says below before jumping to any conclusions about systematic bias on Wikipedia. If reliable, published sources unrelated to Wikipedia or Dallman had been presented with information about him, this article would have been kept. But those sources don't seem to have covered him yet... so any beef should be with them for not writing about him, not with Wikipedia for merely enforcing our established policies. If you can't be bothered to read Uncle G's full comment, at least read the summary: "So if you wish to make an argument, please cite sources. Sources work. "I'm notable. I've done X, Y, and Z." does not." And the latter was all that was presented. <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Friends, Matthew Dallman here. I was just made aware of this article's consideration for deletion. In the spirit of the <a href="../../../a/b/_/WP%7EAB_9fd9.html" title="WP:AB">WP:AB</a> guidelines, which speak of "Therefore, it is considered proper on Wikipedia to let others do the writing. Instead, contribute material or make suggestions on the article's talk page", here I am to do just this.
<p>I would feel strange arguing for my "notability", and it appears that Wikipedia culture doesn't believe I should, anyway, which is fine by me. I can speak to a couple issues, though. First, the Marquis' Who's Who in America, which will include me in the 2007 edition, does not require me to purchase a copy of the book, so that charge by Hatch68 is incorrect. My credentials were independently judged by its editors to be worthy of inclusion. Also, Hatch68 questions the IMDB listing; it is for a short film that my wife directed, and I scored; the film played in various film festivals, incl the prestigious Chi. Int'l. in 2005, in one of their "shorts programs"; it also played at other festivals, in Chicago and Milwaukee, USA. The IMDB listing was, I believe, created by someone internal to the Chicago Int'l Film Festival.</p>
<p>I have an email acquaintance with the creator of this original listing page for me (M Alan Kazlev); he informed me after he made the page, and invited me to make whatever corrections were needed. I took him up, but only on minor points. It seems now, as I know more about Wikipedia, that such participation by me is a Wiki-no no. Other than that, I have had no part in this, but it was clear, from seeing the page first develop, that Alan pulled from the bio page on my personal website (matthewdallman.com/bio.html), and that other users (I don't know who) were adding to the page, so the charge by Ohconfucius is incorrect. Lastly, it might be noteworthy that, in addition to the arts journal I founded (POLYSEMY), I was involved with another publication -- The Manifest (the-manifest.org). In addition to authoring several articles for that magazine, their editor in chief interviewed me. (see <a href="http://www.the-manifest.org/features/dallman1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.the-manifest.org/features/dallman1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-manifest.org/features/dallman1.html</a>).</p>
<p>I fear I've said too much, so I'll stop. If there are any questions, let me know. Sharkface217's suggestion to "improve it's Wiki-credibility" makes sense to me. <a href="../../../m/_/d/User%7EM_Dallman_7005.html" title="User:M Dallman">M Dallman</a> 1 Dec 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>I made no charges concerning the Who's Who book. I simply pointed out that by itself it is a suspect reference due to vanity inclusions. The point of this whole discussion is not really whether you are notable or not. The premise here is that there is a real lack of reliable references that can provide verifiability of notability.
<p>I will go on the record to say that I really suspect some sockpuppetry going on here as well. The link to the Wikipedia article was featured prominently on your home page. The username Curlygoose has two clues; the first being that your picture that was uploaded and used in the article shows you with very curly hair, the second is that your production company is named Electric Goose. Also, the user Curlygoose uploaded the picture used in the article, then put a copyright notice on the picture that the copyright holder allows anyone to use it for any purpose, which leads me to believe that Curlygoose is the copyright holder. None of this is definitive proof, but viewing them as a whole makes me extremely suspicious.--<a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHatch68_1537.html" title="User:Hatch68">Hatch68</a> 19:52, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>The way to construct articles about people is to use non-trivial published works from sources that are independent of the person concerned. (See <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Writing_about_subjects_close_to_you" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability#Writing_about_subjects_close_to_you</a>.) Re-hashing an autobiography (taken off the subject's own web site or otherwise) is not the way to write an article on a person, a band, or a company. We remember the lessons of <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Kane_a13f.html" title="Jamie Kane">Jamie Kane</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jamie_Kane_3cff.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jamie Kane">AfD discussion</a>), Alkhemi (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Alkhemi_214b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alkhemi">AfD discussion</a>), and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">Aladin</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_5963.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin">AfD discussion</a>). A simple re-hash of Jamie Kane's web-site would have resulted in a completely fictional article about a nonexistent person. Aladin's web site quoted references to magazine articles that, when one looks at the on-line archive of the magazine concerned, don't actually exist. And only one person stated that Alkhemi even existed. Autobiographies are not to be trusted, for the reasons laid out at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>.
<p>The best way to demonstrate that a person is notable is to show that such published works exist by pointing to them, i.e. to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to demonstrate that our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> (WP:BIO) are satisfied. If you can do that, you can make a strong argument for keeping. However, conversely, if no such published works exist, a reliable and full Wikipedia article cannot be written, because we don't base our articles on autobiographies, on people, companies, groups, bands, web sites, and whatnot telling the world about themselves. As all of our notability criteria for people, companies, web sites, bands, and so forth state, autobiographies, advertising, and self-publicity are not routes to having a Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>So if you wish to make an argument, please cite sources. Sources work. "I'm notable. I've done X, Y, and Z." does not. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Sources</a>! <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Sources</a>! <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">Sources</a>! <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:41, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sorry, but I don't agree with the concept of adding things up to achieve notability. A person with a non-notable IMDB listing, who is also a non-notable journal editor, with a non-notable discography, and who writes a non-notable blog is not therefore notable. (If he were notable for one of those things, the others wouldn't matter, either - if he were a notable blogger, it wouldn't matter for notability terms whether he was also a non-notable journal editor.) Remember that although we may think that a person who's done all these things is <i>impressive</i>, that's not the same as <i>notable</i>.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 22:12, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In other words having expertise in a specialised subject automatically means one is part of a "close community", and therefore one's comments don't matter? Two wrong assumptions here - first that there is a "close community", second that one's opinions don't matter only because it is a specialised subject. If you look at any specialised subject, let us say (to cite another of my interests) a particular field or subfield of Paleontology, you will always find only a small number of students and researchers and workers in that field, precisely <i>because</i> it is such a specialised subject. But that doesn't malke it non-notable, nor does it make the opinions of those who are students of that field irrelevant.

<li>'CurlyGoose', Goethean and Kazlev suggest a number of reasons for keeping the article, none of which stand-up. Previous association with or criticism of someone notable, even Wilber(!?), does not in itself demonstrate notability. The 'wiki-credibility' of the article is irrelevent if its inclusion is prohibited by a lack of notability. Other wikipedia references cannot be used to establish notability without real external RS.</li>
<li>This previously deleted article appears to have been resurrected by the subject's sock and then he has the cheek to comment above seperately using both his sock and his own name. Sheeesh... An administrator will be able to compare the ip addresses, if Dallman wants to state here that he and curlygoose are unrelated.</li>
<li>It is interesting to note that the addition of Dallman to the Integral Art page was made by Curlygoose. On the Ken Wilber talk page user 67.109.221.130 identifies himeself as Dallman and then goes on to add POV to the references to himself on that page and the other pages that are used here to justify his notability.</li>
<li>Matthew - Do not be offended by this deletion - notability is determined by wikipedia policy not by how important you feel yourself to be or how proud you are of your entry here. --Backface 17:18, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is also interesting to note in the history of this debate that CurlyGoose originally asserted that he had no connection with Dallman, but has now removed that statement following the observation that and administrator would be able to determine the truth of the matter from ip addresses. This would appear to underline the socking, bad faith and self-(re)creation of the article and it should be deleted speedily. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackface_55a1.html" title="User:Backface">Backface</a> 08:24, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

( "Captive media" are media which are "captured" by the subject of a proposed Wikipedia entry - that is, are directly or indirectly under his control or influence, typically with a view to heightening his perceived importance. In this category are personal webpages and blogs, of course, but also included are the blogs of family ( his wife in this case ) and close friends, technical or professional journals of which the subject is founder, editor, contributor or financial supporter, and indiscriminate newspapers and broadcasters that include press releases from the subject or his representatives virtually verbatim.

<p><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHatch68_1537.html" title="User:Hatch68">User:Hatch68</a> mentions that no one seems to be able to come up with reliable, verifiable sources to demonstrate notability (for Dallman).</p>
<p>And this is my counter argument, that what Hatch68 has said re the Dallman bio applies <i>in a much broader manner</i>, and reflects an <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">unavoidable and non-intentioned bias</a> among Wikipedians, every one of whom has the very best of intentions. After all, how does one define notability? Who sets the standards? And how do we avoid these standards simply perpetuated the already established bias and over-emphasis in certain (albeit very worthy) subjects and perspectives, to the detriment of other (equally worthy) subjects and perspectives?</p>
<p>I'll give an example. I wrote a stubby bio page on David Grimaldi, co-author of <i>Evolution of the Insects</i>, an important textbook and definitive popular review of Paleoentomology. At some point this page seems to have disappeared. What were the reasons why he was considered non-notable?</p>
<p>Yet at the same time there are entries on every detail of pop sci fi franchises (less so serious SF). I'll pick a page at random: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_comic_books_809c.html" title="List of Star Wars comic books">List of Star Wars comic books</a>. Every comic book and every author listed. Now, mind you, I <i><b>strongly support</b></i> this!!! I think it is way cool the way that Wikipedia <i>does</i> list every character and detail and comic book, no matter how non-notable they may be to anyone outside that particular area of geekdom!</p>
<p>In fact, this was one of the main things that inspired me to write entries on Paleontological authors like Grimaldi, on Integral artists like Dallman, and on Integral theory critics and sceptics like Geoff Falk, in the first place. Surely all these people are <i>at least just as notable</i> as an obscure planet or character in the Star Trek or Doctor Who franchises, say. btw, ST and Dr Who rock!, I'm not dissing these shows, I grew up watching the original series of Star Trek and the early Doctor Whos, there were among the things that really got me interested in SF; but i'm just trying to make a point. I could draw similar examples from anywhere in Wikipedia. And what all this means is that Wikipedia is essentially a biased coverage, and that to Wikipedia's credit this is recognised. I argue here that the Dallman page should be kept, and the Grimaldi and Falk pages restored, as a way of helping to balance the unavoidable and unintentional bias that this vast and magnificent project has. <a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_Alan_Kazlev_3836.html" title="User:M Alan Kazlev">M Alan Kazlev</a> 21:51, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because <i>Chayathirai</i> and <i>The Coloured Curtain</i> only get 12 distinct Google hits when combined with "-wikipedia" and those were for booksellers.

At least one bookseller-hit only mentioned it in passing as a "similar item", and there is at least one "this only appeared in links pointing to this page", and then, of course, there are the Wikipedia clones.

<li><b>Comment</b> That is true, yes, but I am not claiming zero Google hits. I am claiming damn near zero Google hits outside of bookdealers and Wikipedia clones (see my Comments over at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Subrabharathimanian_8f61.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Subrabharathimanian">the author's AfD page</a> for details).

<li>The Sword API project is quite notable in that it may in fact be the primary and only Open Source Bible software and library in English (if not any language). So, it would be foolish to actually have no article about it whatsoever.
<p>The question is this: Should all of the information about the API, Frontends, derivative projects (JSword), etc., be condensed into the Crosswire Society page, or should this project page remain, and this information (not pertaining to the society itself, but their projects) be grouped here.</p>
<p>This is the real question, not the actual deletion of all information about this notable project.</p>
<p>Another factor in the notability of this project is that it is licensed under the GPL (last time I checked), and is now beginning to appear either with many GNU/Linux distributions (bundled with) OR is available in almost all repositories.</p>
<p>I personally will take it upon myself to expand and tighten the articles pertaining to Crosswire and their Sword API project (along with related information on the Frontends, etc.). However, we must decide if it should all be placed into the primary Crosswire article, or kept here.</p>
<p>I posit that it should all be placed under the Crossire article, under a heading:</p>
<p>==Projects==</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since I am new, and know your attitude towards the opinions of newbies, I shan't state an opinion on this deletion issue. I came here while downloading Bibletime and Sword for Mandriva -- which has used it for some time. I will be watching with interest, because I was planning to write an article on Tepexi de Rodriguez, Puebla, Mexico -- where I am currently living. It is a small village of no import, except it is world famous among paleontologists because it is one of the top locations for fossils in the world, and it seems disgraceful there is nothing about it on Wikipedia. I edited for five years a Mensa local newsletter, and certainly understand editing issues. However, to invest the time required to produce an article to your high standards, then have it discussed for total deletion essentially because there are no paleontology professors or students here, would be a tough row to hoe. Better to save my time and let them google for the same material I would be using for the article. --- <i><a href="../../../i/r/l/User%7EIrlandes_6d44.html" title="User:Irlandes">irlandes</a></i> 21:50, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Can't speak for anyone else, but I think new people are what keeps the entire WP project alive. All you need do to keep your article about Tepexi de Rodriguez from deletion is to make sure it prominently says that it is significant because of the fossils &amp; make sure there are at least two good published references cited to the fact that it is notable. Then just link it to the appropriate palenontology pages, add links from appropriate paleontology pages to it, for example from famous species unearthed there. And I hope you will stay and do some more. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 22:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Nominating as a non-notable political figure. This one is a little tougher than prior nominations as this person actually holds an office. However a state committee seat is a party seat and there are literally dozens of state committee people in OH. Also a party chairman for a middling county in OH.

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe that summary deletion was the incorrect action to take for the (A) article, and a suitable period of time should have been allowed for a transwiki to take place - preferably by placing a notice on the article "freezing" it and requiring transwiki by a particular date. There are editors still contributing to these articles, and I think it is simply rude to delete the articles from under them, so to speak. Since the principle of removal from Wikipedia has been agreed in the AfD debate for the (A) article, there is no argument to keep the others - that is obvious.

<dd>Well, yes - but I don't own the articles - I can't speak for all other editors.

<li>I didn't understand the first eleven words of your closure notice. I had (&lt;-note past tense) no idea what 'userfy' meant, and my reading was that I would need to ask for info idiom by idiom, when I didn't have a list to refer to - which seemed almost Kafkaesque.

I hate folk etymologies, where someone sits down at the keyboard and decides what the history of a word or phrase is based on their own hunch.

Then this sometimes incorrect info will get cited by kids in research papers, and prank ones (made up in school one day) will get added, with no basis for judging which should stay and which should go. If each was footnoted to a reliable publiched source and did not violate a copyrighted definition, then such a database would be valuable on one of the Wikiprojects, perhaps Wiktionary. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:45, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Transwiki" (like "userfy") is a neologism created a couple of years ago. Many of the people who contribute to Wikipedia in various ways are not computer experts, and if there is an article explaing it a reference to that might be appreciated. All I see are computerspeak jargon loaded pages about backlogs and logs and templates, with no overview. To the naive outsider it would appear that anyone could save a copy of an article and upload it to another Wiki. I suppose the cryptic transwiki process might preserve added context such the edit history comments, or history of AfDs? It is not immediately clear why an article that could be copied and uploaded in a few minutes takes months to "transwiki" and why it has to stay in the mainspace under some type of suspended sentence of deletion, or why editors should have to leave an unencyclopedic article alone and mark their calendar for some unspecified number of months in the future to check back and see if it is gone, or put it on their personal watchlist and see every minute wikilink added, or comma removed, or vandalism added and reverted for several months.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:57, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I remember that Wikipedia is for a global audience. I also remember that the existence of those other novels needs to be verified (and that internet evidence may be in Tamil script). Perhaps a search of for them using the original script is in order (it wasn't given in the original article). He is said to have written five other novels. I've looked more closely at the article and it appears that one of those novels I couldn't even find a seller for was already translated into English (<i>Pinaingkalin Mukankal</i> (<i>The Faces of the Dead</i>), I believe it was allegedly called). <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22+Pinaingkalin+Mukankal+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22+Pinaingkalin+Mukankal+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">All four of the Google hits for that</a> were Wikipedia and her clones.--<a href="../../../r/m/k/User%7ERmky87_07f5.html" title="User:Rmky87">Rmky87</a> 17:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Kathaimalar was the Saturday supplement of Dinamalar years ago and is not in print now. It is obvious that you cannot <i>find Kathaimalar anywhere</i>. It is either because you do not know to search properly or because it is not in internet or because it is there with some font (one of hundreds) that cannot be searched. By the way their Sunday Supplement is Vaaramalar (வாரமலர்) and their Friday Supplement is Ciruvar Malar (சிறுவர் மலர்)</dd>
<dd>My point is that IF SOMEONE COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT KATHAIMALAR DID NOT EXIST BECAUSE HE COULD NOT FIND IT IN INTERNET, His mental acumen has to be questioned.</dd>
<dd>Tirukural is not reviewed in Amazon. Ramayanam (Kambar) is not reviewed in Amazon. That shows that only someone who does not have the slightest idea about the presence of tamil literature in internet (as of today) will use this as a benchmark in fixing the notability. The penetration of Tamil Literature in Amazon on 3/12/2006 is such that even Tirukural and Ramayanam are not reviewed. Just because they are not reviewed does that make these books as non notable. Any one can not see as to HOW USELESS IS TO USE AMAZON REVIEW TO JUDGE NOTABILITY of a TAMIL BOOK.</dd>
<dd>Award or no award this person is a notable person in Tamil Literature. Full Stop. Please don't try to use useless means to justify your decision about something regarding which you have no idea or knowledge.</dd>

<dd><i>The least you could do is give me the titles of those works</i> You have enough of his titles already in the article.</dd>
<dd><i>I want bibliographical citations</i> Kumudam does not have Bibliographical Citations. You seem to be TOTALY IGNORANT ABOUT TAMIL LITERATURE. No way arguing with you&#160;:)</dd>
<dd><i>or links if you can</i> SO there is no world outside Internet for you. You believe in only links. Common. Wake up&#160;!!</dd>
<dd><i>Anyway, what exact sort of work did he publish in there?</i> Novels and Short Stories. My God, we are talking about an novelist.

<p>Comment&#160;: <i>Why have none of you bothered with this, instead of making almost completely unsourced assertions?</i> For the simple reason that tamil works are under represented in Internet. There is no use in killing a Horse because it does not lay eggs. Chickens are supposed to lay eggs and horses have their own use. Since tamil works are not represented in Internet (Even no one has reviewed Tirukural and Ramayanam) there is no use in proving or disproving notability through internet. Is it plain and simple.

For example <a href="http://pkp.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_pkp_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pkp.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_pkp_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> <a href="http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/msg00278.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/msg00278.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> By the way the Singapore Pancha was a story written in Tamil making fun of the prize schemes of announcing Plane tickets for literary competitions. Hence there is nothing special that it does not turn up in internet.</dd>
<dd><i>Is there anything about him in the media that anyone can show me?</i> Good Question</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>:While I am generally sympathetic to Bruno's arguments about under-representation, the article makes no real claims to notability. The two awards won are relatively minor; the Katha awards are handed out by a nonprofit that works in translation and three short story writers in each of India's eighteen or so languages win every year; traditionally, a different three!

<p>Appears to be a band with no claims of notability. Made a couple of albums but no claim of them being massive sellers or in any way groundbreaking. Played a couple of gigs. My current view is that there is no notability here despite Wikipedia's low threshold for music notability and pop culture relative to everything else. I came across this page as a result of the <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_Watson_ea06.html" title="Lloyd Watson">Lloyd Watson</a> page that I tagged for references some months ago and is itself not especially notable. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 07:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your contributions, it appears that I am not in line with wikipedia beliefs on this. The notability threshold for Music appears to be particularly low in my opinion but the consensus is that this article passes purely on the grounds of containing people who were notable elsewhere so no further debate appears necessary. A withdrawal of my nominiation is in order. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 07:46, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> (My bad. Should not have voted here. I think a comment is OK?) <b>Comment</b> There are a number of factors I'm taking into consideration. At least five (and perhaps as many as seven) of his eight books are self-published and only one was definitely published by a press other than his own. His "Church and School of International Detente" has <b>no</b> footprint on the web at all except for his version of its establishment and destruction. I can't even be sure any person other than he was a member because there's zero information on it. Beyond these items, what's left in the current Wikipedia entry is his professional career as a professor and he was apparently fired after 21 years at W. Illinois Univ under circumstances impossible to know. (He claims persecution and martyr status but without info other than his version, I am reluctant to render judgment.) There's also his interest in and advocacy for clothing-optional/nude beaches, and that he's a "self-styled cyberSpace philosopher", neither of which I find particularly notable. If the writing on his web page is any indication, he's a remarkably sloppy and poor writer. Everything I've seen is purely self-promotional and I've seen no indication of independent recognition of his notability except for right here. This is what I see. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b>Pigman</b></a> (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Pigman_6033.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Pigman">contribs</a>) 05:06, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>On the subject of annoyances: What's also annoying is when citations of sources that were added to an article during the previous AFD discussion, for editors to employ in order to do the very expansion that was discussed, are later removed from it without explanation by an anonymous editor. It should be no surprise that the article wasn't expanded using them. Yes, this is a stub. Yes, there is potential for expansion. See the potential sources found in the last AFD discussion, the citations for which I've restored to the article from its earlier version.

<li>List for <b>cleanup</b> by rewriting from scratch based on sources restored by Uncle G. There are other books and academic papers which address the topic in detail.

<li><b>Comment</b> Now this I can agree with. Start all over using the links added by Uncle G and then expand and make sure that happens. To show I mean what I say I will even offer to start if others help out. Alle we need is a half decent short article to get things started.

<li>Conditional <b>Keep</b>, clean it up, make it encyclopedic and useful for research. The collection we see there is not even at the level of a tabloid <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 23:26, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article in its present form is admittedly very low on content. However, I think the topic is an important one that should be addressed in Wikipedia. Sexual behaviour in the elderly is a taboo and marginalised concept that deserves to be in the mainstream. The article could easily be expanded and include a discussion of the change that the availability of 'Viagra' etc. has brought to this area. It is also an area seeing more coverage e.g. in films like "<a href="../../../s/o/m/Something%27s_Gotta_Give_%28film%29_70bb.html" title="Something's Gotta Give (film)">Something's Gotta Give"</a>.<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 00:57, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think its worth another shot. Is it possible to set a realistic time period for the improvement of the article? By the end of the is AfD (suggested below) is rather short notice. The very fact of the AfD will draw attention (as it has mine) to the state of the article and progress is likely. The further reading and links already show availability of material to expand the article. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 07:35, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Empirically, articles that haven't reached "adequate" state at the end of the AfD have a chance in the single digits (%) of being improved afterwards.

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> OK in light of comments I have had a go at expanding the article. I think the new structure demonstrates the potential for this being a very strong article. Obviously what's there needs further referencing, but thought I would make a start.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think we are starting to have a decent article. You are right that we need more sources and I will try to find some later today. A simple search on Google gave a truckload of hits so it really shouldn't be so difficult to do.

<p>The article fails <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, and is fancruft. A collection of conjectured aspects. The article has (cough) "references", but the references are merely points to mentions in fancruft, or spin off fiction (perhaps an author mentioned a rank of "Master Chief Petty Officer of the Starfleet" in one book, and that's therefore justification for conjecturing a rank, where the rank lies, and designing a badge for the conjectured and non-canon rank). The article even states, in one section that <i>"The following are several variations of Admiralty insignia, as proposed in fanon sources of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_Expanded_Universe_15ca.html" title="Star Trek Expanded Universe">Star Trek Expanded Universe</a>"</i>. It's full of weasel terms and original work (classic weasel phrases such as <i>"... it is plausible that ..."</i>, <i>"... may be explained by ..."</i> and <i>"It has been also speculated that ..."</i> Completely original research, much of it badly referenced (if at all) and unverified. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 11:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP (with a cleanup/expansion of article)</b> This article is enourmously referenced and contains no less than <b>17 directly cited sources</b> for the ranks contained within. For that reason <b>ALONE</b>, one cannot seriously talk about deleting it since it is very clearly not original research and provides reference material to back up the claim. The ranks mentioned have also appeared in countless books, manuals, and comic books with some (like Branch Admiral) making live action apperances. In addition, this is but a section of the muc larger article on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_ranks.html" title="Starfleet ranks">Starfleet ranks</a> and was sub-paged since that article is getting too long. Perhaps a cleanup is needed, but certianly not a deletion on an article which has been worked on for over a year by several different users. I also invite voters to view the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia" rel="nofollow">AfD debate on Starfleet ranks</a> which resulted in an overwhealming "Keep" vote.
<ul>
<li>This is a <b>synthesis</b> of various facts, assembling in such a way as to form a collection of conjecture.

<li><b>Comment</b> On looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia" rel="nofollow">other AfD</a>, it seems to have been based on different concerns — they weren't worried about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, they were worried about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a>. All the info the other article contains is from official sources. It does link some fan sites, but as useful resources, not as references. So I don't think it sets a precedent for this article. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 11:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, sources aren't enough, they must be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. "Conjectural", "speculated", "it is plausible", "suggests that", "<a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a> sources" means that unfortunately this subject is not suitable for an encyclopædia article. (Clearly a lot of hard work has gone into it though, so why don't you submit it at the <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Star Trek wiki</a>?) <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 11:25, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The sources look pretty reliable and actually most of them fit the definition of "primary sources" on the very page you reference. Pocket books novels are the main source, followed by at least two live action productions where these insignia apperaed, not to mention material from <a href="../../../f/a/s/FASA_d928.html" title="FASA">FASA</a> roleplaying which is considered quite well referenced. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 11:58, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are the published sources <i>non-trivial</i>? In other words, do they actually have significant coverage of the rank, or do they just mention that some <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshirt_%28character%29.html" title="Redshirt (character)">redshirt</a> holds it, or show them on-screen with the insignia? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 12:09, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Without getting too deep into it, some ranks which are <i>heavily</i> referenced are <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Admiral_e30a.html" title="Flag Admiral">Flag Admiral</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_captain_%28Star_Trek%29_8c08.html" title="Fleet captain (Star Trek)">Fleet captain (Star Trek)</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_%28Star_Trek%29_14fb.html" title="Commodore (Star Trek)">Commodore (Star Trek)</a> with those holding no less than 8 to 10 mentions in Pocket books and FASA manuals. "Second Lieuenant Commander" is a costume error which appeared on the show and Branch Admiral is visable as being worn by <a href="../../../d/e/f/DeForest_Kelly_b914.html" title="DeForest Kelly">DeForest Kelly</a> in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encounter_at_Farpoint_adb8.html" title="Encounter at Farpoint">Encounter at Farpoint</a> and also mentioned in FASA roleplaying. The "alternate rank pins" are from several sources, such as comic books and tech manuals covering material over a 20 year period. Hey, I am not saying this article couldn't use a major cleanup and some really good ext (I would do that if I had time), just to delete it...that seems like destroying other people's hard work espeically when we went to the trouble to source and reference <i>everything</i>. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 12:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But you're using these references - and of the ones I could check, they just seem to be trivial mentions rather than articles / books / sections discussing these ranks - to construct a conjecture of what each rank means, and what its place is in the Star Trek universe. That is original research, which the article is comprised of, from top to tail, and will always be, due to the inherent nature of the topic. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I dont know what "trivial references" you are speaking of.

<li>Cat, I am not arguing that the article is not sourced. It is. But the sources are for points of fact which the article uses to conjecture a multitude of fanon Starfleet ranks, and how they relate, both to one another and with the canon ranks.

<li>Fannon if notable is acceptable. The insignia mentioned here is from sources like star trek encyclopedia, a semi-cannon source. The ranks never appeared on the show itself but instead appeared on novels. Something mass published like a trek tech manual meets wikipedias notability criteria.

<li>Wikipedias deletion criteria is not based on cannon. The number of articles there are is irrelevant. There is nothing wrong with memory alpha, however its existance is not a deletion criteria. It would be vanity to have an article per conjectural rank however.
<p>The actual cited sources are not some random fansite instead ranks are from star trek encyclopedia and other tech manuals which are written by people who design the ranks themselves.</p>

<li>Yes, I'd say there was a clear conflict of interests here. On one side, we have people trying to improve the encyclopedia. One the other, we have people trying to insert crap like this (not merely aspects of a fictional universe, but <i>conjectured</i> aspects, no less). The two positions cannot be reconciled. Either we're writing an encyclopedia, or we're indiscriminately collecting <i>conjectured</i> aspects of a fictional universe. I know, it's a tough call.

<li>As an example of what I'm talking about, the first rank mentioned is warrant officer. This entry is based on an insignia on one character's shirt collar, followed by conjecture (with no sources) on what rank he might be. This is classic OR synthesis (relying on a primary source and then drawing conclusions based on that source). This method is pursued throughout the article and is its fatal flaw. Also, I'm calling the article, not the novels, fancruft.

Some have said it's not OR because it compiles <i>other people's</i> speculation, but it's still just a collection of imaginative hypotheses about things that don't actually exist, which doesn't sound very encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarywill_7a8c.html" title="User:Garywill">Walor</a> 18:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very strong Keep</b> Our job is not to delete articles such as this just because someone feels there is other source inof that may overlap, but rather to build on them and make them better.

That leaves just a few non-controversial references that don't apply to the meat of the article.

<dd>If a rank is created in a Star Trek book, then that can be noted. If an insignia design is given in a book somewhere, then that can be noted as well. If someone writes about a rank insignia appearing in a Star Trek show or film, then that can be noted somewhere. If a website writes lots about different actual and theorised Star Trek insignia, that can be noted somewhere. The insignia can be covered to a certain degree, but the real thing that a Wikipedia article should be focussing on is why this topic is important enough to warrant an article. What impact has this topic had on society in general? Who has written about this topic and why? If no-one bothers to write about it, then it shouldn't be in Wikipedia.

<dd>None of the article is credible, as it's inherently comprised of conjecture.

<dd>Self referance? You seem to be most confused today. Those links are to EPISODES and BOOKS.

<dd>Five of the references are to Wikipedia articles. For example, reference 1, which discusses the non-canon badge of a Lieutenant Commander, is to <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_a_Mirror%2C_Darkly_%28Enterprise_episode%29_4b7a.html" title="In a Mirror, Darkly (Enterprise episode)">In a Mirror, Darkly (Enterprise episode)</a> (the second part). This article then contains no mention, at all, of the Lieutenant Commander rank. The episode itself, as far as I can tell from the synopsises I went through (<a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/ENT/episode/9515.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/ENT/episode/9515.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://www.treknation.com/episodes/enterprise/season4/in_a_mirror_darkly_part_two.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.treknation.com/episodes/enterprise/season4/in_a_mirror_darkly_part_two.shtml" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, and <a href="http://www.greatlink.org/showepisode.asp?episodeid=1350" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greatlink.org/showepisode.asp?episodeid=1350" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> (and its sublinks)) make no mention of an alternate Lieutenant Commander rank/insignia. So there is clearly conjecture as to the nature of this rank, what it means, etc. I only checked this one in great detail, but a brief run through the others doesn't suggest they are much different. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 15:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not care about star trek site, or the wikipedia article about the episode. In the actual episode the mirror (our) <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hoshi_Sato_6496.html" title="Hoshi Sato">Hoshi Sato</a> is said in dialog "to retire from starfleet with the rank of Lieutenant commander". This information is acquired from the database of the future defiant captured by Tholians in the (evil) mirror universe. That is in dialog and her bio is actually put <a href="http://images.wikia.com/memoryalpha/en/images/7/77/Sato_biographical.jpg" class="external text" title="http://images.wikia.com/memoryalpha/en/images/7/77/Sato_biographical.jpg" rel="nofollow">on screen</a> (there was in fact a post-production commentary about it). I can go into greater detail if you like. So the rank did exist by the time of her retire. However we do not know if the rank existed prior. Hence it is not necessarily canon. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 17:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Mainly non-canon" and "many of the links are internal" implies that some of them are valid. We need to look at these ranks, keep the ones based on official sources and remove the rest. Whether the valid ones stay on this page afterwards, or be merged into the main ranks page, is another question - that depends on how many are left. But you don't need to delete the good ones to get to the bad ones - use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 16:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Does the ST Encyclopedia really have four different versions of original series flag officer insignia? Sounds damn messy if it does. Re: those fan sites (refs 18 &amp; 19 in the article) - I had a look there, and didn't see any mention of their sources - but if they're from the ST Encyclopedia, that's what should be listed as the reference. Since you've got the images in the table here already, there's no need to reference fan sites which show the same insignia.</dd>
<dd>Based on the comments made here, you'll need to remove all the speculative content if you want the page to survive in any form. (I've known abusive commissioned officers and warrant officers - Kosinski's "disrespect to superior officers" isn't enough to base any claims on where he fits in, or what the next insignia above and below him are. ) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 16:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not certain. I believe there are different competing sources. There are three versions of star trek encyclopedia. Each updated and sometimes existing data is altered. There are also star trek tech manuals and etc. I believe it is from that kind of citation. I do not posses all the books linked there. Husnock owns all of the books (including the ones I do not have) but unfortunately he is currently deployed and is far away from all his resources. If anyone else has the cited books that would make it easier.</dd>
<dd>Yes, well... I really want to keep article related discussion at its talk page... Can we please do that&#160;:) Afd is an unconfortable place to discuss this.</dd>

<p>Non-notable Dasternberg 11:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC) Individual appears to be non-notable. Search engine results show very few that match the individual, the large majority of edits to the page come from one non-member, thus this appears to be a vanity article. I found one page that mentioned the subject's name in a list of nearly 100 "good sopranos" today, otherwise there was nothing to be found. In addition, as has already been noted at the top of the article itself, very few Wikipedia articles (perhaps none?) link to this one. <b>Strong delete.</b></p>
<p>I don't know too much about opera, or the classical music scene in the USA, but this certainly reads as if it is describing an accomplished and notable performer. Unfortunately, it also reads as if it is a magazine/newspaper profile and I'm concerned there may be a copyvio here. I will hold back from voting until someone else can attest to notability (for example, are the orchestras named notable?) <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:24, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I think if the galaxy's name was a string of random characters, it wouldn't be in AFD. I think the existance and verifiability of this galaxy is barely but sufficiently established by sources, however, calling it a "pathetic" in the title is clearly NPOV and not suitable even for a temporary name. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 20:18, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The article referenced only says, <i>Robert Lupton of Princeton University, whose team discovered the big, dim feature, called it a "large pathetic galaxy" with a mass comparable to a cluster of stars, much less than the Milky Way</i>. it is unclear if this name is used by the wider astronomy community. At most the fact that a group of stars are in the process of being incorporated into the Milky Way could be said in the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_Way_7069.html" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> article. Also, this article faces the problem that has little potential to ever be more than a stub. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 01:08, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The press release linked to by the article appears to identify the object described in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...643.1166F" class="external text" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...643.1166F" rel="nofollow">this Astrophysical Journal paper</a>. This may correspond to an object listed in the <a href="http://simbad.harvard.edu/" class="external text" title="http://simbad.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow">SIMBAD</a> database as "[BDS2003] 122", although I do not think that can be used as a real scientific name. I suggest that someone reads the Astrophysical Journal paper and update the article accordingly. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 12:30, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per above ––30sman 21:04, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; the problem seems to be that we've got something notable (as per CNN), but that doesn't actually have a name yet, and the article has to be called something. This doesn't seem to be to be a reason to delete. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 09:56, 5 December 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>
<li>The key point of the referenced article is that Lupton called it "a" LPG. There is no implication that he was naming it "the" LPG.

<li>I don't know wether user Duja has mobilized serb nationalist for this ridiculous vote, or if these supposedly non-serbian voters actually are serbs hiding behind wikipedia accounts. No matter what, you are all voting for the removal of a page listing devilish people - and in doing so you do not less than support them! Some call this page POV just because it lists? It's unbelievable - well it wasn't me or any other editor that killed the children or women which earned the criminals a place on the list of serb criminals. Becasue of your scandalous denial and the belief that commited war crimes should be hidden away and forgotten, your deeds will be answered with consequences. I'm sure these consequences allready are present in your lifes to an extent - how can anyone who votes for denial feel good inside their damaged souls? But like I said time will catch up with anyone who does so. Truth always prevails and those who work against it will regret it deeply with time. The moral equivalence that wikipedia's extremely amateuristic writers are trying to follow is horrible, being neutral does not apply when it comes to choosing between the evil and good side, anyone who thinks so automatically has chosen the evil side. Being equivalent in the Bosnian "war" (aggression!), is like being neutral and equivalent to the Holocaust of Jews. We are talking about peaceful human beings killed by humans possesed by evil forces - and you are neutral?, well keep on dreaming..neutral is the last thing you are. I and every peace loving man or women whish you no good, for people like you are the reason of war and misery, sorry but that is the truth - it's an evil path you have choosen for yourselves. My suggestion to you is to try to save yourselves before it is to late and you will regret all you bad acts. (This will probably be removed sooner than I wrote it, obviously another example of denial and injustice. People you are letting criminals get away with the killing of small boys and girls!

<li><b>Strong keep both</b> --&gt; Correction: <b>Strong delete Both</b>; It is obvious that some serb Milosevic-era nationalistic editors feel like the list is bad advertising for them, so therefore they want to hide from the rest of the world. The idealistic situation for them seems to be killing a people whitout anyone knowing about it. And how for God's sake can a list be POV?..you heard me a list! I think this vote should be declared unreasonable and forbidden, it is not normal to vote wether the holocaust happened or not, the same goes for the genocide in Bosnia. The ICTY-list contains all ethnicities, and serbs make up 95% of the list. So we need to recognize that the serb army was much more systematic in killing and crimes than the other armies involved in the conflict - because of this the war criminals belonging to the serb army deserve a list of their own, if nothing else at least because of their huge quantity.</li>

<p>This is all nonsense an to a great deal POV from the users who want to delete the article.</p>
<p>The users who are pro-deletion know that the ordinary "Joe Smith" does not know how o access the categories and overlooks it. Deleting the article for the list is abusrud since less people will look at it.</p>
<p>Now you may ask why a list if we already have a category? Besides the point I stated above looking at a list is easier. Also it is easier to come to the page and easier to search.</p>
<p>You may say that it is repetivie, then tell me why so many other articles are like this that start "list..." on many different language wikipedias.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="../../../h/e/r/Category%7EHerbs_34a1.html" title="Category:Herbs">Category:Herbs</a> when there is an article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_herbs_and_spices.html" title="List of herbs and spices">List of herbs and spices</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="../../../n/a/z/Category%7ENazi_leaders_6e49.html" title="Category:Nazi leaders">Category:Nazi leaders</a> when there is an article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nazi_Party_leaders_and_officials_b544.html" title="List of Nazi Party leaders and officials">List of Nazi Party leaders and officials</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this, then Wikipedia has too many redundant articles. It is a shame so many have to get deleted now.</p>
<p>Deleting this based on that it is repetivitive is nonsense. So far no one has stated a good reason for the deletion. Why would anyone try to hide the truth if they are criminals? This has nothing to do with their nationaility. The point is to put out the men who did these attrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is a positive motive.

<dd>What if you guys are simply trying to do is to vote in order to get your points out trying to convice others like these users. Can't you see that no one has tried to moblize votes against the deletion. The point is votes so not work as Estavisti has shown when we tried to vote against the redundant template Municipalities of RS. He told me Wikipedia is not a democracy. If we take his point into consideration then voting does nothing. (It stated in Wiki policy). Simply being inflamatory is not a reason. Explain how it would offend anyone? It states the war criminals it is not implying that all serbs are criminals. (A lot of military generals did cause autrocities). Please explain further.

<p><b>Comment</b> While I agree that Wikipedia is not the place to launch a crusade deleting this list will not make it go away. This is one of the things that will pop up again and again. We should have a guideline that controversial and inflamatory information of this type should be only published under peer revision and edits be suggested to a neutral committee who approves or disaproves the edits prior to be on public view. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 22:41, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Before I'm accused of being partisan one way or the other on this issue, let me say that I'm simply concerned with the encyclopaedic nature of this entry. Firstly, there is only one page which links to it, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniak.html" title="Bosniak">Bosniak</a> a word I had never heard of until now so I would never have gone there and so never followed the link. If I was interested in finding a list of Serb war criminals, I certainly wouldn't start by typing in "List of Serb war criminals"; I'd try Serbia, or Bosnia or some such easy title, and still not get there. This is one of the problems with Lists of any descritpion - attached to an article they can be useful. As stand alone articles, they are not going to be found. For this reason, I am voting to <b>delete</b>. If someone wants to merge the information into a more suitable article, that's great. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 22:59, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I think this article should be deleted, because it doesn't have any purpose. Before anyone start applying to me terms such as bias and partisan, I would just like to add that there is already an article on this Wikipedia, with <b>ALL</b> of shameless people who are indicted by the Tribunal for taking part war: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ICTY_indictees_75c4.html" title="List of ICTY indictees">List of ICTY indictees</a>. That list is very good, it has what they are indicted for, it already has filled sentences for ones who were found guilty, ethnicity, and so on. So, I think it's ridiculous to separate all these criminals based on ethnicity, as I just can not see the point of it. If all of them have been involved in the <b>SAME</b> war and conflict, I don't understand why should we now break this already existing list into three smaller lists and list all over again people of croat, serb, albanian and bosnian ethnicity who were indicted. Why change something that is already there, and looks pretty good? Cuz then Serbs will make a Croat, Bosnian and ALbanian list. And then All of them will say "well <i>he</i> is not a criminal, but a hero" and then there will be million reverts and fighting... See my point??</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> From the information currently included in the the article, I can"t see much that makes her notable. I'd need some citations that she is "a recognized spokesperson" and/or a leader. Has she accomplished things? Yes, but that, in itself, is not notable. I just need more proof than what is in this entry now, which reads more like promotional copy than an encyclopedia entry.

<li><b>Delete</b> Being notable within a community does not mean much. After all, each of us can be notable within our own groups, but that does not warrant inclusion in an encyclopaedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> most notable people are not notable outside their community. The pagan community is a distinct minority. Unless you are a member of the community, you will not have heard of many notable Buddhists either. The community itself is the most reliable judge of a person's notability. Let the Hindus decide who is a notable Hindu, the Buddhists who is a notable Buddhist, and the pagans who is a notable pagan. Many who are notable are never noticed by mainstream media. That is as true of other religions and moreso of paganism. —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 01:24, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note that I (nominator) am a practicing pagan with an extensive library and have never heard of her. Not that I'm saying that my hearing of someone equates with notability, but frankly she's a minor figure at best, and the third-party verifiable sources are very minimal. For me, she doesn't meet my personal bar of article-worthiness because of how sub-stubby sticking to only the verifiable facts would make that article. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 11:41, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Please note that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is <i>not</i> governed by a subjective criterion. Notability should be evident regardless of whether one is a member of a particular community or not, by virtue of the independent and verifiable/reliable sources available concerning the subject. In this case, I believe there is enough independent interest in the subject to count her as being notable, but the article needs a <i>lot</i> of work to get rid of the aggrandizing tone and present only notable facts. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien"><b><font color="black">Dachannien</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/c/User_talk%7EDachannien_c4c3.html" title="User talk:Dachannien"><font color="blue"><i>Talk</i></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dachannien_c2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dachannien"><font color="green"><i>Contrib</i></font></a></sub> 02:41, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. True, notoriety within a community would result in an avalanche of niche entries. However LaSara is also called from outside a community (Playboy, SexTV) to represent the community - and as such is likely to be known outside the community. wolfharper 01:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Agree that <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Metal_d98c.html" title="Epic Metal">Epic Metal</a> is not its own subgenre. Bands are often listed as "Epic Power Metal" or "Epic Heavy Metal," but very rarely (or consistently) as simply "Epic Metal." The characteristics listed on the page are too vague too constitute a seperate subgenre. More of a 'sub-subgenre' than anything else.</p>

<p>"Epic" is used as a frequent descriptor for styles of metal, but I've rarely seen it by itself or even associated with power metal.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Epic metal is not a subgenere, IMO. It's a term that could describe any metal subgenere - epic black metal, epic doom metal, epic power metal, ect. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeletor2112_e088.html" title="User:Skeletor2112">Skeletor2112</a> 05:04, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The confusion of 'epic power metal', 'epic black metal' and so on comes because the epic tag is often misapplied to bands that use an epic style of lyrics. Epic metal itself is a legitimate subgenre of heavy metal; bands like <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manilla_Road_e76a.html" title="Manilla Road">Manilla Road</a>, Feanor and <a href="../../../c/i/r/Cirith_Ungol_%28band%29_e860.html" title="Cirith Ungol (band)">Cirith Ungol</a> have a distinctive sound that doesn't fit into the other subgenres. <a href="../../../a/g/g/User%7EAGGoH_99b5.html" title="User:AGGoH">AGGoH</a> 07:40, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Epic metal is like Viking metal: there is no specific style, and it's a broad term that can include a lot of bands from different subgenres, but they all have one thing in common: an epic feel. Same as all Viking metal bands have Viking lyrics/imagery or whatever. The article definitely needs a rewrite though.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with Rlevse. As a comment, I am always suspicious of nominations that use the incorrect nomenclature. It shows that the proposed deletion has not been researched enough. This is not a "chapter", but a "company" of the Boys' Brigade, just as Scouts have "troops" or "groups". The term "chapter" would not be understood in Glasgow about anything, let alone a BB Company. It is a US term. I also do not understand the phrase "paraphrases the parent - <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boys%27_Brigade_11b0.html" title="Boys' Brigade">Boys' Brigade</a>" (NB I also corrected that link above). One is about the whole organisation. The other is about one notable company. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:07, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As another comment: Let's not get hung up on incorrect nomenclature. I'm willing to bet Glaswegians are not as unintelligent as you make out and although they might not use the term 'chapter' to refer to a company of the BB, they will know or be able to work out what it means if only because they have heard of Hell's Angels chapters. If a simple Londoner like me can do it, a Glaswegian can. Back to the debate: The fact that it's one of the oldest BB companies may be significant within the BB, in which case it could be mentioned in the BB article. I see nothing that merits a separate article. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 23:24, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - On the use of the word chapter, and because it's not always possible to avoid <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">being a dick</a>. Most commonly used in the context of US college fraternities, it can also be used, in the (literal) canonical sense, to refer to meetings / groups within religious orders. Particularly apt in this example. The use of the butchers's apostrophe was an egregious typo, but I'm always happy to see poor typing being pointed out (even at the expense of weegies, I fear). To my original AfD proposition - My comment was cursory and hasty.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is a unique article and is worthy of being kept. Rlevse is correct - it discusses one of the oldest BB Companies in the world. The history of the Company and the uniqueness of the text suggests it should be kept. 87.81.62.126 17:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am deeply perturbed by the current balance in this debate, which is edging towards keeping this article. I do not doubt that this organisation is important to its members, but as presented in this article no evidence of notability has been provided. The <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boys_Brigade_f6e5.html" title="Boys Brigade">Boys Brigade</a> is an important organisation, but if we keep this article we will shortly be inundated by a wave of articles about every <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scout.html" title="Scout">Scout</a> troop, and so on. This, I believe, would be deeply unwise. My key point is this: the article, as it stands, does not show notability for this company ( it's clearly not even the first of its kind&#160;! ). I hope that the closing administrator for this debate will feel able to find a way of holding a wider debate on this issue. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 22:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I'd have speedied this as a club with no assertion of notability, but as we're talking about it now... There's no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, no indication of any notability, the text is a homepage-type advertisement.

<p>While reverting Kill Reality 2's repeatedly vandalized page, I attempted to verify the information to be sure I did not revert good information. Searching for a second season of Kill Reality resulted in no results, except those here at Wikipedia. Sources I checked included <a href="http://www.imdb.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.org/</a>, <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.tvguide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tvguide.com/</a>, and <a href="http://www.eonline.com" class="external free" title="http://www.eonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.eonline.com</a>.

There are only three Wikipedia encyclopedic articles linking to this page, along with a few user pages (including warnings about defacement of the page). I have no problem keeping this page alive if the information is true, but otherwise it seems to be a breeding ground for vandalism. (P.S. This is my first afd request, so please be kind if I did anything improper or un-Wiki-ish.

<dd>While Stanford is indeed published. I can find no evidence that the biography he penned received multiple independant reviews.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the lack of sales is because your link is to the 1994 biography. The 2003 biography has the title <i>The Outcast's Outcast</i>.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've significantly expanded the article. Stanford has written for several national newspapers, and has had numerous books published. Copies of professional reviews of some of the books (<i>The Devil</i>, <i>The Legend of Pope Joan</i>, and <i>Heaven</i>) can be seen by following the ISBN links to amazon.com. A Google search of Peter Stanford produces many results. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Pascoe_ece4.html" title="User:Alan Pascoe">Alan Pascoe</a> 20:16, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notable author and journalist. Note to BOBBY: I can't understand how you can use Amazon and not conclude that this a notable author. I note you used Amazon.ca (29 results). Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk give similar results (admittedly, a few appear to be by authors with the same name - a major failing of Amazon) but checking on any of these gives respectable sales. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 23:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Since Dragan Nikolić pled guilty to four counts and has been sentenced, the claim that this is POV is doubtful. There is a Serbian actor of the same name, so using the plain name is unrealistic. (Also, the article omits the guilty plea, and is obfuscatory.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 19:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Change</b> title removing War Criminal. The fact that he was convicted does not give him an additional title.

I'll start over. There's already an article for a different person named <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragan_Nikoli%C4%87_0868.html" title="Dragan Nikolić">Dragan Nikolić</a>. This particular Dragan Nikolić needs a description affectation and "war criminal is fine as that's what he's notable for. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 05:54, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> War Criminal is POV - he wasn't convicted as a war criminal, he was convicted of various crimes... Also, the article is at the same name with (commander) after it which is neutral <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 08:48, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Labelling someone primarily famous for being convicted of crimes against humanity a "commander" is POV, or at least weasel-wording. We can't drop the disambiguating suffix entirely, and this one fits well enough. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> doesn't require us to whitewash history, of if it does, it's faulty. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 13:11, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The man's profession was 'commander'. Labelling someone per their ciminal activity is inherently POV. I have not seen any other articles on this site that label someone in the same manner. BLP states that we have to source all claims - have you got a source showing that this person is in fact a 'war criminal' (using the exact wording)? <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 13:31, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Gangbang's &amp; cumshots are absolutely no novelty in porn. What is the point of this page? It is nothing more than an advert for a particular studio line, one among many. The more I read this vacuous article more I think it should go. Getting an award at Venus amounts to very little. It is a trade show that hands out lots of meaningless awards every year with no serious selection or voting policy (normally the only criteria for inclusion being the the hire of a stand or promotion spend). Delete now. As mentioned before gangbang's &amp; cumshots are no novelty, why waste any more time later.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> A lot of no name's in here trying to get this page taken down. Those are probably the same people whose links we keep removing because they only go to spammy pages selling DVDs(which is against Wiki TOS the last i checked, no??? direct links to commercial sites with ref codes?). John Thompson is a very well known producer in Europe and especially Germany. as you can see by looking at the <a href="http://imdb.com/company/co0067452/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/company/co0067452/" rel="nofollow">IMDB listing</a>, sadly they stopped listing after 52 titles. As well you can see <a href="http://www.adultdvdtalk.com/reviews/search_reviews.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.adultdvdtalk.com/reviews/search_reviews.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a> the GGG line is notable enough to have 99 reviews about their movies on adultdvdtalk.com. if those are not acceptable references I'm not sure what you need? Yes we run an affiliate program, but we got tired of affiliates fighting over this link so we just removed the affiliate codes from them. No one from our company wrote this article. In fact there are a number of inaccuracies about it that we just don't care to change. We are merely tired of hearing the fighting about what affiliate gets to claim this link so we removed their affiliate codes, thats is all. I left all of the links not relevant to us or our affiliate program. In fact some of them I found to be very interesting. I do not know who removed the others. look at the edit history, i guess.

<p>Reason The article does not cite any evidence that a "Hajj passport" exists. It is possibly total fiction.</p>
<p>The one reference I can verify (the claim that a <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj_passport.html" title="Hajj passport">Hajj passport</a> is issued by the United Kingdom) is untrue, the British Passport Office does not issue different types of passport. To issue a document only persons of a specified religion would be considered discrimination.</p>
<p>A google search for <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj_passport.html" title="Hajj passport">Hajj passport</a> finds only this article and mirrors. TiffaF 16:45, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I added a reference to a Pakistani news article discussing them, <s>so at least they appear to be real.</s> A Pakistani source used the term, but a Saudi source just referred to Hajj visas to be used with ordinary passports. Thus a "Hajj passport" might become a "Venezuela Passport" if the owner obtained the correct visa the next week. This does not rule out the possibility some countries issue such single use passports, but I could not readily find evidence of it. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:56, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> The first source (State Bank of Pakistan) merely mentioned it in passing in a way that may not have implied that they are passports of a special type. The list of issuing nations needs to be sourced; a comment above provides a reason (if confirmed) that the UK needs to be removed from this list. <i>If</i> sources are added which clearly provide evidence of some nations issuing these single-purpose passports, then <i>keep and cleanup</i>; lacking firm sources, <i>delete</i> per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:21, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Try searching for "Haj passport" instead of "Hajj passport". According to <a href="http://domino.kln.gov.my/KLN/press.nsf/6bbe49238c1c471cc82564f7002357c1/1c2be910876f0e70c8256b50002cd3e7?OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://domino.kln.gov.my/KLN/press.nsf/6bbe49238c1c471cc82564f7002357c1/1c2be910876f0e70c8256b50002cd3e7?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">this press release</a> from the Malaysian Department of Foreign Affairs, the "Tabung Haji issues the green-coloured Haj passport". There are also several more newspaper and government references, so I'm pretty sure this isn't "total fiction". --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 21:01, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> what can be verified (it seems to be Malaysian practice at the very least) into the article on the <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">Hajj</a> itself - probably a new section on the technical issues or something. From a non-Muslim perspective, it would answer the commonly-asked question of "how do they make sure that only Muslims get into Mecca?" The Saudi practice of only issuing Hajj visas from specific times of the year should also turn up in such a section. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:48, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> (reply to Highfructose) "Special" and "unique" do not equal "notable," unless outside publishers have taken note of the school's uniqueness and decided to therefore publish things about the school. But it doesn't look like they have in this case. And, association with a non-notable (or even notable) recording artist, youth conference, or organic market, do not imply notability of the school. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:48, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> No indication of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> -- this school does not appear to be described in many (or any) non-trivial outside sources from which to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:05, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Sources included in article weakly support a claim of notability. I searched for additional sources at various sites, though the difficulty may be related to its remote location in South Africa. Justification of "waste of space" is not a valid reason and article has far more information than required by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> to exceed a directory entry. Having an AfD that doesn't even attempt to reference a relevant Wikipedia standard or guideline is not a good sign of responsible nomination. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 06:53, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryanston%2C_Gauteng_d44f.html" title="Bryanston, Gauteng">Bryanston, Gauteng</a> since there is little info about the school (the only really non-trivial detail that the school is a Waldorf school is apparent in the school name). Being the only school of a given type in a specific suburb is not a claim of notability especially when no indedenent sources have felt a need to discuss the matter. I agree with some of the keeps that the nomnination is less than compelling if not outright ridiculous but that shouldn't stop us from evaluating the article now that it is here on AfD. In so far as that, the school fails the highly generous <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> and doesn't come even close to meeting the conditions in any draft of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>.

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> <b>Delete</b> - If J.R. King is indeed a teenage author who has already been published (and his book has made the top 100K books on Amazon) then there is an excellent case for notability. However, I'm a bit skeptical about the age claim, and would like to see solid proof before voting for keep. Unfortunately, google searches for JR King come back with a lot on Martin Luther King <b>JR</b>. Not much more appears when I add periods. It seems surprising (given the nature of the press) that a <i>teenage author</i> would not receive significant news coverage. I'm also a bit wary about an author named <b>J R King</b> writing books in the same genre as <b>J K R</b>owl<b>ing</b>.

<p>Utter blithering nonsense.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - The reciprocal of a composite number divided by a prime is equal to the prime divided by the composite. Since the composites get "bigger" much more slowly than the primes (due to the greater frequency of composite numbers once we get out of single digits) there is absolutely no way that sums of these quotients could converge (since each subsequent value would be greater than the last). The chart given below as a justification doesn't even make sense. It seems like the "Primes" and "Composites" column are supposed to say how many of each type of number exist in the range from 1 to <i>F6</i>. However, since all even numbers (with the exception of two) are composites (proof: divisible by 2), it is impossible to have more primes than composite in any range once you get above 12. I must admit that the article made for a good laugh in my analysis class, but it is certainly not suitable for WP. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertbcole_d850.html" title="User talk:Robertbcole">→</a><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robertbcole_0dd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robertbcole">←</a> 19:22, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess from the article that the so-called "Tetralectic constant" is the article's mentioned "constant c &lt; 0.767661013369489", and that this c is intended to be the limit of "Dif Major-mInor" when x tends to infinite. Then we simply get c = log(10)/3. This c value is the result of (apparently arbitrarily) choosing to define F6 = (10^x+2)/<b>3</b>, and PRIMES = pi(<b>10</b>^x).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Once the meaning of the undefined terms has been guessed, this is elementary mathematics. I see no value in it. I guess the author just played around with prime counts and thought it was significant that a constant emerged from some arbitrary choices.</dd>
<dd>A lot could be done to clarify the article but I think the end result would be uninteresting and useless statistics and observations. I see nothing notable which isn't already placed much better in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_counting_function.html" title="Prime counting function">prime counting function</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_number_theorem.html" title="Prime number theorem">prime number theorem</a>.

<li>It has been 5 days since I posted the above comment and I confess that I'm a little disappointed that the people who have proposed deleting this article have not come forward to answer the question I asked above: "why can't this article be fixed?". Simply stating that "this is an instruction manual" does not make it so. AfD are supposed to be about discussing things to reach a consensus. If this article *can't* be fixed, then there isn't any reason to try rewriting it.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Given the diversity in approaches to dealing with spam this article may actually be more remarkable for how good it is. This is, after all, Wikipedia. That means multiple authors. The different sections are most probably written by proponents of the techniques described in the sections. Where else can you find anything that approaches the coverage of the topic of dealing with e-mail abuse (where "e-mail abuse" appearsw mostly to mean "spam.") If a section has a problem identify that section and identify the problem. Don't throw the whole thing out because some parts aren't perfect. Minasbeede 01:24, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> As the previous 6 or so posters pointed out: this is Wikipedia's main article on the subject, and it would would be almost scandalous if Wikipedia had no article on such an important and high-profile topic; and the article does present a lot of information. I suggest the editors should identify the target audience(s), structure the article accordingly, and improve the presentation by increasing use of "chunking" and decreasing verbosity (Web users want to scan, not read). My own thoughts on target audience(s), in descending priority order: home / small business users; owners of small Web sites (vulnerable to form email, blog, guestbook and comments spam); system administrators; people involved in anti-spam initiatives and research. In other words, visitors with the least prior knowledge get priority treatment. There should be links to additional "advanced" pages, both within and outside Wikipedia.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 11:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and clean up.</b> I read through the article, and I agree that it is poorly worded in some areas. It just needs to be rewritten, however; deletion implies that the topic of the article is worthless when in fact this (stopping e-mail abuse) is an important topic of research. The article has tons of good information about the different methods used, it would be criminal to delete it. Moreover, this does not look like a guide in most areas. The intent of the article is clearly encyclopedic and clearly not just for the purpose of disseminating some random guy's ideas about how he blocked spam one day at 2:00 in the afternoon because he was bored.<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldsmitharmy_fb23.html" title="User:Goldsmitharmy">Goldsmitharmy</a> 05:09, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Actually, keeping the article and moving (copying) it to wikibooks are not mutually exclusive and is likely the proper course. The area of spam control and reduction is a large and important one and most of this article is just fine. Some of it would also be useful as a How-To guide on wikibooks. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 16:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Rockford Master's Commission was the second Master's Commission program to become an affiliate of the Master's Commission International network. Their director, Jeremy Deweerdt, sits on the board of the MCIN and is head of the European Master's Commission Network. The Rockford Master's Commission is one the premier Master's Commission programs in the entire world and many other Master's Commission programs look to them as a solid model for what a Master's Commission should look like.</p>
<p>The Rockford Master's Commission is a model that other Master's Commissions, Churches, youth groups, and non-profit organizations, look to for direction. Someone who does not know about the Master's Commission "world" would not understand the purpose of this article. However there are 10s of thousands of Master's Commission students and alumni worldwide as well as members of the church who would benefit from this article.</p>

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> There's a very simple way to solve this problem, introduce references into the article from non-trivial secondary sources (meaning not principals or participants in the organization) that establish that it's notable by WP notability standards, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> for details. <b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, no references by reliable sources that this organization is notable outside its circle of participants. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 18:49, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If you want to stick to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> to a T, you need multiple Non-trivial sources, which means even if 2600 is notable (which I think it is, go look at the subscriber base size) it is still only one non-trivial source. It was linked to on slashdot in a post not dedicated to it. Thus it only has 1 non-trivial source. I'm assuming wikipedia policies which refer to multiple sources mean more than one. Since it doesn't have MULTIPLE non-trivial sources it doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Not notable enough, as it has only one source.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I think this article should stay. For one, there is an article in 2600 Magazine about this guy and his problem. However, since it is a paper publication, there is no way to site it other than the link provided. Also, referring to your reasons for deleting: 1) It is not an attack page. It is not attacking fuckpaypal.net. 2) It doesn't seem this way to me. It seems to be your point of view that this is a promotion of the site. I see this article as a warning to people that use paypal. I believe there was a link to the site in the PayPal wikipedia article in the criticism section, but was removed when the section was cleaned. I don't see this as a promotion of the site or a personal grudge. I see it as a documentation of the 'fuckpaypal' movement. Maybe a name change from 'fuckpaypal.net' to 'fuckpaypal' would satisfy you.68.193.81.111 06:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> How about merging or renaming this into an article Criticisms of PayPal. I would note that buyers and sellers <b>routinely</b> have beefs with PayPal, Ebay, Mastercard, Visa, Amex, etc, and buyer <i>and</i> seller fraud is a big problem. Ebay even has a "Dispute Console", indicating that they expect disputes. The only thing notable about <i>this</i> dispute is that he put up the fuckpaypal.net website. Large companies deal with larger disputes and buyer fraud regularly, spammers and phishers scam the public for <i>millions</i>. A $600 gyp is not notable, unless it happens to me, in which case you will see a WP page on it. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 08:24, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This ariticle has undergone an incomplete AfD, PROD, PROD removal, and re-PROD; all without the editors commenting on this. I'm bringing this to AfD so this can go through an actual community review. The original PROD reason was "notability", which I assume is supposed to mean the PROD'er finds this person non-notable.

<dd>Notability criteria do not equate to "I have heard of it"/"I have never heard of it" or "I think this topic deserves attention"/"I do not think this topic is worthy of attention".

<li><b>Delete</b> Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. With respect to notability, the inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, and journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. As such, the primary notability criterion does allow Wikipedia editors to determine whether "the world" has judged a subject to be notable, but this is not a consideration of whether a Wikipedian personally thinks a subject is or is not notable.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.219.142.172 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.219.142.172.html" title="User talk:71.219.142.172">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.219.142.172_38a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.219.142.172">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 71.219.142.172 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.219.142.172.html" title="User talk:71.219.142.172">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.219.142.172_38a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.219.142.172">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>,I suspect this is from the same person that nominated quite a few other rather notable people in the field, such as Peter Carroll, as well. If so, this may perhaps be a clear <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and the user ought to be warned as such. I'm going to assume good faith on the part of the nomination, however and defend as such. Hine is well-known in occultist circles, published for at least two books by reputable publishers, and his books are located in print bookshops in addition to online ones. While that may not be a direct qualification, I think that it can be a useful adjunct to the bio policy in that if Barnes and Nobel thinks he warrents shelf-space he's probably at least notable enough. His books are also the subject of review in websites and in print. The article cites sources, and deals with an author of verifiable notability. While notability is not just in the eyes of wikipedia editors, it is also not simply in the hands of the mainstream. The fact that his writing is important only to a subculture is not an impeachment of his notability. Chaos Magic is a notable new religious/philosophical movement, and as a major writer of the field, Hine is as well. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 23:53, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - as others have said, Phil's work is seminal in chaos magic, which apparently the nominator doesn't believe in. I don't believe in Chrsitianity, but I don't go nominating Christian articles for deletion.

<p>This was originally prodded by <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">User:SkierRMH</a> with the comment "Spam, even with extensive re-writes this article is simply a long ad for a bunch of softwear". The prod was removed without comment by User:220.227.55.18 (<a href="../../../2/2/0/User_talk%7E220.227.55.18.html" title="User talk:220.227.55.18">talk</a>), an apparent single purpose account. In 220.227.55.18's defense, he left a comment on SkierRMH's talk page (since blanked) asking how/if the article could be saved. SkierRMH re-added the prod tag, which is not the right thing to do, so I've taken the article to AfD instead. It does smell somewhat spammy, and I <i>think</i> it's a not-yet-launched portal, which would fall short of our notability guidelines, but I'm not entirely sure, and I'm a little concerned about the prodder's peremptory behavior (and his spelling), so I'm not sure of my own position on this yet. Therefore, this nomination should be considered procedural (although I reserve the right to choose a side later after further study). <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 21:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fire and Ice were a short lived team in WCW. The article can't be expanded much more, and doesn't serve much purpose. There is many wrestling articles like this, so this is just the start of teams nominations. Just because they have a team name doesn't make them more notable. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A team around for only a few months can't be expanded. How hard is that to understand? The only way to expand the page is listing each and every match they were in. There is NOTHING else to add. A short lived team isn't that notable. This is an encyclopedia, not a guide to every short lived tag team that had an official team name.

<p><b>Delete</b> - although a branch of a national political party, this club itself isn't notable.

<dd>I agree, to a large extent. However, perhaps, in its establishment in the 1860s it may well be amongst the oldest Conservative groups at any University; considering there were only three universities in England at this time; Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, I do believe. I think this ought to be looked into. If not then, true, it is not notable.--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECouter-revolutionary_5112.html" title="User:Couter-revolutionary">Couter-revolutionary</a> 23:59, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. That this is a student society is not relevant. If it were notable I would advocate keeping, but it is not.

<li><b>Agree</b> that the article should be deleted, but my problem is that I was trying to edit the article but couldn't find any information about Schwartzstein from an independent, reliable source. The fact that we apparently needed to link to her WitchSchool article to "verify" that she was clergy (and I question that, because I think that if you state in an article that someone is ordained clergy, you need to specify what they are ordained clergy <i>of</i>) indicates that there is a dearth of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information here. I haven't found any independent review of the books she co-authored on a website that's not trying to sell it. I just don't know how we can do this without it turning into an advert. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMa</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 23:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The verifiable information seems to be a thimbleful at most. She's authored two books, that's verifiable, and they are published by a popular publisher of neopagan and spiritual books. They do have reviews on Amazon (the one-star review of <i>The Urban Primitive</i> is especially good reading) but that seems to be about it; not much critical reaction anywhere, and I haven't heard mention of them myself. It's also verified that she's taught a class at a spiritual festival, but that's not much; I've taught classes at equivalently sized events, and I don't consider myself notable enough for Wikipedia. Beyond that, things are only verifiable through sites she controls; her WitchVox listing (self-published ad) and her store's website. I don't think once sentence of verifiable info is enough to make a viable article. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 10:13, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was recently AfD'd and withdrawn before I could add my input, so I prodded it and it was removed citing the reason being that it is "no different from any other fictional item list". This is an unmaintainable, unsourced, unencyclopedic, potentially endless list. What makes this subject notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia? Who set the criteria to only include fictional rooms in real buildings? I don't see the usefulness of this list. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 22:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><s>*<b>Keep and Change Title</b> to something like fictional rooms in real buildings. The problem is the scope of the article is too big as it currently is. I feel like it could be useful and interesting, in case someone wants to know if a room they saw in a movie actually exists in reality. Sourcing is the problem, but that might be fixable.</s> --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 23:04, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>If you're (at least partially) talking to me, why the attitude? The reason I put "change title" in my vote is because, though I read the article and am capable of understanding the scope laid out there, I think the article could still do with a title change, I often think its a good idea for an article's purpose <i>to be clearly understandable from the title.</i> That way you know what's going on right away. The way it is, the title makes you think you are going to be reading about any fictional room in any fictional locale ever imagined, and then the first paragraph narrows it down. Why not have the scope defined from the get-go?
