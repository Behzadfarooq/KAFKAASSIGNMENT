<li>You're all being sad bastards again: If it isn't in google, it doesn't belong here, so vote for deletion. When are you sad gits going to learn that there is a large (even mildly interesting) world outside google. 15:56, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Besides, even if this article is rejected, are we going to let Wikipedia become what the ivory tower elitists want it to become? This was meant to be an open forum where anybody could add a little bit to the massive encyclopedia that was Wikipedia. If we're going to delineate what is right, and what isnt,without any clear indication, we're reverting back to exactly what we didn't want to become. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumba1xclusive_0103.html" title="User:Numba1xclusive">Numba1xclusive</a> 03:29, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My question is, no one here has a warrant to explicitly reject this post. All anybody has said is that its an apartment complex therefore its not significant. However, are you stating that an area of residence and culture is insignificant? Because if you are, thats elitist. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumba1xclusive_0103.html" title="User:Numba1xclusive">Numba1xclusive</a> 03:24, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. What the guy below said is so true. Chairboy has given no reason why this should be deleted. The only argument here is that "Google" doesn't have it. Chairboy has made this entire process entirely undemocratic, because of the way he is treating the other votes.<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumba1xclusive_0103.html" title="User:Numba1xclusive">Numba1xclusive</a> 03:09, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Your definition of notable is ambiguous and arbitrary. There is no bright line for notable, written anywhere. What I see happening here is people using Google as a method to justify. Besides that, no one else has any negative reason why this should be rejected. Unfortunately, it was in the belief that Wikipedia was an open encyclopedia that this entry was added. By rejecting this entry, you are enforcing a normative mindset, which will lead to impacts such as the destruction or political mindsets, resulting in no way for others to dissent. 12.65.42.195 01:47, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Howdy, <i>de-democratizing</i> would be more along the lines of deleting votes. Please review <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> to see why your new account is being given special attention in this VfD. It's nothing personal, just added information to make the process of coming to consensus easier. Also, nobody is suggesting that the article is 'bad' in a perjorative sense, just that the subject is not notable enough for inclusion. Please note that while there are hundreds of thousands of apartment complexes in the USA, few of them merit inclusion in an encyclopedia. I look forward to seeing you contribute to other articles, you have an obvious passion about this subject that could be used to better other things as well.

<li>Isn't that what you're doing basically, by disregarding votes, you're de-democratizing. And note, there is absolutely no brightline for notable, written anywhere. Wikipedia is an open source Encyclopedia, and by arbritrarily setting a limit for notable, leaves out an infinite number of articles that could have possible noteworthy aspects. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumba1xclusive_0103.html" title="User:Numba1xclusive">Numba1xclusive</a> 16:05, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just to be clear, It won't be Chairboy or any of us who have voted here who decides the result of the debate. It will be a neutral third-party administrator.
