<p>The <b>art of ancient Greece</b> has exercised an enormous influence on the culture of many countries from ancient times until the present, particularly in the areas of <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculpture.html" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a>. In the West, the art of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> was largely derived from Greek models. In the East, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>'s conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> cultures, resulting in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Buddhist_art_f2dc.html" title="Greco-Buddhist art">Greco-Buddhist art</a>, with ramifications as far as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Following the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanist</a> aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Well into the 19th century, the classical tradition derived from Greece dominated the art of the western world.</p>
<p>The art of Ancient Greece is usually divided stylistically into four periods: the Geometric, Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic.</p>
<p>As noted above, the Geometric age is usually dated from about <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000_BC_0f1e.html" title="1000 BC">1000 BC</a>, although in reality little is known about art in Greece during the preceding 200 years (traditionally known as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_dark_ages.html" title="Greek dark ages">Dark Ages</a>), the period of the 7th century BC witnessed the slow development of the Archaic style as exemplified by the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black-figure.html" title="Black-figure">black-figure</a> style of vase painting. The onset of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Wars_76fa.html" title="Persian Wars">Persian Wars</a> (<a href="../../../4/8/0/480_BC_198f.html" title="480 BC">480 BC</a> to <a href="../../../4/4/8/448_BC_7863.html" title="448 BC">448 BC</a>) is usually taken as the dividing line between the Archaic and the Classical periods, and the reign of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> (<a href="../../../3/3/6/336_BC_11c9.html" title="336 BC">336 BC</a> to <a href="../../../3/2/3/323_BC_3b67.html" title="323 BC">323 BC</a>) is taken as separating the Classical from the Hellenistic periods.</p>
<p>In reality, there was no sharp transition from one period to another. Forms of art developed at different speeds in different parts of the Greek world, and as in any age some artists worked in more innovative styles than others. Strong local traditions, conservative in character, and the requirements of local <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_%28religion%29.html" title="Cult (religion)">cults</a>, enable historians to locate the origins even of displaced works of art.</p>

<p>Ancient Greek art has survived most successfully in the forms of sculpture and architecture, as well as in such minor arts as <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coin.html" title="Coin">coin</a> design, <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">pottery</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemstone.html" title="Gemstone">gem</a> engraving. From the Archaic period a great deal of painted pottery survives, but these remnants give a misleading impression of the range of Greek artistic expression. The Greeks, like most European cultures, regarded painting as the highest form of art. The painter <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygnotus.html" title="Polygnotus">Polygnotus</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thasos.html" title="Thasos">Thasos</a>, who worked in the mid <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">5th century BC</a>, was regarded by later Greeks in much the same way that people today regard <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, and his works were still being admired 600 years after his death. Today none survive, even as copies.</p>
<p>Greek painters worked mainly on wooden panels, and these perished rapidly after the 4th century AD, when they were no longer actively protected. Today nothing survives of Greek painting, except some examples of painted <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_cotta.html" title="Terra cotta">terra cotta</a> and a few paintings on the walls of tombs, mostly in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28region%29.html" title="Macedonia (region)">Macedonia</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. Of the masterpieces of Greek painting we have only a few copies from Roman times, and most are of inferior quality. Painting on pottery, of which a great deal survives, gives some sense of the aesthetics of Greek painting. The techniques involved, however, were very different from those used in large-format painting.</p>
<p>Even in the fields of sculpture and architecture, only a fragment of the total output of Greek artists survives. Many sculptures of pagan gods were destroyed during the early Christian era. Unfortunately, when <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marble.html" title="Marble">marble</a> is burned, lime is produced, and that was the fate of the great bulk of Greek marble statuary during the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Likewise, the acute shortage of metal during the Middle Ages led to the majority of Greek <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze.html" title="Bronze">bronze</a> statues being melted down. Those statues which survived did so primarily because they were buried and forgotten, or in the case of bronzes, lost in the sea.</p>
<p>The great majority of Greek buildings have not survived: they were either pillaged in war, looted for building materials or destroyed in Greece’s many earthquakes. Only a handful of <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple.html" title="Temple">temples</a>, such as the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenon.html" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> and the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Hephaestus_f4f9.html" title="Temple of Hephaestus">Temple of Hephaestus</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, have been spared. Of the four <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Wonders_of_the_World_704c.html" title="Seven Wonders of the World">Wonders of the World</a> created by the Greeks (the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Zeus_at_Olympia_fc5e.html" title="Statue of Zeus at Olympia">Statue of Zeus at Olympia</a>, the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Artemis_9f12.html" title="Temple of Artemis">Temple of Artemis</a> at <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephesus.html" title="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossus_of_Rhodes_c686.html" title="Colossus of Rhodes">Colossus of Rhodes</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighthouse_of_Alexandria_2a2a.html" title="Lighthouse of Alexandria">Lighthouse of Alexandria</a>), nothing whatever survives.</p>
<p>From the Archaic period of Greek art, painted pottery and sculpture are almost the only forms of art which have survived in any quantity. Painting was in its infancy during this period, and no examples of it have survived. Although coins were invented in the mid <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century_BC_5fc0.html" title="7th century BC">7th century BC</a>, they were not common in most of Greece until the 5th century.</p>

<p>The Ancient Greeks made pottery for everyday use, not for display; the trophies won at games, such as the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panathenaic_Amphorae_17cb.html" title="Panathenaic Amphorae">Panathenaic Amphorae</a> (wine decanters), are the exception. Most surviving pottery consists of drinking vessels such as <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphora.html" title="Amphora">amphorae</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krater.html" title="Krater">kraters</a> (bowls for mixing wine and water), <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydria.html" title="Hydria">hydria</a> (water jars), libation bowls, jugs and cups. Painted funeral urns have also been found. Miniatures were also produced in large numbers, mainly for use as offerings at temples. In the Hellenistic period a wider range of pottery was produced, but most of it is of little artistic importance.</p>
<p>At the end of the Geometric phased, the Orientalizing phase of vase painting, saw the abstract geometric designs replaced by the more rounded, realistic forms of Eastern motifs, such as the lotus, palmette, lion, and sphinx. Ornament increased in amount and intricacy.</p>
<p><br />
In earlier periods even quite small Greek cities produced pottery for their own locale. These varied widely in style and standards. Distinctive pottery that ranks as art was produced on some of the <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegean_Sea_b508.html" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean</a> islands, in <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>, and in the wealthy Greek colonies of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_Graecia_cc44.html" title="Magna Graecia">southern Italy and Sicily</a>. By the later Archaic and early Classical period, however, the two great commercial powers, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinth.html" title="Corinth">Corinth</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, came to dominate. Their pottery was exported all over the Greek world, driving out the local varieties. Pots from Corinth and Athens are found as far afield as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and are so common in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> that they were first collected in the 18th century as "Etruscan vases". Many of these pots are mass-produced products of low quality. In fact, by the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">5th century BC</a>, pottery had become an industry and pottery painting ceased to be an important art form.</p>
<p>The history of Ancient Greek pottery is divided stylistically into periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <b>Protogeometric</b> from about <a href="../../../1/0/5/1050_BC_92d6.html" title="1050 BC">1050 BC</a>;</li>
<li>the <b>Geometric</b> from about <a href="../../../9/0/0/900_BC_120f.html" title="900 BC">900 BC</a>;</li>
<li>the <b>Late Geometric</b> or <b>Archaic</b> from about <a href="../../../7/5/0/750_BC_d938.html" title="750 BC">750 BC</a>;</li>
<li>the <b>Black Figure</b> from the early <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century_BC_5fc0.html" title="7th century BC">7th century BC</a>;</li>
<li>and the <b>Red Figure</b> from about <a href="../../../5/3/0/530_BC_d24f.html" title="530 BC">530 BC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The range of colours which could be used on pots was restricted by the technology of firing: black, white, red, and yellow were the most common. In the three earlier periods, the pots were left their natural light colour, and were decorated with slip that turned black in the kiln.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The fully mature <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black-figure_pottery.html" title="Black-figure pottery">black-figure technique</a>, with added red and white details and incising for outlines and details, originated in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinth.html" title="Corinth">Corinth</a> during the early 7th century BC and was introduced into Attica about a generation later; it flourished until the end of the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century_BC_8011.html" title="6th century BC">6th century BC</a>. The <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red-figure_pottery.html" title="Red-figure pottery">red-figure technique</a>, invented in about <a href="../../../5/3/0/530_BC_d24f.html" title="530 BC">530 BC</a>, reversed this tradition, with the pots being painted black and the figures painted in red. Red-figure vases slowly replaced the black-figure style. Sometimes larger vessels were engraved as well as painted. .</p>
<p>During the Protogeometric and Geometric periods, Greek pottery was decorated with abstract designs. In later periods, as the aesthetic shifted and the technical proficiency of potters improved, decorations took the form of human figures, usually representing the gods or the heroes of Greek history and mythology. Battle and hunting scenes were also popular, since they allowed the depiction of the horse, which the Greeks held in high esteem. In later periods erotic themes, both <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexual.html" title="Heterosexual">heterosexual</a> and male <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a>, became common.</p>
<p>Greek pottery is frequently signed, sometimes by the potter or the master of the pottery, but only occasionally by the painter. Hundreds of painters are, however, identifiable by their artistic personalities: where their signatures haven't survived they are named for their subject choices, as "the <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles_Painter_1096.html" title="Achilles Painter">Achilles Painter</a>", by the potter they worked for, such as the Late Archaic "<a href="../../../k/l/e/Kleophrades_Painter_8dad.html" title="Kleophrades Painter">Kleophrades Painter</a>", or even by their modern locations, such as the Late Archaic "<a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Painter_b196.html" title="Berlin Painter">Berlin Painter</a>".</p>

<p>Clay is a material frequently used for the making of votive statuettes or idols, since Minoan civilization until the Hellenistic era. During the 8th century BCE., in Boeotia, one finds manufactured “Bell Idols”, female statuettes with mobile legs: the head, small compared to the remainder of the body, is perched at the end of a long neck, while the body is very full, in the shape of bell. At the beginning of 8th century BCE., tombs known as “hero's” receive hundreds, even thousands of small figurines, with rudimentary figuration, generally representing characters with the raised arms, i.e. gods in apotheosis.</p>
<p>In later periods the terracotta figurines lose their religious nature, representing from then on characters from everyday life. With 4th and 3rd centuries BCE., figurines known as <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanagra_figurine.html" title="Tanagra figurine">Tanagra</a> show a refined art. At the same time, cities like Alexandria, Smyrna or Tarsus produced an abundance of grotesque figurines, representing individuals with deformed members, eyes bulging and contorting themselves. These figurines were also made out of bronze. Terracotta was rarely employed, however, for large statuary. The best known exception to this is a statue of Zeus carrying Ganymède to Olympus, executed around 470 BCE. In this case, the terracotta is painted.</p>

<p>Sculpture is by far the most important surviving form of Ancient Greek art, although only a small fragment of Greek sculptural output has survived. Greek sculpture, often in the form of Roman copies, was immensely influential during the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Renaissance_d53b.html" title="Italian Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a>, and remained the “classic” model for European sculpture until the advent of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernism.html" title="Modernism">modernism</a> in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Inspired by the monumental stone sculpture of Egypt and Mesopotamia, during the Archaic period the Greeks began again to carve in stone. Free-standing figures share the solidity and frontal stance characteristic of Eastern models, but their forms are more dynamic than those of Egyptian sculpture, as for example the <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_of_Auxerre_cbc3.html" title="Lady of Auxerre">Lady of Auxerre</a> and Torso of Hera (Early Archaic period, c. 660-580 bc, both in the Louvre, Paris). After about 575 BCE, figures, such as these, both male and female, were the so-called archaic smile. This expression, which has no specific appropriateness to the person or situation depicted, may have been a device to give the figures a distinctive human characteristic.</p>
<p>Three types of figures prevailed—the standing nude youth (kouros), the standing draped girl (kore), and the seated woman. All emphasize and generalize the essential features of the human figure and show an increasingly accurate comprehension of human anatomy. The youths were either sepulchral or votive statues. Examples are Apollo (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an early work; the Strangford Apollo from Límnos (British Museum, London), a much later work; and the Anavyssos Kouros (National Archaeological Museum, Athens). More of the musculature and skeletal structure is visible in this statue than in earlier works. The standing, draped girls have a wide range of expression, as in the sculptures in the Acropolis Museum, Athens. Their drapery is carved and painted with the delicacy and meticulousness common in the details of sculpture of this period.</p>
<p>The Greeks thus decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour. Seeing their gods as having human form, there was no distinction between the sacred and the secular in art—the human body was both secular and sacred. A male nude could just as easily be <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heracles.html" title="Heracles">Herakles</a> or that year's Olympic boxing champion. In the Archaic Period the most important sculptural form was the <a href="../../../k/o/u/Kouros.html" title="Kouros">kouros</a> (plural <i>kouroi</i>), the standing male nude (See for example <a href="../../../k/l/e/Kleobis_and_Biton_04e0.html" title="Kleobis and Biton">Biton and Kleobis</a>). The <a href="../../../k/o/r/Kore_%28sculpture%29.html" title="Kore (sculpture)">kore</a> (plural <i>korai</i>), or standing clothed female figure, was also common, but since Greek society did not permit the public display of female nudity until the 4th century BC, the kore is considered to be of less importance in the development of sculpture.</p>
<p>As with pottery, the Greeks did not produce sculpture merely for artistic display. Statues were commissioned either by aristocratic individuals or by the state, and used for public memorials, as offerings to temples, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle.html" title="Oracle">oracles</a> and sanctuaries (as is frequently shown by inscriptions on the statues), or as markers for graves. Statues in the Archaic period were not all intended to represent specific individuals. They were depictions of an ideal — beauty, piety, honor or sacrifice. These were always depictions of young men, ranging in age from adolescence to early maturity, even when placed on the graves of (presumably) elderly citizens. <i>Kouroi</i> were all stylistically similar. Gradations in the social stature of the person commissioning the statue were indicated by size rather than artistic innovation.</p>

<p>In the Classical period there was a revolution in Greek statuary, usually associated with the introduction of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athenian_democracy.html" title="Athenian democracy">democracy</a> and the end of the aristocratic culture associated with the <i>kouroi</i>. The Classical period saw changes in the style and function of sculpture. Poses became more naturalistic (see the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charioteer_of_Delphi_d134.html" title="Charioteer of Delphi">Charioteer of Delphi</a> for an example of the transition to more naturalistic sculpture), and the technical skill of Greek sculptors in depicting the human form in a variety of poses greatly increased. From about <a href="../../../5/0/0/500_BC_5eed.html" title="500 BC">500 BC</a> statues began to depict real people. The statues of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmodius_and_Aristogeiton_%28sculpture%29_6291.html" title="Harmodius and Aristogeiton (sculpture)">Harmodius and Aristogeiton</a> set up in Athens to mark the overthrow of the <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrant.html" title="Tyrant">tyranny</a> were said to be the first public monuments to actual people.</p>
<p>At the same time sculpture and statues were put to wider uses. The great temples of the Classical era such as the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenon.html" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> in Athens, and the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Zeus_097c.html" title="Temple of Zeus">Temple of Zeus</a> at Olympia, required relief sculpture for decorative <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frieze.html" title="Frieze">friezes</a>, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pediment.html" title="Pediment">pediments</a>. The difficult aesthetic and technical challenge stimulated much in the way of sculptural innovation. Unfortunately these works survive only in fragments, the most famous of which are the <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Marbles_d588.html" title="Elgin Marbles">Parthenon Marbles</a>, half of which are in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>.</p>

<p>Funeral statuary evolved during this period from the rigid and impersonal kouros of the Archaic period to the highly personal family groups of the Classical period. These monuments are commonly found in the suburbs of Athens, which in ancient times were cemeteries on the outskirts of the city. Although some of them depict "ideal" types — the mourning mother, the dutiful son — they increasingly depicted real people, typically showing the departed taking his dignified leave from his family. They are among the most intimate and affecting remains of the Ancient Greeks.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the Classical period for the first time we know the names of individual sculptors. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phidias.html" title="Phidias">Phidias</a> oversaw the design and building of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenon.html" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praxiteles.html" title="Praxiteles">Praxiteles</a> made the female nude respectable for the first time in the Late Classical period (mid 4th century): his <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphrodite_of_Knidos_da4a.html" title="Aphrodite of Knidos">Aphrodite of Knidos</a>, which survives in copies, was said by <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny</a> to be the greatest statue in the world.</p>

Their size and magnificence prompted emperors to seize them in the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> period, and both were removed to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, where they were later destroyed in fires.</p>

<p>Thus Greek art became more diverse and more influenced by the cultures of the peoples drawn into the Greek orbit. In the view of most art historians, it also declined in quality and originality; this, however, is a subjective judgement which artists and art-lovers of the time would not have shared. New centres of Greek culture, particularly in sculpture, developed in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antioch.html" title="Antioch">Antioch</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pergamum.html" title="Pergamum">Pergamum</a>, and other cities. By the 2nd century the rising power of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a> had also absorbed much of the Greek tradition — and an increasing proportion of its products as well.</p>
<p>During this period sculpture became more and more naturalistic. Common people, women, children, animals and domestic scenes became acceptable subjects for sculpture, which was commissioned by wealthy families for the adornment of their homes and gardens. Realistic portraits of men and women of all ages were produced, and sculptors no longer felt obliged to depict people as ideals of beauty or physical perfection. At the same time, the new Hellenistic cities springing up all over <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> required statues depicting the gods and heroes of Greece for their temples and public places. This made sculpture, like pottery, an industry, with the consequent standardisation and some lowering of quality. For these reasons many more Hellenistic statues have survived than is the case with the Classical period.</p>
<p>Some of the best known Hellenistic sculptures are the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winged_Victory_of_Samothrace_7060.html" title="Winged Victory of Samothrace">Winged Victory of Samothrace</a> (2nd or 1st century BC), the statue of <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphrodite.html" title="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> from the island of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melos.html" title="Melos">Melos</a> known as the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_de_Milo_d280.html" title="Venus de Milo">Venus de Milo</a> (mid 2nd century BC), the <a href="../../../d/y/i/Dying_Gaul_87d9.html" title="Dying Gaul">Dying Gaul</a> (about <a href="../../../2/3/0/230_BC_2147.html" title="230 BC">230 BC</a>), and the monumental group <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laoco%C3%B6n_and_his_Sons_8421.html" title="Laocoön and his Sons">Laocoön and his Sons</a> (late 1st century BC). All these statues depict Classical themes, but their treatment is far more sensuous and emotional than the austere taste of the Classical period would have allowed or its technical skills permitted.</p>
<p>Discoveries made since the end of the 19th century surrounding the (now submerged) <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> city of Heracleum include a <a href="../../../3/0/0/300s_BC_daae.html" title="300s BC">4th century BC</a>, unusually sensual, detailed and feministic (as opposed to deified) depiction of <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isis.html" title="Isis">Isis</a>, marking a combination of Egyptian and Hellenistic forms beginning around the time of Egypt's conquest by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>.</p>
<p>Hellenistic sculpture was also marked by an increase in scale, which culminated in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossus_of_Rhodes_c686.html" title="Colossus of Rhodes">Colossus of Rhodes</a> (late 3rd century), which was the same size as the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Liberty_c55e.html" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. The combined effect of earthquakes and looting have destroyed this as well as other very large works of this period.</p>

<p>Architecture (building executed to an aesthetically considered design) was extinct in Greece from the end of the <a href="../../../m/y/c/Mycenaean_Greece_e72d.html" title="Mycenaean Greece">Mycenaean</a> period (about <a href="../../../1/2/0/1200_BC_8f1b.html" title="1200 BC">1200 BC</a>) until the 7th century, when urban life and prosperity recovered to a point where public building could be undertaken. But since most Greek buildings in the Archaic and Early Classical periods were made of wood or mud-brick, nothing remains of them except a few ground-plans, and there are almost no written sources on early architecture or descriptions of buildings. Most of our knowledge of Greek architecture comes from the few surviving buildings of the Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods (since Roman architecture heavily copied Greek), and from late written sources such as <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitruvius.html" title="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> (1st century AD). This means that there is a strong bias towards temples, the only buildings which survive in any number.</p>
<p>The standard format of I.C.P Greek public buildings is well known from surviving examples such as the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenon.html" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, and even more so from Roman buildings built partly on the Greek model, such as the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheon%2C_Rome_03df.html" title="Pantheon, Rome">Pantheon</a> in Rome. The building was usually either a cube or a rectangle made from <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limestone.html" title="Limestone">limestone</a>, of which Greece has an abundance, and which was cut into large blocks and dressed. Marble was an expensive building material in Greece: high quality marble came only from Mt Pentelus in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attica.html" title="Attica">Attica</a> and from a few islands such as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paros.html" title="Paros">Paros</a>, and its transportation in large blocks was difficult. It was used mainly for sculptural decoration, not structurally, except in the very grandest buildings of the Classical period such as the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenon.html" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>.</p>
<p>There were two main styles (or "orders") of I.C.P. Greek architecture, the <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doric_order.html" title="Doric order">Doric</a> and the <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionic_order.html" title="Ionic order">Ionic</a>. These names were used by the Greeks themselves, and reflected their belief that the styles descended from the Dorian and Ionian Greeks of the Dark Ages, but this is unlikely to be true. The Doric style was used in mainland Greece and spread from there to the Greek colonies in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. The Ionic style was used in the cities of Ionia (now the west coast of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>) and some of the Aegean islands. The Doric style was more formal and austere, the Ionic more relaxed and decorative. The more ornate <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinthian_order.html" title="Corinthian order">Corinthian</a> style was a later development of the Ionic. These styles are best known through the three orders of column capitals, but there are differences in most points of design and decoration between the orders. See the separate article on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_orders.html" title="Classical orders">Classical orders</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the best known surviving Greek buildings, such as the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenon.html" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> and the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Hephaestus_f4f9.html" title="Temple of Hephaestus">Temple of Hephaestus</a> in Athens, are Doric. The <a href="../../../e/r/e/Erechtheum.html" title="Erechtheum">Erechtheum</a>, next to the Parthenon, however, is Ionic. The Ionic order became dominant in the Hellenistic period, since its more decorative style suited the aesthetic of the period better than the more restrained Doric. Some of the best surviving Hellenistic buildings, such as the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Celsus_88c1.html" title="Library of Celsus">Library of Celsus</a>, can be seen in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, at cities such as <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephesus.html" title="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pergamum.html" title="Pergamum">Pergamum</a>. But in the greatest of Hellenistic cities, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, almost nothing survives.</p>

<p>Coins were invented in <a href="../../../l/y/d/Lydia.html" title="Lydia">Lydia</a> in the 7th century, but they were first extensively used by the Greeks, and the Greeks set the canon of coin design which has been followed ever since. Coin design today still recognisably follows patterns descended from Ancient Greece. The Greeks did not see coin design as a major art form, but the durability and abundance of coins have made them one of the most important sources of knowledge about Greek aesthetics. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_coins.html" title="Greek coins">Greek coins</a> are, incidentally, the only art form from the ancient Greek world which can still be bought and owned by private collectors of modest means.</p>
<p>Greek designers began the practice of putting a profile portrait on the obverse of coins. This was initially a symbolic portrait of the patron god or goddess of the city issuing the coin: <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athena.html" title="Athena">Athena</a> for <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> at <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinth.html" title="Corinth">Corinth</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demeter.html" title="Demeter">Demeter</a> at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes_%28Greece%29_0c1f.html" title="Thebes (Greece)">Thebes</a> and so on. Later, heads of heroes of Greek mythology were used. Greek cities in Italy such as <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_Italy_db3e.html" title="Syracuse, Italy">Syracuse</a> began to put the heads of real people on coins in the 4th century BC, and the Hellenistic kings of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> were soon putting their own heads on their coins. On the reverse of their coins the Greek cities often put a symbol of the city: an owl for Athens, a dolphin for Syracuse and so on. The placing of inscriptions on coins also began in Greek times. All these customs were later refined and developed by the Romans.</p>
