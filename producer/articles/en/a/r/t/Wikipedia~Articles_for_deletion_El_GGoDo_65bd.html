<li><b>Comment</b> from what's in the page, it seems to have some kind of notability, but the only thing here that seems verifiable is <a href="http://www.catedraldeleon.org/sub2/sub219/frpalarte20.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.catedraldeleon.org/sub2/sub219/frpalarte20.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I do wish we had more to go on. He may have published two books, and he may have had some major exhibitions, but I can't tell for sure, so like Paolo, I won't vote yet. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 00:00, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The reason I believe there are not more entries about him on the web is that the people who know him are not web literate; i.e. they can not respond to this comment. This entry in Wikipedia is intended to bring El GGoDo to a wider audience and encourage debate and discussion; though he is noteworthy - he is a private man and I suppose this may be against him. Regards, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 08:19, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> His 1991 book is available for hire from some Spanish libraries and from the Bayside City Library (<a href="http://www.bayside.vic.gov.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.bayside.vic.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bayside.vic.gov.au/</a> see under "services" then "library" and then search for "elggodo" and you will see the book is available for hire and therefore exists. You can of course check with the publishers....</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You could also telephone the Telediario de Leon (<a href="http://www.diariodeleon.es" class="external free" title="http://www.diariodeleon.es" rel="nofollow">http://www.diariodeleon.es</a>, Telephone details can be found on the website) and get more background detail about El GGoDo and his life - invite them to comment perhaps on Wikipedia. Hope this helps with what to go on. Cheers, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 08:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> to Alex@elggodo.net. Unless a consensus developes to delete, the article will stay. Articles do need to be verifiable, and it is very hard for those of us in English-speaking countries to verify this. Is there an article on this artist in the Spanish language Wikipedia? - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 11:28, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Comment to Dalbury. No, there is no Spanish version yet - my first language is English (Australian) and the Spanish I know is pretty rough. However, his 1979 catalogue and 1991 book are in several languages; just look at the quality of his artwork<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 22:27, 13 November 2005 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Discussion</b>. The fellow is real enough. <a href="http://www.elggodo.net/imagelib/sitebuilder/misc/show_image.html?linkedwidth=actual&amp;linkpath=http://members.tripod.com/eu_art/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/diario_de_leon_oct_03_pg14.jpg&amp;target=tlx_new" class="external text" title="http://www.elggodo.net/imagelib/sitebuilder/misc/show_image.html?linkedwidth=actual&amp;linkpath=http://members.tripod.com/eu_art/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/diario_de_leon_oct_03_pg14.jpg&amp;target=tlx_new" rel="nofollow">This link</a> is about his latest painting and provides some sketchy biographical details (second paragraph, e.g. where he came from, the fact that he didn't want to work in the coal mines, where his name comes from etc...). Also, the book that is scanned in has a preface by Jose Camon Aznar, professor (I think) at Univ. Autonoma (Madrid). However, all that said, this is an artist of very, very local reputation. I don't think you could even go so far as to contend that his reputation in Leon is particularly significant, let alone outside of the city. I am in Madrid and a quick (granted wholly unscientific) poll has found no-one here who has ever heard of him. Finally, per the <a href="http://www.elggodo.net/es/id1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.elggodo.net/es/id1.html" rel="nofollow">website</a>, unless <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> had a translation done for the site, his Spanish should be more than good enough to put up a site on the Spanish WP. Which makes me a bit suspicious of the comment above. Also, could you clarify the relationship? Are you the grandson? I'll abstain voting for now. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 15:47, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> one of my reasons for abstain as well is that, beside what's in the web site <a href="http://www.elggodo.net" class="external free" title="http://www.elggodo.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.elggodo.net</a>, there are few other references about him in the Web. One seems particularly promising: <a href="http://www.museum.ru/gmii/cafer_old.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.museum.ru/gmii/cafer_old.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. His name mentioned here seems to support the fact that he donated something to Russian musemus, confirming written in the article. The block of text in the linked page reads (thanks to Altavista):
<blockquote>
<p>We will be grateful for your opinion about the site and for the opinions about our museum: you will estimate, if you please, exposures, exhibition, excursion, lecture, occupation in the circles, concerts, scientific activity, conference, publication, the care of visitors. Unfortunately, museum does not have a possibility to answer the questions, which emerge beyond the framework of the designated thematics. You can present the question into the conference: Museum cafe. Examination on THE INTERNET museum does not produce, slides and electron images it does not send.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the son of Pedro Rodriguez Fuertes ("El GGoDo"), however at birth I was taken away by my mother (Sue Alexander) to Australia. Part of the story can be found here: <a href="http://www.elggodo.net/en/id1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.elggodo.net/en/id1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elggodo.net/en/id1.html</a>. Because of the distance and my poor Spanish over the years I have had a different type of relationship with my father; than most families. Nevertheless, it greatly improved through the use of modern technologies and the creation of the website ElGGoDo.net; where we can both share in each others stories. Although, he is my father, I am able to be very objective about the quality of his work as a result of our unique realtionship. If anyone here is interested in Art then I believe if you saw his work you would see that he indeed has genius: I think this photo say it all: <a href="http://www.elggodo.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/elggodo_with_clay.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.elggodo.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/elggodo_with_clay.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.elggodo.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/elggodo_with_clay.jpg</a> (the clay picture - has a double meaning, I believe it is also a protest against bullfighting)</li>
</ul>
<p>And thanks for the hint about the Prof above I will see if I can get him to comment here <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 00:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC).</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> in 1999 when I was last in Madrid this restaurant had number of ElGGoDo's great works in the restaurant. The address is:</p>
<p>Restaurante CARTA MARINA Tipo: Restaurante Cocina Gallega Dirección Padre Damián, 40 Provincia: Madrid Localidad: Madrid Zona: Tetuán Metro: Cuzco Telf: 914586826/ Precio: Aprox. de 45 a 60 €. Especialidad: Pescados .</p>
<p>Perhaps if you have time you could check this out as well. In the meantime I will see if I can get in contact with that Prof 155.143.63.97 10:18, 15 November 2005 (UTC). Note: This is no ordinary restaurant it is a celebration of three forms of art (Food, Painting and Interior Design) and a hommage to El.GGoDo.<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 22:05, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the clarification. Having reviewed the information, my belief is that this fellow is simply not notable enough to warrant an entry. He has practically no web presence - which means that he is unlikely to have been featured in exhibitions which invariably leave some webprint behind. The fact that the article is authored by his son does not assuage concerns that he is unnotable. And I can find no-one in the country who has heard of him. I wish you the best of luck in helping spread his reputation. Wikipedia, however, is not a venue for promotion. I vote therefore to <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 10:45, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> It is true recently he has not had an exhibition. But as good as you exist he has exhibited on a number of occasions. The fact that he does not have a web presence does not mean he is not a notable artist; it simply means that he is not a generation X, Y; but rather before. On another note I have just tried to email Jose Camon Aznar to see if he can add an entry he in support of El GGoDo; hopefully, you can wait a bit longer. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 155.143.63.97 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.143.63.97_7ef2.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.143.63.97">contribs</a>) 11:19, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</small> Sorry, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 22:01, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the fact that your father is not part of the internet generation is not germane. Neither is Antonio Martínez Mengual, yet a google search turns up <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Antonio+Mart%C3%ADnez+Mengual%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Antonio+Mart%C3%ADnez+Mengual%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">900</a> entries. Notable artists generate web presence through expositions, gallery showings, etc....

<li><b>Delete</b>. Time to decide. I see no evidence in all this discussion that he meets the criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> [[User_talk:Dalbury|(talk)]] 11:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Comment to Dalbury. This is the criteria: Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field. Well, his painting is in the famous Cathedral of Leon, so it will endure for near eternity in the historical record of the province of Leon Spain. Leon, is an important province in the history of Spain...</li>
