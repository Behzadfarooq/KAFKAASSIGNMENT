<li><b>delete</b> The original incarnation of this article was a copyvio but it appears this version is not. I did a fair amount of Google checking and this looks like non-copyvio text. I'm not sure BY passes the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUS_d39c.html" title="WP:MUS">WP:MUS</a> criteria, but from the Google searches it does appear that he passes general notability and verifiability criteria. If the copyvio has really been solved, then I think there'd be enough interest in the article to make it worth keeping. I do agree it needs to cite sources --- but that can be fixed <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 17:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)btball</li>

<dd>Changing my vote to delete based on author's comment below that clearly indicates that this is an autobiography. I'll add the relevant policy links to his talk page so that he can find an appropriate way to get an article about himself published here ... <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 18:54, 16 July 2006 (UTC)btball</dd>

<dd>Yes, you're right - I was giving the second the benefit of the doubt based on an assertion on one of the sites that BY was a professor of music --- going back and looking at the pictures makes me think I need my glasses changed&#160;:-) I already changed my keep to delete - based on it being an autobiography - now I'm convinced of the lack of verifiable notability as well ... <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 05:58, 17 July 2006 (UTC)btball</dd>

<p>Question? On my page, yes I have many links on my own pages abou t myself, I re-wrote this as tastefully and truthfully as I could, can this be put up or edited without deletion please? I have not promoted, spammed, just kept it straight. There are certain things here THAT ARE NOT VERIFIABLE, for instance my playing giutar with Inner Circle for 2 years 1985-1987 I was never given credit That IS WHY i left the band&gt; most people however know I did, I could really care less since I wasn't treated fairly by the band, so I just mention it because it was a well known diversified band that I did play with and recorded on their albums. What needs changed please? AND IF you take a look at Bruce Hornsbys' site ( association on my site) you will see there are links and many artist put their linkjs, I am reluctant to do this seems everytime I may do something I am up for deletion, warm me please what I should do Thank you Billy Yeager <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mograbber (<a href="../../../m/o/g/User_talk%7EMograbber_c288.html" title="User talk:Mograbber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mograbber_b0ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mograbber">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Brian's 3 sites: Sites 1 &amp; 3 are artist self-promotion sites (2 is the wrong person).

<p>"ATTENTION PLEASE" i CLICKED into the above Film Festivals, they are not posted here at wiki I noticed does this mean I cannot list them on my bio? Should, I , or someone else put some basic info up about the film festivals? Will someone please address myself to let me know what I can do to fix this? Instead of addressimg me between yourselves as if I don't exsist. I am reading alot of rules and info, adhereing to them I agree with them, this is my bio, all true, not hawking products, not spamming, just who I am and what I have done. This is a great place AND I DO NOT INTEND TO BE COMING BACK AND RE-EDITING MY INFO TO PROMOTE MY SITE ALTHOUGH I NOTICE THERE IS A PLACE FOR LINKS ON THAT. Just want to get it up and be done with it, it will help me for press articles that need some basic information on myself which they always get wrong. Things such as Bunny is my mother, she is not she is my aunt, dates on my films, how exactly my contact with Bruce came about and what exactly happened this is all basic info. Seriously, look at some other artist sites out here, it is quit silly, Billy Bob about his mental disorders???

<li>No, that would not work either - it would be deleted as non-notable biography ... and even if verifiable notability was established, it is still *autobiography* - I already posted the links to Wikipedia policy about biography and autobiography on your talk page.
