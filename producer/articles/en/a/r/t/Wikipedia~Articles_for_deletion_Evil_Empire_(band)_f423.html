<p>As I've made clear elsewhere, I'm fine with the concept of self-published. However, has this band had any radio play or significant club appearances or press? Sales over a small number of privately sold copies? They're on Amazon with a sales rank of ZERO. Their site isn't even a direct URL--it's a free hosting. If not, they're not notable enough to have an entry. It would fall under the category of "Self promotion."<a href="../../../m/z/m/User%7EMzmadmike_686e.html" title="User:Mzmadmike">Mzmadmike</a> 13:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)mzmadmike</p>
<p>I agree, obvious self-promoting "vanity article". --PhoenixVTam 19:05, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per apparent failure of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>; it also appears to be <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html#Self-promotion" title="WP:COI">self-promoting in a way</a> as well. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyraVixen_2190.html" title="User:KyraVixen">Kyra</a><sub><a href="../../../k/y/r/User_talk%7EKyraVixen_ac0e.html" title="User talk:KyraVixen">~(talk)</a></sub> 22:09, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe anyone from the band created this entry, but it may be (as mentioned above) a form of promotion. On the contrary, the band has founded a mind-blowing style, almost a genre, that is just in it's beginning stages. This may of interest to someone. Whether or not they're approved of by the Wikipedia staff makes no difference to their uprising. No, they don't usually play at overpriced 21 and up venues or clubs, rather in basements or bars. They play for mainly underground, all-ages audiences that are the Chicago suburbs area punk scene. Their popularity is gaining across the US, the UK, Japan, Austria, and probably some other countries- just in a very underground way, and they cannot play in these areas. Delete this entry if you so desire, but only if it is breaking some sort of Wikipedia law, do not discriminate. It is a guarantee that this article will re-appear in the near or distant future, due to the band's (and the scene's) rising underground reputation. (This was unsigned)</p>
<p>++++++++ Without rancor, let me point out that EVERY band believes this to be the case. Can you list some articles in zines of some kind, industry commentary, sales numbers, anything? If they're so underground they don't have notice, they are, by definition, not something to be listed in an encyclopedia. I get less than 400 Ghits once I remove "Rage Against the Machine" who had an album of that name, Wiki's references and duplicates. Everything I see is myspace and blog references. A Wiki article needs references to support it.<a href="../../../m/z/m/User%7EMzmadmike_686e.html" title="User:Mzmadmike">Mzmadmike</a> 03:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. When their "rising underground reputation" results in actual sources that meet guidelines, then the article can be recreated. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 03:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the problem is that most of the articles or pages put up that are promoting Evil Empire are by the band themselves, and they haven't had anyone make a page or article for them, until now (unless this wiki entry is made by the band as well). I found one page, but it's in Japanese, and it doesn't translate well. But, if self-promotion is how the band wants to do it, it's all their choice, I know for a fact that they are ok with people promoting them, and PEOPLE have, just not many online writers that are in some authoritative position to write about them. They have most-likely been in their local newspaper as high-schoolers. I'm not really trying to keep this article from being deleted, I'm just stating some facts and trying to point out that they are very popular to punk scenes around the country, despite their lack of corporate sponsorship or online reviews. And, I would really appreciate it if I was talked to as a normal person, rather than mocked and talked down to, thanks. Sorry I'm not educated on how to sign things or use Wikipedia code.</p>

<dd>Nobody is saying that there is a problem with self-promotion. However, Wikipedia has policies that all subjects must be notable. Bands that lack any reputable sources attesting to notability do not meet article guidelines. For more information, please see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. While there are many outlets for self-promotion, Wikipedia isn't one of them. It isn't appropriate to use a Wikipedia page to help establish notability. I'm sorry you feel as if people are talking down to you. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 05:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noted the "unsigned" merely to separate it from my response. I'm rough with the code myself. No offense was intended.<a href="../../../m/z/m/User%7EMzmadmike_686e.html" title="User:Mzmadmike">Mzmadmike</a> 06:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>DELETE! As a member of the band I feel it should be deleted. No one in the band wrote it and I agree it is not a subject for an encyclopedia.</p>
