<p>This event is not notable enough for a separate article. In fact, it probably isn't notable at all as the publicity from it lasted for about a week. At most, it might get a mention in a trivia section on GWB's page (much like his father's vomit episode in Japan has on GHWB's page), but again, I don't think the bike accident is worthy of any mention. <a href="../../../c/j/o/User%7ECjosefy_550b.html" title="User:Cjosefy">Cjosefy</a> 05:49, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - a clear case of "recentitis". No one is going to care about this next month, much less for posterity.

<li>I disagree with that. The Cheney incident is slighty more notable because he shot someone, but it still doesn't need a huge article with 61 sources (as it is now). I would like to see this NN minutia purged from Wikipedia. Plus, the connection drawn between the two articles is VERY weak and is probably POV. <a href="../../../c/j/o/User%7ECjosefy_550b.html" title="User:Cjosefy">Cjosefy</a> 07:12, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> We don't need an encyclopedia article for every hiccup by every world leader. Gerald ford fell several times, even leading to regular skits about the falls by Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live. That might be a better candidate. Is there an article for John Kennedy's sore back? Eisenhower's heart attack? If so there should not be. There would not in a real encyclopedia. If the episode is of some llight significance, add a sentence to the GE Bush article.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:11, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As the article's creator you can consider me slightly biased, but it did trigger two cycles of newscoverage, effectively dominating the coverage of the G8 summit the first time, and then another flurry when the police report came out. Notability does not come and go, if Bush's hiccups or Gerald Ford's falls got <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Bush+bicycle+accident+scotland&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Bush+bicycle+accident+scotland&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">284,000 google hits</a>, then we should probably have an article about them as well. What about merging this into an article for all of Bush's bicycle accidents—he's had nearly a dozen, all of which get some news coverage, although this is probably the most notable, save the one at his ranch during the Sheehan thing. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 16:29, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps if Google was around back during the Ford administration, then this would be a valid argument. He is the CURRENT President, so it is no surpise that it gets a lot of hits. Do you honestly think this will be remembered in 20 years? Can you honestly say notability doesn't come in go (especially when you use Google as the measure)? <a href="../../../c/j/o/User%7ECjosefy_550b.html" title="User:Cjosefy">Cjosefy</a> 15:36, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. I can honestly say that for the purposes of WP, notability does not come and go. It's a shame that there was net less media back during the Ford Administration, in my opinion. That doesn't mean that we should censor present events in proportion to the increase in media coverage from notable and verifiable sources. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 18:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, if there was Google back during Fords admin, then you'd want an article on him being clumsy? This is ridiculous. We don't need a detailed account of every tiny thing the President does. You can find many news articles on every single daily activity of the President. Do we need articles for every banquet he attends, speech he gives, or jog he takes? Maybe we do because there is no shortage or verifiable sources that report on these things. <a href="../../../c/j/o/User%7ECjosefy_550b.html" title="User:Cjosefy">Cjosefy</a> 20:30, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're just wrong. Things only get picked up by multiple media sources when they are notable.

<ul>
<li>OK. I look forward to your article on when he choked on a pretzel, or perhaps the medical results from his colonoscopy. It seems naive to think that only notable events get picked up by multiple news sources. Do we want articles on every flash in the pan news story? Surely you admit that every week plenty of stories get picked up all over the country, and the world that are big for a week and then go away.
