<dd>In fact, the notability of this band is likely focused in the Basque Country, which is not an independent nation. The criteria for national notability (charts, etc.) thus may not be met here. However, the Basques could be considered a specific ethnic, cultural and national entity (and in this case notability within the Basque Country could suffice to meet <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>). Otherwise all bands singing in Basque would become inherently non-notable just because they are not notable Spain-wide. I think that this perspective should be debated. --<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 22:08, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK: Assuming, <i>arguendo</i>, we treat the Basque Country as a country for the purposes of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, what <i>specific criterion</i> of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> do they meet, and are there <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for it? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not sourced, but the article claims that members of the band went on to play with a series of other bands, the first one of which appears to be relatively notable. Additionally, an argument could be made that the band is representative of a particular regional scene (that of the Basque Country). That said, the lack of sources for either claim is problematic, and I think whatever comes up is going to be in Basque. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because the article claims something means nothing without sources. In addition the links provided by Husond are not in English, so maybe this article belongs in the Spanish wikipedia but certainly not here. It simply must produce sources. If no one is interested in this article enough to find reasonable sources, it should be deleted. i can see its been a redlink on the disambig page for a long time and no one has stepped up to state its case for many months. the logical thing is to merge its content into <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negu_Gorriak_df32.html" title="Negu Gorriak">Negu Gorriak</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnasweden_24e8.html" title="User:Annasweden">Annasweden</a> 23:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, most websites are private, I think that references on them should only be discredited when they're clearly spammy.

Any search for "Mikel Abrego"+"B.A.P."+"Negu Gorriak" on Google retrieves hundreds of references that confirm that Mikel Abrego joined notable band <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negu_Gorriak_df32.html" title="Negu Gorriak">Negu Gorriak</a>, this is virtually impossible to contest.

<dd>You seem to drop many WP articles that are irrelevant. What has to do Assume Good Faih and No Personal Attacks in this discussion? The only relevant page you mentioned is Deletion Policy and the article does not meet the criteria there: it's not vanity nor publicity article but one on cultural history. In fact the article has no relation with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, where the policies for deletion direct too. So I understand that you are being very subjective here.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> says:

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Having followed the debate, I'm willing to put my neck on the line and say that the band seems to just sneak over the line as far as notability is concerned, given what Husond has tirelessly located. It's not much, but it just does it for me. Arguing that non-English sources are somehow less than English ones is a nonce argument, since a Basque rock group is always going to generate more information in Basque (and probably in Spanish) than in English. Yes, I'd love to see more sources in English too, but I'm also prepared to accept <i>any</i> sources. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:37, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You should carefully review the discussion before presenting such a deviant position. The notability is not only existent as it is also confirmed with sources conforming to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>The article's standing is not improved by Husond's personal attacks on those who speak for deletion. I have read the record and i object to my views being termed "deviant". The article's subject is clearly not notable; in fact, the article text makes no assertion of natability. In addition i dont find one google hit in english on this subject. If you read the one link given in the article you will find a brief reference to BAP somewhat far down in the text, and the implication is that the website thinks the band exists, when it is defunct. Thus the source is proven to be not only out of date but inaccurate; moreover, this source doesnt qualify as a reliable source per wikipedia standards. Upon re-reading the article the word "vanity" calls out. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcdoc_acfe.html" title="User:Cdcdoc">Cdcdoc</a> 02:59, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please do not deem my objection to your objections as "personal attacks". I have a strict policy against personal attacks and I don't think that your accusation is even close to plausible. In order to find Google hits related to this band you must narrow your search by adding related words such as band/basque/euskal/etc. That will provide you with a vast array of results. The fact that the band is defunct does not strip it (nor any other band) from notability. Once again I recommend that you carefully read the discussion and realize that the band is notable at least for the fact that one of its members later joined a notable band (as per <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>).--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 03:38, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL - So you are somehow calling me vane (by arguing that my work is an act of vanity, like if I had anything to do with BAP! apart of having enjoyed their music) and you don't tolerate that Husönd considers your opinions deviant (I think he meant <i>dissident</i>, but anyhow). As long as we a re talking about each other opinions or actions there are no personal attacks. We are pondering not each other's essential qualities but our respective acts. If you say that something I've said is false, you are not necessarily calling me a liar, you are just saying that I've comitted an error. If You think my stub is "vane", I hope that you are not calling me that, just this specific act. If I wrote that Annasweden's decission of submitting the article for deletion was capricious and felt my effort sabotaged, I'm not implying that she is a capricious person or a saboteur.</dd>
<dd>Let's stay cool and accept the criticisms to our actions as what they are opinions, and opinions not on ourselves but on some of our acts. That's all.</dd>
<dd>(And, yes, the online sources are obsolete. That's a pity but I still don't think it justifies the deletion. I could create a page in my geocities site on them... but that would be really an act of vanity.
