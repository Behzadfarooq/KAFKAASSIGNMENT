<li>You delete the article -- so that the current stuff isn't available in the history -- then recreate it as a redirect. In point of fact, after a delete, anyone would be free to create the redirect as a purely editorial decision; thus, it would be helpful if everybody specifying "redirect" would clarify if they really thought leaving the current article available in the history was a good idea. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:08, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> 22 DVDs at as mainstream an outlet as Amazon is not notable? How many <i>American</i> adult models can claim 22 DVDs at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble and Waldenbooks combined? To apply the 100-film <i>American</i> test to models from other countries is to ensure a clear cultural bias at Wikipedia. To now make them pass tests not even <i>American</i> actor/models can pass is to blatantly attempt to censor Wikipedia of Japanese models. As I have stated before, if this model is not qualified for a stand-alone article, she certainly qualifies for a mention at a List of Japanese female porn stars. However, the nominating editor also nominated that list for deletion, and ensured its deletion by deceptive means. He first edited that extensive list of models who had no article (and probably did not need them), down to a list of only models who had articles and stated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Japanese_female_porn_stars" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Japanese_female_porn_stars" rel="nofollow">here</a> that "This list really does not serve any purpose. That's what Categories are for. In fact there is a Category:Japanese_porn_stars." He is now systematically de-populating that category.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know how many times I must tell you to assume good faith. All articles that get deleted are deleted through the AfD process. I do not delete the articles. Editors vote and discuss, and eventually an admin deletes the article if s/he deems it should be deleted. Non-notable porn actresses should not have articles on WP. It's a simple matter. This person, <b>even in Japan</b>, has starred in a very small number of non-notable porn movies, have received no awards, no notable magazine appearance, no mainstream work, etc etc. Not all porn actresses are notable, no matter what culture or what country they are from. WP should not act as a porn directory with an indiscriminate list of unknown porn actresses. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 17:53, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> To make my vote clear: I do not believe every model/actress deserves her own article. That's what lists are for, and 22 DVDs at Amazon certainly qualifies for a listing at List of Japanese female porn stars. However, that extensive list of names mostly with no articles (and not qualifying for them, hence the need for the list) was deleted with a statement implying a category (i.e. individual articles) would serve in its place. Now the category is being systematically depopulated. The options seem to be: 1) re-instate the list, and delete individual articles not meeting notability, 2) keep the individual articles, or 3) openly state Wikipedia is being censored of Japanese actress/model names. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:25, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That list ultimately got deleted because the overwhelming majority of the names were unverified to even be real people. Contrast that to most other lists on WP, all or most of the entries on them link to articles, and those articles in turn verify the existence and notability of the persons or topics in question. However, this discussion is on the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoko_Goto_46b2.html" title="Shoko Goto">Shoko Goto</a> article particularly, and no, 22 porn DVDs on the Japanese Amazon is most definitely not notable. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 18:32, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, HongQiGong, I'll assume good faith in this statement. You claim the list was deleted because the names were unverifiable, though no apparent effort was made at the time to verify a single name. You have just done the work necessary to verify Shoko Goto. I think you will agree that 22 DVDs at Amazon constitutes verification that the model actually exists, if not enough notability (by the <i>American</i> test) for an article? Now, if you will agree to help reinstate the list, giving Ms. Goto honorary first entry, I will agree not only to take up the work you started in verifying and weeding the list down, I will agree to help weed out the articles on actresses who do not merit stand-alone articles-- so long as they are (if verifiable, of course) allowed an entry on the list. I will also apologize for misinterpreting your actions as bad faith editing (i.e. nominating the list for deletion, claiming a category served its purpose, then depopulating the category, <i>and</i> claiming the list was unverfiable without making any effort, or asking for others to verify a single name). Deal? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I honestly have no problem with that list if all of them can be verified to be real people. You'll notice that almost every other list on WP have entries that link to articles that exist. I have never seen a list on WP where most of the entries do not link to articles, and that do not provide some sources on the existence of the people or topics on the list. That was the major problem with the list. The article had existed for a good while, and still, there was no evidence provided that they were actual people! Anybody could have edited the article to insert a completely made-up and imaginary name! But no, I'm not interested in re-creating that list. However, I won't nominate it for deletion if the names on the list are verified to exist, either because those names link to articles, or because sources are inserted at the end of the list to verify their existence. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 20:29, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not asking you to help with the list, just to say that you won't nominate it for deletion, and will oppose its deletion so long as the names are all verified. If a particular name is <i>not</i> verifiable, we'll delete the name, but not the entire list. If this is what you're saying, then I change my vote on this particular article to <b>Delete</b> until <i>notability</i> is established. However, since verifiability of the subject <i>has</i> been established, I say <b>Move</b> Shoko Goto's name to a future, revised, verified and footnoted List of Japanese female porn stars, which I will work on later and model on other, long-standing WP lists. If you agree to this, I apologize for misinterpreting what appeared to me to be an attempt to simply ban all these names from WP both as articles and as entries on a list. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 21:32, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree, but that's why I mentioned that she would not meet a Japanese equivalent of the test.

She does not have anything <i>equivalent</i> to that of being a Playmate of the Month. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 16:53, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the show of support, RFerreira &amp; the below, I was beginning to think I was alone on this. My point is, if she doesn't deserve her own article, she <i>certainly</i> belongs on a list of Japanese porn stars (which was deleted.) I am currently going through the old list (mentioned above) which was deleted for 2 stated reasons: 1) the subject would be covered by a category (implying every model would need an individual article, yet the category is now being systematically depopulated), and 2) to quote, "the overwhelming majority of the names were unverified to even be real people"... I am in the process of just the first pass of verification, through the simplest of Amazon searches, and have so far come across only 2 or 3 questionable names out of (I'm guestimating) about 100 names searched so far. So, obviously, <i>no</i> attempt or request was made for verification. I see the same thing here-- "She <i>may</i> not have been in Playboy"... etc. Shoko Goto has been major presence in this field for over a year. It would not be at all surprising if she has over 100 appearances (again, the <i>proposed American</i> test) to her credit. The problem (and the language/culture creates that problem) is <i>verifying</i> that she has made enough appearances to be considered notable. Amazon is a mainstream source, and this model has 22 DVDs there. When I was in Japan, I know there were publications with names like "AV Actress," etc. which could be used as sources. Unfortunately I am not there now, or I would be happy to check these publications to verify claims of notability. Perhaps there is an editor in the country who can help with this? This Amazon search is useful, but shows only the tip of a very large iceberg. It will clear as notable only the most extremely mistaken cases for deletion of currently active actresses. Amazon shows only DVDs (and to a lesser degree VHS) that are <i>curently in print.</i> In verifying the list, I have come across several <i>major</i> stars from 20 years ago, stars who <i>certainly</i> made over 100 appearances, who today have only a paltry representation at Amazon, because those videos are now out of print. For example, even Tani Naomi, who is mentioned even in mainstream discussions of Japanese cinema and culture, would fail the proposed test. So, by sticking to this proposed test, Wikipedia will, contrary to its stated goals, be <i>more</i> censored and <i>less</i> comprehensive in scope than even the mainstream, paper encyclopedias. Now, I am with HongQiGong in believing that we need notability for stand-alone articles, and verifiability for mention within articles (i.e., entry on the List). The standard for notability, however, <i>cannot</i> be the same for American subjects and for international subjects (particularly those in non-English-speaking countries), if Wikipedia is to claim to be making any attempt at avoiding cultural bias. Sorry if I ran on too much, but obviously this article is part of a much larger issue. If there is an area on Wikipedia for discussing this subject (that is, Japanese adult model/actresses), please point me there, as I would like to participate in it. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks for agreeing that notability needs to be established for these porn actresses to have articles dedicated to them. And no, we can't expect Japanese porn actresses, or even mainstream actors and actresses for that matter, to have notability through American media. Which is why I keep repeating, again and again, that some of these Japanese porn stars would not pass a <i>Japanese equivalent</i> of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. For example, has this person won notable awards <i>in Japan</i>? Has this person done notable mainstream work <i>in Japan</i>? Has this person made notable magazine appearances <i>in Japan</i>? If the answer to these questions is "no", then she's not notable. Simple comments like "she's notable, Google search returns XXX number of results and she's been in 22 DVDs" do not help. Porn videos do not reach the mainstream like mainstream movies do. And also, please note that invalidating <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> because it's only a proposal would subject these porn stars to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which they would more likely fail. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 20:48, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>i am re-nominating this page for deletion and have received permission to do so from wiki admin. it was nominated for deletion once before and i have read the debate on keep or delete. i found the reasons for keeping it to be weak and unconvincing. thus, i submit it for deletion.</p>
<p>dr. meredith jung-en woo is a very good scholar and has authored some very good works, but nothing about her record makes her exceptional in the field of korean studies. her research, while important in its own way, is not commonly thought of as being central to the field. her books are a very fine accomplishment, but among scholars, it is not exceptional. i know of other scholars whose records would warrent a page before her, the late james palais being among them.</p>
<p>specifically, dr. meredith jung-en woo is not, by the academic standards of her field, a prolific writer or a central thinker. as an example, the koreanist bruce cumings (to whom she is married) has over 20 books. his contributions to the field of korean studies reshaped its issues and assumptions, particularly those surrounding the korean civil war. today, NO SCHOLAR wishing to research the korean civil war would be taken seriously unless they first addressed the arguments raised by bruce cumings. THAT is noteworthy among academics.</p>
<p>next, her accomplishments such as advising the US government and appearing in the new york times are neither exceptionally noteworthy or overly numerous.</p>
<p>i argue that for an academician to appear in wikipedia that person needs to be truely exceptional and to achievements that place him or her far above their peers and colleagues. wikipedia needs to have high standards in this area.</p>
<p>in short, this seems more of a "vanity" page than a page dedicated to an exceptional scholar whose ideas have reworked or reshaped scholarship in their field. as such, i ask that you reopen the debate to delete the page. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongkyongnae_e837.html" title="User:Hongkyongnae">Hongkyongnae</a> 22:16, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a non-paper encyclopedia, Wikipedia can afford to have broader standards for notability than traditional encyclopedias. This author has several reputably published books and is clearly regarded by several mainstream media outlets as a person to call on for views in her field. Regardless of her relative position within her field, her accomplishments considered alone are notable enough for Wikipedia. I see no evidence that the authorship of this article is motivated by vanity. By the way, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Palais_74d3.html" title="James Palais">James Palais</a> does have his own article. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 01:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Firstly, the most important question one must ask per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> is this: Is this article on her <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>? Yes, it is. Secondly, in 1996 she was appointed by President <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> to serve on the Presidential Commission on U.S.-Pacific Trade and Investment Policy. Isn't that a noteworthy job-scope?

<li><b>Keep</b>—In this case the nominator for deletion sets a higher standard for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Notability (people)</a>, than Wikipedia as a whole does (one need only participate in AfD discussions for a few weeks to recognize that). This is not a nomination for a <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a>, where the standard is best in class. This is a Wikipedia article where a recognized test of notability is whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> based on verifiable information from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Sources_b1a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Sources">reliable sources</a>. Although Dr. Meredith Jung-en Woo may not be, by the academic standards of her field, a prolific writer or a central thinker, she has accumulated a sufficient body of work and a sufficient recognition to warrant inclusion. If Wikipedia required the same standards of notability as the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>, then we’d be the Encyclopædia Britannica; we’re a much wider body of knowledge and data; some of us think that is valuable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 14:09, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Further comment</b>—I appreciated Tariqabjotu linking the original debate. I note that although the nominator found "the reasons for keeping it to be weak and unconvincing", they were actually about as unanimous and strong as it gets for these AfD debates. I'd encourage the nominator not to proceed with this nomination again (and administrators to avoid wasting our Wikiresources by keeping this debate alive).

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the original creator of this page. I did so to complete a dead link at her husband's, Bruce Cumings, Wikipedia page. I do not accept the argument put forward by Hongkyongnae that the page must be deleted because the subject has not made an important contribution in the area of Korean politics. Meredith Jung-En Woo's work extends beyond that narrow definition. Hongkyongnae also oddly conflates the work of a historian (Bruce Cumings) with that of a political scientist. Yes, the original page, now somewhat edited, did borrow heavily on the U Michigan political science page mentioned above. Fair-use and non-commercial use priciples seem to apply sufficiently well here and the authors there do not object to the use here. She is a prominent member of a prominent department whose visibility continues to grow. For all these reasons, this page should remain. Yosemitemac 23:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

And it observes that notability is contentious. However a fair test of whether a person is notable is sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> based on verifiable information from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Sources_b1a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Sources">reliable sources</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>-Probably does fail WP:BIO—rather than simply citing WP:BIO in the nomination, it would be useful to have a brief analysis by the nominator as to why they so judge. The debate on candidates at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html#Elections_first.2C_then_individual_candidates" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">candidates and elections</a> has gone on for a bit. Five years from now the Wikistandard will be (I'd wager) that these articles on candidates are retained since 1) they are likely to appear in future campaigns and therefore there will be a later interest in their past record and 2) they will be of some interest to later historical research. Bottom line—I'm not voting to keep, but my sense is that in the future we will begin keeping these. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 14:33, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm really wondering here: <i>HOW IS THIS A GAME GUIDE?</i> The article is merely a list of characters, just with little information on them. There's no "guide" here: the page doesn't tell you how to become friends with these characters, or what actions can be taken when they're around, or list off some cheats to allow you to make these characters topless. I've never even played this game, so it's not as if I have some vested interest in it. But at least three different people above have used the phrase "game guide", which this is not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:43, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's not so much a <b>guide</b> as a document that will only be of interest and use to players of Animal Crossing.

<li>It's a checklist. Game guides for Animal Crossing will often be just lists of things, since the game doesn't have much in the way of goals, so a common make-your-own-goal is seeing all of a type of thing. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:55, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Many things are covered by many news sources that are not encyclopedic. I agree with the nom, we do not need a separate article for every single minor airline scare, especially as their frequency will only continue to grow.

<li><b>Delete</b>, notable enough for a newspaper or magazine, but not an encyclopedia. There may have been news coverage, but that is just because people are nervous about terrorist attacks, especially involving planes. Also, there have been many other scares. Another analogy would be to have an article on when a volcano was expected to erupt and some evacuations occured, but the volcano never erupted and no significant changes came as a result. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 06:21, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I contend that it is not a signicant event in aviation or terrorism history or the history of the airline in that, although it may result in a review of air-marshals' procedures, it would not have a significant impact on future events that suggests that it would pass a 20 year test, let alone a 100 year test. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:21, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I have no idea what motivated the nominations, but this article fails to demonstrate anything significant about its subject. There is nothing here that cannot be folded into a discussion of the show (a table of contestants, fates, and further actions would just be three columns and could very easily encompass everything here). There is no evidence that the figure has done anything except appear. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep:</b> Reality shows done well are comedy / dramas. They are crafted to make us interested in the contestants for 15 or 16 weeks. They are in effect mini-soap operas. As such, winning is beside the point to the "notability" of those involved. Read the blogs on the show as people passionately defend the "good guys" or berate the "bad guys". Indeed, given that the producers do not need to worry about keeping fans interested in the same characters for year after year (as is the case in traditional television fare), they are freer to pump up the story lines and the resulting emotions. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 16:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The claim seems to be that unless you have notability outside of a Reality TV series, you are not entitiled to space in Wikipedia (space being such an increadably precious commodity within Wikipedia. Oh wait it isn't, is it?). By this logic, all Wikipedia pages devoted to fictional characters should be marked for deletion. After all, a fictional character's notability is almost by defintion a construct of the fiction in which he or she occurs. For example, Col. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has a very nice article despite the fact that he is a character on Stargate / SG-1. Presumably, his notabilty is solely a function of the movie and the TV show and all the web references about him will be in the same contexts. Jack O'Neill will never write a book or run for president or do anything else notable, other than be a character of fiction. The contestants on a Reality TV show occupy an interesting niche. There notablity may be nothing more than that given by the show on which they appear. But if being a character on SG-1 is sufficent for notablity for Jack O'Neill, then it strikes me that it is sufficent for Kayne Gillaspie, Keith Michael, Bradley Baumkirchner, and all the rest. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 17:56, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A follow-up to my note above. One might argue that as main character on a series that has run for 10 years, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has acheived some kind of notableness outside the context of the show. If so, one would still be hard pressed to justify the pages of <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._and_Mrs._Stoppable_e7d9.html" title="Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable">Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Mankey_5daf.html" title="Josh Mankey">Josh Mankey</a>. These may not ring any bells for those not plugged into day-time Disney fare. The former are the parents of <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Possible_5e05.html" title="Kim Possible">Kim Possible</a>'s sidekike <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Stoppable_eb80.html" title="Ron Stoppable">Ron Stoppable</a> and the later is Kim's love interest in several episodes. Again, my take is that the characters on Project Runway et.al. are in fact characters in a drama. The standards of notablity for inclusion in Wikipedia should be based on the standards for Television characters. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 18:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>&gt;Żydokomuna (Polish neologism for "Jewish communism") was an antisemitic term used to describe the conspiracy theory that the Communism in Poland was supported by Jews to a much greater extent than by the Gentile Polish population. Any Communist group which was considered dominated by Jews counted as "Żydokomuna". The term is similar to the "Judeo-bolshevism" rhetoric of Nazi Germany.&lt;</li>

<p>This and 25 other lists exist as Wikipedia articles, and I'm nominating all of them for deletion. I'm giving two reasons: first of all, despite the importance of KROQ, there is no special importance attached to this yearly countdown, let alone the countdown of any specific year... hundreds of radio stations make lists like this, and including them is, plainly, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Second, and more importantly, this is a massive <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">copyright</a> violation: the list is intellectual property of KROQ and there is no claim of fair use that can be made. Let me point out that none of the 26 lists I've nominated contain any commentary about the list, they just give the list (with a basically unchanging header). The other articles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1981</li>

As for the copyright issue, is it really their intelectual property? The articles say that the list is established by caller's votes, and unless KROQ mind controlled all those callers then the results of the list are not theirs. Copyright protects the creative expression of material, not the material itself. In my eyes that means that while the broadcast of the countdown can be copyrighted, the voting results cannot be.

<p><b>Keep.</b> Article you cited did not go through full AfD, so the fact that it was listed has no bearing.

<li><b>Comment.</b> To me it sounds like this is a case of "all the good sources are probably in Japanese," a very common occurance. Personally, if reliable sources can't be found, I'd support stubbing this article off (as obviously there are reliable sources for basic information such as the author and name of the manga).

<p><s>Ok. The first paragraph is a dicdef. Only cite is that the EPSO defines what an active shooter is. Does not show the term as being relevant to any other LEO departments. Second paragraph is a list of "active shooter incidents"...which technically would include any situation when police arrived on scene for a shooting. That happens daily around the world. Further, I believe it includes situations in which the shooter had ceased firing (whether through suicide or lack of ammo, or other reasons) before police arrived on scene. Third paragraph discusses "changes in police response" as related to Columbine, which belongs in the Columbine article. Basically it's an article looking to define a term that is not uniformly used throughout law enforcement agencies, and each individual paragraph would very easily strengthen it's own article elsewhere. Further, <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spree_killer.html" title="Spree killer">Spree killer</a> already fits the article. There's also a picture on the page with no caption, I believe it's one of the Columbine shooters. I haven't looked into the copyright status of it, but it could be an issue. I'm all for SWAT related articles: I heavily maintain <a href="../../../s/w/a/SWAT_0192.html" title="SWAT">SWAT</a>, but this one is unnecessary, redundant, and feels like random unrelated paragraphs slapped together.</s> I withdraw my nomination of this. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 08:44, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The article quotes the Minneapolis PD manual, which uses the phrase "active shooter". I quote, per everyone's comment, the El Paso Sheriff's Department as well. A general Google gets 27,800 hits, with 795 distinct hits, and many of those hits are Powerpoint training sessions on active-shooter response, or academies offering training in such (such as the North American SWAT Training Association, which I did not quote but linked to an article about same). So, I have three sources which use the phrase "active shooter". Make fun of my writing all you want, I'm embarrassed and will fix the darn thing; but, I have to disagree with the WP:NOR. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the article, and <b>mention</b> Penny Arcade on the list noted by Mitaphane above. Like Andrew, I don't think the other game would survive an AfD, and I don't think there's any reason to <i>not</i> discuss that game here (in a separate AfD, obviously). Penny Arcade can simply be mentioned in the "games based on licenses" article without a redirect being created, as who would ever search "list of videogames based on webcomics"? -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 12:13, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Supporting act and a CD can be (but isn't necessarily, seeing as he fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> an' all) enough for AfD to support, depending on other factors such as the phase of the moon. As such, I'm sure you'll agree it's inappropriate to speedy delete an article under A7 if there's a possibility that AfD will keep?

<li>Begging your pardon, I think it's a bit patronising to avoid jargon within the community. Most wikipedians have the intelligence or education to look up phrases, acronyms and words which they don't know. After all, that's what wiki is for. In my above nomination, the term "not notable" was already used, and NN was used to avoid duplication. Honorable though your intentions may be, I somehow don't think your idea will catch on, as it is not very practical for everyone used exclusively the longhand form of commonly used wiki terms. You yourself have used "AfD" and "A7", for example, within the scope of this discussion. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:56, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> I abhor spam and this certainly looks like it. However, is it an accredited course and recognised at all? As a foreigner I can't tell, but the article contains the assertion <i>legitimately use the term 'legal nurse investigator'</i> and the term <i>certification course</i>. Is "certification course" accredited by Government or some professional body? It doesn't look like it from their own site but I just thought it is perhaps worth pausing to check. For example, I know that there is certification for <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_testing.html" title="Software testing">Software testing</a>, articles on two of the accreditations, <a href="../../../i/s/e/ISEB_e95c.html" title="ISEB">ISEB</a> and the newer <a href="../../../i/s/t/ISTQB_06f9.html" title="ISTQB">ISTQB</a>, would seem to me to be legitimate articles. I am not sure that that would pass the test I have set, that is they are not government accredited, but I think they are verifiable externally, for example accreditation is called for in job advertisements <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/istqb.do" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/istqb.do" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Shouldn't that be the test? External refs to the LNI profession are few and far between. I googled up only one: <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=15644" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=15644" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">Arktos</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 00:50, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - the profession <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_nurse_consultant.html" title="Legal nurse consultant">Legal nurse consultant</a> exists and we have an article on it. The not-for-profit American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants is the membership organization for the profession the USA. It is a profession that requires <b>no</b> certification, as the <a href="http://www.aalnc.org/edupro/position.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.aalnc.org/edupro/position.cfm" rel="nofollow">AALNC FAQ page</a> states. The subject of this debate is a for-profit company marketing a product to registered nurses that they do not really need. A "Legal Nurse Investigator" is just a legal nurse consultant who has paid large sums of money to take this course and get its expensive and unnecessary "diploma", and membership in the inappropriately named "National Alliance of Certified Legal Nurse Consultants" is limited only to people who have paid large sums of money to take this course.

<li>Hmmm - I do understand and am not trying to be obtuse but there are many professions or vocations for which you do not HAVE to get accreditation. Accountancy is one, software testing is another. You have to pay sums of money if you choose accreditation. We do have articles on those occupation's accrediation. I think the test is probably whether the accreditation is recognised elsewhere. Otherwise the same argument could apply to <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_Public_Accountant_0a08.html" title="Certified Public Accountant">CPA</a>. Whether or not the training adds value, is needed, ... is POV - is it recognised outside should be the test.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">Arktos</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 02:42, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The notability of the fanbase is not that it makes maps, but that it has completely taken over actual development of a commercial game, without compensation.

<li>The <i>game</i> is notable because it won some awards, was innovative, had a long sales run, etc. The <i>community</i> is notable because it took over the software development from the franchise owners. When this was happening (with signing of non-disclosure agreements, etc, circa 2002-2003), it was covered in the general gaming community and considered a notable event, even unique, among commercial games. This point is perhaps obscured somewhere in the dev histories and lists of groups, but this is AfD, not a FA review. I'm not defending the cruft - for instance the section on development history is probably impossible to follow except to one of the developers or core beta testers. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 00:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. While many online communities develop their own slang and in-jokes, the Myth Community is fairly unique in the way it has so many cultural divides. Online communities (such as World of Warcraft) might have server-division but nothing comes close to the Marius/PlayMyth, WWII/Reg/AvA, rank/un-rank divides while retaining major interaction. Also one of the older online communities outside of the RPG world to still have major tournaments that get advertising by the original creator (Bungie) and even sponsorship (MindscapeFX and a 'clothing company' just sponsored a small Myth II tournament'.</li>

<dd>Game development being taken over is one thing. But running two major (they can both handle over 1200 players if need be) gaming servers, an annual tournament which since 2003 has had approx 32 teams of 10ish players, UPDATES to the game (not just higher res and compatibility with modern computers) including huge modifications to actual gameplay, graphics and unit behaviour in Myth III, the fact that three games are being maintained (most communities like this are just the one) and the vast depth of the culture are what makes it important. We can clean this thing up a lot, but keep the core of it. The main Myth page was just getting too bogged down with really note-able things about the game that wouldn't go anywhere else. Several people suggested a new page and it is a lot better for it.</dd>

<dd>Development history could be put into a table perhaps (I can't do this as I don't know how)? Along the top you could have developers (Bungie, Mumbo Jumbo, Project Magma, MythDevelopers and Flying Flip) and along the side the list of games and map-making tools. So each block would list all patches that company releaased. For reference material:</dd>
<dd>Bungie created Myth: The Fallen Lords v1, v1.1, v1.2 and v1.3, Myth II: Soulblighter v1, v1.1, v1.2, v1.2.1, v1.3 and v1.3.1, Fear/Loathing v1, v1.1 and v1.2 I believe. I may be wrong on those.</dd>
<dd>Mumbo Jumbo were responsible for Myth III: The Wolf Age v1, v1.0.1 and v1.0.2. Their Vengeance work I know nothing about.</dd>
<dd>Project Magma (in association with MythDevelopers) created Myth II: Soulblighter v1.3.2, v1.4, v1.4.1, v1.4.2 and v1.4.3. Project Magma on their own created Myth II v1.5, v1.5.1 and are working on v1.6. Fear v1.2.3 Updates to Fear/Loathing were made to all Magma patches but Mac support was only added in Fear v1.6 and Loathing v1.5.1. Their only other work was Myth: The Fallen Lords v1.5.</dd>
<dd>MythDevelopers created Myth: The Fallen Lords v1.4 and v1.4.5 (v1.4.5 was Mac only), Myth II v1.4.4 and Myth III: The Wolf Age v1.1, v1.1.1, v1.1.2, v1.2. They also did Vengeance work of some sort I believe.</dd>
<dd>Flying Flip (a second incarnation of the core developers from MythDevelopers...work could be listed together perhaps) created Myth III: The Wolf Age v1.3, v1.3.1 and are working on a new patch currently, or considering it. Ballistic, v1, v1.0.1 and v1.0.2 were released by Flying Flip but rather than being a new program it is an update of Vengeance and could be listed as part of Vengeance's dev history as opposed to on its own.</dd>

<li>Reliable sources for the Myth Community are from websites that really have not got much more credibility than myself as a member of it. Many people within the community are watching over this, and regularly it gets scruitinized (since I've written the most I usually handle complaints from the community) and I'd say all server admins, map-makers and tournament organisers etc. who could be contacted have been. I can gather quotes proving all this if I must I guess but to be honest its not easy to find everyone - but its as accurate as it can be and based on the collective opinion of the community. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Elfoid_abf0.html" title="User:The Elfoid">The Elfoid</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Elfoid_79dc.html" title="User talk:The Elfoid">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Elfoid_fd24.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Elfoid">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Well what about original websites and things? Myth Community, though noteworthy in many ways has been fairly self-contained and not publicized since around the end of 2004 because the growth of PlayMyth.net's side of things ended after Myth World Cup 2004 and at that point the PlayMyth decline began (from mid-2002 onwards the community had been growing again). What about non-personal interviews e.g. official statements? It is impossible to find just about anything relating to Myth that classifies as reliable since everyone goes on aliases. 'some guy called wight slayer' is of very little guaranteed proof to anyone but I can safely guarantee the Myth Community would keep this authenticated and accurate since that's what they do. This is one of those horrible situations where politically correct rules don't quite work and things should be bent...not that I expect it to work.(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Elfoid_abf0.html" title="User:The Elfoid">The Elfoid</a> 23:32, 29 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

<li><b>Keep but edit heavily</b> The content here is quite thorough and probably way too wide-ranging for a single page. Most of the sections on this page could be condensed to a small paragraph with the deleted text relegated to it's own article. As for attribution, as Elfoid pointed out it is difficult to 'prove' most of the facts presented here since most of the original sources are websites that are no longer active, but as someone who has followed and been active in the myth community for several years, and who maintains an archival site of myth articles and content I have not found any major errors in the content on this page. Of course the question someone raised of whether so much detail about a particular computer game even belongs on Wikipedia is a seperate (and valid) question.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't entirely understand the last three delete comments. This is a sub-article of the main Myth article, repeats little content, and seems well below "ludicrous depth". If an "interesting" and <b>uniquely notable event</b> in game software development does not merit a short article, then surely the content should be merged, not deleted. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 00:57, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Someone with the ability PLEASE put the dev history into a table for me. I just can't do tables. Once its done I can tinker with it but I can't get the basics right. I am in the process of getting more details on the matter. A list of Myth Community projects (MythAlice, recent news articles, a note on the playmyth/marius magma/mythdev wars that almost broke the community apart would be noteworthy too in a little more depth - its rare for a community with such closely knit groups almost destroy itself when money's not involved.

<dd>The guy runs a blog and a website where people submit software ideas. Millions upon millions of other people run websites in the world (and millions write blogs). Nothing makes this guy note worthy in an encyclopedia at the moment. Oh and...I believe guidelines are there to be used, otherwise there's no point in them. On the fact he's got "high profile" people supporting his small website, well...those people support many things, most of which haven't got articles on Wikipedia at the moment. Just because they support something doesn't mean its instantly notable, there's many other factors to notability as well. — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 20:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Millions of people write blogs, but millions of people do not write blogs that are in the top 0.01% of all blogs by traffic. And millions of people do not operate popular websites which have brought together the combined efforts of over forty of the sharpest minds in the Mac industry, including the founder of Apple himself. And whether you want to call it renown or notoriety, millions of people have not achieved a large measure of celebrity within the extremely fast-growing Mac community. Phill Ryu has accomplished unusual and notable feats, especially given his relatively young age. I don't know why people keep claiming that Ryu does not meet Wikipedia's standard for notability; even without throwing in his Apple awards and other businesses, there is not a single other person in the world who comes close to matching Ryu's profile.

<dl>
<dd>Unusual and notable feats? Name them, with reliable sources from newspapers and books please. This sounds like your own opinion. Just because someone gets an Apple award that doesn't make them notable for an encyclopedia, that's one award. Let's look at the facts: Phill Ryu's site is the 58,478th most popular website in the world by traffic - however, compared to Macminute.com which ranks 32,757 - And the guy who runs MacMinute (Stan Flack) doesn't have an article, even though he runs a more popular site. As for phill's other website, Alexa.com hasn't even got traffic data for it...that's explains the popularity of that one! — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 07:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. The final tally as I count it was 6 for Delete, 1 for Keep, plus 2 more Keep comments by editors who have only edited the article and this deletion debate. The one non-new editor desiring Keep had no strong argument, leaving the arguments to the two new editors. While their arguments are vociferous, they are tainted, and not terribly strong anyway. "I highly doubt that the Wikimedia Foundation would appreciate your accusations against LinuxDevices", whatever that's supposed to mean, is not a helpful comment. The article <i>does</i> consist, except for the how-to section, almost solely of glowing descriptions of alleged features unreferenced by disinterested third party material, and this is brought out in the arguments, as well as the point that, after all, a full release of the product does not yet exist. Stronger argument and more numbers = Delete. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 18:06, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><a href="http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/AndLinux" class="external text" title="http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/AndLinux" rel="nofollow">[andLinux</a>] is a real Linux distribution that runs in Windows and has even been featured on <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS9808373276.html" class="external text" title="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS9808373276.html" rel="nofollow">[Linux Devices</a>] and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/174129/" class="external text" title="http://lwn.net/Articles/174129/" rel="nofollow">[LWN</a>]. I am the founder of andLinux and you are more then welcome to direct any questions about the project to my email (used during registration). The link to the home page or a google search on andLinux would show several valid links for the project. I understand your questioning a project such as this, but there are real needs for people to use Linux without coming ot of Windows. Please note that I am not sure how to answer back, so i responded here. --LordDavon | 09:25, 27 August 2006 (EST)</li>
<li>Addional response: I used your google search and note that the first link is to LWN and the second is to MadTux's andLinux download page (they test all distributions before adding). I also noted that your exclusion of the term "wiki" also excludes any page linking to its home page. Since andLinux is relatively new and named from typos found in a google search, excluding the home page will return several pages with typos. --David Solomon a.k.a LordDavon
<ul>
<li>The AndLinux distribution is yet to present that it has any notoriety or merit to deserve an article on an encyclopedia. The google test which I presented removes the reference to any wiki because wikis are vulnerable to spam and vanity attempts like this case. Nonetheless, without filtering out wikis, the google test laists a little over 700 hits. I'm not notable but my nickname earns more hits than that. Therefore it is easy to see that the AndLinuxdistribution is indeed very obscure and void of any notoriety. Moreover, it seems that it's article is just a pet article from the distribution's author, which is one more reason to delete it. Wikipedia should not be used as a vehicle for self-promotion or advertising --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 13:54, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, sounds like a very impressive Linux distro, but the article reads like an advertisement, and the distro isn't even finished yet. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:58, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JIP: Thank you. I have no control over the article, but I was happy when it came out positive.</li>
<li>Mecanismo: I am sure you find no fault on your part and that is just fine by me, but you really need to do your research before making statements like yours. For one, LinuxDevices may have written the article like an advertisement, but that is how they chose to write it. I like to think they were very impressed considering it was a proof of concept and the very first release. You are welcome to think however you like and following Wikipedia's own guidelines, I will continue to. Here are some things I would like to point out:
<ul>
<li>A wikipedia search shows 30 results of its own for LinuxDevices.</li>
<li>A LinuxDevices -wiki search returns 9,220,000 results on Google.</li>
<li>LinuxDevices is owned and operated by Ziff Davis Publishing (in the bottom right-hand corner of thier web site).</li>
<li>I highly doubt that the Wikimedia Foundation would appreciate your accusations against LinuxDevices. I suggest researching a little more in the future.</li>
<li>My google search of just andLinux returns 16,900 results. Just tossing it out there. I don't mean to argue. I have seen this corrected by clearing your cookies and cache.</li>
<li>I appreciate your work with Wikipedia and am glad that people check into invalid sites, but this is not one.</li>
<li>I didn't write this wiki page, but I am very glad someone did. I do browse around the Internet just before releasing a new version to find any issues that users may have had and came across the andLinux wiki page. I am happy that someone took the time and effort to create the page and appreciate their work.</li>
<li>I am busy preparing a new version and this has set me behind long enough. Following Wikipedia's <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Etiquette Rules</a> I agree to disagree. If you would like to discuss this further, we can talk in IRC. I do not believe this is the proper forum for this discussion.</li>
<li>I do not believe Wikipedia has a stance on a sites "notoriety" to be included but feel free to correct me sometime in Wikipedia's IRC.

<li>Wicketthework, as you are interested electronic music, I want to give you an idea of how useful andLinux could be for electronic musicians: Imgagine you are one, and you've heard about the intersting things happening regarding audio programs in Linux, e.g the exiting open source dj-mixprograms. But maybe you don't have the time to get well known with Linux, but want to try &amp; use these programs. One easy solution could be andLinux. Your're up and runnig in just a few moments, the programs are also installed easily. Now you could combine sounds made with Linuxprograms with sounds of Windows-programs. Also, someone could also make a special andLinux distro with all relevant programs preinstalled&amp; tuned... there are many possibilities to use andLinux.
<ul>
<li>@reliable sources: yes, there are few, its a one man show by now, but I think this will change. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECellstorm_7681.html" title="User:Cellstorm">cellstorm</a>, 18:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>KEEP he's an awesome designer...he's the first Black Male to be on Project Runway...it's momentous!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> He's a top designer, back to back challenge winner, Tresemme winner, all around good guy and ditto to everyone else's comments above. Should do well in the industry whether he wins or not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> He's (currently) in the top 6 and has been in the top 2 or 3 basically every week. If his work keeps up he could just as easily be in here soon as a young, up-and-coming designer regardless of the show. Whether or not he wins, he will actually be around for a while in an industry (unlike most reality show contestants). 69.203.80.93 16:21, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. He is the first African-American male designer on <i>Project Runway</i>. If he continues progressing at the rate he is going, he might very well have a show during Fashion Week. That would certainly make him worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, wouldn't it? He also has his own clothing line, which could certainly take off after the season has ended. I think we should wait until the final three are revealed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosTheDwarf_7b4a.html" title="User:CarlosTheDwarf">CarlosTheDwarf</a> 05:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Christian" books (usually a reference to the Evangelical community in the USA) tend to be self-published because the writers and potential buyers don't trust mainstream publishers, rather than your standard vanity publishing case. Being neither American nor a member of the Evangelical community, I cannot venture an informed opinion on whether this book is an encyclopaedic subject, but I would suggest that the standard metrics (sold X copies, published by Y house) may not necessarily apply here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 14:35, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seriously, though: dude, a <i>TV show created by High School students for the edification of a High School audience which ran for 5 years</i>? Maybe this sort of thing is common in the USA (where they have 39 flavours of ice cream; maybe even more), but from my old fogey point of view it's <i>pretty freakin' amazing, eh?</i> If we feel the programme itself isn't worth an article in its own right, it should at least be merged into an article on the Senior High School. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 14:16, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong, strooooong delete</b> With no disrespect to fuddle, an excellent user from the great land of Australia, TV shows produced by high schools are a dime a dozen in America. My town not only gets the public access channel run by my old high school, but the public access channels run by the high schools of two neighboring towns; this is quite common in the US. "480 Seconds"+"El Camino Real" (the name of the high school) gets a grand total of seven unique Google hits, five of which are YouTube or MySpace. Since the article is strongly POV, and Google hits show that the program is completely non-notable, it's not even worth a merge, as there's no evidence that the program (as the article claims) "has become a significant part of El Camino Real Senior High School history." -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:36, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>— Not original research. Note that <a href="http://ast.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cine_asturianu" class="external text" title="http://ast.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cine_asturianu" rel="nofollow">Cine asturianu</a> is an article on the Wiki-site for our Asturian and Leonese Wiki-brethren. My Spanish is poor enough so that I have trouble with even that, much less the Asturian and Leonese article. But it is clear that it is at least locally noteworthy—the article indicates that hall itself dates back to the beginning of the 20th century (well actually the end of the 19th, but clearly not for cinema at the time) and that the festival is a recent invention to help offset the impact of television. I'll add the interwiki link and someone with greater proficiency than mine can make the translation. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 15:57, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've edited the Asturian cinema article, pulling some of the material across from the Asturian article, to put its significance into better perspective. After working on it a very small time (my command of Asturian is an extrapolation of a weak understanding of Spanish) I'm convinced that there is an important vein of articles missing in the English Wikipedia, that the cinema is not just a cinema, it is a symbol for successionists, and that deletion would be a serious mistake. One wonders how many other articles I've supported throwing in the trash because I did too little research to understand why someone took the trouble to put up on Wiki. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 16:19, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is ironic that you should mention research. Wikipedia, in English or in any other language, is not a source. For all that we know, <a href="../../../../ast/c/i/n/Cine_asturianu.html" class="extiw" title="ast:Cine_asturianu">ast:Cine asturianu</a> could be a complete fiction. It cites no sources at all. It is not as if we never have hoaxes in the English language Wikipedia, after all. The <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilartikel.html" title="Nihilartikel">Nihilartikel</a> episode should be enough of a cautionary table about trusting what other Wikipedias have articles on. Please look <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia for sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:58, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Appeciate your cautionary comment. The thought did cross my mind. I "googled" <i>Cine asturianu</i> and found 1,360 hits; many appeared consistent with the article. So I felt on moderately safe ground. And I did link to other Wikipedia pages. And further, Google is hardly a primary source (or even a decent secondary source in many cases) so finding it there simply means someone posted it there. Not being proficient in the language, there would be value in having someone assure that this is not complete ficiton.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>— Will watch and might change vote conditioned on expansion — Wow, that's the best written article for an automobile dealer I've ever read. But that's hardly the basis for retention. And one can't help but be interested in how an autodealer gets 5,170 Google hits. As you scroll through the various hits, you recognize that the article is nowhere near as extensive as it could be. If someone went to the trouble of showing a dominant presence in sports (for example), then Jeff White Motors might make the threshold of notability. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 15:36, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as well, unless some assertion of notability surfaces. I also don't see anything obvious in the google hits that could let it meet WP:CORP, and there's 0 usenet hits. Also, it's not the best auto dealer article written, see <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Worthington_68e4.html" title="Cal Worthington">Cal Worthington</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/t/Sytner_Group_f3ec.html" title="Sytner Group">Sytner Group</a>.

<li>Hi it was not supposed to be the best article ever written I am a good writer this is why it is ok. It was supposed to put a popular Welsh businessman and company on the map so to speak. I'm sorry but if this article does not meet criteria then I am very surprised at some of the rubbish that gets posted on wiki e.g such as Wakigama hoshima yuri was a ninja in anime Aaaaaaah! monsters for example. And that is allowed as an article? I thought wikipedia was supposed to venture across all boundaries and aspects of human life for 'the sum of all knowledge'. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 17:03, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm pleased to see you (Ernst Stavro Blofeld) support your work strongly. I'm a pretty strong <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:Inclusionism">inclusionist</a>; I read each article with the premise that it should be saved if it can be. You write well enough that we want more of your work.</dd>
<dd>As to this article, what would change my mind is something compellingly broader than just a big dealership or even a cluster of dealerships. Biggest in the nation, if true &amp; verifiable, would get my support. Or something related to how they got all those Google hits; they seem to be very active in supporting racing and otehr sports activities. But without your excellent writing, I'd not even have given this article a chance.</dd>
<dd>The nice thing about Wikipedia is we can change policy if it is wrong. Take a look at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. If you can improve it by identifying other reasons for notability, please do.</dd>
<dd>Regardless of whether this article survives or not, keep up the excellent writing. Wikipedia can use more talent like yours - <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 18:09, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b>—There certainly is such a place in Ireland (see the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Petty%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Shelburne_0a06.html" title="William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne">William Petty</a> article and articles on his relatives mention of Petty estates, which comprises a geographic area noteworthy by Wiki practice). However putting an article up with no further information than a coat of arms is inappropriate. So my vote of keep is conditioned on adding enough substance to the article to allow us to figure out on a map where Petty is; after all we are an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 15:03, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Seems the image (heraldry) is appropriate if linked to the Petty family—which one must suspect it is.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a very dangerous moment, reminiscent of the Great High School Imbroglio that took up 50% of AfD time about a year ago. If we permit, for example, college dormitories with a genuine history, such as <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliot_House_3553.html" title="Eliot House">Eliot House</a>, how can we then claim that Ara or whatever do not have, if not as notable a history, then a sufficiently notable history, without causing a bit of a ruckus? And, once Ara or Vindhya or whatever survives AfD, wont every 20-person hostel add itself to Wikipedia?</li>

<dd>Someone please put <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliot_House_3553.html" title="Eliot House">Eliot House</a> up for deletion, if they dont believe any hostels are notable enough.

The most that can be said for Eliot architecturally is that it is 'typical of Harvard'. Peronally, I think all House/dorm/rez/College(at Yale) articles should go, unless theyre genuinely notable for architecture. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 08:12, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

I think this meets notablilty standards, but I think the article should do a better job of explaing how it does so. It should mention reception in the home country or sales figures.

<li><b>Comment</b>— The criteria for companies and corporations does not address franchises such as this case all that well. A listing of 650 BLS Limo services nationally (in the U.S.) might be the basis for an arguement that this is a notable firm. A lack of internet coverage other than ads would argue that it's not notable (although it gets sufficient Google hits to have some traction). Think we're in the gray zone here. I lean toward delete, but will watch to see if someone’s research turns up a good argument for retention (or a recommendation on a notability policy change). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 14:47, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are legitimate independent internet articles confirming Predrag Gosta's existence and suggesting/supporting notability.

Wow... at first I was going to complain about your lengthy nomination, but it's clearly needed with such a complicated web of blatant self-promotion. I think everything posted by the author should be tagged for NPOV. I would agree with Williamborg that the Ballet has at least borderline notability and verifiability. But does this confer notability on its creator? I'm skeptical. It's also very weak on the verifiability for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predrag_Gosta_8f39.html" title="Predrag Gosta">Predrag Gosta</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm uneasy on this one. Much that I'm normally inclusionist on such matters. The self-promotion is unmistakable, and the notability is not quite evident to me. Of the prizes listed, most may just be minor student-level awards. And the early music ensemble he founded doesn't seem to have gone much beyond regional notablility. They've produced some CDs that apparently won some (modest) acclaim, but I can't quickly find much on the web in terms of independent critical acclaim for the conductor, or reviews in major music journals. The CDs were all produced by Gosta's own firm, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edition_Lilac_fda7.html" title="Edition Lilac">Edition Lilac</a> (another article created by Gosta himself).

<dd><b>Comment</b> Ok, I'm not wild about the idea that he has created most of the blue links off of his page. (If anyone is interested, nearly all of his "collaborators" (remember what that term used to mean?) have wikipedia entries because he made them). I can buy CDs on which he acted as conductor, not only from his own site but from others, Amazon etc. To me that makes him notable. I'd strip his entry down to bare basics and allow others to build it back up. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 11:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as my account being called a single purpose account, think of it this way: I am strongly considering taking up wikiing as a hobby as it allows me a venue for one of my favorite pastimes -- web research. I consider the debate here as test. Does Darwinism work? I am perusing Wikipedia and stumble on what seems the subject's laughable self promotion and wonder, "Is this myspace?"

<li><b>Keep</b>. Of course, the page needs a thorough re-write, some sources and much expansion, but then what pages don't? This is a huge issue in the world of cricket - comparable to Bodyline or the match-fixing scandal with Cronje et al. a few years back - and deserves its own article. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 20:23, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It seems big at the moment, but with hindsight I don't think it will be as big as either of the two you name. Certainly not Bodyline, which led to significant changes in the rules.

<ul>
<li>This incident may lead to changes in the ball tampering rules, changes in the match forfeiture rules, and will definitely lead to changes in umpire-team relations. The match-fixing scandal does not have its own article, but IMO it should. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 20:37, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There have been match-fixing scandals going back to the 18th century. What is so important about the latest one? Ball tampering has happened before too.

<li><b>Delete</b>, because there is nothing here that other articles won't or don't already cover.

<li><b>Comment</b>— These porn star AfD discussions go on continuously on Wikipedia; somebody goes to quite a bit of trouble producing some rather well written articles; somebody values this material (I enjoy pornography as much as the next guy- actually I'm not sure that's true since I've not done a careful study on enjoyment of pornography - but there clearly is a constituency for this material). Is it time for a sister wiki, perhaps titled Wikiporn? We could get great sponsorships and might subsidize the main sites. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 17:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC) <small>And, although humorous, this is a semi-serious question.</small>
<ul>
<li>There's a whole sub-industry of the Internet pornography industry that is devoted to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlebombing.html" title="Googlebombing">Googlebombing</a> porn actresses. Moreover, that someone has "gone to a lot of trouble" is not really relevant. Editors have written lengthy, well-wikified, articles about completely new made-up languages, before now. The appropriate things to discuss here are whether this person satisfies <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and the appropriate things to be looking at are whether the coverage in the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> constitutes a non-trivial published work, and suchlike.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. The person is not a porn star - she's a $4,000 prostitute, as her site clearly indicates, and the movies are incidental to the sex-for-pay business. She fails PORNBIO, her business fails CORP, and she fails BIO absolutely. This person also contacted me after I closed the first deletion, admitting that the article was part of an orchestrated campaign of self-promotion, and asking me to reverse m decision. There was concsensus to delete in the first AfD, and nothing new have come up. We shouldn't even be here. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 18:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The first AFD discussion didn't make any mention of sources at all. The article on her in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> was not discussed, for example. The existence of multiple non-trivial published works from sources independent of the subject indicates notability, and two such works are cited by this article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:45, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Eh... the SFChronicle is trivial - it's her restaurant picks for crying out loud, the other two are from PORNBIO land, and in the spirit of PORNBIO I would require 100, not "multiple". The Bio is OR, anyway - there just aren't reputable independent published sources detailing her biography that we could cite here. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 03:03, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <i>Chronicle</i> article has a paragraph of good, solid, biographical information at the start. The <i>AdultFYI</i> article has similar content, from which we can know that the subject studied ballet, is married, teaches Pilates, and so forth. Are you saying that the second isn't a reliable source? On what grounds? This person has a lot more information published about her, by a reliable source, than most porn actresses. Most porn actresses are <i>wholly unverifiable</i>, because the only biographical information for them is the potted blurb that comes along with the pictures — which is almost always a complete fiction created by some editor somewhere. Even the names aren't reliable. Whereas this person has interviews in newspapers. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:29, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Relist</b> Here's the thing. I don't often visit wikipedia, unless Stephen Colbert has a new grudge against the bear population or I'm in need of some really trivia information. But I thought that pretty much anything that is relevant in pop culture could have a place here? No? I mean, CrazyRussian seems to think not, but so what? One guy gets to make the rules?! And on what grounds? That Tatum Reed isn't really a porn star but a prostitute who in some way is using wikipedia to score dates?! Well, that makes total sense, because when I'm really lonely, the first place I turn to is an online encyclopedia! Listen, if you want to argue that porn stars shouldn't be on here, that's one thing. But I don't even think Tatum is simply a porn star. She's currently having a documentary shot about her life and her business and completely blurs the line between pornography and art. And as a last grasp of an arguement, I thought I look up another porn star and see if she's on here...so I typed in "Bella Donna." And you know what came up? THIS: <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bella_Donna_eb91.html" title="Bella Donna">Bella Donna</a> No, that's not Bella Donna, the porn star...that's Bella Donna, the COMIC BOOK CHARACTER! If we're going to allow fictious, z-rated comic book characters on wikipedia, can't we leave Tatum alone?!Thefoxymoron 06:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>— Although this material is likely to be promoted by someone with a specific interest in Benjamin Bond Cabbell, perhaps <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">genealogy</a>, it must be evaluated on its own merit. Notability is always contentious, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notability (people)</a> is not Wikipedia policy so we have no absolute standard. The list of ways to verify notability of articles reminds us that "article for deletion reviews, although frequently limited to internet resources, must remain aware that not all published material of significance has been posted on the internet;" this is an excellent example where an internet review is likely to come up dry. Without doing serious library research, one can only review the article. Amusingly enough, the item that probably qualifies him for notability is mentioned in passing – serving as Sheriff of Norfolk - which was a far more substantial role in earlier centuries than it is today. Although this opens to door to a long string of Sheriffs from Norfolk (and many other places), in the ambiguous and contentious world of Wikipedia NN determinations, Sheriffs probably warrant a spot.

<li>Wrong. Our <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria have been widely employed by many editors for several years, now, being derived from our official policy that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a genealogical database</a>. An argument that we should keep this because it is of genealogical interest is an argument against policy.
<p>As for searches coming up dry, we've had enough false historical figures (and Greek gods, even — see Dinlas (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dinlas_8cc6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dinlas">AfD discussion</a>)) slyly inserted into Wikipedia to know that simply accepting something without attempting any verification at all, simply because it is "historical", is prone to egregious error. The article cites no sources, and unless editors are able to find sources for themselves (which you yourself say they are not) this article is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a>.</p>
<p>If you wish to make a case for keeping that actually holds water, please cite some sources to show that this person is indeed a part of the enduring historical record, having been mentioned in history books and suchlike. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>He's notable now since he is a real person who disappeared. His 'real' connection to Iron Maiden has yet to be revealed. I say wait at least a month and see what happens.

<li>I find the article useful, so i don't think it should be deleted.</li>
<li>Is there any harm in letting it remain. If it turns out that there is some historical relevance to the band, or any other source, it could be hasty to delete it.</li>
<li>I have found this article useful to understand what the song purposes and symbolism are. If you take a moment to visit the supposed "real" Benjamin Breeg page, you will clearly realise its connection with the band. I think this article (even though it is still a stub) adds a deeper layer of knowledge for those who want to know what songs mean and thus, it should not be deleted. - JSCouso (aug, 31-2006)</li>

<li><b>Very weak keep.</b> It does exist; the reason Google knows nothing is that the drink (Japanese: チェリオ <i>cherio</i>) is officially called "Cheerio" in English, so the title is wrong. However, I cannot verify the claim that it's "no longer produced" -- the Cheerio Corporation's <a href="http://www.cheerio-web.co.jp/" class="external text" title="http://www.cheerio-web.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">website</a> seems to be advertising Cheerio soft drinks quite happily, and the <a href="../../../../ja/%E3%83%81/%E3%82%A7/%E3%83%AA/%E3%83%81%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA_%28%E9%A3%B2%E6%96%99%29.html" class="extiw" title="ja:チェリオ_(飲料)">Japanese Wikipedia article</a> likewise says no such thing. Move the article to the correct name and delete that apparently-misleading claim, add the links from this comment, and we'd have a dicdef ("Cheerio is a Japanese soft drink brand"), an external link in Japanese, and an interwiki link from which the article could theoretically be expanded by translation.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and <b>move to Cheerio</b> — I believe that the orange-flavored Cheerio in a glass bottle is the original Cheerio, as well as the grape-flavored one. I've seen them in the Japanese <i>dagashiya's</i> in the 1970's. Looking at the corporate website, it appears that the original Cheerio's have been reincarnated in plastic bottles. As for the Wikipedia article, it can be expanded further.

<ul>
<li>Untrue. It depends from what sources exist. If the number of times that a song is played is something that is discussed by many people and the subject of much literature, then it most definitely is encyclopaedic. On the other hand, if this article is the result of a Wikipedia editor <i>counting the number of plays xyrself</i> and reporting the result of this firsthand primary research, then it isn't. As I said, the right thing to be doing is not asking onesself "Do I think that this belongs in an encyclopaedia?" but asking "Do sources exists for this? How many sources are there? How extensive are they? Who wrote them?" <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:51, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. My reasoning is thus: of the four references, two are by Ruthy Alon, one is an interview with Ruthy Alon in Feldenkrais Journal, a publication of dubious impartiality, and the fourth is a reference that, in my opinion, is dubious: <i>Aspray TJ, Prentice A, Cole TJ, Sawo Y, Reeve J, Francis RM. Low bone mineral content is common but osteoporotic fractures are rare in elderly rural Gambian women. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. 1996 Jul;11(7):1019-25. (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8797124" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8797124">PMID 8797124</a>)</i>. I don't <i>know</i> that the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research on Gambian Women doesn't contain significant references to Bones for Life, but I am suspicious. Secondly, we have to be very careful about letting spam into the Wikipedia. Granted the article has been rewritten well, still. It's spammish history shows that it was not written by a disinterested scholar but by the very people who stand to benefit from the inclusion of the article. That's another point against the article. Thirdly, I did not find the Keep arguments to be strong as regards to notability. If Alon was a top figure in a recognizedly important medical field, that would be one thing. Being a top figure (claimed, anyway) in the less notable Feldenkrais Method is insufficient to establish notability. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:28, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

The article has three very poor references by wiki standards, which support only a single section of the article so far. The bottom line is that so far the authors have not actually cited what they are using for references, or they are simply writing original research. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 01:35, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You call having her own book on the topic and a link to a Medline article a poor standard? Your argument is clearly nonsense. I'd like you to apologise for wasting everyone's time. 58.178.129.162 05:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

Given this works's newness (having evolved only over the past 10 years) it is understandable that reference material is limited, but due to its pedigree and growing recognition (having taken root in 19 countries on 5 continents, with over 500 teachers worldwide) it would seem an oversight for it not to be granted some acknowledgement, if only for the sake of completeness. References to Bones for Life -- as written up in newspaper articles worldwide -- are in the process of being gathered (I trust Hebrew is acceptable). Speaking from personal experience, this work, based on solid biomechanical, ergonomic principles is most credible -- not to mention effective -- and deserves further attention by your readers inquiring into cutting edge approaches to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Medicine_e2df.html" title="Alternative Medicine">Alternative Medicine</a> and <a href="../../../n/c/c/NCCAM_1148.html" title="NCCAM">NCCAM</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Note here what's happening: the main author, DBOLTSON, is trying to find sources AFTER writing the article. He's caught up in proving what he's writing is true, ignoring Wiki policy that he should be be writing directly from sources he has on hand. He's doing original research. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 14:42, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Or, in a more gentle light, after making a contribution which falls somewhat short (though is perhaps currently acceptable), DBOLTSON is trying to bring it up to the highest possible standards. Doing this article properly is hard, and DBOLTSON (and I, in any supporting role I've played) are just learning the ropes -- ignorant perhaps, but not purposefully 'ignoring'. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKineticScientist_5eaa.html" title="User:KineticScientist">KineticScientist</a> 14:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Obviously, the problem here was the article was identified as problematic from it's very creation. While there are assertions that the article is acceptable from some editors, the explanations, when they exist, consist of more comments like DBOLTSON's above: long on claims and short on sources. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 19:24, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The skepticism here is wonderfully healthy and challenging! Thank you, everyone! Please bear in mind that, just because one does not believe in something -- understandably because one has not experienced it for himself -- does not mean that (1) it does not exist and (2) it is not a valid approach, worthy of consideration. Please excuse my enthusiasm for Bones for Life (which prompted me to create this entry in the first place) while we amplify the resource section in order to substantiate its growing worldwide recognition, and approach WikiPedia's high standards for inclusion. Being too close to a subject can often blind one to its flaws; being too far can often blind one to its merits. With everyone's contributions, I trust we can find a more objective middleground! --DBOLTSON 23:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What does this have to do with the article being considered for deletion? The POV is a bit overly promotional, but it's the violations of WP:SPAM, WP:NOR, and WP:V that are of concern. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 19:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. Users <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">User:Addhoc</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EApers0n_d5e5.html" title="User:Apers0n">User:apers0n</a> asked for more references and they were provided, so that leaves you. But let me be more specific about what I am asking of you.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding WP:V: You got the references you requested and also tonnes more links through google. I'd like to know specifically why you consider the 7 new references on the page to be inadequate. There are references to widely published and translated books, a medline article, interviews, and sundries. It's been established this is a notable person in the field. There are some 700+ google matches including many impartial interviews to be sorted through. Why do you consider all this to be inadequate?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding WP:SPAM: I am requesting more information because it isn't clear what you are calling spam. You are working to fix the article on the discussion page, so clearly at least some of the article has merit in your eyes. Which parts do you have a problem with and why? I've noticed on other articles that you seem to consider all external links anywhere other than scientific journals to be spam, which is not the usual spam threshold on wikipedia, especially on alternative therapy articles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding WP:NOR: Everyone on the article talk page has agreed the article could be more wikified and it's worth working towards fixing that. The founding editors are new to wikipedia and it's obvious they need a helping hand. All users are clearly indicating the article has some merit, and even you have been making comments on the talk page. So why is this grounds for deleting the article? If you believed the entire article violates WP:NOR why would you be suggesting improvements on the article talk page?</dd>
</dl>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>WP:SPAM: I don't recall seeing any contention that DBOLTSON's original article was spam. My only concern now with this policy is that the new article, if not deleted, resolve the problems of the original article. Additionally, WP:SPAM lists an important issue, which I see as more WP:NOR: "Therefore, it can never be correct to add a link or reference to References sections if nobody editing the text of the article has actually referred to it." I don't think the article has solved the SPAM issues because of the NOR issues.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>WP:V: I think the editors have made very good progress providing verifiable references, though there still appears to be very heavy reliance upon Alon's book and her website. I think Aspray(1996) should be removed because there appears to be no connection between it and this Wiki article. Alon(2005) should be removed because, as I understand, it is only an abstract - the actual research paper has never been published. Still, I think these issues are minor, other than how they relate to the WP:NOR issues.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>WP:NOR: (see the above quote from the WP:SPAM article) From my perspective, the article is original research with some references added that were never used as source material. I personally like the recent addition of the "Working Theory", though this not actually specific to Bones for Life and so could be moved to another article. The Research section should be removed, since it is based upon an abstract of an unpublished paper. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 02:00, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Spam</b> Reads and probably is still spam. If after a supposed rewrite its still pretty much, I'd say it may be unfixable, and thus not for wikipedia. It seems like one of those random medical ideas that aren't well constructed or proven, where there's a collection of loosely related medical content that is original research to collect it into the medical idea presented. In summary, the program is not well established, and its spam for bonesforlife.com. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 01:21, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd suggest that if, after a rewrite, users consider it still too isolated we merge it with <a href="../../../f/e/l/Feldenkrais_method.html" title="Feldenkrais method">Feldenkrais method</a>.

<dd><b>Significant rewrite:</b> Okay, I've done a considerable rewrite of the article removing advertising style language and culling unecessary fluff. You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bones_for_Life&amp;diff=73362393&amp;oldid=73321453" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bones_for_Life&amp;diff=73362393&amp;oldid=73321453" rel="nofollow">see the differences here</a>. I believe there really is some encyclopedic content here. With a couple more citations and ensuring the article doesn't bloat I think it's a reasonable addition to wikipedia. Please note I commented out some of the notability evidence at the bottom of the article in order to streamline the treatment. Let us know your thoughts on the new article. Best wishes. Anon. 58.178.194.85 03:42, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> my concern regarding the article is the lack of secondary references, so there is no commentary on the ideas being expressed.

<dd><b>Comment</b> <i>A beautiful rewrite</i> -- very succinct and clear (and objective). I see you well understand and appreciate what we are trying to communicate, and you do so expertly; your generous expenditure of time and effort is thoroughly appreciated -- <b>Thank You</b>, Anon 58.178.194.85<b>!</b> I will get to work on sourcing the Tel Aviv study, which was cited in Ruthy's own (unpublished) Proposal to NASA (I have a copy) <i>Bones for Life Strategies for Effective Rehabilitation of Bone Strength within Protection of Vulnerable Joint and Connective Tissue.</i> [Text from Page 4, supported by Appendix 20, page 31] -- Or might this be useful in and of itself? As far as criticism of the work, I think it is too new to have any commentary or detractors (especially given its focus on safety, and its general harmlessness, not to say effectiveness). It really is distinct from the Feldenkrais Method -- in aims, and in approach -- and ultimately merits unique filing, IMO. --DBOLTSON 18:06, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Appreciate your comments. Secondary sources would probably most help other users feel more comfortable. Even conversations in Feldenkrais magazines should be enough to prove it's taken seriously as a modality. 58.178.157.210 04:47, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, having done a search for more references, I've reached the conclusion there is sufficient material to justify an article for Ruthy Alon and the Bones for Life material could be merged into this new article.

<li>It is interesting that you should mention the album being for sale on Amazon. There's a review of the album <i>Cosmic Storyteller</i> on its Amazon page by one very dissatisfied customer who was apparently looking for an album by a <i>real</i> band named Unicorn, from the 1970s. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:22, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ok, I've had a listen to it and it doesn't sound like it was made in the 60s though that's by no means water-tight. If this is a hoax then maybe it should be judged as to whether it's a notable hoax. Given that it's available to buy, I would suggest that it is. This is certainly a fascinating subject and I am going to try and find out more. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 19:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm trying to figure this out and I'm still confused. The album appears to not be by the band Unicorn but by a woman named Hilary Clay Hicks and is sort of a hoax in the vein of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platinum_Weird_e7c0.html" title="Platinum Weird">Platinum Weird</a>. The album exists, and can be bought -- it just isn't a "lost" recording. But did the band really exist at some point and she just took their story? Or is the whole thing a hoax? <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 19:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>There was <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:idjw7i2jg75r~T1" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:idjw7i2jg75r~T1" rel="nofollow">an unrelated band with the same name</a> in the seventies, as Uncel G already mentioned above. I'd guess this one is completely made up. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">Fritz Saalfeld</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFritz_Saalfeld_515f.html" title="User talk:Fritz Saalfeld">Talk</a>) 19:30, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There was a real band in the 70's called Unicorn who had <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Gilmour_e9c5.html" title="Dave Gilmour">Dave Gilmour</a> produce one of their albums see <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:2nklu3e5an5k~T1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:2nklu3e5an5k~T1" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. It also lists this band with Cosmic Storyteller listed as their sole album see <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hz6gtrarkl2x~T2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hz6gtrarkl2x~T2" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. It doesn't have any text for the band but the album review states "Lost artifact of the psychedelic era? Pseudo-Spinal Tap put on? Modernist pop/psychedelia? The Cosmic Storyteller is all of these things. The brainchild of singer/producer/singer Hilary Clay Hicks, these tracks attributed to Unicorn make up a "lost" 1960s album that embraces several different musical genres, and does so with a classy sense of spirit and style." Please note that this All Music Guide tells a different story to the article. We don't have an article on Ms Hicks and nor does All Music Guide. In conclusion, I would support keeping an article on the 70s group as they clearly meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. An article on this group is marginal although we would have to make sure it was verifiable and it would need significant changes. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 20:11, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's problematic, isn't it? On the one hand we have AllMusic saying that this band is a complete invention from whole cloth, and Amazon reviewers (and Wikipedia editors) saying that this album certainly doesn't <i>sound</i> as if it were a product of the 1960s. On the other hand, we have <a href="http://www.cosmicstoryteller.com" class="external text" title="http://www.cosmicstoryteller.com" rel="nofollow">the web site for the album</a>, and the album's own blurb, neither of which are independent of the album's creator(s), giving this giant history of a band whose music was supposedly "lost" for 34 years. Then, in order to muddy the issue even further, we have <a href="http://www.popdirt.com/article50326.html" class="external text" title="http://www.popdirt.com/article50326.html" rel="nofollow">people accusing Platinum Weird of stealing the story of Unicorn</a>, and a completely separate <i>real</i> band named Unicorn. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:31, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Those participants included <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Yee_8144.html" title="User:Danny Yee">User:Danny Yee</a> himself who preferred to delete the content as he didn't want it on his user page. In fact, his user page states that the article <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Yee_bcaa.html" title="Danny Yee">Danny Yee</a> is not particularly useful. Since the article's claim to notability for the subject is as an online book reviewer, I don't think he meets any <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria to such a degree that he ought to have an article about him even against his will. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 19:32, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Bad faith nomination by editor (Kmaguir1) who does not care about subject, but is simply nominating out of unrelated edit conflict with article creator. • Apart from that, however, the "Google test" gives 155k hits for Yee, whose reviews are <i>widely</i> quoted, referenced and syndicated. Relatedly, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Danny+Yee%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Danny+Yee%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google scholar</a> shows a rather substantial 365 mentions. The "author test" mentions readership of &gt;5000: according to Yee's statements (see <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDanny_Yee_cd06.html" title="Talk:Danny Yee">Talk:Danny Yee</a>), he has gotten over a million hits on his reviews over the years—even if Yee's characterization of server logs isn't exactly accurate, the 5000 threshold is easy exceeded by two orders of magnitude. FWIW, Google groups shows 4260; and Alexa shows his homepage at 64,061. I also find it notable that his reviews have been slashdot frontpage stories repeatedly. • The prior AfD (over a year ago) was based on different, and inadequate, article contents that in fact failed to assert notability. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 20:10, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Can I vote? He's not notable, he was judged to be so, by Metropolitan90's argument, he should be gone as it is--he doesn't meet any WP:BIO criteria--he's a simple online book reviewer. That's not notable. If I publish book reviews on the net, do I become notable? Ridiculous. -<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 21:06, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure you can "vote". Although on Wikipedia the decision is not by the number of votes; it is by the merit of the argument. But a “vote” might have weight, I suspect some Admins understandably count votes when closing out the process. Regardless, craft your argument thoughtfully and it will have its day in "court".
<p><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states clearly that it is not policy. But whether this article meets the emerging continuously emerging consensus on what is notable is still essentially the subject to debate—this debate (Wikipolicy is evanescent and virtual).</p>
<p>And yes, if you publish enough on the net, even if you publish nowhere else, it is possible you can become notable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 21:19, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>— Notability is always such an interesting debate. Regardless of the allegation of bad faith nomination the question is, does Danny Yee meet a reasonable standard for notability. With 683,000 Google hits I'm willing to accept him, even if he's done little else—he's internet notable. If we get rid of all folks and topics this borderline, Wikipedia will have a lot fewer entries. I've only "voted" against a couple of notabilities today; I seem to like them all. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 21:20, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree that you can be notable and just be on the net, like a <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Berardinelli_aeac.html" title="James Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a>, but it's very rare, and you have to be notable in an area that itself is notable--like Berardinelli, he's a movie reviewer. Billions of people have seen the movies he's reviewed, and he has a sufficient number and sufficient mention in non-internet sources to be considered notable. But Danny Yee? I think not. You'd have to say that the things his reviews are about are as popular as movies, the huge category of movies, or somewhere close and I think that that is not in evidence, from LotLE or from anyone else. -<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 21:47, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The 155k is the right count: probably the larger number forgets the quotes around the name, i.e. both "danny"s and "yee"s... but still: how can 155K genuine hits be NN?! It's definitely not linkspam inflation, but genuine references. We argue on AfD's over whether a few hundred hits reaches notability... not whether over a hundred thousand hits does! <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 22:37, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Give it a rest, Kmaguir1: I <i>created</i> the Yee article long before you joined WP, so I hardly think my belief in his notability has anything to do with you. Moreover, I had heard of Yee, and read his reviews, long before <i>I</i> joined WP: I think I first heard of him in 1993-4 (before the WWW existed, probably), when his reviews were widely syndicated and discussed on Usenet. Yee has certainly "seen print" in terms of being mentioned in many books and newspapers; but in the last decade or more, a lot of publication <i>is</i> electronic-only. Not that it really matters, but Yee has repeatedly received book offers for collections of his reviews, but has declined to do that (if I were him, I think I'd have accepted; but I'm not him). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 16:12, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Question and remark from George,
<p>What do I need to change so the Blogtronix article and company info stays in Wikipedia structure. We are a legidimate coprorate structure in US. If the weblinkage is a problem - I would immeaditely remove it</p>
</li>
<li>George: I did put the article. I removed the web links to Blogtronix website.
<ul>
<li>You need to include <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> references to non-trivial coverage in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable secondary sources</a>, supporting the criteria listed at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (inclusion guidelines). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:34, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>From George: Anthony, please indicate what I need to change so it is not considered as a spam. What is it different than the article for Movable Type? open the movable type article and tell me what is different! I will chaneg what I have to to have Blogtronix included in Wikipedia but you guys are not helping here, I know you are editors, not support center but the guidlines are not clear what i need to remove especially when I have the example with Movable type. They are in the same position we are in!</li>
<li>George: I edited the article additionaly - please check and advise.
<ul>
<li>Honestly speaking: There is no hope for your article at this point. It <i>will</i> be deleted. Change your company and your software first, before considering whether they deserve a Wikipedia article. Get mentioned on Forbes 500, become a Dow Jones companent stock, and get your software <i>featured</i> (not just mentioned in passing) in 5 newspapers first, and we might reconsider. Nothing's wrong with the article, it's the company (and the software) that isn't <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">notable</a> <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">enough</a> for an article at this stage. <a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3b01.html" title="User:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh</a> 20:42, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>George: What is "blatant" here? Does this mean you have double standards? Movable type can be included together with SixApart and Blogtronix can not. What is different in the two articles - none of the editors here can not point out. Did you check the latest update I just did? Compare it wtih Movable type and tell me where is the difference

<li><b>Comment</b> As it stands, this article is an advertisement, not an encyclopedia article. To have a shot at being kept, you'd have to rewrite it to be an objective analysis of the company.

<li>George: OK, I Understand. Thank you. I will take out some of the information that can be considered as an advertisement immediately.</li>
<li>George: I changed the article again. Danny, can you check it again. Awyong Jeffrey - I think your statement is a little incorrect. Being first in more than one aspects should allow us to be included in Wikipedia. Plus we do have way more than 5 articles about us in newspapers. We can not become Forbes or Fortune 500 company in 18 months but we are aiming there. There is nothing wrong with our software or company type - you do not know the Corporate Blogging software industry to state that We can not be included because we are nobody. I am honestly seeking advise how we can be inclued in wikipedia,i am not arguing with the editors. I need advise what to do as I am certain my opinion is valid as well as the infromation for Blogtronix which should reside in Wikipedia</li>

<li>This is Vassil Mladjov,Vassil mladjov founder and ceo of Blogtronix. One thing I don't understand here is what are you guys talking about. Blogtronix is a company incorporated in the US, CA in Aug 2005. We just like, <a href="../../../s/o/c/SocialText_21de.html" title="SocialText">SocialText</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/x/SixApart_94f8.html" title="SixApart">SixApart</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/WordPress_fde3.html" title="WordPress">WordPress</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/t/JotSpot_c5c1.html" title="JotSpot">JotSpot</a> and many others make web 2.0 software and services. Why are any of our competitors here in Wikipedia and we can't be here? You guys have many articles about software companies for wikis and blogging <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog_software.html" title="Blog software">Blog software</a>, we are just one of these companies. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProprietary_wiki_software_9057.html" title="Category:Proprietary wiki software">Category:Proprietary wiki software</a>
<p>So, if any of these companies are here, I do think that we should be here well. We will edit the info to a minimum, so it does not look like any commercial ad, but people are looking for us on the internet as our solutions is a best of breed for enterprises at the moment. (these are just not my words).</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to your guidelines <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> about software, it states that: "Creating an article about software you have personally developed is strongly discouraged but not forbidden"</p>

<p>George: Thank you Uncle G. I guess, we will get back to Wikipedia in a couple of months. BTW; All sites that are posted here have our company name on them and believe me the Report on Corporate Blogging from <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forrester_Research_5d35.html" title="Forrester Research">Forrester Research</a> is quite non-trivial, reliable and independent source. There should not be a reason for Wikipedia editors to deal with our inclusion in such a manner when SixApart, iUpload, WordPress and JotSpot are listed here. Anyway - we will wait and will deal with this at a later date. I read very carefully what should be a reliable source and besides the fact that Mars is a planet and the Wikipedia editors have a DELETE button - i could not get any other or more information. I will really get back to wikipedia when the content we can put about Blogtornix is verifiable and understandable enough for the very general public that needs to be told that Mars is not only a chocolate bar but it is actually a planet!</p>

<hr />
<p>To answer pjacobi:</p>
<p>I created this article. I'm currently editing this from various sources. I have no relationship with any of the individuals mentioned in the article. I'm not even in the same country. I don't know where you got the idea of "spam" from. What part of the article contains spam exactly? I don't understand why you think this is any less notable then any other over-unity device claims on wikipedia which are equally wild. I don't understand why you think this article should be condensed or why you think it is the same as the water fuel cell article which it is clearly not.</p>
<p>Here's why I think it should stay:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote the article from a sceptical point of view.</li>
<li>I make clear none of the claims are validated.</li>
<li>I put the article is pseudoscience and perpetual motion categories - I never attempted to suggested it belonged anywhere else.</li>
<li>Any rational person reading this should realise that it's not realistic or conventioanl science.</li>
<li>Erroneous or disputed claims about science still have a place in an encylopedia for historical value provided they are presented as such. I don't agree with the idea of removing a claim because it is wrong. Instead, explain why it is wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know the over-unity Joe cell claim is questionable, I'm not an idiot. I just thought it was a interesting claim that was undocumented on wikipedia.</p>
<p>kesfan 20:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Hate pseudoscience, but at least it is correctly categorized. Inclined to argue for delte, but will watch the discussio.</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer user Williamborg (above comment): I don't like scientology and think it's absolutely hillarious bunk, but I haven't attempted to delete the wikipedia page on it.</p>
<p>I don't believe in Joe cells and am a scpetic, however I don't think it's valid to erase a claim from history just because it's complete rubbish. I think it is interesting to research why people believe in it and the evidence either way. I was hoping people would add evidence over time to debunk the Joe cell claim (or indeed support it if they want to).</p>
<p>If you don't point out the folly of the past, then people will just repeat it. I'd wager that if you delete this article, someone else will recreate it and this argument will start over again.</p>
<p>I was concerned that somebody marked the article as factually in dispute. I've tried to refer to "claims" in the article as not to represent the information as fact. If you think the sceptical balance if not sufficient then please let me know and I'll see what I can do to rephrase it.</p>

<p>This guy <a href="http://www.thejoecell.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.thejoecell.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thejoecell.com/</a> has a credible sounding explanation for the Joe cell effect which might generate some worthwhile discussion. I've asked permission to include his theory as he specifically requests that you do so. Just waiting for a response. --kesfan</p>

<dd>Please don't. That would be against <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<p><br />
In answer to Pjacobi: My understanding of the root of your difficulties with this article is that your are concerned it may be confused with peer reviewed engineering. Do you think it is in the wrong categories? I thought I'd got it about right.</p>
<p>Refering back to my comparison with scientology. Look at this article on the <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-meter.html" title="E-meter">e-meter</a> to which are attached unsubstantiated wild claims by principally a single person. The article describes what the device is from a dispationate point of view, the theories about it and then presents an undertone of gentle scepticism. That's what I'd like to do here.</p>
<p>With the Joe cell, I don't see anything sinister going on. It's a bunch of Australians having fun with an effect they don't understand because none of them have got the training or resources to figure it out - hence the crackpot theories and questionable claims.</p>
<p>There's at least 50,000 web pages mentioning "Joe cell" which shows some public interest in the device and makes it distinct from any other device/claims. So would you rather people come to wikipedia where they're going to (over time) get a balanced view, or go to some other web site written by an individual with a particular bias? Or worse try and buy one on ebay (of which they are for sale) without reading what people think about the theory behind the device.</p>
<p>--kesfan 11:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I got a new compromise suggestion. What if I drop the "theory" and "conspiracy claims" sections and just keep the history and construction sections?</p>
<p>End with something like:</p>
<p>Numerous people (give list, videos etc) have made claims to have operational Joe cells although none have been peer reviewed or made available for indepedant scrutiny.</p>
<p>Several people have independently produced their own theories as to how a Joe cell may operate - then give external references and links - but none have been verified. So the actual theories don't appear on wikipedia and hence there isn't any implied credibility from wikipedia?</p>
<p>What do you think? --kesfan 13:04, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, for a start, the <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-meter.html" title="E-meter">e-meter</a> is of clearly superior notability, completely independent of the question how and if it "works".</dd>
<dd>But regarding <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_motion_machine.html" title="Perpetual motion machine">Perpetual motion machines</a>, we have to do some filtering. Building a machine that doesn't work, isn't notable in itself, even if the machine would revolutinize the world, if it works. Also getting a patent, setting up a webpage, or getting an entry at PESWiki isn't a notable achievement. For this reasons, most claims of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_motion_machine.html" title="Perpetual motion machine">Perpetual motion machines</a> are not notable enough to get reported here. If a device gets some media attention, at least some reporters were tricked to believe the claims, some gullible investors were relieved of excess money -- OK, that's the threshold where a sentence at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_perpetual_motion_machines.html" title="History of perpetual motion machines">History of perpetual motion machines</a> may be considered.</dd>
<dd>Whether any single device article within <a href="../../../p/e/r/Category%7EPerpetual_motion_machines_9ca1.html" title="Category:Perpetual motion machines">Category:Perpetual motion machines</a> deserves an article for itself can be questioned (and more often than not was questioned by AfD).</dd>
<dd>Wait, wait, you may say, it's not prooven, that it doesn't work. But here <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_razor.html" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a> is a mighty axe. Any such invention over 10 years ago but today
<ul>
<li>No physics textbooks are re-written to account for this "free energy"</li>
<li>Inventor didn't get <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_prize.html" title="Nobel prize">Nobel prize</a></li>
<li>Inventor not even rich or famous</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramco.html" title="Aramco">Aramco</a> still a solid enterprise</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So Joe Cell is a rather clear-cut case. Very fresh claims of perpetual motions are somewhat more problematic, see <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steorn.html" title="Steorn">Steorn</a> which seems undeletable (in the moment). But they at least spent some money for press coverage.</dd>
<dd>Finishing may rather long comment I want to say, that my initial reaction may have been too harsh against you personally: Yes the article takes a cautious approach to formulations and the amount of spam (two or three links to PESWiki) is not obscene.</dd>

I think I'd disagree with you over threshold. Wikipedia has a lot lower threshold for interest than say a science journal. If there was a concern over the overall size, then someone would have gone round and deleted all the rediculous pages on every minor science fiction character that's ever graced a paragraph in a Star Wars novel.</p>
<p>You imply that there have previously been a lot of perpetual motion claims placed in wikipedia that have been deleted. I don't think it's such a great idea to delete them in case someone looks up the claim by popular name.</p>
<p>OK, how about this. A lot of machine claims will fall into categories e.g. water fuel cell, permanent magnet motor etc (steorn?).</p>
<p>Create a page on perpetual motion machine claims (distinct from the page describing the meaning of perpetual motion), which is essentially a table or list of the popular names/orignators of the claims against links to a generalised description of the claim (and debunking etc). Then in the table/list you can be put how the specific claim varies against the generalised description.</p>
<p>This will stop similar claims proliferating as sets of pages under differing names and avoid the requirement to debunk each claim individually.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I withdraw my article as I see it's too controversial to ever remain. I see I'm not going to win this one and I don't want to annoy anyone. I think though you need a better policy on dealing with perpetual motion machine claims than "delete" as they'll just keep coming back from different people. I think there is benefit in listing claims by popular name as that's what people will Google on. --kesfan 15:03, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>— In the interest of full disclosure I'd previously found a PROD on the article and deleted it with the comment "PROD Removed - Easy to establish notability via Google - And not on Wiki:AfD yet." Now that it is on AfD, let me summarize my thoughts. Notability is always contentious, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notability (people)</a> is not Wikipedia policy so we have no absolute standard. However it is reasonable to accept its stated position that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> based on verifiable information from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Sources_b1a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Sources">reliable sources</a>, without straying into <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_Research_3347.html" title="Wikipedia:Original Research">original research</a>. My previous opinion holds. If the bad faith assertion LotLE makes is valid, that's unfortunate— I’d prefer to take this on face value as a challenge to notability— on simple notability Alex Martelli warrants space on Wikipedia.

<p>Article does not establish notablity of subject, as per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. People in Tampa, Florida may recognize this person, but he seems to have little notability beyond this limited area, since he is not working for a national television outlet. Additionally, there is nothing mentioned that would give him any national or international notablity, all the Google hits are related to his work at his television station and seem to be all on Florida based websites. I have never been to Tampa and I have never heard of him, and I am guessing that he will fail the name recognition test when people not from Tampa, Florida are asked He fails the widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers test, the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field test, the multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers test, the large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following test, the commercial endorsements test, the independent biography test, the persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events test (being a TV weatherman seems not to be involvement), the person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person test, the 100 year test (future speculation), the 100 year test (past speculation), and finally the autobiography test, as this been written by someone closely involved with the subject. <a href="../../../w/e/v/User%7EWEVZ_b980.html" title="User:WEVZ">WEVZ</a> 20:04, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>(ec) <b>Keep</b>. The spirit of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is to keep us from having to maintain pages on every small company that would like more visibility by having an article on Wikipedia. This is a large mall. There's no danger of not having <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> information; newspaper articles get written about malls all the time. As an example, <a href="http://www.cmmonline.com/news.asp?mode=4&amp;N_ID=35537" class="external text" title="http://www.cmmonline.com/news.asp?mode=4&amp;N_ID=35537" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an article about a labour dispute there. Frankly, I'm not at all sure what "not notable" means in terms of shopping malls, but I don't think it would be outrageous if we have articles for each of the ten largest shopping malls in the capital city of Canada. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 21:26, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>By the way: The beauty of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is that you <i>don't have to know</i> what notability means for shopping malls, because you don't judge the notability yourself. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">You let the world do it</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:33, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Can we judge shopping malls by whether or not they are traded on a well known index? That doesn't make sense to me.

<li>Isn't that trying to say the same thing as "we need <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to write an article"? If it isn't, I suspect it should. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 21:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sources aren't verifiable. It is <i>articles</i> that are or are not verifiable.

<li><a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a>'s point was that when you do a makeshift page move by copying and pasting text rather than using the move function, you break apart the logs and histories.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The truth is Tube Poker is a multi- award wining fake documentary.

And it is widely publicised and known about throughout the W.W.W. It is a case of life imitating art</li>

<li>Generally, no, because Jeopardy is not about the contestants personally. A viewer watching Jeopardy learns about 30(?) seconds of information about an individual contestant. There's virtually no independent coverage of contestants (e.g. not counting the show itself as a source), so virtually nothing verifiable could ever be said about a Jeopardy contestant (beyond winnings). However, the *entire* Big Brother show is about the contestants lives. More signficantly, there is ample independent coverage, which allows for a proper neutral verifiable biography on the person. As a simple test, watch both shows. Then, search for independent information on all the participants. You will then learn the difference between them. A good litmus test for determining if you can write a biogrpahy on a show participant, is to ask: what if the person and the show lied about everything in their personal life. Would anybody notice? In the case of Jeopardy, (usually) nobody would know or care if somebody gave bogus bio information on themselves. However, in case of Big Brother, people will know and care very often, and discrepancies will be reported on. Now, if the lives of Jeopardy contestants eventually gains a comparable degree of independent coverage, than I would change my views on it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:37, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>if you ask me i think this should stay because wikipedia is all about sharing facts not about deleting the little guy fine go ahead and delete cause were not some big hot shots but that will just prove my point that the world is stupid and its no longer about the art or the music. Wikipedia is just a place for us to share the thoughts behind a unique sound. It sounds like school of rock but hey that movie is right lets think about the art. I think it would be a major mistake.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Weber_eed6.html" title="Amy Weber">Amy Weber</a> is much more notable at this moment than the one I just flagged for deletion.

<dd>Maybe it helps a tiny bit, but being signed to a contract means that there is no gaurantee that she will have any role in future WWE programming, even being in the development territories does not promise instant notability.

<p>A title used at one academic institution; not at all notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not some obscure community college; it's a place where no one gets this title without being more than sufficiently notable to have a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Comment</b> First off, I did sign this nomination, in writing "Delete as nominator" for the first recommendation. Next, the implication of this AfD is not that the people who hold this title are not notable, just that an entire article <i><b>on the title itself</b></i> is not notable. Honestly, beyond the short definition and list of people, what else could possibly be added to the article? This really can't expand beyond a dictionary definition. And furthermore, what stands to be gained by maintaining this article alongside <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_people_e280.html" title="List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology people">List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology people</a>, where all the same information resides?

<ul>
<li>"what else could possibly be added...?" is rash. The history of the title, the process by which these persons are appointed, the politics of appointments, the duties of Institute Professors (<a href="../../../i/s/i/Isidore_Singer_7b89.html" title="Isidore Singer">Isidore Singer</a> told me that he has "no formal duties" (although he was required to write an annual report on his professional activities; I presume this includes research papers published in journals, seminar talks, courses taught (he's not required to teach, but of course that doesn't automatically mean he doesn't), etc.), salaries, perhaps as compared with other professors, effects of conferring of this title (have the the professors become more productive in research because they don't have any "formal duties" such as teaching, or less, because they're more secure than they were?), etc. Many more things can be said! <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:21, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough, but the fact remains that none of that information is here yet. As of right now, this page is redundant with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_people_e280.html" title="List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology people">List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology people</a>. New pages are created to expand on a topic when the information in a broader article grows too large and unwieldy, not preemptively with the expectation or hope that expansion will occur later on. This article is nearly three years old; it's not like it's a young creation that hasn't yet been given a chance to bloom. I suspect that if the information you suggest including was already available from a reliable source, it would have been included by now; that it hasn't indicates to me that there aren't many or any sources available that comment on those aspects of this professorship. Consequently, I don't think that we should hang around with this article hoping that such sources will crop up. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 01:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Merge</b> — although the Institute Professors themselves are no doubt notable, I find it hard to see why the title itself is worth an article. A mention in the article on the professors, of course, and a sentence in the list of faculty and/or the MIT article, seem sufficient. Plus, I would add a Category:MIT Institute Professors as a subcategory of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Category%7EMassachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_faculty_dca4.html" title="Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty">Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty</a>. As a test of notability, a simple question: is there any article on the title <i>per se</i> (rather than one of the professors) from a source other than MIT?

<li><b>Commen</b> Good god, man, what do you have against this article? Did an Institute Professor kill your uncle?&#160;;-) I have no idea how to address notability. Not every article in an encyclopedia is as notable as others, but I think it's fair to assume that anybody who reads about an IP might be interesting in knowing what that is. Now, as for why we can't move over material on the details of IP: if you were interested in finding out what IP means, would you expect to find it in a List of MIT People? No, you wouldn't. You'd probably hope there were an article on IP. Heck, you might not even know that IP is an MIT thing. As for not citing sources, I did mention which MIT document the information is from in the text. I just didn't bother to find an online reference. I should do that. But do you've been saying all along the whole problem is redundency of information. That's been solved with what I think is useful information. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirge_4ea5.html" title="User:Birge">Birge</a> 16:18, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't have anything <i>against</i> this article, and I take exception to the idea you imply that I am just coming up with reasons to oppose its existence: while redundancy of information is important, the first sentence in my proposal deals with the issue of notability. In that regard, you seem to think that an abstract person who might "hope there were an article on IP" makes this article's subject notable. Please read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>: "A topic has notability if it is known outside a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact." I think that the MIT community would definitely be considered a narrow group, and I can't imagine that the subject of an institute professor would be of importance to anyone who isn't an MIT student or faculty member. Besides, under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html#North_American" title="Professor">Professor#North American</a>, there is a quick list of these types of appointments, because they vary by institution and don't each deserve separate treatment. I support its deletion because it serves no purpose but to clutter up Wikipedia andto repeat information already available at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_people_e280.html" title="List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology people">List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology people</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">Professor</a>, and because neither Wikipedia nor its users have anything to gain by keeping it. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 20:16, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The thing is, you do keep changing what you focus on. If somebody argues that it's notable, you say the big problem is that it's redundent. And when I point out that it's easy to fix the redundency, than all of a sudden your biggest problem is that it's not notable. Well, if something is worth putting in the MIT People list, than it's worth putting in the correct place. If you think having information about what an Institute Professor is is worth having SOMEWHERE in Wikipedia, than I think it's worth having as its own short article to make it easy to find. And it's interesting beyond the MIT community (though perhaps not for many people, but then again neither is <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_Theory_97c0.html" title="Group Theory">Group Theory</a>) for the same reason Harvard's presidential antics are of interest to people outside Harvard. I think there's a vast difference between the Morris Schmenkman professorship at the Southern Glouchester Vocational College and Community Reading Room and Institute Professor at MIT, because the latter comes up in other articles because of the stature of those involved. All such professors are worthy of their own articles, and those articles will probably mention their position as IPs. It would be nice to have a link to an explanation of what IP is and why it means something rather than a link to the MIT People page, don't you think? <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirge_4ea5.html" title="User:Birge">Birge</a> 21:03, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

Basically, the difference is the title of the page, and I have much fewer notability qualms about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_people_e280.html" title="List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology people">List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology people</a>. Again, I point you back to the definition of notability. You say that this article can "interesting beyond the MIT community," which is absolutely true, but <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> involves information that <i>is known</i> or <i>should be known</i> beyond a small community; very different from being found <i>interesting</i> by others. I highly doubt that the title of Institute Professor <i>is</i> well-known beyond MIT, and I would be surprised if that title has any <i>importance or impact</i> beyond the school, either (being careful to distinguish between the professors who hold the title and the title itself; I know that a professor <i>having</i> such a title might have impact). I think that this information is worth keeping "somewhere" on Wikipedia because it <i>is</i> important <i>within the context</i> of MIT professors and MIT itself, and so would be perfectly acceptable as a section in such an article.<br />
Regarding focus: of course I have changed subject based on what people have cited when objecting to the deletion. That's called responding to their specific ideas and making direct counterarguments, not trying to weasel out of the argument. I defy you to show me an example of my saying that any one issue with this article is "the big problem" as you claim. If someone votes "Keep" because they find it notable, then I remind them that that isn't the only problem I noticed and I ask them to address the other ones. You did a good job in adding more information to reduce redundancy, but I also ask you about eliminating notability problems. I'm waiting for a good solution that solves all the problems I brought up, and when one appears in a satisfactory fashion, I will change my vote to Speedy Keep and withdraw the nomination. If any of the problems remain unsolved, then this article qualifies for deletion. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 22:01, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, looking at the notability page I think I'm starting to be swayed, especially by the fact that there are really no articles elsewhere on institute professorship that aren't directly from MIT, which makes an NPOV difficult. So, while personally I think it's a good article to have, I do agree that it's a close call with regard to some of the criteria for notability provided my Wikipedia (which are often contradictory, I should point out). I think you're wrong about it being of no importance, but I do agree there isn't enough outside information on it. So, I guess my problem is with Wikipedia, which seems content to always being behind the ball on any subject given that they will only consider something notable if a bunch of other sources already cover it, as well. But given my current ambivalence about this, I'll switch my vote to merge. Is it considered fair to delete one's own vote? <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirge_4ea5.html" title="User:Birge">Birge</a> 02:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> MIT is not a "narrow interest group" even if MIT is <i>narrow</i> (in the sense of having only 10,000 students and fewer faculty). An "interest group" can consist of <i>all</i> persons interested in a particular topic. But many more people would be interested in this topic than just the members of this "narrow" group. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 21:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Please see my response to <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirge_4ea5.html" title="User:Birge">Birge</a> above on notability; it does not deal with people "interested" in something, it deals with whether people <i>know</i> or <i>should know</i> about the subject because of its importance. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 22:01, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're splitting hairs. When I say someone is "interested" in something, I mean the same thing as if I'd said it is important to them and they should know about it. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:12, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not splitting hairs, I am pointing out an important distinction that you keep missing.

<li><b>Comment</b> Add two more sourced paragraphs and I think its a keep. By the way, altho sources that are on the web are more useful, sources are still sources even if they are dusty books on a shelf. They only must be widely available to the public to count as a source, so a handout not even at an MIT library doesn't count and a source <i>only</i> found in Massechusetts (eg at an MIT library) is questionable. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 21:16, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Dylan wrote "I can't imagine that the subject of an institute professor would be of importance to anyone who isn't an MIT student or faculty member." That's just silly. Dylan's lack of ability to imagine things is of no interest or relevance to this discussion. There are perfectly obvious reasons why persons not affiliated with MIT would have use for this information. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:12, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Saying "I imagine" is obviously a rhetorical device, and you are again missing the point. People could certainly "have use for" the details of my own life: friends, family, employers, coworkers, and classmates, to name a few. But the reason why I have a Facebook account instead of a Wikipedia biography is because I'm not a notable individual in the larger world. <b>This has nothing to do with anybody finding information about title of Institute Professor interesting or enlightening or intriguing or useful. It has to do with whether the title is important or relevant to the average reader</b>. That the only sources provided are MIT publications suggests to me that this is certainly an important subject to people at MIT, but not to anyone else. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 00:57, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <b>average</b> reader? Why the <b>average</b> reader? Why not the reader interested in academia or in MIT? Most of the math articles are probably not of interest to the average reader.

<li><b>Comment</b> I was using the phrase "the average reader" to try to make it simpler to understand, but in retrospect it was a rather misleading term. The idea is that the subject needs to be important <b>in general</b>, to the world as a whole. Mathematics articles like <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_theory.html" title="Group theory">Group theory</a> are important in general because a variety of mathematicians have studied it, there are numerous and diverse academic papers and books on it, and because it's generally acknowledged by the scientific community to be a significant area of study. Other mathematics articles that might not bear the same widespread acknowledgement might still be notable because they are considered a groundbreaking if burgeoning area of research. You keep coming back to this criterion of the subject being "of interest to" somebody. No matter how <i>interesting</i> the title of Institute Professor or, or how much it is <i>of interest</i> to some people, I still have not seen anyone in the AfD put forth a good reason why or how it has been considered to be notable <i>beyond Cambridge</i>. If it were, I would expect non-MIT sources to have commented on it, or at <i>least</i> an MIT source to do so beyond a cursory definition (none of the provided external links do more than that). <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 11:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Beyond Cambridge" there are people interested in the geography of academia. Let's say a clerical assistant to the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Somewhere is writing to Professor X at MIT to invite him to speak at the commencement. Might it not be useful for the assistant to know whom he's writing to and understand what Professor X's title of "Institute Professor" means? Then a journalist writing about Professor X's forthcoming appearance as the speaker would find it useful too. Do you think no one at other institutions ever communicates with anyone at MIT? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 20:02, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I thought my ability to imagine "let's say" and "might it...be" hypotheticals was of no relevance to this AfD. You are suggesting times when it would be <i>useful</i> to know what an Institute Professor is. I am challenging you to give reasons why this title is <i>important</i> outside of MIT, why this title has an <i>enduring impact</i> beyond MIT. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 20:21, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>No, I said you <b>in</b>ability to imagine such things is of no interest (you had asserted that you lack any such ability). I gave some reasons for importance to people outside of MIT. Why do you then assert that I did not? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 20:33, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I say that because you gave scenarios when it would useful to know what an IP is, not why the title is important. If friend that I went to high school with might want to contact me, knowing my address would be <i>useful</i>, but not make my address <i>important</i> in the real world. I don't know why you cannot understand that distinction; I really have no way of distilling the explanation any further. Important is different from useful. We are looking for an article that is important in the world in general, not just useful to anyone. FAQ lists, instruction manuals, and travel guides are all <i>useful</i>, but they are <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">prohibited</a> from Wikipedia.

<li>I understand very well. You're the one who's failing to understand. Your friend's phone number is useful to you but not to the public. Usefulness to the public entails "importance" and "notability" in the present sense. This information is useful, not just to some specific person that we can now identify, but to many who may some day be situated as in my examples or otherwise will be navigating their way through academia. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 18:29, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability policy</a> is not based on imagining future users' reactions to AfDs.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no official notability policy! Quit dishonestly implying there is. In fact, this whole issue of notability is up for debate, so it's not fair for you to invoke some sort of "policy" which doesn't exist while dismissing others' reasons as not relevent. In the end, we should be bound by our good judgement, given that there is no hard and fast rule for notability, nor is it an official policy. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirge_4ea5.html" title="User:Birge">Birge</a> 08:22, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's true, but the concept of notability has very widespread acceptance among editors and while not considered "official" by the Foundation, is a guideline accepted by most. I didn't mean to imply that we were bound by a holy, official rule, but virtually every Wikipedia editor recognizes it is an important <a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">guideline</a> for editing. The concept of notability appears multiple times in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> (which <i>is</i> official policy) and is generally considered an extension of "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information." No one would hestitate to delete a well-written, NPOV, cited article about the fire hydrant in front of my house because it isn't <i>official</i> policy to do so.<br />
I apologize if my arguments mislead you in that direction; I honestly didn't mean to do so. Hopefully the fact that I linked <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> multiple times (and encouraged people to read it) might suggest that I wasn't attempting to conceal the actual classification of the concept. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 11:10, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The problem is, the concept of notability may have widespread acceptance, but the definition does not, nor is it at all accepted as applied towards deciding to keep an article versus merge it. I accept that you weren't trying to decieve people, but it certainly appeared that you were when the title of your link to the notability essay was "notability policy" when it's not policy. In fact, that same page lists both sides of the debate, and draws no final conclusions. In the end, I'm not sure what the problem is. You argue that it's not notable enough for it's own article, but is notable enough to have somewhere in Wikipedia. You say that it will clutter wikipedia, but if the information is going to be in wikipedia regardless, isn't it less cluttered if it's organized into its own article, where people are free to ignore it and will never come upon it unless they follow a link or search for it? To me, it seems that wikipedia is best served by dividing things into more, rather than fewer, articles, because that keeps information better organized and less overwhelming. There's no reason we should divide Wikipedia like a paper encyclopedia, since search and linking is instantaneous. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirge_4ea5.html" title="User:Birge">Birge</a> 18:19, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
