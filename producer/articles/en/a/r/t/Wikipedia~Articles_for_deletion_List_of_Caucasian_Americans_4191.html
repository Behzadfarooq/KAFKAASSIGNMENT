<li>I beg to differ. I'm quite bright and I cannot put myself in any of those lists and I wouldn't put myself in the European American category either as I'm not entirely European American. I'm white, but I've got about a sixteenth Native American in me. not to mention a sixteenth or thirty-second of every western european country and scandinavian. And I doubt I'm alone.

<li>None of the lists require purity of the blood. A noteworthy person who is like you ethnically can be placed in several lists. I think what you're wanting is something like a List of uncategorizable European-Americans or List of mixed ethnic people. I'm not convinced anyone you named on this list fits that. I also don't think this is the way to handle that. You make an interesting point, but sorry it just doesn't quite make the grade.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>(to Gateman1997) So will this overlap those other ones, or simply include those who cannot trace their ancestry, as you say?

<li><b>Emphatic delete</b> - this (and similarly-named) list is a meaningless exercise in futility. It fails on several fronts:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) The definition of the "races" is dubious at best (we all have descended from Africans. Some came to the US after Europe, after Asia, etc.). In many contexts, it is a political, not a social or genetic, difference.</p>
<p>2) The distinction between races is also arbitrary at best. As late as the 1980s (maybe later, but I'm not sure), Louisiana State law required a placement of "Black" on a person's driver's license - regardless of appearance - if the person is at least 1/32 black. Do <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paula_Abdul_c06c.html" title="Paula Abdul">Paula Abdul</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halle_Berry_1870.html" title="Halle Berry">Halle Berry</a> make this article? All have ancestors who lived in Europe.</p>
<p>3) The name of the article - List of Caucasian Americans - is much too vague. Who is going to visit the hospitals on an hourly basis to keep the list up to date?</p>
<p>4) And if you think my question in #3 is silly, so is the idea of having even a Partial list of Caucasian Americans... and I also extend that argument to any "List of **** Americans" on Wikipedia for that same reason. Adding "notable" or "famous" might not make it better, but the title should mention why the individuals on the list deserve to be singled out on Wikipedia besides their so-called race.</p>
<p>5) As far as I am concerned, there is only one race of people on Earth: the human race.</p>

<ul>
<li>1) Your feelings on race are irrelevant in the eyes of most governments on the face of this planet. I agree we're all humans when it comes down to it... but that's not the way our governments see it. 2) And the distinction is ambiguous to a point, however as you point out there are limits placed on what constitutes a race for a person. However for the sake of this list Hallie Berry could make a case for being put on it. 3) The name of the list is also just as it should be. To be on Wikipedia a person has to be notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> so to make the list it is implied a person is notable. 4)Point three isn't silly, just misinformed. 5) As I said in point one, the US, Canadian, UK, French, Russian, South African, etc, etc... governments disagree with you.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 06:27, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> B.Wind, with regard to number 2. Paula Abdul is 1/2 of Jewish American. Mariah Carey is 1/2 Irish American. Halle Berry is 1/2 English American. Race, just like religion, seems to be in the eye of the beholder. Halle Berry, for example, would probably take issue being called <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian.html" title="Caucasian">Caucasian</a> even if she is 1/2 white (<a href="http://racerelations.about.com/od/celebritiesandrace/a/hollywoodtoday.htm" class="external text" title="http://racerelations.about.com/od/celebritiesandrace/a/hollywoodtoday.htm" rel="nofollow">url</a>). On the other hand, why would it matter if she is labeled on both the Caucasian page and African American page anyway? Both are correct. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackJandy_33ec.html" title="User:HackJandy">HackJandy</a> 08:10, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
