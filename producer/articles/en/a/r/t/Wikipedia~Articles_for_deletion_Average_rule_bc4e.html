<dd>Well, it's pretty clear he created it (see my reasons above), and he and his alter ego have been monkeying around with topics concerning democracy ever since which shows his interest in the democratic process.</dd>

<dd>I agree. If they don't have encyclopedic relevance, they must all go.

Is it because you are a fascist and you are burning books? <s>I suggest as decision method to be used the Average rule, I also suggest the decision to be valid as long as the average rule requires, I also suggest 25% of Active Vfd voters to vote in this poll in 5 days, in order for the decision to be legitimate.</s> <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 08:21, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not the forum to discuss voting policy, as has already been explained to Iasson. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Iasson_d2ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Iasson">RfC</a> (also note I added this comment after the ones below it). — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker দ</a> (<a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">talk</a>) 21:50, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is no time-based rule regarding the deletion of articles, and an article doesn't become any more encyclopedic if it happens to stay alive in the Wikipedia for any length of time. The reasons expressed here for its deletion appear to be valid. So instead of complaining about book burning, how about addressing the concerns? And if you can't address them, just accept the judgement and how Wikipedia is organized. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman">Stevietheman</a> 08:46, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Policy bullshits! I am asking you to show me an active poll where the active wikipedians have voted and they still keep valid a decision that says that original research is prohibited from wikipedia. Can you point to that poll? Or, is the prohibition of original research just another decision of the administration cabal? <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 09:26, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. As I understand it, this is a founding principal of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 09:36, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see. We have to find the reasons why the administration cabal insist of keeping such a principal. Is this founding principal by chance? Is it because administration's plans are to create the best encyclopedia in the world and sell it somewhere someday, and they want us to create articles in their encyclopedia for free, but of course without beeing able to tranform their encyclopedia to something else because this is against their business plans? I cant find another reason but maybe you can help me a little to find one, and I am in good faith to believe it. Of course there is also the possibility that this is NOT a founding principal as you claim. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 10:00, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that they could do as you suggest, because of the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a> Wikipedia uses (see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>). It is normal for an encyclopedia to contain no original research, as it is a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a> not a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>. There is, however, a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fork_%28software%29.html" title="Fork (software)">fork</a> called <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">wikinfo</a> that apparently does allow orignal research. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>
<ul>
<li>What is going on here? Original research is always considered to be a reason to delete an article in Vfd! Why nobody proposes to move original research articles to wikinfo, and everybody here proposes for every original research article to be deleted? This is another proof that the deletionist gang band has overcome wikipedia. If the owner of wikipedia is not a cabal member, he must uproot deletionist cancer gang band from wikipedia's heart, and he must do it as soon as possible. <b>And dont mention to me undelete policy bullshits. How a newcomer can vote for an article to be undeleted, if he cannot read it?</b> <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 11:05, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Probably because Wikinfo is not a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> project. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 11:11, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Aha!..ok then...as I can see wikinfo and secondary_source are sister projects of wikipedia and they welcome original research articles. Thats good! So I propose as a policy, all proposed for deletion original research articles to be moved there insteed of deleted. Then if voted for undeletion, they should return back to wikipedia. And of course if somenoe asks wikipedia about a deleted original research article, wikipedia should point to its sister projects with a warning that this was an ostracized article. If you want to convince me that you are not a deletionist gang band that want to overcome wikipedia and turn a supposed edited by anyone encyclopedia to an encyclopedia that supports your deletionist gang band POV, you HAVE to support as a policy what I am proposing you. If you dont, this proves that you are a deletionist gang band, and every rational human person can understand this. I am not supporting the average rule article right now, I am supporting all the past articles you have already deleted, and the future you are going to. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 11:49, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>You appear to have misunderstood what I meant in my previous comment. Wikinfo is <i>not</i> a sister project to wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 12:13, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what about secondary_source? I consider your answer as an acceptance that you are a deletionist gang band that wants to turn wikipedia to an encyclopedia that , although supposed to be edited by anyone and support NPOV, contains articles that are compatible only with the POV of your deletionist gang band. Nice try, troll guys, but you are not going to win against all rational human persons. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 12:21, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I've suggested to several authors that they check out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>, and strongly suggest it to you too. You can even write signed articles there, but you don't need to sign articles. I've transwikied one article there myself and intend to do more, but it's far better if the author does it, and the copying is automated and very easy provided you do it before they are deleted here. So I hope to see you and your theories there. But be aware that most of the policies of Wikinfo are based on Wikipedia, and your behaviour here would not go down well there either.

<li>And I am saying to you that, for now on, I am going to cast peculiar votes in all proposed for deletion articles. It is finnaly clear to me that your Vfd policy is against NPOV, and as long as I am a strong advocate of NPOV I want to destroy anything that is against it. Be prepared, my peculiar votes are going to flood your POV Vfd policy and procedure, until an administrator bans me. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 12:36, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

The fact that nobody of them have ever asked the article to be deleted, means that <b>those 10 persons at least have cast a keep or abstain vote</b>. Not to mention also the other people in this 6 month period who read the article and did not propose it for deletion. All those people obviously are a keep or abstain vote for the article.

<li>What you mean your rules? You mean the rules that your deletionist gang band have created and imposed to all the others? Where is the poll that shows that current deletion policy is voted by all active wikipedia voters, and also all active wikipedia voters still keep their vote alive in your current deletion policy? You cannot point to that poll, simply because deletion policy has been created by 10-20 people and an administrator cabal, in order to destroy the work of the others, any work that is against gang band's belief or against its plans. This is clear to me, and I am not going to bother with your gang band anymore. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 10:11, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thankyou, but I'm sure I speak for the rest too.

<p><b>Comment</b> I was personally intending to nominate Average rule for deletion myself—only after I had gotten replies to a query I sent to some of the other editors of the article, precisely because I was interested in the fact that so many people had looked at it over a period of six months without themselves nominating it. I asked:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm thinking of nominating Average rule for deletion on the grounds that it is a neologism and original research. This article has existed since August 2004 without anyone questioning it or proposing it for deletion. Do you think it's legitimate? Do you know of any reasons I shouldn't nominate it for deletion?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So far I've gotten <s>two</s> three replies.
<dl>
<dd>Michael Hardy replied: "I don't know much about politicial philosophy, but my gut reaction is to suspect you're right." Stevietheman replied "Well, I didn't know whether or not it was legitimate, but I did some work at some point to clean it up. I think the original author of this article also created other works and contributions to articles I've been unsure of (like to Majoritarianism). I don't see why you shouldn't submit Average rule for deletion."</dd>
<dd>Jmartinezot says "I edited that article just to remove a blank before a comma, so I will agree with the final decision about deletion or not."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Generally, the other editors were wikifying, correcting text, editing for clarity. I don't think any of them were making content judgements. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:58, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My edits were only to clean up the article, and do in no way whatsoever endorse the content as encyclopedic.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Neologism, original research, no citations presented. The strongest argument is made in the article itself: "Average rule has never been tried as a political regime in human history, but also not even a single community has ever tried to implement it." The kindest interpretation I can make of Iasson's conduct is that he has constructed some novel and complex systems for group decision-making, which may or may not have real theoretical merit as a way of extracting a judgement from a group of people, but which are too utterly impractical to merit serious consideration... and that he was hoping that he could convince Wikipedia to adopt these methods. This material could go on Iasson's user page—assuming, as I do, that he is the author—but it is not suitable for the main encyclopedia namespace. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:58, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am not the author of that article, but I am willing to offer hospitality to it in my personal page, as long as it is a very good argument in my RFC against the tyranny of the deletionist gang band majority that want me to stop casting my peculiar votes. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 14:50, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>I am not the author of that article</i>. Riiiiiight. It's just an amazing coincidence that the IP number of its creator is an IP number you've used.</li>
<li><i>as long as it is a very good argument in my RFC</i>. It's clearly an appeal to authority you made up out of whole cloth, so it's not only NOT a very good argument, it demonstrates the bankruptcy of your defense, such as it is. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 15:26, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a somewhat interesting proposal, but so impractical that I cannot imagine its ever being adopted for human group deliberations, even if it could be shown that it was better at identifing the will or the judgement of a group of people than traditional voting methods. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> if you are interested in promoting the use of this rule, or have a general interest in voting methods, then you <i>should</i> consider copying this material to your user page, as it is a place within Wikipedia where you could keep it and people could read it if they were interested. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 16:34, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
