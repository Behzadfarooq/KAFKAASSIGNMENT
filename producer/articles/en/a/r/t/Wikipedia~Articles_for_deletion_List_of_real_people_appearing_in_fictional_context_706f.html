<p>A list we cannot possibly hope to write well. This has got to be the longest Wikipedia list I have ever seen, and it's probably, at best, 5% complete. There is an entire genre of writing called <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_fiction.html" title="Historical fiction">Historical fiction</a> which exists to portray real people in fictional contexts. Even keeping the list down to figures prominently featured in the works, this would still imply that every Historical novel written should be listed on the page at least a half-dozen or so times. And of course, the list does not stick to the limits set in the introduction, but has grown beyond all reason. There were 28 listings, for instance, of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a>, which I guarantee does not really feature any real person prominently, with the possible exception of Adam West (which by the way is not listed). What this article is, really, is about a hundred trivia articles rolled into one. The page has been listed on AfD previously: see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Litefantastic_Files_7f8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Litefantastic Files">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Litefantastic Files</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_real_people_appearing_in_fictional_context_06c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of real people appearing in fictional context">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of real people appearing in fictional context</a>. It was kept in both cases, but the problems with the article have only gotten worse. I'd mark it with a cleanup tag, but I honestly can't think what would make this a reasonable article. Forking out sections based on what kind of real people appear doesn't seem much better. Perhaps an article featuring only older works? But that seems arbitrary, and is a heck of a lot of work to distil from this article. We could restrict to only books, or only movies, but this wouldn't cut down the list much... and we could try to restrict to only particuarly important works, but systemic bias will kill us there. I see deletion as the only way to fix the situation. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:28, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Impossible to maintain. Just listing the works that Julius Caesar appears in is close to impossible. (If there's useful information for individual people in this list, it might be beneficial to split some of those off.) <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 06:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete'</b> couldn't we just split this off into articles for the most notable/frequent appearing ones? <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 06:19, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see the list ever being usefull, and it would never be even close to complete. For example, look at shows that have had frequest guest stars like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Love_Boat_244d.html" title="The Love Boat">The Love Boat</a> (Love Boat had one like every week). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 06:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: unmaintainable; but I like the suggestion that individual smaller lists should be split off for historical figures who are also notable for having been particularly frequently portrayed in fiction. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 13:37, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and strongly oppose splitting up the list into smaller lists for individual people. Such "...in popular culture" articles almost invariably turn into crap magnets and many of them end up right back here and deleted. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:11, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Split</b> article. I disagree with the statement made by Otto4711. I have no problem with "...in popular culture" articles; while some have been AFD's they have not always been deleted. Such a list is viable and encyclopedic. What it needs is structure. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:39, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Merely saying to "split" without explaining how isn't that helpful. How? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:00, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would think that would be self-evident from looking at the article. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:28, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay. Now I know what you mean, anyway, but I don't think it would be good. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 14:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There does seem to be an animus in certain circles against separate articles about the representations of historical figure in fiction or popular culture. How, then, is this information going to be preserved? A catch-all list for those figures who don't warrant separate articles serves the indexing, cross-referencing, and browsing functions. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:22, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
