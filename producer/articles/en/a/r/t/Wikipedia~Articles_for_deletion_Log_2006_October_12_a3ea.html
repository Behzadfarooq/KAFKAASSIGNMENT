<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> for now. Yes, I tend to agree the article is mainly a dictionary definition when you remove the wide generalizations. Then again, the article is better referenced than it was before this process. I guess my main problem with the article is that it is such a pedestrian topic that I would never touch it, or care whether or not it gets deleted (which is why I'm your guy to close this, I guess.)</p>
<p>As to the argument between Pan Dan and Mister.Manticore (the battle of the funky usernames) I generally think that a "pet peeve" is in the eye of the beholder. To me the term implies a very specific irritation that one person has, which is not likely to piss off many other people. I think Pan Dan thinks something similar, hence his disagreement with the sources' more general usages of the term. The subjective use of the term itself is probably the biggest problem with this article's continuing existence, but the references are the only thing we have to go off of as far as how the term is used. (Is the term used differently regionally? Put that in the article!) For the next debate, the subjective nature of the term itself should be considered more carefully. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="orange">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="black">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="orange">ka</font></a> 09:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That source falls into the "discusses its etymology" category (see my comment above). It's almost entirely a rather expansive discussion of the meaning and etymology of "peeve" (and we already have articles on <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a> in general and <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back-formation.html" title="Back-formation">back-formation</a> in particular). There's one sentence about when "pet peeve" first appeared in print. All of this is dictionary material. The final sentence speculating about why "pet peeve" became popular--whatever the merits of that explanation--is not substantive enough to justify an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, this isn't a vote. It's not me you have to convince, it's the closing admin! But I suppose if there were reliable non-trivial sources that discuss either pet peeves themselves (like some of the sources for "road rage" at <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_rage.html" title="Road rage">Road rage</a> or some of the articles <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22road+rage%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22road+rage%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">here</a>), or that discuss the use of the term "pet peeve," then I would change my opinion. As to whether the Word Detective blurb is a reliable source: in my view its content can't justify keeping the article, so there's no point in me committing to an opinion on whether it's reliable. As for your comment on etymology, that's what dictionaries are for. I note that using your reasoning we could have a Wikipedia entry for every single word whose etymology is known. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but I can't talk with an admin who hasn't decided to act yet, but I can interact with you. Which might in turn influence that theoretical admin's action in the future. If you want to ask whether there are some non-trivial sources on pet peeves, well, I looked at scholar.google.com and I found a lot of articles that I would say are about pet peeves. Like <a href="http://apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed2.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which describes a study that set out to find student's pet peeves. (Or the one from an insurance company that's already on the page). Plus this page <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300099711&amp;id=ING9Y81oJT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Pet+Peeves&amp;sig=Ex1Y_NBLnG3A_EpSjHenL5o78oI" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300099711&amp;id=ING9Y81oJT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Pet+Peeves&amp;sig=Ex1Y_NBLnG3A_EpSjHenL5o78oI" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> indicates that the authors of that book did a study on it. And yes, where it is important or interesting, a given phrase or term might well deserve an entry with its etymology. In this case, it is more than just saying "Pet Peeve means a personal irritation" . Check the English-language idioms category for lots more similar articles. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>The references you link to are about <i>general</i> annoyances, not <i>pet</i> peeves, which by definition are peculiar to individuals.</b> The first ref misapplies the term "pet peeve," and the second doesn't use it at all (at least not in the title, which is all I can see). So the contents of both of these fine sources could not support <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_peeve.html" title="Pet peeve">Pet peeve</a> (but could go into Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> once it is shown that they got some <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> to show that they're not trivial or wacko).

<dd>The refences I cited specifically said they were looking for pet peeves, for example, the insurance company looked for people's pet peeves about driving, and the APA article also described their study that way. And the author of this <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300099711&amp;id=ING9Y81oJT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Pet+Peeves&amp;sig=Ex1Y_NBLnG3A_EpSjHenL5o78oI" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300099711&amp;id=ING9Y81oJT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Pet+Peeves&amp;sig=Ex1Y_NBLnG3A_EpSjHenL5o78oI" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]who is actually a Ph. D. in Social Psychology. I don't know if she got any peer review, but it was published by the Yale Press, so I'm inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt. Sure, I'd love more context, but as I don't have the book at home, I'll just have to go with the page that google has, which says among other things "Because my students and I were interested in the actual content of people's pet peeves and because most....we conducted a study on pet peeves in close relationships. Now that you bring up <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> though, I don't see how that article is particularly different from this one.

<dd>"The references...specifically said...pet peeves"--My point above was that those folks are misapplying the term. They meant general annoyances, not pet peeves. As to the book you cited, again, I said above that there's no indication that it's about pet peeves. As to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> being problematic, yes, there is some stuff about etymology of the word "annoyance" in the first sentence of that article that perhaps doesn't belong, but most of that article is about the <i>concept</i> of annoyance in psychology--not the word. <s>And it's cited. That material certainly does belong in Wikipedia.</s> Taking a closer look at that article, I see that some of the material there is uncited and possibly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>, which, yes, is a problem. As to combining the two articles: <i>some</i> of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> is encyclopedic, but <i>nothing</i> in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_peeve.html" title="Pet peeve">Pet peeve</a> is, so there's nothing to combine. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 03:19, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You claim they are misapplying the term. Well, that's a matter of disagreement, but feel free to make an argument as to why, because I just don't understand what you're talking about. And the book doesn't have to be entirely about pet peeves to indicate that it treated the subject of pet peeves with specificity, as it does on that page which I found through google. It also mentioned some other books on that page. Yes, I suppose you could argue that Pet Peeves is part of the larger subject of <b>annoyances</b>, but even if we did, it is still a specific word with its own origins, which people might well search for. But hey, I could be amenable with treating the subject of pet peeves in the Annoyance article, if that's what you want to propose. But we'd still need to define pet peeve and link back to annoyance, if only because the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_Peeve_5bc9.html" title="Pet Peeve">Piers Anthony book</a> isn't going anywhere, and I really don't feel comfortable with that article not having a disambig. Personally, I think that it should be moved to a different namespace, but that's another issue. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have bolded my explanation above of the difference between pet peeves and annoyances. "[D]reary, monotone lecturing" (from your ref #1) and being "teased, nagged, betrayed, or lied to" (ref #2) are things that annoy lots of people--they're not <i>pet</i> peeves. (The authors wanted to use the term "pet peeves," I suppose, because of the nifty alliteration referred to at Word Detective--it gets the reader's attention.) An example of a true pet peeve, by contrast, would be "People who type 'what-up!'" at <a href="http://www.peevepile.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peevepile.com/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (a ref in the nominated article). Because pet peeves are peculiar to individuals, something people talk about to shoot the breeze at internet forums, I doubt that anyone of any importance has undertaken a serious study of them. So, again, I don't think there's any non-trivial, non-OR way to "treat the subject of pet peeves in the Annoyance article," as you suggest, or in the article under discussion. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:32, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, but I'm afraid your differentiation isn't quite as solid as you think it is, as it seems to me, that many uses of pet peeve are not making that distiction. Uses that a bit more notable than you, such as an insurance research group and a scholar published by Yale. But if you think the point you make is well-supported by other sources, (or IOW, not OR on your part) it would seem to make for good content to add to the article. Perhaps it might qualify as a pet peeve itself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:55, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>My distinction isn't OR, it's based on the definition of pet peeve. But even assuming that the distinction isn't there, your sources discuss examples of pet peeves, not the overall phenomenon itself, and as such are not particularly strong to build an article on (whether an article on pet peeves or one on annoyances--note that <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> mainly discusses the overall psychological phenomenon, not examples of annoyances). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:20, 14 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it's based on what you feel the meaning of the word is, which may be true, perhaps, but if nobody has written about it, may make it OR. See <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimate.html" title="Decimate">Decimate</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catachresis.html" title="Catachresis">Catachresis</a> for more on that problem. At least some people have written about that. (In fact, it's a common pet peeve). Not as bad as when they use it as a <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropism</a> Still, if people are collating data on examples of pet peeves, writing news paper coloumns and even books on them, and otherwise talking about the issue, I think it makes it notable. Not that I think we should have List of Pet peeves mind you, as I agree, that would be ugly and unmaintainable. But sourcable material, that gets on CNN?

<li><b>Merge</b> the popular mods per Warfire-- I skimmed the TA page and did not see any mention of popular mods there so I'm guessing all that is relevant is here. I disagree that the <i>popular</i> mods would fall under advertising anymore than having TA itself here as an article would count as advertising for Cavedog entertainment. Move the information on popular mods (as judged by the article) to the TA page. Edit: I only found 1 mod mentioned in the TA page. So I vote Merge. Here is my proposal: Move Spring, Uberhack, and anything else considered significant to the TA page as brief mentions in the Extensibility section. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolberg_69b8.html" title="User:Solberg">Solberg</a> 03:10, 14 October 2006 (UTC)Solberg</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> I have added a couple of more sources to the external links section, and removed the hoax tag. This is not a hoax article, and I hear this term in use alot, especially by Rush Limbaugh.

<dd><b>Comment</b> see below. The source you point to as evidence of the claim's notability is itself a hoax. Rush may have said it, but he says a lot of stuff, most of it does not require an encyclopedia entry. Lexis nexis shows no use at all of this term since December 2004 in print newspaper sources.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <b>This is a hoax</b>. I read the CJR article about it and the writer is pretty clear that this is all the fault of a too-gullible reporter at the Boca Raton paper. He didn't check up on these articles apparently, and CJR ridicules him. I did some more research and the AHA reference is bogus; "Rob Gordon" at the "AHA" is a character from the movie <i>High Fidelity</i>. <a href="http://markbyron.typepad.com/main/2004/11/yes_you_are_a_p.html" class="external text" title="http://markbyron.typepad.com/main/2004/11/yes_you_are_a_p.html" rel="nofollow">This blog post</a> has some info. The Boca Raton paper refers to AHA as a Boca based organization; if it exists, it is a private organization, and not an organization endorsed by most health professionals in America, as the name would imply. I don't think this article should be kept, but if it is kept, it should be made clear that this is an example of small town journalism getting hoodwinked rather than of a recognized psychological condition.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 08:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Here's a longer explanation for my vote. As someone who reads some conservative blogs, I remember the coverage of this from November 2004 and I've noticed continuing references to it in those blogs. The "syndrome", the psychologist who coined it and the 2 or 3 newspaper stories about it are, IMO, way below Wikipedia's standards for notability. Getting mentioned by the <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Journalism_Review_5be6.html" title="Columbia Journalism Review">Columbia Journalism Review</a></i> is more significant, but still not enough for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:Notability</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Sources are very weak. Actress is a female who acts in theatrics. I can appear once or twice in some minor movies, and I'm actor. That doesn't infer much special(I could have been an extra). She was also a teacher and a social worker the article says. Sounds like she wasn't much of an actor. IMDB is very sparse. To me, it looks like she was hired a few times to sing in some Indian movies. Beyond that, I can't tell, and that's a bad sign. In playback recorder it claims that most films in Bollywood are musicals. Which makes her a dime a dozen in terms of singing in general. (All the actors either must sing or lipsync to playback records there) Can we get honest evidence to the contrary? The lists so far don't do much for me. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 02:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep and merge/create with Sabita Chowdhury</b> As far as I am aware, she is NOT an actress, she is a singer and a household name in at least <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bengal_be5b.html" title="West Bengal">West Bengal</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, I'll wager. The article body refers to a different individual that is non-notable but with the same name, hence the confusion but the references refer to Sabita (Banerjee) Chowdhury. So if the result of the debate is keep, I will rewrite it to reflect that. The filmography is incomplete because like most people here, at IMDB, people were not aware that the more famous Sabita Banerjee married Music Director <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salil_Chowdhury_ae6d.html" title="Salil Chowdhury">Salil Chowdhury</a> and was credited as <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabita_Chowdhury_a02f.html" title="Sabita Chowdhury">Sabita Chowdhury</a> afterwards.

I hope editors reconsider in light of this fact. Also there are 4860 hits on google for "Sabita Chowdhury", mostly for her, which will establish her notability as a singer, if the fact that her songs are available on iTunes, emusic, MSN, and a host of other sites is insufficient. On emusic.com there are 25 songs of hers available as a solo singer, she has eight other pairings with other singers. Incidentally, there is only one song available for her as <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabita_Banerjee_7b7b.html" title="Sabita Banerjee">Sabita Banerjee</a><a href="http://www.emusic.com/search.html?mode=x&amp;QT=sabita" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.emusic.com/search.html?mode=x&amp;QT=sabita" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe the teacher/actress is non-notable but the singer is notable. If we can agree on that then I'll rewrite the article deleting the current contents and focus on the Singer Sabita (Banerjee) Chowdhury.

<li><b>Delete</b> She's written a book and some articles that have been picked up in leftist and Arab publications some of which are notable. If she were writing about just about any topic other than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict she would easily fail notability guidelines. She gets some pretty big google numbers but I think that has more to do with the topic she's writing about than what she has to say. However, if we adapt the academic notability test and consider all of the people who regularly write about this issue she is certainly not more notable than the average person writing about the topic. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:42, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>reply</b> Let us know how you really feel. The analogy does not hold water. Notability criteria is NOT based on what is "good" for society at large. This person, I will assert, is far more important to us <i>vis-a-vis</i> her positive contribution to society, but that is <b>not a criteria</b> for inclusion in WikiPedia. The fact that a wider audience is aware of a Porn Actress than of a Wisconsin High School teacher means that the Porn Actress is actually <i>more</i> worthy of inclusion by the basic <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> guidlines. Being a good person is not the baseline notability guideline for inclusion. If it were, important figures like <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol_Pot_2322.html" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Dahmer_e378.html" title="Jeffrey Dahmer">Jeffrey Dahmer</a> would be unworthy of inclusion, while some of my buddies that are also High School teachers (some having won national awards even) would be worthy of inclusion. That's just silly. We don't have to like that people are notable for doing things that we find abhorrant. Do I think that Porn Actresses <i>should be</i> notable for what they do? My opinion doesn't matter. Society at large shows such an actresses notabilty, and wikipedia's inclusion of the subject matter is a reflection of that. Award-winning high school teachers are not as notable in the society at large. Is that right? Probably not. Is it the place of a document like WikiPedia to change that? Definately not. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 17:19, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Notable to me (1st hand knowledge of most aspects), certainly not to Wikipedia. It would be easy to flesh out bio and more fully summerize news articles and conservative-leaning blogs that commented on this event, but this would still not meet standards. Only notability is proximity to election/Ground Zero and as a study of heavy, politicized national attention that lasts 1 or 2 days on the news. Many events are connected to the 2004 election and Ground Zero, and many events receive brief, exploitive national attention. This is not a notable person nor a notable event.12.216.24.192 23:33, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even so, under the <i>Alternative tests</i> heading it lists <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>, which states: "Can all information in the article be independently verified now? (some say) 10 years from now?" The answer to both is yes. The subject is notable because it is verifiable. It was already judged for its notability when it was originally reported in credible well-known news sources like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Newsday_9115.html" title="New York Newsday">New York Newsday</a></i>. The point of Wikipedia is to be NPOV and chronicle the facts from sources like those; why should we place subjective restrictions on things that are already established as notable? If so, there is a slippery slope, and established information that some editors don't like can be censored for being "not notable enough?" Wikipedia is not censored for any reason. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 03:56, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>True, but <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a commonly cited guideline on WP that establishes a pretty low threshold for notability as it is, and this subject still fails. So I'm citing the failure of the guideline as justification for why I believe this article ought to be deleted. It's fairly common practice. Obviously failure isn't an automatic deletion, or else there'd be no need to get community consensus - somebody would have just deleted it already. GassyGuy 05:08, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

We can verify that this guy lived (which is not a notable fact) that he died (which is not notable either) and how he died (unusual, but not really notable). We can also verify that he was on his high school debate team (not notable again, even if he did well) and that he created some pieces of art (also not notable, even if they were shown publically).

<li><b>Keep'</b> Vaubel was on the board of the Young Associates of the Chelsea Art Museum. He was asked to found this program because he was such an influential person, which speaks to his notability. I think it is also relevant to note that news of his death was being emailed throughout schools in New York soon after it had occured, including schools that he did not attend. I think the death of a university professor would elicit a similar response. Vaubel was notable for his striking art, his work for the Chelsea Art Museum, and the vast influence he had on people throughout New York. I was not aware that the Wikipedia spent time deciding who is notable and who is not, but if that is the case than Zander Vaubel certainly qualifies as notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.107.104.201 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__70.107.104.201_32f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 70.107.104.201">contribs</a>) 16:07, October 17, 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>reply</b> Checked out the new link. OK. We can verify that he held this post. Still, it doesn't get to the heart of his notability. Are there reviews of his work? Do others cite him as an expert in his field? That's the sort of thing that makes one notable. Getting better, but still not enough yet to change my vote. A review in the mainstream art press would be nice. Citations in anthologies or the like would be even better. Examples of widespread use of his work beyond a single museum showing would be good too. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete/Move</b> The article appears to be written by the subject of the article. According to the linked website the Dan Papirany <b>Trio</b> were nominated for a prize, not the artist himself, so this does not seem to qualify as notable for the artist? The Radio New Zealand website has no mention of Dan Papirany that I can find. The Trio would appear to have made a number of albums and may meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, perhaps the article should become one on the Trio? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich257_a349.html" title="User:Rich257">Rich257</a> 12:39, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This article has a new focus (the trio rather than the artist), it has a reference to the radio interview mentioned above, and also a music sample of the trio, can the article title change to "Dan Papirany Trio"? if it's possible, how do you change it?

<li><b>Comment</b> actually, the Eddie Tribute episode is part of a larger article that covers the many tributes to Eddie. This is not.

<li><b>Keep or Rename "Tributes to Owen Hart"</b> Wasn't there an Owen Hart Tribute Show that included WWF, WCW and ECW wrestlers? WCW had a tribute match and a black card (ala Adult Swim) at the beginning of their Monday Nitro broadcast the night after his death. And Bret Hart came out to the ring on Nitro a couple of weeks later and said he was taking time off because of Owen's death. A lot have been done in memory of Owen or because of Owen, and so re-naming the article might be the best way to go. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERaderick_97ff.html" title="User:Raderick">Raderick</a> 03:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, the article was recently recreated as <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Metal_f010.html" title="Pop Metal">Pop <b>M</b>etal</a> and the creator insists on having it as its own article, rather than redirecting to glam metal. Note that although there are three accounts and two IP's involved in editing the article / reverting, these share a very similar contribution history.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am slightly concerned that something that is clearly presenting itself as an East Asian religion (cf the long list of supposed names for this religion in every imaginable East Asian language) does not in fact have an existing article on any East Asian language wikipedia. I am also concerned that there appears to be no information available anywhere on when this organisation was founded, how many members it claims, or even <i>which countries it is active in</i>. An article that merely presents the doctrine of an organisation, while lacking such fundamental details, is problematic, to say the least. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 11:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's unfair to search for the string ごぎょうかい: this is alleged to be the reading of the <i>kanji</i>, and if the allegation is true we'd expect the <i>kanji</i> and not this <i>hiragana</i> to appear.

<li>The simplified Chinese characters for this name happen to be normal in postwar Japan and there are a fair number of Japanese-language hits.

<li>How about if only fires that have the S44 (not sure what there call it in other states), damage or lost homes, burnt a large area (Say over 300ha) can only be added so it doesn't get to big unlike <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tornadoes_of_2006.html" title="Tornadoes of 2006">Tornadoes of 2006</a>? -- <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidgee_34fa.html" title="User:Bidgee">Bidgee</a> 06:55, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>move and edit</b> in accordance with Chuq's proposal. This is a nice Wikinews article, but seriously, S44 declarations are made most weeks of summer in NSW, and the equivalent in other states. The Bureau notice is boilerplate text, and the RFS reference has already gone from their website. An article like <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_Australian_bushfire_season_73a2.html" title="2006-07 Australian bushfire season">2006-07 Australian bushfire season</a> can include an intro that talks about the unusual dry hot conditions that led to the early start to bushfire season. Even that topic will be hard to keep up to date - there have been several fires large enough for mention in SA, Tas and Vic this week, too. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 07:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For clarification, are you suggesting that it be kept as an article about the season as a whole? My delete was for the current article about the early bushfires which probably won't be anything like the most significant bushfires this season, but as I said, I have no objection to the creation of a more general article. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 08:38, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A move to a 2006-07 bushfire season which I suspect will be large. There is a similar declaration in place for this weekend and September was rather early for bushfires. However, I think that these fires were not notable enough to warrant an article rather than part of an article.

<dd>I made the 2nd ANUS page on wikipedia because I was pretty irritated that I had to read through a bunch of anus materials to determine what they really were. I actually visited Wikipedia immediately after I saw the first page so that I could hopefully get an objective view of what ANUS was.

<dd>The first source is ANUS itself - not a third party. The second is GNAA - not reliable. The third documents its Alexa ranking, which only verifies that the website exists but not much else. The fourth is a directory which, reliable or not, would again only verify that the site exists. The fifth is the site itself.

I will add to the list. However, how many more do we need? 4: ANUS covers heavy metal extensively. How about you invest some search engine work?

<li>It's not a matter of quantity of resources; it's about quality. Again, none of these are reliable third party sources that establish the notability of the site; at best, they establish that it exists, or are from GNAA or the site itself, which obviously don't count since those are not third parties (the article claims that ANUS is affiliated with GNAA).

<dd>The MTV article is close, but alas, it does far more to confirm the notability of Slayer than ANUS. The others, again, while mentioning ANUS, do little but confirm that the website exists. GassyGuy 06:25, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>In contrast to you I think it is more reference than one can expect for a site about heavy metal. If you look at the other sites in the google link I posted above, you will notice that the important ones have Wikipedia entries, too (Encyclopedia Metallum, BNR Metal). Mainstream reference is even rarer for those sites. It is in the nature of a subgenre that is not well presented in mainstream publications, but this alone doesn't make ANUS non-notable.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If all the references can do is confirm that the site exists, then it leaves little too no verifiable content <i>about</i> the website for the article. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, you cannot have articles without verifiable content. Per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, you cannot just use the site itself to write about it. If heavy metal websites do not get mainstream coverage, then they shouldn't get Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia - it documents things which meet the guidelines; it does not need to acknowledge the presence of everything under the sun, and especially not everything on the Internet.

<li>I see a problem in your skewed standards. Those other sites are not nominated for deletion, because they don't offend as ANUS does. Although there are clearly <i>more</i> external references for ANUS than for, say, Enclopdia Metallum, ANUS is nominated for deletion. In consequence it appears that this article is focused on and nominated for deletion because of its content, and not because of notability issues. I myself leave the ANUS doctrine aside, judge by the various references on the article page alone and come to the conclusion that ANUS is noteworthy. n.b. I don't call for the deletion of other heavy metal articles, this is just to show the hypocrisy of this debate. Best Regards, Aor 11:35, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>If what you say is true, then I would likely express a similar opinion at an AfD for Encyclopedia Metallum. I have not had a chance to look at that article. However, your argument is specious. I have told you what my problem with the ANUS article are. Others cite similar claims. It is really a matter of addressing them. If other websites have similar problems meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, they should be nom'ed for deletion, but the existence of other articles that should be deleted is not a reason to keep this one.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Of what use are guidelines that are enforced only, or more strictly, on articles with offending/dissident content? That is not in any way an encyclopedic approach, and I can only reiterate my conclusion which springs from such behaviour: that something else than the denied encyclopedic adequacy of the topic motivates those who nominate the article for deletion. As a result, articles like ANUS get singled out while others, which, by your standards should have long been deleted (if you abode by those standards), remain. In the end, this hilarious debate is pointless. Those who want the article removed because they have personal objections, which of course aren't sufficient reason for deletion, are not honest and do not aim for consensus.

<li>First off, any argument based upon some supposed equality between ANUS and Encyclopedia Metallum is flawed right from the start. ANUS has a current Alexa rank of 66,041, while EM's is only 4,781... more than ten times better than ANUS. (Yes, I know Alexa isn't everything, but it's the quickest way to compare two websites, and these two aren't even in the same ballpark). Believe it or not, this is an argument we've heard countless times before, in misguided support of everything from high-school athletes to video game ROM hacks to people's pet cats. In fact, we hear it so much that there's even a couple of essays written specifically as a rebuttal to this argument. See <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> and <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:41, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Clarin article doesn't say anything about ANUS except confirmation that it exists and is somehow associated with metal - that's not non-trivial coverage. The Launch one is also not non-trivial; it's more about the Slayer incident than ANUS, who is simply mentioned in passing as being associated with it. The Houston one is the strongest of the three, but it's not being featured in a real article, it's part of a "best of" special feature. That's borderline; it may or may not count as non-trivial coverage by a reliable source, but I hardly see that as strong evidence of notability any more than a paragraph in any other special interest (e.g., the tech section) area of a paper would qualify most sites.

<p><b>Strong delete</b> It seems that the sickeningly egalitarian rules on this let's-pretend 'encyclopedia' deem it permissible to have articles like "List of props appearing in episode 432 of The Simpsons" but regard articles about subcultural phenomena, especially when the philosophies espoused by such subcultures go against the grain of placid Hindu-cattle conformity which this 'encyclopedia' promotes, to be a waste of precious server space. The irony of this is that the fool who nominated this article for deletion clearly doesn't even understand the first thing about what he read in the article. He claims that this is vanity. The thing is, Yomangani, vanity is a distinctly <b>un</b>-nihilistic trait. There is no reason for a nihilist to be vain, because it is placing value upon something that is transitory and fleeting. It seems to be thing at Wikipedia, though, that ignorance, political correctness, pseudoscientific twaffle and Judeo-Christian moral systems are regarded as sacrosanct, while logic, beauty and intellectualism are condemned as not being important enough for inclusion.</p>
<p>Iconoclast, so anything can be included in this pretty 'encyclopedia' except for 'fascistic neopagan ideology'? Let me tell you something, fool. Nihilism implies <b>atheism</b>, not neopaganism. Neopaganism is a pointless romantic revisionist historical creation which, while having aesthetic appeal to some, is far removed from any critically tenable conception of the world. You're ignorant, Iconoclast, but we agree on one thing. The world is indeed deteriorating. But the world is not deteriorating because of black metal. It is deteriorating because people are terrified of the truth, and would rather exist in a novocainesque facade of shopping malls, designer clothing, plastic music and trendy stupidity. The fact that there are some people who would rather have no part of that existence is mortally offensive to these herd-grazers, and that is why they want to delete this article. But this 'encyclopedia' is also helping the world to destroy itself. Knowledge is not for everyone. It is not democratic. Knowledge is an aristocracy. A fool cannot savour the existential fullness granted by reading the works of Nietzsche, or playing with the abstractions of higher mathematics. They content themselves here by editing articles on the local highway and their favourite television show. Pseudoscience is promoted here at the same level as real science. Religion is privileged above art.</p>
<p>That being said, there is no real reason why this article should be here. Its presence merely indicates perceived importance on the part of those who are not fit to judge. Nonetheless, it would illustrate just how fucking hypocritical the ostensive egalitarian nature of this 'encyclopedia' is, if the article were to be deleted. Any ideology has to censor that which poses a threat to itself. And while I do not delude myself into thinking that the ideology of black metal poses any real threat to the nauseating stupor of left-liberalism at the moment, its time will come. The reaction, though, of people to intellectualism and anti-egalitarianism is an inbuilt and natural extension of the left-liberal mindset, because ultimately this is what poses the biggest threat to the 'utopia' in which we live. So, if the people at Wikipedia are to truly practice the revolting morality which they preach, they will keep this article, not because they agree with it, or because it is in accord with whatever insane so-called 'rules' there are here. They will keep this article to avoid making bigger prats of themselves than they already are.</p>
<p>Now have fun, everybody, finding your 'consensus'. But know that consensus among fools will represent only foolishness. You make me laugh. --Diffeomorphism 18:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now, I'm not going to read all that (I do not want to get a heart attack as a black man such as myself has heart disease), but what it boils down to is whether or not it is good for minorities. ANUS isn't good for minorities -- it is actively racist and anti-Jew (the worst of the worst as anti-Semitism has always been the highest evil) and supports neo-nazi skinhead music like Skrewdriver, Burzu, Graveland, Bully Boys, and so on. I think that what it boils down to is not whether it is notable or not, but <b>whether or not it should be</b> notable. Get it? Get it? --Iconoclast 19:26, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> A.N.U.S is an absolutely superb resource for numerous musical genres and subcultures. It is particularly insightful and well written. Indeed as someone who specialised in music youth and subculture as part of thier political studies I can only but wonder why this sight has been deemed inapproprate for this site. I would go so far as to argue that its relevance is particulalry pertinent due to the sure number of related pages of this nature concerning music in the metal scene. Many of those above that have nominated this page for deletion furthermore seem totally unfamiliar with the topic at hand and its deeper meaning and consequence for those who live this style of life and make it thier approach and philosophy. I think it would be sad to delete this page and if this is then the case it is only further indication of the increasingly deteriating quality of wikipedia as a whole.

Anus has been around longer (since the BBS era), operates several websites (Anus.com, Corrupt.org, Sodomy.org and many more) and has been more active recently than GNAA, "trolling" both the cyberspace and <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatspace.html" title="Meatspace">meatspace</a> (through flyering). Besides, Anus is much more than a simple trolling organisation, it advocates a philosophy and a lifestyle, and has articles that inform a certain subcuture (Death Metal / Nihilist culture) I can't see why it is less notable than <a href="../../../w/i/p/Wipipedia.html" title="Wipipedia">Wipipedia</a> which serves approximately the same purpose for the BDSM subculture. In fact, it can be said that the articles on Anus.com constitute social commentary that qualifies it on the same level of notability as <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Rockwell.com_4214.html" title="Lew Rockwell.com">Lew Rockwell.com</a> and various other social commentary websites.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- I was just starting back then. The term itself comes from a Bulgarian book, "Istorija na bylgarskija ezik", by a certain Kiril Mirchev -- whenever pronouns come after nouns, he writes that they're in "weak position". Whether the link was needed is another question. --<a href="../../../v/k/o/User%7EVKokielov_dc04.html" title="User:VKokielov">VKokielov</a> 14:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. "Weak position" is used in <b>several</b> contexts in grammar and linguistics. This is not the most common historical one: more frequent is the use of weak position to describe unstressed syllables. In classical prosody, "weak position" is where a short vowel that is usually grammatically long, usually because of preceding a consonant cluster containing a liquid, is realized as short for metrical purposes because it is unstressed. FWIW, the loss of case marking in Romance has more to do with phonemic erosion than it does with "weakness" arising from following a preposition. Whether the prepositions caused this erosion, or their use is its result, is a chicken-and-egg argument. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(I started this AfD in the first place, so I guess I've already voted) Yes, the phrase "weak position" must come up all over the place in grammar and linguistics, and also in sports and economics and architecture and psychology… But is it a recognized, technical term in any of these fields, or does it just mean, well, "weak position"? If it has the status of a standard term in poetry, this can just be noted in the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meter_%28poetry%29.html" title="Meter (poetry)">Meter (poetry)</a> article, and not in a separate article, and certainly not one called "Weak position <b>(grammar)</b>"! And if we make a disambiguation page for all the possible uses of "weak position" then I think we'll also need to create large object (disambiguation), dark area (disambiguation), bad idea (disambiguation), etc. etc. etc. (Please do not click on any of those.)</li>

<dd>If you mean the vulgar Latin bit, I may agree, although it would be nice to have an expert opinion. The German usage is for real, and I suspect there are others.

<dd>I hadn't noticed the addition of German, and the external link is very good, but the established term in this case is "weak" and not "weak position" (cf. "weak declension", "weak ending", "weak form", "weak article/adjective/noun"), and it is already treated (or should be) in articles like <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declension.html" title="Declension">Declension</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_articles.html" title="German articles">German articles</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - notability standards have to take into account the nature of the topic in question. When it comes to legacy software, we need to be more relaxed in our evidence -- there is unlikely to be much WWW info on these languages, because by the time the WWW came along they were mostly gone. But that does not mean that they are unnotable (from a historical perspective), if there are significant mentions in older literature (e.g. trade magazines, journals). Unfortunately, looking up those old magazines would be quite an effort; so I would suggest the answer is to err on the side of keep. --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 20:31, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because the group exists not as a company, but as a collective of individuals, supporting eachother, and often giving up profit, time and commercial projects to spend time on comics that make them little to no money, i believe sweatdrop deserves to be explained on wikipedia, as they are certainly unique within the UK manga scene, providing an alternative to the corporate publishing route, while offering opportunities to obtain 'notability'.--<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmer-san_a4b2.html" title="User:Palmer-san">user:Palmer-san</a> <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmer-san_a4b2.html" title="User:Palmer-san">Palmer-san</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Palmer-san_d6e5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Palmer-san">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<pre>
<s> To begin, it is stated in the attention box above. 
</s>
</pre>
<p><s>‘Deletion decisions are made on the merits of the arguments, not by counting heads (or socks)'</s></p>
<p><s>And so I put the fullness of my argument to you Consumed Crustacean. First, in relation to Neo magazine.</s></p>
<p><s>Neo magazine is the only UK based magazine dealing with manga and anime, and the only one to be found in non specialist shops there period. The only main competition it would have is in specialist comic stores from the American or Japanese version of NEWTYPE magazine. But, they have sole magazine coverage of the UK anime/manga scene. It’s a valid reference. But frankly, I don’t think it’s as famous as Sweatdrop is.</s></p>
<p><s>As a section of culture which only continues to expand in popularity, individuals who have no interest in that sub-culture may consider the likes of Neo and SD to be of no importance. However, that does not detract from the status of said groups. Those two groups along with the Tokyo pop Rising stars of manga competition constitute the core of the UK and Irish manga scene. Sweatdrop, through its tutorials and constant presence exceeds the other two in importance, is literally educating and supporting the next generation of UK and Irish manga artists, and frankly whether it is listed in wikipedia or not, will go down in history as the source of the organised manga creation scene in the UK. They simply can’t be robbed of that fact. Anyone with even remote familiarity with the manga subculture in the UK or Ireland has been exposed to sweatdrop. And the list of companies that they collaborate with includes industry leaders like letraset, Wacom etc.</s></p>
<p><s>Who are wacom??? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacom" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacom" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacom</a> they make the leading brand of graphics tablet used by artists the world over, but many people have no idea who they are, because of course they are only famous within the artistic community. My point is, just because a lot of people don’t know who wacom are, does not mean they aren’t of core importance to certain groups. Without them, the digital art community would probably crumble overnight.</s></p>
<p><s>And here, on wacoms site, wacom, who sell to the whole world of digital artists is Sonia Leong's work, SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS. <a href="http://www.wacom-europe.com/manga/manga.asp?lang=en&amp;pdx=10" class="external free" title="http://www.wacom-europe.com/manga/manga.asp?lang=en&amp;pdx=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.wacom-europe.com/manga/manga.asp?lang=en&amp;pdx=10</a> and on that page are also the words Sweatdrop studios.</s></p>
<p><s>Also, the references named above which 'are just talking about the artists as individuals' were to cite that Sweatdrop is mentioned before every tutorial said artists give in a leading concept art magazine which is read world wide a.k.a. the artists market themselves as Sweatdrop artists. When you consider the magazine in question has articles in it by the likes of ADI GRANOV and others who did concept art for everything from batman to star wars, names which might mean nothing to you, but once again, within the art community holds high esteem you have to realise Sweatdrop relative importance. It was made totally clear in the references that they accompanied tutorials by the artists in said magazines. It would be unfair to expect the magazine to allow a huge rant about Sweatdrop pre every tutorial by their members, and expecting such as proof of their position is unrealistic because that would never happen for any company.</s></p>
<p><s>For example. When you buy a pair of Nike shoes, you don’t get a 10 page rant about the company in the box. And the store selling the shoes isn’t handing out such rants either. Similarly, where Sweatdrop provides a service, there is no rant about them either. The very fact that they are providing the service, for magazines like neo, Imagine Fx, and companies like Wacom is the proof of their credibility.</s></p>
<p><s>In the October 2006 imagine fx magazine ISSN 9771 7489 3000 3 10&gt; Sweatdrop is mentioned in the same breath as the biggest names in manga worldwide "other big publishers include Manga Entertainment, which is somewhat more focused on anime and DVD releases, Dark horse comics and Sweatdrop studios." -page 24 The fact that Sweatdrop in not an official company, but the blood sweat and tears of people with 9-5 jobs makes this ever more remarkable.</s></p>
<p><s>Imagine FX august 2006 page 27</s></p>
<p><s>Results of a competition run by Sweatdrop, and sponsored by IMAGINE FX, LETRASET, WACOM ,E FRONTIER AND TOKYOPOP are announced.</s></p>
<p><s>this proves a professional working relationship between SD and these very very respectable companies.</s></p>
<p><s>If you go to Tokyopop right now <a href="http://www.tokyopop.com" class="external free" title="http://www.tokyopop.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tokyopop.com</a>, the leading manga publisher outside Japan, there is Sweatdrop artist Joanna Zhou featured, and advertised as 'of the Sweatdrop crew'.</s></p>
<p><s>Of note is that the article which was being judged here has changed to a degree that it is unrecognisable from the one set for deletion, for this alone, the article should be re-examined and re-voted upon after a short period to complete updating of the wiki.</s></p>
<p><s>Also, if you can find me another manga circle in the UK, or even outside Japan that can list credentials, and companies, and magazines like those Sweatdrop are associated with, ill be very very impressed. Credit where credit is due gentlemen. And in this case, that credit is your simple recognition of their right to be known. Various links have been provided, magazines cited in their defence, examples of their name associated with big companies within the trade.</s></p>
<p><s>I think you will agree, there is nothing unfair about that. At the very least deletion should be withheld for a month, to give time for the wiki, and a full list of magazine citations to be included. The problem is of course, any such citation can be negatively spun to being a form self praise, but, without it you doubt the importance or accomplishments of the group... How you resolve these two conflicting directives I do not know. Can you not accept all these references provided to you, and leave them out of the wiki, so it does not look like a list of ' look what I can do' references? It would seem that whichever direction they move in to appease you folks, they’re damned. Leave as in - not enough proof. Provide proof - tooting ones own horns.</s></p>
<p><s>Thus and for many similar reasons, the counter argument is flawed, and has failed to provide any proof to damage the validity of the citations provided.</s></p>
<p><s>Crustacean Man and the counter argument in general are being unreasonable in its view, as it was willing to be dismissive of the proof given. SD was asked for citations, and I provided numerous. Many of which were looked down for no solid reason. If Sweatdrop can be asked to provide proof , and provide it, then sir I say when you discredit that proof you must provide proof of your own, Questioning whether one magazine was valid as a source with the words 'I’m not sure' is unacceptable in such a situation, as you disregard the burden of proof you lay on others, and saying the other citations were just about the artists themselves when in fact it is stated plainly that they were bios quotes that accompany all of their tutorials in said magazine, and that I was quoting the bios to show hat the artists market themselves via the Sweatdrop name shows a clear willingness to pick and choose elements of the facts to reflect a distorted truth which favours your argument. This is unacceptable.</s></p>
<p><s>In addition to this, the links provided above, in respect to tokyopop and wacom, are proof undeniable for the case of keeping the SD wiki, where your current counter argument sir is based on mis representation of the facts I provided, which were cited in accordance with the submission rules of this institution. If you are unwilling to investigate my citations properly by buying said magazines , or contacting said companies to disprove said proof, then you have no basis to cast their validity into question, an by doing so you fundamentally weaken your argument to the point where it can no longer be upheld as rational. That is why I respectfully ask you to withdraw your argument at this point.</s></p>
<p><s>My argument is one filled with citation from site after site, magazine after magazine, company page after company page.</s></p>
<p><s>All the counter argument has done is attempt to tear down that proof with speculation. To any reasonable onlooker, the burden of proof overwhelms any current attempt to discredit it. Until the counter argument is willing to stand up, with proof to discredit these citations -you have no valid argument.</s></p>
<p><s><br />
In closing I would say to the administration.</s></p>
<p><s>Sweatdrop has proved their existence, and that that existence is exceptional, through various citations from established sources. To include such citations in the wiki would be viewed by many as clear self indulgence and self promotion on their part, providing them with an angle to once again attack the SD wiki. Thus I ask that the issue of burden of proof of Sweatdrop’s importance to the UK manga scene and the validity of its connections to various leading creative companies be dropped as an issue, unless Wikipedia is willing to allow a list of shining citations which would only serve as self promotion, thus breaking the established rules against such behaviours. The burden of proof asked of sweatdrop by the counter argument was severe, and the proof provided was questioned in a very unreasonable fashion in that it was based on no valid source. A house of cards counterargument based on simple nay saying.</s></p>
<p><s>The only reasonabe decision, within a system which survives through the value of fact, of citation, is to disregard the validity of the counter argument due to a lack of anything but nebulous accusations and award the right to exist to the sweatdrop wiki which has clearly defended itself to a far more professional degree those who would act for its deletion.</s></p>

<p>I proposed this article for deletion a couple days back, but that's been challenged. I'm to understand that the company/organization has no videos released. It was supposed to be some sort of reformation of a previous similar group named "Poly Bag Boy Productions", but I can't find heads or tails for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">no sources</a> for this.</li>
<li>The article's been moderately kept up since it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smiley_Grim&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52984979" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smiley_Grim&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52984979" rel="nofollow">created in may</a>, but doesn't have any videos then and now and its August.</li>

<li>The owner of the company can't finish the videos just yet, and is taking directing classes to help improve themselves.(see talk)</li>
<li>Their offical website is a myspace page.</li>
<li>I cannot substantiate the claims of popularity in Scotland, and I reason that I will not as a result of what I've seen above.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, I believe there are numerous and currently insolvable problems with this article. It should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> for Eminence, <b>Delete</b> for Hirokaki Yura. For eminence, there are no notability councerns. A google test for "Eminence Symphony" gets 100 thousand + hits. The orchestra also stands out for being popular amoungst people who aren't the usual orchestra crowd, as its choice of music is unusual (unusual as in unusal compared to most orchestras) comprising mostly of fantasy, video game and anime music. Many concerts, three albums released, not to mention they've been noted in reliable sources (see references for articles about Eminence from some of Australia's biggest newspapers). Compare with other australia orchestral articles like <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Symphony_Orchestra_ef79.html" title="Melbourne Symphony Orchestra">Melbourne Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Youth_Orchestra_2e18.html" title="Adelaide Youth Orchestra">Adelaide Youth Orchestra</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrier_Reef_Orchestra_124e.html" title="Barrier Reef Orchestra">Barrier Reef Orchestra</a>. It's defintely notable enough for us to write about. Not sure about what you mean by autobiographical concerns, please clarify. Article is not a press release or misusing wikipedia. Section on staff and albums could possibly be cut down. And some more information on their history and choice of music would be nice. The fact that the article has been almost completely written by one user, who has made almost all their edits on this article is worrying. All that means is the article needs some more people do help by doing a bit of research and writing, and tidying up. But the article isn't advertising - although one could say it is one-sided, and it's certainly not un-notable. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 10:54, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> this is probably not assuming the best of faith, but i can't help but feel slightly suspicious about the fact that the person who nominated this article was an <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.197.168.177_a576.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.197.168.177">anon ip</a> who has made no other edits on wikipedia, and seems to have created an account only to create this deletion page. I have to wonder whether the nominator is making this nomination because he or she has something to do with Eminence in real life. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 11:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The google test is insufficient as one would need to put that in quotes, because of the commonness of the two words "eminence" and "symphony" and "orchestra." If you google the whole phrase you get less than 750. My main concern was the fact that it was all one person. That's what I meant by autobiograhpical. It seems to me that everything the person has written is written to advertise the symphony. I mean, who says "bold, dynamic and fresh" if you're not associated with the project? Also that phrase is taken directly from the "About us" section of the website- <a href="http://www.eminenceonline.com/2006/index.php?display=about_eminence" class="external free" title="http://www.eminenceonline.com/2006/index.php?display=about_eminence" rel="nofollow">http://www.eminenceonline.com/2006/index.php?display=about_eminence</a> Leading further to the belief that the one guy who seems to maintain this article s also associated with that page.</li>
<li>I also added <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroaki_Yura_3202.html" title="Hiroaki Yura">Hiroaki Yura</a> because it's related to this page as it seems to be the leader of this group and the same guy who maintains this article has also edited that one. It seems too much like vanity to me.</li>
<li>(I have made many contributions to wikipedia but have never made an account. I guess my cable provider gives out dynamic IPs. It's true I made the account to nominate this, but that's because I finally decided to "make the jump" as an editor.) Em-El 12:20, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>hmm...the intro does portray the group very positively. But at the same time, the newspaper articles (which are a genuin third party source) very much do so as well. Though phrases being taken directly from their group's own website is a big problem. The article defintely needs work, especially in terms of neutrality. It's already been tagged with cleanup as i speak. In terms of notability, i still don't think it's an issue. Eminence "Canberra Symphony Orchestra" gets me only about 800, which is about the same amount i get for eminance, so i'm not so sure how reliable this is. Google test aside, i think the face that Eminance has been documated by two of Australia's largest newspapers means a lot.</li>
<li>I'm going to hold onto keep. The article is notable, it just needs work, and neutrality, but i don't think deletion is suitable. However, i will change to delete for Kiroaki Yura. I've changed my ealier statement accordinly. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 13:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To clarify, I am the creator and main editor of this page. I apologise for the occasional anon IP, that's my fault for not being logged in. I also was not registered early on, so that helps explain. I am the senior production co-ordinator from Eminence, thus I am in a position that gives me the most knowledge to write this information. I have written in as best I can so it doesn't come off as an advertisement, and wrote it in an informative passive way. I have avoided using terms like 'greatest group' etc for this reason. I must stress that this initially went up to be informative, and that it shall stay. Given that we are an orchestra and we perform to a sizable audience I believe it to be fitting to have an entry here to reflect this. I list the staff so the public knows who is behind the concerts, though if the Wiki community so desires I can shorten this. My main point here is that I as an Eminence staff member have been editing this, and therefore Wikipedia will not run into copyright issues. I create the majority of the text on our website and programme booklets therefore I am able to replicate this in a passive manner. I should have mentioned all this earlier, I apologise. Eminence fully condones the use of their logo and this article, that is not an issue. Should the article on <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroaki_Yura_3202.html" title="Hiroaki Yura">Hiroaki Yura</a> be requested for a merger I am happy to do so, I did not create it. Given my lack of direct Wikipedia experience I apologise if we have broken rules or created content incorrectly. - Nephtis 11:24, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure where to put an addition to my argument, so I'll put it with my other comments. By article's creator's own admission, this article is in clear violation of the guideline <a href="../../../a/b/_/WP%7EAB_9fd9.html" title="WP:AB">WP:AB</a> (To quote: "You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved").

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's true. But i don't think it's appropriate to delete an article for AB violation. Put it this way, if ESO is not notable, then it should be deleted for being so. If we decide ESO is notable, but delete the article. Then the next person who comes along to create the article will have to start from scratch. So it's better if we keep the article, trim off anything that is violating Wikipedia's content policies (such as Neutrality and verificability), and leave the article there for other people to improve. I don't think the entire article is violating any wikipedia content policies enough to warrant deletion. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 05:57, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete, as the page and the edits have not made reference to it's "significant importance", but have focused on selling the book instead. It's very clear which was the purpose of making the page. Without reference to controversy, it's just advertisement. The book name as the first graphic novel can be added to a page about the publisher instead.</li>

<dd>That is according to the articles own author. Sounds like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> to me. WikiPedia does not exist to make someone more notable. A subject must have <i>verifiable notablity</i> to qualify for an article here. WikiPedia merely documents established fame; it does not act as a means to establish fame itself. Additionally, I did a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22John+Nagle%22+Guitar&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22John+Nagle%22+Guitar&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for "John Nagle" Guitar. I turned up a paltry list (1000) articles, and most on the first page were writen BY guys named John Nagle, rather than about. There is paltry verifiable evidence that this guy is notable. He <i>may be</i> a great guitar player. Being good, or even having a unique style, does not make you notable by WikiPedia standards. If his style is so important, people who don't know him personally will note that style and write about it in the music press. Then he will become notable and then he will be worthy of an article. Unless and untill that happens, he doesn't belong. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 23:36, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This type of index page serves to guide and direct to the individual articles. Other lists like this are NUMEROUS and highly useful on wikipedia, and like all of those lists, deserve to be kept. Not to mention that under the most basic terms of notability (hundreds of thousands of people watched these TV shows) and verifiability (back issues of TV guide and other sources make it so) also points to keep. Finally, the guidline that Wikipedia is not a TV guide is designed to keep people from creating huge numbers of articles dealing with every individual episode of a TV show. Merely noting that a show existed, and when it aired, does not fall under that segment of WikiPedia guidelines. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 17:59, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete All</b>.

<li><b>reply</b> Except that bus timetables from 1953 or yellowpages from 1967 do not themselves contain notable information. Indices of notable information <i><b>are notable</b></i> by extension. For example; NFL teams are notable, so an article that listed, say, the league records from a particular year, listing where each team finished in each division and their W/L record is also notable; it is a way of organizing notable information in an alternate fashion that provides a unique perspective that would not exist except for the list. It is true that in this example, we could list a teams win/loss record on THAT teams main entry page; just like we can note that a particular show aired on a particular network in a particular timeslot on THAT shows main article; however, such notations also lack the context that a list like this provides. For all that say "delete": Please check <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> to see the consensus standard guidline for lists. I quote the relevent passages from that Guideline page here:
<ul>
<li>1) "The list may be a valuable information source. This is particularly the case for a structured list. Examples would include lists organized chronologically, grouped by theme, or annotated lists. " -- This list is a structured list, which is recognized in WikiPedia guidelines as a <b>valuable information source</b></li>
<li>2) "Lists can be used as a table of contents," -- This list serves this purpose: It directs people to specific articles about specific shows, within a certain context (in this can when they aired)</li>
<li>3) "Some lists are useful for Wikipedia development purposes....Like categories, lists can be used for keeping track of changes in the listed pages, using the Related Changes feature. Unlike a category, a list also allows detection of deletion of pages from it, and, more generally, a history of its contents is available." -- Lists like this can be useful when working around a topic. By using a list like this, the relevent WikiProject can keep track of which information is still needed, what is happening to articles, etc. etc.</li>

<dd>List articles are not just a large group of articles. When you say "The fact that the articles under AfD consideration are like "numerous" other articles is no reason to keep - multiple wrongs do not make a right." you ignore the place that list articles, especially lists of <i>notable</i> and <i>verifiable</i> information such as this, have within WikiPedia. List articles individually must meet standards of notability and verifiablity just like all other articles do. As a class, however, the entire concept of a list article is NOT up for debate and is a valuable and accepted part of the WikiPedia structure. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:02, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1953 Bus timetables and 1967 Yellow pages are nowhere near as important as nationwide TV programs. Comparing these things doesn't do your argument credit. And it's not OR, as it's merely facts verifiable by reading old copies of TV Guides, not theory on what a given TV show's presence or cancellation might mean. Which itself is the subject of some research, and probably belongs on some page or another. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I fail to see how an old outdated TV Guide is of any more use or importance than an old bus schedule or yellow pages entry. Importance is relative. Old bus schedules are of significance to an urban planners and social historians. The 1990 Thomas Cook train schedule might be of importance to train historians. Yet neither of these are <i>encyclopedic</i>. No importance is asserted in these so-called articles. The mere assertion that they are important, without saying how they could possibly be important, isn't enough. I have seen no citation of any policy that supports their inclusion, but there is enough policy to support their deletion. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:29, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You missed the point entirely. Read the section at <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>. Are you claiming that TV shows, seen and remembered by millions of people, are not themselves notable? If TV shows are notable, then by extension LISTS of TV shows are notable as well, especially provided the structure of this particular list. An article does not have to assert importance by stating in plain language "I am important". It is important because the information it contains is notable and verifiable. Lists are a vital component of WikiPedia structure. Any claim that this list is not notable is an indictment of accepted WikiPedia practice, unless you are claiming that network TV shows are not notable. Either proposition is ludicrous (that Lists should never be part of WikiPedia or that TV shows should never be part of WikiPedia) Lists are important. TV Shows are notable. Therefore lists of TV shows should be kept.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 21:01, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You seem to be confused. I mentioned the old TV guide's as evidence that this was not Original Research. Why you attached it to importance I don't know. The importance comes from being "nationwide TV programs" . Can you explain to me how that is uninmportant? It would be one thing if this list covered local programs. But it doesn't. It is about national TV networks, who also have other lists of programs broadcast on them. See: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_American_Broadcasting_Company_ea2f.html" title="List of programs broadcast by American Broadcasting Company">List of programs broadcast by American Broadcasting Company</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_CBS_f4e6.html" title="List of programs broadcast by CBS">List of programs broadcast by CBS</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_NBC_74f5.html" title="List of programs broadcast by NBC">List of programs broadcast by NBC</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_FOX_ef03.html" title="List of programs broadcast by FOX">List of programs broadcast by FOX</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_UPN_e1c7.html" title="List of programs broadcast by UPN">List of programs broadcast by UPN</a>, or heck, the Category: Television Series by Network. All this is list and the others represent is a collation of that data in yet other form, this time providing the useful detail as to what date a program is on. To make this unimportant, you'd have to argue that all of those pages are unimpotant.

<dd>I have no problem with <i>encyclopedic</i> lists. My only "indictment" is of the nominated articles, or any non-encyclopedic list cloaking itself in <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> when it does not meet the criteria of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. You can attribute all sorts of arguments to me that I haven't made, but the long and the short of it is that <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> is a <i>guideline</i> that concerns itself mostly with style and offers little in relation to the determination of what is encyclopedic, as opposed to the <i>policy</i> that is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If one is to go strictly by the criteria of WP:LIST, I suspect almost anything, properly formatted in the manner provided for in LIST, would merit inclusion. I won't even get into the fallacy that <i>all</i> television shows are inherently notable (let alone "remembered") or that a complilation of "notable" things makes the compilation notable. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:48, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, so when are you going to respond to the issue of <b>Nationwide</b> television programs? And what argument do you have to suggest that the time/year of a program being broadcast isn't notable? Every year, in case you didn't know, there are articles in papers, in TV Guide, about what's on and when. Every year. It would be one thing if these pages tried to cover every channel, including cable and independents. But they're restricted to the major networks of the time. If that's not enough specificity, then frankly I don't know what will be. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 13:30, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What verifiability concerns do you have exactly? Anybody who wants to read old copies of Network TV Schedules need only check archives of TV Guide or USA Today, or your local paper which may well have covered what the networks announced as part of their scheudule. Yes, you might have to leave your house to do it, but you can verify anything on this page if you want to take the time to do it. Yes, this won't cover every week of the year, but that's not the purpose of this list, and if it did try to cover things like that, it would become indeed become a TV Guide.

<li><b>Keep all</b>. I find this format an encyclopedic method of organizing this information, imparting information not to program your VCR/Tivo, but to see the schedules of major national TV networks in a particular year.

It further organizes them by day, time and channel; this grid is intuitive and familiar.

It's not in serious dispute that American network television series are <i>per se</i> notable, and so if simple lists of such series would be appropriate, the only remaining question I see is whether these schedule lists are a useful alternative means of organizing that information. I say yes. Scheduling blocks do show meaningful relationships among programs, and these lists could be useful for pop culture historians. What is great about list/table articles is that they allow for multiple ways of presenting and organizing information (unlike categories, which diminish in usefulness as they multiply and compete), so we can list cities by alphabetical name or by population density, and we can list television series by originating network or by broadcast schedule. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 17:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>. I have been using Wikipedia for many many things for several years. When I have a question about ANYTHING I check Wikipedia first. While the policy of "notability" and "verifiable" are very good standards there seems to me a conflict with that in some of the projects I have seen on Wikipedia (e.g. pages for state legislators, articles completing timelines). These projects imply a desire of comprehensiveness to some degree. Those things said, these articles seem to fall into line with the comprehensive drive of other projects. Verifiability? Yes, difficult. So, to me, it seems the question here calls for a balance between Verfiability and/or Notability vs Comprehensive and leading resource. And one more point to the idea of Comprehensive Resource: many other Wikias also imply a similar drive...things like Lyrics library, etc.<a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">tony garcia</a> 18:17, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>regarding verifiability</b> FYI, verifiability in this case is actually pretty straightforward. There are already published books that outline major network prime time schedules (I have one on my bookshelf at home, can't remember the exact title.) Simply citing the appropriate page of such a book would be sufficient reference. Another printed source is to look up major newspapers from the season in question, most of which have published television schedules that can be cited. So verifiability is not an issue in this case, aside from having an editor willing to take the time to actually add the reference to the article. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:28, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> Historical prime time network television listings are a non-trivial way to index and compare some of the most important pop cultural works of a given period. Want to know what people were interested in watching or doing or thinking about in 1976? The prime-time network schedules of that year give you a nice insight. Notable information worth keeping. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:59, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Unfortunately, that has been deleted, but I totally agree, if this article stays, it needs a rewrite, and a close eye on the external links section, which gets spammed by everyone else who has set up a fly-by-night flight sim web site. I'm not passionate about saving it, but I think it genuinely deserves an article. Both it and avsim have been battling it out for a while now for the title of most popular flight sim site. Both are not just a few guys with a geocities account. For example, companies that produce FS software and hardware will frequently cite reviews by both sites, and avsim holds an annual convention that is taken very seriously by Microsoft, who, if I'm not mistaken, used it to unveil their next generation flight simulator. --<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 00:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Allmusic is a fairly canonical site. It covers nearly every artist with an sizable distribution deal, whether major label or indy. If his albums are self produced and distributed locally or self-distributed, then no one knows about him, if no one has ever heard of him, then he is <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">not notable</a>. If he becomes notable in the future, he will then warrent an article. People who are not famous yet, but are really good musicians and just SHOULD be famous do not rate high enough to pass the bar on notability. Look, I have done more than you have in support of him. If you assert he is notable, just provide us the sources to prove so. A few independant reviews in the national music press ought to do. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b>: There are 18 works, and 5 reviews, as listed in the Austlit database--the comprehensive reference source for Australian literature. (Are you all aware of this database? Perhaps not, which tends to indicate a super-power myopia.) Reviews are in reputable newspapers and journals, including The Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian, Southerly, and The Courier Mail. Amazon.com is not a good test for Australian notability. Thomas Keneally is a successful author in the sense of being bankable, but in Australian writing he is not the cultural high point. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmeevans (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmeevans_8efa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmeevans">contribs</a>).</small> <small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FMatthew_Karpin&amp;diff=81170171&amp;oldid=81152497" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FMatthew_Karpin&amp;diff=81170171&amp;oldid=81152497" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>.

Lupo, I don't want to quarrel with you, really. You seem like a very nice person, even thanking me for correcting your inaccuracy--and also helping me by telling me how to sign my article. However, you're being a little obtuse, aren't you, in creating some magical boundary between commentary in your encyclopedia concerning schools and that concerning literature? The point, of course, is that the encylopedia--which should probably really be called a compendium--is stacked full of trivia. A very arbitrary browse would tell anyone that that is the case. Why would I want to enter a debate about tightening up <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria? I also would have no interest in sticking a tag on the trivia I find. It seems to me inseparable from what this encyclopedia does--as well as providing information about important issues. It seems that none of the people who have said "delete" have any expertise in the field of Australian literature at all--perhaps no expertise in any literary field. I don't really know. It even seems that no one was aware of the significance, when it comes to considering whether or not to delete this item, of the Austlit database--a not-for-profit organisation, unlike Google and Amazon.com., which one of you at least immediately turned to. However, no one has said Austlit should be considered the most reliable source. It's been remarked that to access the database you have to pay; but if Wikipedia can't pay to see the best information to support its decisions then it is even more removed from expertise than otherwise. The group who have responded to the article by saying delete strike me as at best punters, with a general understanding--annoyed at someone not using the editing process correctly; and, at worst, a gang, arrogantly backing each other up rather than trying to think about the material objectively. Finally, there is a real paucity of entries on Australian writers in your encyclopedia, but no shortage at all of American writers--many of whom I have never heard of before and never will again. Of course this reflects on the people who have taken the time; but it also reflects what this encyclopedia is: seriously biased towards the US, at least in this comparison. Such bias is the responsibility of everyone to correct. I do tell my students, when they quote from Wikipedia, that it is academically regarded as an unreliable reference source. I am not saying this to be contrary. This is a real criticism and something you should all be aware of. But you will make your decision sooner of later no matter what I say. ~~~~<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmeevans (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmeevans_8efa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmeevans">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>By the way, doesn't Matthew Karpin fulfil this criteria in WP Bio: "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work"? And please note that the article has been considerably revised. ~~~~<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmeevans (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmeevans_8efa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmeevans">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia itself is not for profit. Therefore, unless an editor on this site wants to shell out some money, Wikipedians cannot see the Austlit list. Even if an editor did pay to access the list, not everyone can. Therefore, it will be unverifiable, because most people will not be able to see it in order to verify it. American and Australian writers are held to the same standards. American authors must have books that are reasonably popular, and unless their book sells a million copies and is talked about in the press frequently, they must publish multiple, well-selling books. Where are your <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, third party sources</a>, verifying that Matthew has won <i>multiple</i> awards or has been reviewed <i>multiple</i> times? By the way, Google <i>certainly</i> is international in its coverage. If I can find boatloads of information on <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonian</a> writers, why wouldn't I be able to find a lot of information on an English-speaking Australian writer? All of the editors here have taken independent, objective looks into the article as well as magazines, web searches, online lists, Google Books (which, incidentally, has novels by Estonian writers...), and news archives. Please do not insult or degrade us; we have been extremely <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> towards you, especially considering some of your accusations. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 16:14, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Don't delete</b>. What's the problem guys? Even if Karpin himself did create the original article and then got a friend? to resubmit it under a different name it's obvious the article is valuable in Wikipedia. The revised article clearly establishes a case to retain the information. (I've checked the austlit database, I have access and there are five reviews of Karpin's work in the herald, the Australian, Courire Mail and Southerley and another one, which are all very creditable pubs in Oz. Fulfils the multiple review crietera) I also see that the same author (jamievans) who revised the article created an article on the famous Australian writer Delia Falconer who hadn't been included before. This is all important stuff. Surely a big gap in Wikipedia, including references to the important mag Hermes. Important stuff. You guys are just ridiculous --Pop (Popallen)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Were you insulted? Dear oh dear. I don't think you should have been, any more than I should feel insulted. This is surely the argey bargey of debate. I'm trying to express this carefully, because I don't wish to offend: "Therefore it will be unverifiable" must be a special Wikipedian definition of veracity. The argument is: most people can't access the most significant of the databases in regard to this debate—only some can—therefore no one can verify the information. This is what we (you also have taken the liberty of claiming the collective) would call a fallacious argument. I can't imagine an argument of this sort standing up in any fair-minded forum. However, there is another fairly important point to make in response to Srose. The AustLit database is accessible via libraries in Australia for free—and I'm assuming this is the case with just about any library in the US (and most countries' major libraries). Obviously it may have to be organised at your end and would take a little extra time. You could probably do it through your personal computer at home. The argument that you have to pay to see the most relevant information is incorrect. The argument that Google provides the basis for Wikipedian information, at least in this case, and Australia's most academically authoritative source in this debate, the AustLit database, can't have a role, is surely demeaning to Wikipedia's relevance. Why not just rely on <i>Google</i> as your encyclopedia? (Jmeevans)</li>

<li>This is a pointless debate. The consensus of the DRV was that Afd should debate this.

<li>Not exactly. AfD is about determining if an article satifying all the critera for an acceptable article could be written — notability is only one of the criteria.

<li>Since when have we started being traditional? After voting three other times for delete, it seems like a waste of time to say it again. Notable is not the only criteria. If we list every notable commercial product, and each one pursues commercializing as much as this article did before it was deleted, and tries to block other competing products, as the editor of this one did, we would be spammed to death.

<li>I agree - in an ideal world, things wouldn't keep getting renominated over and over for deletion, so you would only have to present a delete argument once.

<dd>The Montreal Mirror article doesn't count, IMO, because the reference purports to come from a "survey", and we don't know what the "survey" contained. For all we know, the "survey" may have mentioned the Fleshlight, in which case all we could say is that one columnist, in an unedited (or edited only for libel) article, thought it was notable the first time. However, <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a> has done a better job of adding references. (Why he didn't do this before is a still a good question.) If they pan out, and are "articles" rather than "columns", it becomes a (marginal) Keep. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:38, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as not-notable. Doesn't seem speediable though since it claims notability (50,000 members or whatever) and the advertising doesn't seem that blatant to me. That said, I can't find any evidence that anyone besides people who play flight sims would care about this. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Very notable within it's own field. While I agree that the article needs a good re-write to comply with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (heck, a general cleanup would be good), that is not a valid reason for deletion (nor is lack of notability in itself), and the problem could probably be best solved with some cleanup tags; there's a lot in the article that could be re-used.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> pending evidence of notability. I agree that the article isn't speediable and isn't blatantly promotional. Google shows lots of hits, but in the first five pages of listings I saw zero media coverage except flight-sim niche sites (I'm not sure any pass the reliable-sources guidelines except as supporting material) and Wikipedia mirrors. By that fifth screen there were things like one guy's user information. It's obvious that this is a group active in a number of nations, and there seems to be only one other group (VATSIM) of similar importance within the field, but I'd have to see some independent non-niche coverage before it meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. All the article's links are to the group's regional orgs, none to third-party coverage. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:59, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although it should be re-written, the article is worth keeping. IVAO was founded in 1998, it is one of the largest organization of this kind, has an international user base and it is a legally existing organisation (NPO).

<li><b>Keep</b> IVAO is relevant within online flight simulation. However, the field itself is rather not-notable, which explains the lack of media coverage outside the flight sim niche.

<p>At first sight, this looks legitimate, if unheard of in English. The definition is remarkably vague, making it somewhat hard to figure out what, exactly, Piazza Telematica could be (a place? a service? a product? how does it differ from a <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotspot.html" title="Hotspot">hotspot</a>?). The term is unheard of on English-language Internet (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Piazza+Telematica%22&amp;btnG=Szukaj&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;num=100" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Piazza+Telematica%22&amp;btnG=Szukaj&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;num=100" rel="nofollow">30 mostly bogus hits on Google</a>), and there are only <a href="http://groups.google.pl/groups/search?q=%22Piazza+telematica%22&amp;start=0&amp;scoring=d&amp;hl=pl&amp;lr=&amp;" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.pl/groups/search?q=%22Piazza+telematica%22&amp;start=0&amp;scoring=d&amp;hl=pl&amp;lr=&amp;" rel="nofollow">6 mentions of it</a> in 2006 on Italian Usenet.</p>
<p><b>But here's the interesting bit:</b> what's odd is that this article started popping up in exactly the same format, neatly translated, on various Wikipedias in immediate succession. Compare nearly identical inital versions: <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_Telematica&amp;oldid=4925039" class="external text" title="http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_Telematica&amp;oldid=4925039" rel="nofollow">pl.wiki</a>, <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_telematica&amp;oldid=10637168" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_telematica&amp;oldid=10637168" rel="nofollow">fr.wiki</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_Telematica&amp;oldid=79839116" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_Telematica&amp;oldid=79839116" rel="nofollow">en.wiki</a>, <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_telematica&amp;oldid=4942159" class="external text" title="http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_telematica&amp;oldid=4942159" rel="nofollow">it.wiki</a>, <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_Telematica&amp;oldid=5014992" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piazza_Telematica&amp;oldid=5014992" rel="nofollow">es.wiki</a>. Most of them are edited from the same or related IPs that have no other contributions.</p>
<p>I did some research and found out that the name is actually being used to identify a specific product by <a href="http://www.piazzetelematiche.it/1994-2005/pt_faq_eng.html#faq004" class="external text" title="http://www.piazzetelematiche.it/1994-2005/pt_faq_eng.html#faq004" rel="nofollow">this organization</a>. They apparently market it to cities and other communities, and fund it from <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">EU</a> structural funds. If yes, they would have a clear interest in promoting this term on random Wikipedias thae are used by citizens of the European Community. <b>Moreover, on es.wiki and en.wiki, where named accounts were used, the name coincides with one of the founders of the organization</b>.</p>
<p>Either way, the article is either a vague non-notable concept-gone-OR published on multiple Wikipedias by an anonymous altruistic polyglot; or more likely, a nicely orchestrated marketing attempt.</p>
<p>I submitted the article for deletion on plwiki, where I'm a regular contributor; I figured I'd make a guest appearance here to submit our findings for your consideration. <a href="../../../l/c/a/User%7ELcamtuf_1a6c.html" title="User:Lcamtuf">lcamtuf</a> 16:18, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, it kinda does, since we're debating the notability of a vaguely defined subject matter on English Wikipedia (as opposed to a mention in <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotspot.html" title="Hotspot">hotspot</a> or no mention at all). Either way, it wasn't my intention to mislead others: the term certainly is used in Italy, but same can be said about names for thousands of other local phenomena (note, however, that <i>hotspot</i> and <i>hot spot</i> are used far more often on .it pages). I'm simply curious as to why it's propagating on various Wikipedias as a seamless translation. --<a href="../../../l/c/a/User%7ELcamtuf_1a6c.html" title="User:Lcamtuf">lcamtuf</a> 17:48, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep both</b>, per Yasth above. Writing a Wikipedia article always involves "research" in the broadest sense, namely the evaluation and compilation of information from various sources.

<p>Concerned about notability of publication, and also because article's creator seems primarily interested in promoting magazine <a href="../../../t/j/0/User%7ETJ0513_30f1.html" title="User:TJ0513">TJ0513</a> 16:43, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree with the deletion request, since I don't think that anything in the article can be considered to be for promotion purposes. It merely informs what is the purpose of the publication and who owns it. The notability of the publication comes from the fact that it is the only publication for the city of Stamford and has the largest circulation among local magazines in southern Fairfield County at this time (this fact was not included in the article, since it could be understood as a promotional information). Thank you. (Stamfordct 05:50, 16 October 2006 (UTC))</p>

<li>2) From the section on sports athletes.

<li><b>Unsure</b> about this one. I'm of the opinion that all pro athletes should get an article, though whether a one-game run in 1880 counts as "pro" is the big question.

<li>Still not any more information. Look, many people are verifiable as people. Many professionals are verifiable as professionals. You could find a website that listed me as a teacher working at the school I last worked at. You can verify I was born; when I graduated high school; when I graduated college; taxes I have paid. Lots of things are verifiable as part of the public record. That does NOT make them notable. Simply confirmation of my existance and my job does not make me notable. Does anyone review Ahearn's play? Are there any contemporary or historical records that tell us what he was like as a ball player; what the press thought of him; what fans thought of him? The fact that he existed and played baseball falls below minimum notability baseline. 4 at bats is well below the meaningful statistical threshhold to even extrapolate on his effectiveness as a player by a mere statistical analysis. There is no way to establish this guy's notability. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 02:51, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, that's just what one person thinks. Simply being a professional athlete alone doesn't assure that WP:BIO is met, that's the conflict in this afd.

<dd>Discussion that comes about as a result of releases from official sources, like the creators of the property does qualify. Not to mention numerous news sources on it, like IGN, who have covered it. And all your claims that this is old and out of date, and so the movie is unlikely to happen do is make this event history.

<li>nor are there any Google hits for its supposed most dedicated opponent Arrhenius Fishner.</li>

<p>X_2&gt; This game is already finished and has a pending sequel. I've cleaned up the article a bit to reflect this. It may be 'non-notable' in the US etc., but in some parts of eastern England (a.k.a where I am) it is real and is quite popular. I also believe that judging this article on its Google rank or results (whether Wikipedia policy or not) is an extremely poor way to check an articles accuracy. It is factual information and therefore encyclopaedia-worthy. If you erase this simply due to its 'unpopularity' it doesn't really reflect what an encyclopaedia actually is.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Subject is notable. They have run a national ad campaign across all media (TV, Radio, Print) for 7-8 years at least. Companies with those kind of resources are eminently notable. The article is crap, however, and needs a major rewrite. The entire article consists of a single legal case. Corp articles need to mention more on company history, sales, services provided, industry ranking, etc. etc. The current article would make a good section of the main article. However, badly written articles do NOT mean that the subject is non notable. This subject is notable, and should be kept. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Subject is clearly notable, even without my lenses in. Nomination smacks of failure to watch TV for the past decade. I can't understand why there is nothing in the article about the company, its sales, history, ownership, advertising, etc., and the exisitng article focuses exclusively on a single lawsuit.

<li>Have a look at the at the article at the time of nomination. The content that you refer to isn't there because the sources used, listed above, don't provide any of it.

<li>No you didn't. Those are the sources that I listed above. As I said, they don't provide the content that you want. Read them.

<p>It's true that Kwok is just an attorney, but plenty of other successful attorneys are important newsmakers and actors in their communities- and they are certainly on Wiki. Take John O'Quinn, Gloria Allred, Johnny Cochran, Ken Starr, Barry Scheck, Joe Jamail, and plenty of others. This article therefore does not deserve deletion.

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Rosenhaus_cd95.html" title="Drew Rosenhaus">Drew Rosenhaus</a> or rewrite to explain that the term is a widely used pejorative that refers to the network of <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban_exiles.html" title="Cuban exiles">Cuban exiles</a> who have influence in Miami.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 23:18, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The organization, informal and secretive as it may be, has been cited by major national media and certainly is a big deal in the NFL as it relates to how Rosenhaus, the most prominent NFL player agent, built his practice. As for the other matter that the phrase is sometimes used to describe an unrelated group of Cuban-Americans, I think that only becomes an issue if an article is created for that group and, even then, it is easily resolved with a disambiguation page or a clarification on the top about which is which. I conceed the point that more information should exist on this group. Since the sports angle is what I know, it's limited to that. Perhaps other information can be found that would add to its overall substance, to the extent the group is active in any other fields. <a href="../../../m/i/a/User%7EMiamiDolphins3_3973.html" title="User:MiamiDolphins3">MiamiDolphins3</a> 14:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is about an improbable sounding disease. An editor marked it for speedy claiming patent nonsense. Another one was going to mark it a hoax, but found google results and now isn't quite so sure. This AFD is to expose it to a broader audience who might be able to determine if it is a hoax or not.

Some of them, however, are for <a href="http://www.zerophilia.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.zerophilia.net/" rel="nofollow">the International Organization of Zerophiliacs</a>.

<li>Interesting case. They aren't non-notable songs, but I suppose they can be adequately covered in the same article. However, I would recommend merging them to <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_School_Musical_%28album%29_2e31.html" title="High School Musical (album)">High School Musical (album)</a> rather than the article about the film. Also, I would change the target of Eres Tú to <a href="../../../e/r/e/Eres_Tu_b697.html" title="Eres Tu">Eres Tu</a> (actually, I would recommend that Eres Tu be moved to Eres Tú and that Eres Tu be the redirect, but that's another matter), which is a disambiguation page including the undeniably notable <a href="../../../e/r/e/Eres_T%C3%BA_%281973_song%29_a8b7.html" title="Eres Tú (1973 song)">Eres Tú (1973 song)</a>.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>.

<p>As per the prod made 17/07/06; No claim of notability. Prod removed by Lor772 with the comment <i>This is quite a notable game, existing alongside Achaea as its sole sister project for many years</i>.

<li><b>KEEP IT!</b> I've been playing this game for years and there is no requirement to pay to play.</li>
<li>KEEP IT* I play, it's very useful to those who play, and in addition as the previous poster meant, paying is OPTIONAL to play this game.</li>
<li><b>KEEP IT!</b> I've been playing this game for years off and on, and find it to be the best of all IRE games. I've read through all the information and it seems notable information and credible in entirety. Paying is optional, it is not enforced. A player can earn the 'credits' that you can purchase within the game relatively easily currently. If you do decide to pay, or buy, it is your own choice if you want to. But I know many people who have played without paying a single dime, and have instead earned credits over time and work. If you are looking for a place to roleplay that is unique, this is it.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>; the issue is not if it is a commercial game or not, but if it is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a>. The article doesn't even <i>claim</i> any notability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KEEP IT!!!* this is NOT a pay to play game.</li>
<li><b>KEEP IT</b>* As one of the biggest and most notable MUDs left in the world I think the notability need not be brought up more than it has. The millions of people that play MMORPGs should be at the very least interested in a prime example of what made developers willing to produce the new, impressive, and impressively expensive games on the market.
<ul>
<li>With all due respect to the above anonymous users, it doesn't seem like they have read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. Here's a bit: <i>In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that it will be described by multiple independent reliable sources.</i> No such sources are cited in the article.

<li>Seems to me that perhaps all articles related to Iron Realms Entertainment need to be merged into one article then. This article, the one on Achaea, Imperian, Lusternia and all the others ought to be redirected to Irone Realms Entertainment then each mud ought to have its own section under the Iron Realms Entertainment Article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep. There is no good reason to delete this article, it is valid information on a game not an advertisement.
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEEEP ITTTT</b> Aetolia's effing leet! It's an elaborate, complex, and yet so FULFILLING game! I keep more up-to-date with it than I do the local news! I shower more on there than do I in real life! Aetolia is a drug. Keep it.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Hello anonymous user, I'm glad that you enjoy it but the quality of the game is irrelevant. What we are looking at is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notability</a>. Now it's mentioned above that Aetolia is "one of the biggest and most notable MUDs", but this isn't shown in the article. It would be good if that statement can be backed up. Lt Penguins idea for merging <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Realms_Entertainment_ae4d.html" title="Iron Realms Entertainment">Iron Realms Entertainment</a> with the four games into one article is interesting but even looking at those, not a single cited claim of notability has been made. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 06:53, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> though meatpuppets/single-purpose accounts have attempted to sway this AfD, the article seems quite detailed.

<li><b>KEEP IT!</b> Well apparently www.topmudsites.com thinks that Aetolia is of some note. I mean, Aetolia as well as the other IRE games have been in their top 10 for months. (in the case of Achaea a couple years)
<ul>
<li>Yes, and? Unless there are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">independent, reliable sources</a> for the information in the article, we can't keep it regardless of how wonderful its players think it is. See <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> for guidelines on the sort of software articles we include. Convincing the players to click on a button on another web site every day for months isn't one of the criteria. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> 21:14, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The information in the article is about a fictional game world. How can fictional information that is made up by the creators of said game world be independently verified?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It's not the 'story' content that is the issue, but the game itself. From <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>: <i>Software is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: 1. The software package has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself....</i> (etc) Now of the 'reviews' linked from the article, Frappr doesn't contain any information (apart from some kind of player map), and GameOgre and GameSpy merely print the cut-and-paste advertising blurb with NO user <i>or</i> staff reviews or scores. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 22:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What is the justification for all the other text muds that are listed under the MU* category then? Why is Aetolia the only one being deleted? Achaea has been the subject of an article by Dr. Bartlet, a feature on the TechTV show The Screen Savers, as well as a few other sources. Thus by your criteria I understand why Achaea MUD is an article. Aetolia is made by the same company (Iron Realms Entertainment) which makes Achaea, Lusternia and the others. I've reviewed some of the other muds listed and they do not meet the criteria by which Aetolia is in danger of being deleted under... why is that?
<ul>
<li>Because they haven't been deleted yet. <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EInclusion_is_not_an_indicator_of_notability_abaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability">Inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>. Feel free to nominate them. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> 22:49, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With all due respect to Cryptic, this policy might need to be revised in regards to text based Muds, Mushes, Mux, etc. This sort of "software" is not "software" at all and instead describe virtual communities/games that are more often than not under the radar when it comes to reviews and your criterion of "notability" will likely only be met by perhaps one or two of these text games. Most of them do not have software that you need to install on your computer to play them besides what's called a client programme. Client programmes are standardized across the industry and you do not need a "special client" to play a particular game, although some games make clients that tailor the mud experience to their own game.</li>
<li>"The software is among the core products of a notable software developer or vendor." It seems to me that by that provision, Aetolia meetst the notability requirement as it is a core product of Iron Realms Entertainment.
<ul>
<li>Good point. Then all <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Realms_Entertainment_ae4d.html" title="Iron Realms Entertainment">Iron Realms Entertainment</a> has to do then is pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and we're away. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 08:44, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> Should be split into multiple articles of cities by country. Include all cities in each country over predetermined population threshold (100,000? 1,000,000) not just ones already in WikiPedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The whole point of an encyclopaedia is to gather together related material about a subject. This article provides a strong mechanism for doing this, where the categorization system would break the cross-domain nature of related items. Admittedly, this has moved away from the original intention I had when I started the article: I intended that it would be a collection of prose descriptions of related terms, rather than a list. Are we now going to start working our way down the 100+ items in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_glossaries.html" title="List of glossaries">List of glossaries</a> (of which this is a member) and transwiking them?

<li>"The whole point of an encyclopaedia is to gather together related material about a subject." Actually, no it isn't. That argument applies to all of our sister projects as well (<i>Wiktionary</i> included), and a good deal of the internet. We also know that AfD inconsistent, but only generally follows trends. The existence of other articles in the same category (especially since this is a wiki, and they would only be deleted if someone took the time) is no argument that they are encyclopedic. My argument is that this argument is not encyclopedic, but is appropriate for Wiktionary, per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Lists_of_words_9e4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Lists of words">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Lists of words</a>, which concludes that articles <i>about</i> a category of wrods is encyclopedic, but articles that are lists of ords and definitions is more appropriate for Wiktionary. What is your reasoning for why they are encyclopedic? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:05, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>[Part duplicate of response at the AfD for Glossary of sexual slurs.] If there was a separate wiki for textile manufacturing terminology, then there might be a reason to move it there, but the whole concept of Wikipedia (behind its central purpose of gathering knowledge to make it available to the world) is to enable access to related information, and a dictionary does not provide that cross-reference facility. Ordinarily wikilinks would provide a mechanism to move from one related term to another. However, in the case where there are a set of terms related through a central theme, but there is not enough to say about each one individually in its own article, then it seems to be a perfectly valid and useful thing to do to gather the information in a glossary which can be referenced from articles that <i>do</i> have enough to justify their existence, but which would be cluttered by a list. It also means that those articles can all point to a single place, rather than having the information dispersed or duplicated.</li>

<p>There will never be a complete concensus on what Web 3.0 is just as there is no complete concensus on what Web 2.0 is.</p>
<p>One way to end this cycle of create-and-delete for this entry is to let the definition emerge spontaneously from contributions that can be validated against widely quoted references."</p>
<p>User Artw states "it's continued recreation should be grounds for deleting and protecting"</p>
<p>What does "deleting and protecting" mean? I can't help but notice that it does sound like censorship even if that is absolutely not the intent.</p>
<p>Given that the Web 3.0 entry (not the current version) was created and deleted 9 times already by different authors at different times, I conclude that it is a clear enough sign that there needs to be a Web 3.0 entry (or 'an entry about Web 3.0')</p>

<dd>I don't know what the "deleting and protecting" refers to either. I will leave a query about this on Artw's talk page.

<dd>If an entry is recreated by 10 different people 10 separate times over the course of many months then one conclusion would be that the Web 3.0 article versions are thus far failing the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> (note: no way to conclude same regarding Web 3.0 article versions in the future unless you have been to the future and can verify) but the flip side of such argument is that the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> itself is failing.

<li>You should have clicked through the technorati results before mentioning them. Most contain "30" not "3.0". Besides, it's not enough to have numbers. With a term like this, there's no reason to assume people are using it consistently.

<li>Crazy Russian must be joking, as God obviously doesn't have a copywrite. The Bible is public domain. As for the whole Christian bias thing, the Bible is favored by Christians, but everyone agrees that it is a significant document. What I am trying to do is this: The Bible is often used to point a finger at homosexuals. It is rarely used to point a finger at rapists, because the God of the bible has no problem with rape. Because most Christians agree that rape is bad, this article can show that the Bible is not the basis for modern day morality. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowyCaballero_078e.html" title="User:ShadowyCaballero">ShadowyCabal</a> 23:33, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

Perhaps: Prominent incidences of rape, Punishment for rape, Forced marriage, and Rape as a spoil of war. More than just a list of verses is needed in the article, though it will be tough to not add POV.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> One of the benefits of Wikipedia is the breadth of its content. Religion is an important component of people's lives and sets the context for how people behave in both religious and secular environments. If other articles on theology and interpretations of the Bible are worth including, then I don't see how this one is not. It is of significance that this informs worldviews, and therefore compiled information on the topic is of value to those who seek to understand such worldviews. The fact that you can make an article titled The Bible and X does not take away from the significance of this article, it only means that articles on those topics haven't been written yet. The Bible is a major force in the development of civilization in the West, and anything that adds to a context that helps in understanding it is of value. This can be especially noted in the development of legal systems through the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_of_hammurabi.html" title="Code of hammurabi">code of hammurabi</a> through the ancient laws of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_tribes_of_Israel_946b.html" title="Twelve tribes of Israel">twelve tribes of Israel</a> through to the codes of Rome, the Middle Ages, through today (this is a rather controversial argument in American society, the extent to which the founding fathers based the fledging democracy on views put forward in the Bible). Also, there are plenty of sources to support this article that would make it not original research. Because the article is inadequate now doesn't not mean that it'll remain inadequate in the future. Everything takes work, this is just a beginning, and we should work to add more information in an impartial way.</li>

<li><b>Changed vote to Delete</b> See above strikethrough. The issues here seems to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a>. A dry list of "Bible Passages Referencing Rape" is scanty on the notability curve. Interpretation is needed to make the passages encyclopedic; however WikiPedia can at BEST report on interpretation as published in reputable sources (those held to standards of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">editorial review</a>). <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> has already posted some sources that could be used. To interpret the Bible passages on your own, even to just paraphrase what the Bible passages said in your own words is to engage in Original Research in some form. Also, as it stands, many passages identified as describing "Rape" are possible Original Research simply in the identification of the passage. For one example, the passage that starts with Numbers 31:7 only mentions women as "spoils of war" It does not imply, implicitly or explicitly, forced sexual relations. One could easily make the case that, as their men were killed, the women accepted their status as captors, and willingly went with their new masters. To assume otherwise is to possible assign modern western motives and values on a situation that may not be under that particular interpretation. So even the existance of many of the passages in the article (where rape is not stated, but interpreted as existing through the lens of modern values) could be considered Original Research. Other passages in the article suffering from this sort of problem include Judges 21:10, Deuteronomy 20:10, Deuteronomy 22:23, 2 Samuel 12:11, Deuteronomy 21:10, Judges 5:30, Exodus 21:7. Removal of those passages, which may not even refer to rape (assuming rape requires interpretation), leaves 3 passages. That's far too scanty to have an article built around. This article seems doomed to start with. Eliminate all interpretation, and lose the article on notability grounds; or keep the interpretation, and lose the article on Original Research grounds. Either way, it seems a lose-lose option. If the sources listed above could be incorporated into this article, and all original research removed, it MAY be savable. But I doubt it. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also this article's topic is covered quite well in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a>. Term does not seem to be in popular or even scholarly usage. As a neologism, it is primarily an article of origional research violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and thus is not verifiable or reliable, see <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>. The term is hardly similar to "orientalism," it's closer to "anti-semitism" as it is used in this article. Note that the article claims that Darwin, Kant, and Hume were anti-African. These individuals did not concern their work with people of African descent and it's quite a stretch to imply otherwise. This article is not encyclopedic. This article is also confusing its own relationship between African and black. For instance, the article's image depicts the prejudice against black individuals, not prejudice against someone because they are of African origion. Discrimination against people of such descent is not always based on the fact that they are from Africa, so much as it is stereotyping the color of an indvidual's skin. Further, the article does not establish notability or importance and confuses anti-Africanism with racism against black people thus over-simplifying the view of African culture and ignoring the plight of blacks from areas such as Australia and the Carribean.<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 23:28, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>:While the article is of poor quality, that does not mean it must<b>Bold text</b> be deleted. Prejudice against Africans is a very real problem with deep historical roots. The first European explorers to Africa wrote that "Black people are a result of man mating with Baboons" (I think it was Stanley &amp; Livingstone who wrote it). Even Ibn-Batuta (himself an African from Morocco) had prejudices against "darker" Africans in the South and was pejorative to African kings like Mansa Suleiman and Mansa Musa. This establishes the historical bigotry.Slavery was a result of the belief that Africans are racially inferior to Arabs and Europeans. Also, contemporary anti-African bigotry comes from Christian missionaries in Ethiopia and other countries.Plus, the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur_Genocide_811c.html" title="Darfur Genocide">Darfur Genocide</a> is a result of the Arab janjaweed killing the more "Black" Sudanese Africans.Apartheid is another exapmple.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 03:15, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Anti-semitism is not a form of racism. In it's popular usage, anti-semitism refers to being anti-Jewish, not actually anti-semitic which has a different meaning altogether.

<dd>Both have racial and non-racial aspects. Which one is felt to be prevailing in either case, depends on which person commits it, on which person experiences anti-semitism or anti-africanism, and on whether one is not quite at that receiving end. For instance, the nazi regime did not 'discriminate' on religious basis but purely by ethnicity.

<dd>You are confusing ethnicity and race. Anti-semitism, in its popular usage, refers to ethnicity and religion - not race. Anti-African refers to a people of an entire continent and does not refer to either ethnicity or race. African is not an ethnicity - the continent is one of the most ethnically diverse besides Asia - nor is African a race. Yet, the term as this article defines it regards race. Thus, this article is best redirected to racism because its definition clearly conflicts with the terminology. There are no works of literature on Anti-Africanism from which one may draw a proper definition and description which would make sense. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 21:41, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not confusing: deliberately not making that kind of distinction in this respect.

<p>This keeps poping up on my watchlist and I keep wondering what to do with it. It appears on the face of it to be a POV fork of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearing_impairment.html" title="Hearing impairment">hearing impairment</a>. Although the logical place for it would be <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf.html" title="Deaf">deaf</a> rather than <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deafness.html" title="Deafness">deafness</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf.html" title="Deaf">deaf</a> is a dab between <b>deafness</b> (which is aliased and points to <b>hearing impairment</b>) and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf_culture.html" title="Deaf culture">deaf culture</a>, which is a long ramble about how only the totally deaf from birth are really properly Deaf (with a capital D). This article is a halfway house and is largely subjective. As a point iof principle the lead is completely wrong anyway, asserting a minor subculture meaning on a par with the accepted definition, and as the lead is a summary of the whole article (except in this case with even more weight given to the subculture) I think that's a fair indication that there is something fundamentally wrong. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 23:50, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article (like many) certainly needs improvement, but it also needs to exist. Redirecting to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearing_impairment.html" title="Hearing impairment">Hearing impairment</a>, with its physiological emphasis, is not sufficient. The disambiguation page at <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf.html" title="Deaf">Deaf</a> is horrible for links. We need a page on deafness in general, including physiological, cultural, and literary aspects -- probably with sections with things like "Main article: <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearing_impairment.html" title="Hearing impairment">Hearing impairment</a>" and "Main article: <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf_culture.html" title="Deaf culture">Deaf culture</a>". (And yes, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf_culture.html" title="Deaf culture">Deaf culture</a> has serious POV problems now.) The proper title for such a page is <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deafness.html" title="Deafness">Deafness</a> (which <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf.html" title="Deaf">Deaf</a> should redirect to). The article now at <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deafness.html" title="Deafness">Deafness</a> (at least the stuff before the TOC) is a fair beginning. --<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby Bartels</a> 18:05, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in complete accord with Toby Bartels. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:19, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> rather than a fork, I think that the arguments set forth here make sense. It is reasonable to have a large, clinical article about hearing impairment and to do so there will need to be subsection articles such as deafness for more general issues. As long as it is written in a NPOV fashion, deafness is an acceptable article. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 10:45, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and improve, seems like some good improvements have already been made. Deafness is certainly more than just hearing impairment, and exploring that in an encyclopedic fashion is entirely appropriate. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 19:21, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
