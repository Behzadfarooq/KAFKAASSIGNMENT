<p>Almost certainly a hoax. PROD tag was removed so it's afd time. I can't find literally anything on Google about this town, the image claiming to locate it is actually for another town.

<li><b>SAVE</b> There are many other movements of similar size with Wikipedia entries. The perspective needs to be made neutral, though, with 'we' and 'our' replaced by 'they' and 'their', etc. This should be an article <b>about</b> that movement, not a manifesto written by its members.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just to be clear, there are websites on the net about MGTOW. The fact they where not included in the article means that an edit is required so that it is on-par with the rest of Wikipeida's articles, not deletion. For instance the following is a link about the movement <a href="http://menforjustice.net/cms/" class="external free" title="http://menforjustice.net/cms/" rel="nofollow">http://menforjustice.net/cms/</a> which should have been included in the article. --Thorsson 16:18, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I said, you need to go back and READ the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> before you clamor for something to be deleted! From the article:</dd>
</dl>
<p>It has been argued that lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion, because (among other things) this isn't specifically stated in the deletion policy; and since Wikipedia is not paper with (in theory) no size limits, there's no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include "everything" that fits in with our other criteria, such as verifiability and no original research.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>SAVE</b> Edit rather than Deletion. The articles subject is part of the masculine, anti-feminist movement so I would consider it notable. Neutrality is a matter that can easily be rectified by an edit. As for citations there are websites out there about the movement, as I noted above, and an edit would once again rectify that problem. --Thorsson 16:34, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is fine, it is not up to you to decide when to censor everyone because you do not agree with what they have to say. And anyway, if this is not a vote, Yanksox, then why use the term "ballot stuffing"?? If it is a debate, then you should have no problem with letting everyone's voice be heard, in the intrest of fairness.

<p>This debate is a clear example of the wonders and pitfalls inherent to modern communication. Claims of ballet stuffing, on the surface, appear valid. Indeed, as defined in Wiki <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policies_and_guidelines.html" title="Policies and guidelines">policies and guidelines</a>, that is exactly what is happening.</p>
<p>The problem is simply this. How can any organization, born of digital communications prove its existence outside of a traditional media outlet? What options are there, other than a ‘head count’, and the understandable allegations of ballet stuffing that comes with it?</p>
<p>I put forward a simple question, what would it take, in the eyes of editors and admin, to validate the existence of MGTOW(as it seems to be the issue). And what sort of time frame is available to do so? As the answers to these questions would raise others, I politely invite a response ( osmod@hotmail.com) .Thank you. <a href="../../../o/s/m/User%7EOsmod_7f73.html" title="User:Osmod">Osmod</a> 19:19, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Funny you want to bring up what members of Niceguys forums are saying when you get together and say things such as calling us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phaedriel" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phaedriel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phaedriel</a>]Pathetic MGTOW morons Nice hypocrisy. Don't complain what is being down on a seperate forum and website when you are doing the same name calling. Another thing. I like how you call the whole forum and its members "MGTOW Morons" as if that forum is the only place where MGTOW is talked about, Discussed and followed as if its Just little ol' us. We are just the ones here at the moment. Shall we go spread it around to the rest of the sites and blog spheres and bring more people here? You see, Mgtow has already been at multiple anti-feminist websites and forums for the past year. ALl you need to do is take a look. Its been at Cooltools4men,Stand your ground, Mens news daily. mens-rights and a whole host of anti-feminism blogs out in the blogsphere and even has a comprehensive site at <a href="http://menforjustice.net/cms/" class="external free" title="http://menforjustice.net/cms/" rel="nofollow">http://menforjustice.net/cms/</a>&gt;Men for justice There is a book already far along being created at this very moment. It wouldn't be hard at all to edit in that "Notability" You say the article needs. All we'd need to do is go out and spread out the word and no doubt we could get those external links up. There would be the book out for sale. The language used could be changed to make it sound less preachy and "Soapbox" like. This could be done very easy yet you all would rather refuse to have it happen. Because you know we could make it meet the notability requierments. I don't see why this can not be done. As it would stop the need for such a debate and bashing one another. How?, Because then it would show that you really are just Following your own rules or that this really is just admins that want to silence dissenting opinions that differ from thier own.<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhythmic01_1528.html" title="User:Rhythmic01">Rhythmic01</a> 22:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Maybe some media coverage.</b> There is no need for traditional mainstream media coverage by the very way the movement is setup. Give it a read. Or better yet.

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Yanksox, That is a fairly complex question.</p>
<p>The first and foremost reason is the countless subtypes of feminism listed on wiki. If there is room for 101 types of feminism (exact numbers unimportant), then there should be room for a men’s philosophy, all be it a minor one.</p>
<p>Pardon my humor here, but I can only laugh when we were told to find independent supporting web sites as a minimum. The problem with that is this. Either you don’t care about what MGTOW is, or you have a political view on it. And sites that agree with MGTOW wouldn’t count for independent support. The issue is very polarized. Given that the MGTOW community has failed in creating bonds/friends in the feminist community ( can’t at all see why ), it makes it close to impossible to display a ‘independent’ source online.</p>
<p>Secondly, being listed, or more correctly, not de-listed, is a validation and a general step forward for the philosophy as a whole. A self-serving reason, granted. But human beings have been known to be somewhat self-centered. <a href="../../../o/s/m/User%7EOsmod_7f73.html" title="User:Osmod">Osmod</a> 23:53, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>As I've stated above, you haven't been able to provide links from fair sources</b> I put down the names of a few sites. Go ahead and take it from there. I refuse to sit down for the next 4 hours saving, linking and cataloging multiple anti-feminist sites and blogs so you can outright deem them as not being fair sources and delete anyway. From my point of view you already made up your mind. Now if we are givin the chance to edit out the page and make it so it can stay without it being deleted outright. I wouldn't be against doing the work. But it has already sounded like you have already made up your mind. First by saying <b>Well, we shouldn't go that far. Most of the new registered users voting to keep the article will never be heard from again once it's truly gone for good</b> You've already made up your mind. You claimed I haven't named any sites when I already did name a few. Meaning either you didn't bothering reading my post in full or you did and just skimed past it because you don't care. Thus no matter what sites I put up that show that its more than just the niceguy forum community you will still say. Its just one forum delete anyway because you personally want to see it deleted. I have seen nothing that shows an open mind. I gave you enough to jump start yourself. If you don't want to then nothing will convice you otherwise and typing here is a waste of time.

<dd>What's most ridiculous is that I sympathise with some points of your core values, but I think many of the forumites have gone about it in a most uncouth manner.

<p>You refused to notice my mention mens news daily? Angry Harry? Why not say what you mean 100 percent. "actual media attention" you mean just mainstream traditional media outlets. Nothing is allowed on Wikipedia unless its mentioned on cnn? What if I told you there was a book that is already out for amazon.com that served as the basis of MGTOW and damn near every basic and tenet of MGTOW thoughout all of his life expeirences. If anything, There would be no MGTOW if it wasn't for this book. Even more to the point. His current revision actually has an entry to a site that list the core idea of MGTOW.

<p><b>His current revision actually has an entry to a site that list the core idea of MGTOW</b> Part of the latest version of the book makes changes to the second to last chapter. Page numbers from my own outdated book are 254-255 listing Anti-feminist pro-male sites he[the author] visits. depending on if pages were added or taken out it should be in or around there.My own copy is an older one thus I can't give you an exact reference or exact statement.Feel free to buy his current version. Changes should include updated urls to referrals to anti-feminist sites and adding in some more one of which is about MGTOW. Him, Being active around the anti-feminist scene has said this to us[us as in anti-feminist...]. You would have the answer to this and indeed it should have been fairly easy to find this book for yourself if you actually poked around. Funny, You ask a question that was answered just 2 lines above yours. Even better I just type a paragraph restating what was said in one line. You know what. That is enough. I won't bother putting anything else here as you have shown this is a waste of time when you can't even be bother to read something that is.

<p><br />
Rhytmic, could you please calm down? Take a deep breath? K? Ok, let's get to the issue here, and stay as focused and concise as possible. I see you've taken our pictures off your forum; that's a good start, and I commend it, seriously. Regarding the article, it's not whether or not we want it deleted due to ideological matters. I think none of us (not even me, being female) have taken a position based in our sympathy to your cause or not. Most of us tend to think as Wikipedians; that means, there are a few basic rules <i>any</i> article must comply in order to deserve space here. For further information, there are several guidelines I would suggest you to read thoroughly, like <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENOT_aef6.html" title="Wikipedia:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>. What we're trying to determine is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the object of this article notable, as in, widely known and recognized outside certain particular forums and blogs?</li>
<li>Can this notability be endorsed with independent sources of any kind?</li>
<li>Can these sources be listed and, if possible, doublechecked?</li>
</ul>
<p>We're open to discussion here; and rest assured that we are perfectly able to weight in a positive and objective manner <i>every</i> element you bring to our attention. You mention that you're not willing to <i>"spend four hours saving, linking and cataloging multiple anti-feminist sites and blogs..."</i> Did you know that writing a good article takes way longer than that? Trust me, all the effort you're willing to put in this article will only be for better, as it may assure its permanence here... that, if you're interested in going through that effort. A second positive step would be to rewrite it in an objective and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> way. Take all the time you need; nobody's rushing you, and this debate will stay open for, at least, a few days. Just make sure that you're working with <i>our</i> guidelines here, not yours; it is <i>you</i> who wants to post here, not us at your forum.</p>
<p>We've had tons of articles that, <i>prima facie</i>, were unworthy of being included at Wikipedia, only to find out later and after further work from some editors interested in the subjects they covered that they were perfectly suitable here. Nobody's saying that cannot be the case with your article as well; on the contrary, I encourage you and other members of your forum to take the endeavor of making this a great article, one that we'll be happy to show around. And if you do, I swear right here that I'll be the first to congratulate you... even despite the fact that I'm a woman.

Look, if you guys just act in an uncontrolled childish fashion, you are going to inspire more true vandalism like SQUIDWARD. Then, you will just have to lock down editing ability. So, the trend will continue untill Wikipedia is totally locked down except by editorial staff, and at that point it will have lost all of its advantage to traditional media. I understand now why nobody in academia takes wikipedia seriously.</dd>

<p>Even though I am a big fan of Phish and the Grateful Dead, this group is not notable enough to have an entire article devoted to them.

<p>Not notable.</p>
<p>This is a standard AfD for an album that was put on a prod-AfD which someone removed. Policy says if anyone removes a prod-AfD, it should go to regular AfD, as <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">User:Meegs</a> pointed out to me. The anonymous user who removed the prod-AfD tag did so with no explanation or discussion, and added marketing copy and commercial links.</p>
<p>This is the only album from a musician whose entry was speedy deleted - see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ron_Sorensen_2a26.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ron Sorensen">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ron_Sorensen</a> - because it was a verbatim copy of marketing cruft from the singer's commercial website. The album entry was added by the same anon username that had no history other than creating the singer's marketing-cruft article and this album entry, and uploading the associated images. The label name on this album produces one single Google hit, to the recently speedy-deleted Wikipieda entry for the singer.</p>
<p>Google of "ron sorensen" "someday, somehow" yields 51 hits on 25 URL's, the first two to these Wikipedia entries, around half the rest to Amazon and its mirrors.

<dd>You clearly have some deep connection with ISRO if you speak of it by name and actually know what it is, Lambiam. While it is linked from Mr. Laciner's page, it goes to the Indian Space Research Organization. If you were a normal wikipedian (and not Mr. Laciner himself or an associate?) you would likely be as in the dark as the rest of us about it, not use being the director of it as a good reason for his bio to remain on wikipedia. On top of that, you claim he has books published. Well I'm sure SOMETHING (his organizations?) published the books listed on his page, but it was not by any real publishing company. I looked up the name Laciner on amazon, which has practically anything published ever, and there were no results. Thus, his "books published" were probably done by his own organization and that certainly does not warrant him a place on wikipedia. Heck, my uncle has published a few things that you can actually buy on amazon but I'd never think of adding him to wikipedia for that reason. Finally, yes he was selected "Young Global Leader", but the way you state it is misleading. He was A young global leader, not THE young global leader of 2006. If you check the list he was one of about a hundred or so. Unless each of them deserve a complete wikipedia page for that reason, merely participating in a conference, then that can't be used as a reason either. I seem to have exhausted reasons Laciner should have a wikipedia page, do you have any others? Vartan84</dd>

Actually the plan has worked, here I am defending Lambien so I must be another Sedat Laciner sockpuppet.

At the same time there are no entries of really notable Turkish scholars such as Kemal Kirişçi, Şerif Mardin, Murat Belge or Hüseyn Bağcı. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 09:07, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that it is a shame that these don't have an article. Only Murat Belge has an article on the Turkish Wikipedia. Unless the argument is that the names mentioned are at the border of notability so that anything less must drop off, I don't see how this is relevant to the decision we're trying to reach here. I don't think of the subject of the article as being particularly notable for his scholarship in the academic sense, but more so as an intellectual who through various activities has an input in the policy debate on a variety of issues. While not "broadly notable", there are many less notable subjects who have an entry, and I'm not referring to poor Mr. Mike Bach, but for instance all-around nice guy <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Hetherington_4c8d.html" title="Marc Hetherington">Marc Hetherington</a>, or Chris Weinkopf, or <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bauer_8f2b.html" title="Bill Bauer">Bill Bauer</a>, or any of zillions more. I personally don't see the point of deleting those (I guess I must be something of an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="meta:Inclusionism">inclusionist</a> then), as long as the information is verifiable and can be presented from a neutral point of view. But <i>if</i> we start deleting, then why not start at the low end? --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:06, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know people love him because he gives credence to wholly unnotable entries, but Mike Bach is on his way out.

<dd>As I said, I don't particularly want them deleted. The point is that I'm in favour of a certain evenhandedness; maybe I'm mistaken, but I sometimes get the the impression that people from countries not in the core of the First World with otherwise the same qualifications are more likely to be considered non notable and have their entries nominated for deletion. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:22, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just reading through today's deletion log I can't say that Non-First World/English speaking subjects are more likey to be targeted for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don’t see how Laciner is a leading well-known scholar in his field. There is quite an easy way to know if someone is indeed notable in his field, Laciner is in political science, right? Well, he has written books right? Then we know of the notability of a writter on the notability of his publications. If he is notable enough and that his works are notable enough, there should be at least one notable critic of his works published at least in one notable scholarly journal. I have checked in the databases there is none, neither was his works ever cited in a reputable journal. If we were to start creating articles about individuals leading or not, from who knows what think tank organization we could add thousands of people that have no place. Anyone here can visit university factulties and pick professeurs who follows master or doctorate degree students, what is the probability that they are published scholars and that their works are cited or criticised in a reputable journal? The probability is pretty high, and I personally known professors who are really, really reputable compared to this man, but still, I’d qualify not enough for an encyclopedia. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 06:03, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Doesn't make sense, I don't know that person, but suppose that that individual should not be on Wikipedia, how does this justify a keep? For all I know, I can randomnly choose anyone and give credence to his notability. Lets take David Davidian, he has a registered organization collecting databases, for all I know, publish materials, and of course he is the president of his own organization. Lets just add him. Lets also add Laciner protege, Holdwater, because his site and his pseudonym gives various hits. I think that he hasn't published anything relevent in any reputable journal other than his, and that his works have never ever been criticised positivaly or negatively in any reputable journal or ever been cited in any reputable journal would downplay the claim of notability. If him, his journal or what have you are notable, why then, no one cite them, why then no one cite the materials then? Had he not added his own page, would there have been anyone here that would have thought of ever creating the pages he has created? I am sure there are various Turkish Journals covering science matter etc., which are probably much more cited. Kamuran Gurun the Turkish retired Diplomat was much more notable, his work denying the Armenian genocide had been critised by reputable journals, is there anyone here that though of even creating a page about him? Laciner not only has used Wikipedia to boost his credibility, but he has used also google searchengines to do so, with various pseudo think-thanks linking to eachothers and then ending on his persona, and now he is here in Wikipedia desperatly trying to creat the illusion that he has some notability. What notability? There are hundreds of think-thank organizations, I can creat one myself, I can creat my journal, register it and publish works from my own publishers. would that make me worthy of being included in Wikipedia? <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:13, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

Your arguement of all human knowledge could be applied to absolutely everything nominated for deletion. If we are going to be that inclusive why need to delete anything at all? This of course would result in absolute everyone from the craziest nutjob to the obscurest nobody to have their own page, but I guess as long as it is within the realm of all human knowledge it's fine...

<li>I wouldn't necessarily call it "non-notable." It did win several first place awards in Xfire/Blizzard's movie contest. Also, the phrase "non-notable" seems a bit harsh.

<li><b>Neither</b> - Please read <b>Defence against Speedy Deletion</b> on the discussion page of the article before commenting. The relevant history is the article was listed for speedy deletion after one scentence had been written - at which point the author, (me) stopped writing it. (It has since been breifly expanded by other hands). The present afD listing is an attempt to retrospectively correct the original error of listing the article for speedy deletion but is flawed as the article remains unwritten - there is no point in puting effort into something which may not last 5 days. To delete the article at this point is to judge the article in an embryonic state and reward the intial breach of Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinstonwolfe_5756.html" title="User:Winstonwolfe">Winstonwolfe</a> 01:44, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - All that has to be done to avoid deletion is to assert notability. It doesn't have to be an article full of sparkling prose. In all the comments left here, on my talk page, and on the article's talk page, I have yet to see one real assertion of notability. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>) 01:54, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Re Comment</b> - Well at least there was a 7 minute delay before that reply&#160;:-). There are assertions of notability on the discussion page, and above, and who knows, there may even be one in the article. On the afD process c.f. speedy deletion, there is a discretion to delete the article if there is no notability, not just assertions of notability. But the question is whether that discretion should be exercised, despite the lack of due process shown in listing the article for deletion. Either way, I think we may set an interesting precedent.<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinstonwolfe_5756.html" title="User:Winstonwolfe">Winstonwolfe</a> 02:06, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - as I noted in my revision of the entry, the site has close links with Craccum despite its very small size in terms of membership.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think if you want to nominate every article, they need to have the afd1 template added to them pointing them to this listing.

<li><b>Delete</b> This appears to be advertising hoping to capture WP traffic and credibility. It is a non-notable project that has not been around long enough to show any significance. If it starts getting quoted by academic or main stream news publications then it can be reconsidered. The complaint that it is not written in English, however, is not a proper argument for inclusion, as I understand WP criteria for inclusion of publications. What really matters is whether it's notability can be verified. In this case, it cannot, thus should be deleted. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 06:22, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think having someone with a wikipedia page on your board qualifies you for a inclusion as well. Besides... a google search reveals allegations from other wikipedians that Ankaram is the same as Sedat Laciner, who created this page and a bunch of others about his organizations. I won't make the same accusion because I have no proof, but seeing as Anakaram updated the Laciner wikipage many times after it was created, the fact he created this page on Ilter Turan is not surprising. What is surpising though is the fact the Turan page is completely in capital letters and in serious need of improving its quality. All his bio states is that he is a professor of Bilgi University (founded 1994/6, I don't think such new schools would be that prestigious). Having published a few books does not make one famous either, quite a few of my college professors were published (and taught at American Universities more people would be familliar with) but I wouldn't add them to wikipedia for that. This is becoming an arguement about Turan's page instead of this organization, but I think I've shown through it that having some guy (Turan) with a wikipedia page who doesn't really appear to warrant having one on your board of some organization (RILP) few people have heard of does not make it deserving of a wikipedia page. Especially when considering the AUTO status of those who created the page. Vartan84 14:49, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - No, it needs the headings splitting off into sub pages. Thats all this is about. An overly long page, that needs subdivision. 98 kilobytes is an absurd size, and vastly exceeds the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article_size</a> guidelines, which give 20-32 kilobytes as the range to begin to consider subdivision. So logically, following the WIKI rules, AT LEAST 3 sub pages are required, and possibly 5. I don't understand why there has to be so much discussion about something, that is just the application of standing WIKI style guidelines. If this was any other topic than 9/11, it would have been done MONTHS ago. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 10:03, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What exactly makes the group notable? There's nothing that you've mentioned besides "we're an active group", which applies to about 99% of groups in America, and few of them are notable enough for an entry. --<a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzy510_a9be.html" title="User:Fuzzy510">fuzzy510</a> 02:19, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hey fuzzy why all the bad kharma here? You obviously have some sort of agenda here so why not put it out in writing for every one to view since you were the one who started this whole thing.....User:jpaterson@bloomberg.net June 6, 2006</li>
<li>Fuzzy; have you used the wikipedia resource lately? for example, go to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/encyclopedia" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/encyclopedia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/encyclopedia</a> where you will note the definition of an encylopedia includes "A comprehensive reference work with articles on a range of topics." Now, Kooks Anonymous is a surf organization. Thus, if an individual wants to do research on the topic "surf organizations in the USA, NYC etc." they could go into wikipedia and find information on the Kooks as well as other surf organizations. If the information is removed, that individual will not find all the relevant information, thereby making wikipedia a less than comprehensive resource. Is that your goal? --User:alex@outerbanks.umaryland.edu June 6, 2006</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fuzzy logic just doesn't get it. Kooks Anonymous exists in the real world, not merely in googleplexdom. Real surfers can get realtime information and shared knowledge of the real world of surfing. Members from three or four continents and several tropical and subtropical islands are in constant communication supporting each other. Kooks Anonymous exists to provide a support network and self-improvement capabilities to the ocean-challenged and neophyte surfer. Kooks Anonymous offers daily news releases and weather forecasting, political and social commentary as well as plain old brother-and sister-hood, not to mention a few good laughs now and then. Furthermore Kooks Anonymous is non-exclusive and open to all comers.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Maintain</b>. I remember finding Kooks Anonymous through the Internet. And when I came to New York, I met some of the real Kooks. They took me surfing, and they rock. Don't delete!! You'll be erasing an online resource citing some of the East Koast's finest bit of surf history. The group is notable for the unique situation of New York City and East Coast surfers. If you search Wikipedia and enter the term "Surfing New York" Kooks Anonymous is the first result, which is right where it should be to introduce all online surfers to the wild world of surfing the Big Apple. - www.kakirine.com - June 7, 2006</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete!</b> The article needs to be edited, is all. The dismissive remarks here about Mr. Fetting &amp; the faction he headed are "POV'd up to hell as well." There's nothing about this entry that is a hoax, the basic facts can be proven, and are relevant to millions of students of Mormon-related history, not to mention the thousands of believers today who accept Otto Fetting's claim to have been visited by a major figure in Christian tradition. I agree the entry "presents [the writer's] beliefs as if they are absolute reality," and I agree that is unacceptable. Don't delete it right away, I'll see about revising it to differentiate between the facts (such as Mr. Fetting being born November 20, 1871, d. January 30, 1933) and what are claims or beliefs.</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete!</b> Me again. I only just noticed the German Wikipedia entry for Otto Fetting, and that it is superior to the English-language entry being considered for deletion. ((<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Fetting" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Fetting" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Fetting</a>)).
<ul>
<li>This is a visual representation of the article's verifiability and notability: ______ -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 00:32, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Um...so you're still at that stage in the discussion? The verifiability and notability of Otto Fetting is established. I take it you don't read German. Either fix the article or delete it, but how about not using this as a forum to merely disparage a religious faction. Urban2
<ul>
<li>For one: the article is unsourced. For another: the article presents these beliefs as fact rather than encyclopedically (my largest problem with the article, still). As yet, no proof has been provided as to why he's notable, or in Baumfabrik's words: not "a minor member of a minor church, visited by a minor angel". -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 01:03, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes the article is sourced, especially by its link to the "Church of Christ with the Elijah Message" entry. For "another," I have said I agree the article is unacceptable because it presents beliefs as facts. I said it needs to either be fixed or deleted. In "edit history" check out what I submitted then withdrew, not sure whether it was acceptable either. As for your claim that "no proof has been provided as to why he's notable, etc.," yes it has. Glance at the German Wikipedia entry for Otto Fetting, please. And glance at the English Wikipedia entry about the modern church he founded, please. Thanks. Baumfabrik's opinion about what constitutes "minor" or "major" in the Christian or any related tradition, is irrelevant. To suggest <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a> is a "minor" figure in Christianity is not only arguable, but trashable, especially in the Eastern Orthodox view, which puts more emphasis on John the Baptist than the Western tradition. Articles about religious factions should be edited for verifiability and noteworthiness, not be a kindergarten exercise in "disbelieving" this or that groups' beliefs. --Urban2 | | 02:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sources, not another unsourced Wikipedia article. The sources in that article are all primary sources, ie. sources directly affiliated with the topic in question. If this article can be properly sourced, then I fully support its inclusion assuming that it can be rewritten. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 03:14, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Vote switched to a <b>Strong {<strike>Keep OR</strike> {Merge AND Redirect}}</b>, for the heck of it. And Urban2, you can feel free to edit articles that are set for deletion, especially if you possibly render them less eligible for deletion... -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 03:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Vote switched from <b>Don't Delete!</b> to <b>Delete or {Merge AND Redirect}}</b> In lieu of the German-language entry being translated into English, I doubt an improved version will be forthcoming. --Urban2 | | 19:44, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Simce when have we started removing articles purely on how it performs on Google? There are many reasons why Google will not index some sites properly. One such reason is the past history of the domain. A quick search on archive.org for 'smszone.com' displays countless pages of a German adult website. As you may already be familiar with, Google does not forget such things easiy.</p>

<p>A few of us on the aritcle's talk page are questioning the notability on this article, so we'll bring it here for more input. From what I understand, Kyle is a student in this anti-tobacco group, stand, and is apparently highly involved. The group received an award in DC from the Campaign for Smoke Free Kids. Kyle has been involved with a bunch of their projects and his name has been mentioned in some newspapers for it. A Google search for 'Kyle Peavly" returns 415 results. However, if you eliminate all results from "ratemyteachers.com," a site where Kyle frequents the forums, you get 25 results. In my opinion, while it is good work he is doing, it is not notable enough for Wikipedia. It seems like he's highly involved with the organization, but isn't THE organization. I, too, am highly involved with a student organization (I'm the national secretary of one that serves over 200,000 members) but I don't think that makes me particular notable. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 10:16, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're right he is not THE organization, but he is the Administrative Manager of the organization and goes throughout Ohio speaking on behalf of the organization, clean indoor air for the state (including giving speeches at clean indoor air ralleys and cities that are kicking off being smoke free including Kettering Ohio on Money), and is at every health fair in the state giving speeches. He is highly in the media for his work at least 4 times a week in his hometown area and more throughout the state. I have stated previously that I would be more than happy to provide media coverage on DVD and send that in. I just feel that he deserves a spot on here for all the work that he has done throughout the years and continues to do on a state level here in Ohio. He is one of our most notable teens in the state in our opinion but won't state that because it is bias. I just feel there's no real reason to delete this article and if you would let me know what more can be done to ensure it is not deleted I would be more than happy to strive towards acheiving that. Thanks again. -Melissa</p>

<p>It's ashamed that most of the interviews are done on the news and are only on video. I think if you were from Ohio and had at least payed attention to any tobacco news (which there has been a lot of it in the past year) you will find Kyle's face, speeches, and quotes plastered all over the news. - Melissa</p>

<dd>Originally, I was going to say <b>delete</b>, but I will ammend this to a <b>conditional keep</b>, if Mr. Palpatine agrees to work on this page with me to refine it, and do further research with citations. It is a film that needs a longer explination than may be given on the front page, but should not be as long as it is (or have so many pictures as it does) now. There <i>are</i> the workings of a good article behind this-- one which may utilize quotes between Kubrick and Clarke for an NPOV and citations. My guess is that if our effort is put towards it, it can be a functioning wikipedia entry by the end of the week. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoplayer_672f.html" title="User:Thephotoplayer"><small style="font-family: Impact; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">The Photoplayer</small></a> 11:17, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree, editors combine multiple secondary sources all the time; it is only "generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data" by the editor that is forbidden by <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. To my way of thinking, collecting information from multiple synopses is not analysis in the sense that WP:NOR means it; it is just "collecting and organizing".<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:57, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

The question is then, who is doing the synopsis? If that synopsis is by a wikipedia editor, then it is original research. If the synopsis is done by someone else, then wikipedia could source that as a secondary source, but the article should then discuss the synopsis, but not the film itself. Thus, a synopsis of a film must fall into two categories, either secondary sources has summerised it, and the article reproduces it, which is a problem with copyright, or an editor has analysied several synopses and summerised them, which is original research.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Phrases from <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> are frequently used in popular culture. The phrase "I'm sorry Dave" gets 139,000 hits on Google. A collection of memorable phrases from this film can be found at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/quotes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/quotes" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>.

<p>Proposed for deletion on the grounds of vandalism and notability</p>
<p>On two occasions the redirect to Satanism has been removed and an article inserted by Kyrus and 80.9.139.207. The former is a pseudonym Russell Gray Sneddon uses on Internet forums (one of which I admin) and the IP is similar to the one he has used there. The first edit was reverted to the redirect but the second one seems to have stuck. Putting the entry back after it was reverted is bordering on vanadlaism especially when the "religion" is just an invention by Russell Gray Sneddon and isn't notable and is purely here for self-promotion purposes. I could revert this back to the redirect for a third time but I wanted to make sure it was officially removed once and for all as it looks like this could easily get bogged down in a reverting war.

<dd>Just a quick note but I am not objecting to the word Diabolism per se - it is the equivalent to Satanism and was rightly redirected there.

This article is a very badly translated version of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> article <a href="../../../../de/a/s/s/Assyrismus.html" class="extiw" title="de:Assyrismus">de:Assyrismus</a>, which is quite comprehensible (if you know German), has been worked on by many editors, and contains some more material. Although Raif Toma is among these editors, the article was apparently not started by him, and it took about a year before his name appeared in the text of the article. The reference is just that Raif Toma is claimed to have some opinion about what Assyrism is (namely not only Mesopotamian patriotism, but aiming at the unity of all Mesopotamians). The google search was not very successful because the article should have been called Assyrianism. I've moved it. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:48, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>the article was apparently not started by him,</i> - How do you know the person that started this wasn't him in the first place? We dont know, and nobody in this world has heard of this silly word that has been created overnight. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 01:53, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't <i>know</i>, but it <i>appears</i> that way. Don't you think that if the anon who started the article was Toma, he wouldn't have waited for a year before putting his name in there? And while his name is redlinked, he never created a page on himself. So (next to the slogan: "Assume good faith") there is no reason to think he is a self-aggrandizer. Personally I think the sentence involving Toma should be removed as being unverifiable (unless a reliable source is found), but the presence of this one such sentence surely is not a ground for deletion. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:54, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is an exercise in crystalballism taken to an absurd extreme---the article's author simply has no idea whether the film will be made, and even concludes by saying it probably won't. It is stated that the film is in post-production, then a few sentences later, he states the film has not been made---which is it? Wikipedia is not the place for speculation as to whether or not a certain film will be made. When the film <i>truly exists</i>, then you write an article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 17:30, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This list, like its namesake and predecessor, its totally speculative and unencyclopedic.

<li><b>Consider</b>Look, I’m not really defending this, but there are a few things you have overlooked.</li>
</ul>
<p>From my research, I found that the picture that you claimed was the same from Christina Ritter’s to Mallory Jameson’s is titled Tina's Cute pics! 039.jpg. And looks like this: <a href="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h267/hollywoodhotness/TinasCutepics039.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h267/hollywoodhotness/TinasCutepics039.jpg" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> However, Mallory Jameson’s picture is titled Youngerheadshot.jpg and is not the same image. Also they look similar, but you can tell they are two different people. Mallory is obviously around 12 years old, and Christina much older, probably around 16 or 17. The picture of the older girl has smaller eyes, a bigger nose, and no lips hardly, whereas the opposite with the younger girl. The only thing that seems truly similar about them is the shape of their eyes and their wavy hair. Besides, many people look alike and have no relation at all. That's why there's celebrity etc look alike contests. Again, not supporting it, but just for the future realize those little details you ignored. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.163.119.188 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.163.119.188_4843.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.163.119.188">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are a number of other photos of the same person on that website, and they look extremely similar, and there are other similarities between the two articles, but <b>that is not the issue</b>, the issue is that this person is non-notable and unverified. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 19:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Let's add a few other issues: First thing <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnette_fleming_0d59.html" title="User:Annette fleming">User:Annette fleming</a> did after registering was try to get Christina's article unprotected. The anonymous edit above, as well as an earlier attempt to remove all the delete votes from this debate, and also an edit to the Mallory Jameson article, came from the same Annapolis ISP that was involved in the Christina Ritter episodes. We have the same case of an alleged role in a Disney series, where reliable sources don't list any such person. We have an empty IMDB page with no roles listed yet, somehow, "fans" are already posting on the messageboard, even though that page cannot be reached from the main IMDB site. (When you search for a name on IMDB, it only returns people with credits.) And we have a picture that sure looks a lot like the same girl, despite claims to the contrary. But, as Mak says, the main issue is that absolutely nothing in this article is verifiable, and even if it were, it wouldn't be notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:10, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It happens all the time. A person who is non-notable by Wikipedian standards creates a website or webpage. To create some traffic, (s)he creates an article here. The vanity page consists of ravings, exaggerations and unverifiable facts. Basic demographics are not included. Next we, Wikipedia editors, start looking for leads about this person, demographics etcetera, for verification, NPOVing and notability. The page becomes a knowledge-base on the person. However, the person does not like his birth-names, birth-date, a linked page with information about the dip in his career and/or other biographic facts and (s)he starts trolling through <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>, <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">edit wars</a>, sockpoppeting, dumping ridiculous threats of legal action etcetera. In some cases, e.g. Monica de Bruyn, notability is then stretched somewhat to prove the point that the person cannot remove the page and we decide on the content. I have always claimed that this is a wrong course of action. A biography of a non-notable person should be deleted regardless of his behavior. We have not succeeded verifying Mrozinski's "nr 1 hit" in Italy, his implying that he was part of Cats was imprecise and he is not mentioned anywhere in the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Music_Guide_0e49.html" title="All Music Guide">All Music Guide</a>. <b>I suggest deleting the article for non-notability.</b> <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 17:42, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> for the closing administrator: Please note that this has become a forum and as a result, an indictment for the flaws in the system. Allowing anyone to become an "editor" is obviously unworkable, as anyone with access to a PC can change information, give misguided opinions and/or allow themselves to be self-appointed watchdogs of information for the "public good". I feel that <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> and GentlemanGhost and their ilk have turned Wikipedia into a public forum rather than a source of information. Sorry that this once reliable source has become bastardized, but I suppose that's what happens when you allow access to anyone, however unqualified. <a href="../../../m/r/o/User%7EMrozinski_fce4.html" title="User:Mrozinski">Mrozinski</a> 21:52, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>To all above: None of this would be a problem if you didn't insist on undoing my edits. I have attempted to comply repeatedly by editing and/or deleting information that is unverifiable by your standards. Yet everytime I edit the page, another "editor" comes back and reverts it to pre-edit status. I'm sure that you would not want to be represented by erroneous information (such as my "full name" which is incorrect). Anything that cannot be cited or "proven" I have tried to remove, but "editors" keep putting it back. What is the point of this? I would much rather have the article deleted than to have unacceptable info be replaced repeatedly after I have deleted or changed it. If you take exception to my previous tone of frustration and indignation, imagine how you would feel if you were forced to be misrepresented by people who have no clue as to the facts. When these edits are constantly changed by various "editors", I have no choice but to change them again, and as aresult I get blocked and unable to represent myself or state the facts as they are. I have been insulted, condescended to, purposely baited ("just to annoy Mrozinski"), blocked, banned and otherwise dismissed all in regard to an article that is supposed to be about me. Please, guys, give me a birthday present today and just delete the whole article so we all can use our valuable time by attending to other more important matters. Thanks <a href="../../../m/r/o/User%7EMrozinski_fce4.html" title="User:Mrozinski">Mrozinski</a> 22:41, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can't promise you that you will get your birthday wish by today, but it should come shortly, probably by Thursday. According the article on the deletion process, it usually takes about five days for a consensus to be reached and appropriate action taken. Since the votes are currently strongly in favor of deletion, I anticipate that the page will be deleted, albeit more slowly than you desire. GentlemanGhost 23:33, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>As the publisher of the already discredited-on-wikipedia <a href="../../../r/e/v/Review_of_International_Law_and_Politics_3b95.html" title="Review of International Law and Politics">Review of International Law and Politics</a>, the "International Strategic Research Organization should be deleted along with it.

It is not appropriate for wikipedia, it is not any kind of leading world organization as it claims. Vartan84 19:37, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a serious and respectable organization. I don't buy the "already discredited-on-wikipedia" argument. First, the jury is still out. Secondly, if a bad entry is written on (for example) the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Business_Review_0d9b.html" title="Harvard Business Review">Harvard Business Review</a>, so that the consensus is: <i>delendum esse</i>, should that then really imply that the article on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Business_School_d2ff.html" title="Harvard Business School">Harvard Business School</a> should also be deleted? What about this hypothesis: the director of ISRO created this page <i>because he believed it would enhance the value of Wikipedia as a repository of encyclopedic information</i>? Why this hostile approach? Assume good faith. Although it is not recommended to write about yourself, it is <i>not</i> against policy. The article can be improved, but it is serious, not gone overboard. It does not claim that ISRO is a leading <b>world'</b> organization, but a leading <b>Turkish</b> organization, which is true in its field. The "pure vanity" lines you removed were not added by prof. Laciner but apparently by <a href="http://barissanli.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://barissanli.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Barış Sanlı</a>, IT editor for <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Weekly_e03c.html" title="Turkish Weekly">Turkish Weekly</a>. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:48, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Look, parts of the article are even written in the first-person plural, as it describes the guidelines for accepting submissions. The link to the allegedly famous ISRO goes to some Indian Space Organization. And most of all, if I try to find any cooberating information about this organization on Google I find no more than 10 unique hits, many of which being to its listing on wikipedia or affliates. The only pages that mention it seem to be: once on a Turkish newspaper site (the Turkish Weekly in fact, someone from whom has helped to updated the Organization's wikipedia page), one or two other (sometimes broken) links, and funniest of all a porn page. A sign of its notability would be it showing up multiple times on Google being referenced by outside sources, but that just doesn't seem to be the case. Sure if we want to enhance wikipedia as "a repository of encyclopedic information" that's just fine, however that does not mean we put everything and everyone in existence on it. Claiming it was done to enhance encyclopedic knowledge is just a nice way to gloss over the fact it appears to have largely been done for the sake of self-promotion by the journal's publisher. Vartan84
<dl>
<dd>What exactly is your problem? <i>This</i> article should be deleted because the organization publishes a journal on whose page the editor wrote "We welcome" instead of "The journal welcomes"? That is a clearcut reason for deletion if I ever saw one. Did you check? Maybe that qualifies for a speedy!

<dd>I perfectly know what a think tank is. Apropos, i did not vote for the deletion of the article, but i added a comment (for which i got no answer, though...). My feelings towards this or other organisations or whatever, is noone's business, and that's why i am not pushing POV in Wikipedia. As for the sources of my 'claims', i have provided links about the article mentioned above (common! everyone can see it is POV!). since the users who have voted for keeping it, are probably aware of USAK, can someone tell me if the figures provided are from this organisation?

This article has the same failings as the first time it was nominated for deletion. It looks more like a promotion for an individual plastic surgeon and academic than a legitimate Wikopedia article. If one looks at the cited awards, for example, there are dozens and dozens of doctors who have won those awards. The number of publications is not unusual for an academic at all. In fact, many academics have far more than these. It seems odd to highlight one doctor out of the hundreds and thousands that could be highlighted. If indeed this surgeon made an original independent contribution to the field, then I suggest that instead of a separate article, a footnote in the Plastic Surgery article would be more appropriate.

Take that away, and he is a run-of-the-mill practicing physician who has only risen to the level of (non-tenured) assistant professorship.

<p>This term (in quotes) gets 333 Google hits, all apparently from blogs, forums and such. For that reason, and judging from the links that are supplied, I have strong suspicions this "movement" consists of a handful of individuals at best, and is therefore not sufficiently notable for inclusion (let alone attested by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>). What encyclopedic content there is (about skirts for men) is already replicated at <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirt.html#Men_in_skirts" title="Skirt">Skirt#Men_in_skirts</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 21:36, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

As long as the article is not a platform for Dr1819's personal advocacy, I see no reason to delete it.

<li><b>Object</b> because, as you can see from the links at the top of this discussion, "Male Unbifurcated Garment" was repeatedly recognised as non-encyclopedic by the community. Then as now, the problem was not the underlying phenomenon — no one disputes that some men do wear skirts — but the protologistic coining of terms to describe it by what appear to be a very few people on a mission. The actual phenomenon is quite well covered at <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirt.html#Men_in_skirts" title="Skirt">Skirt#Men_in_skirts</a>, I think, and can be expanded there if necessary. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 05:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - That would be nice, but people keep deleting references to men's fashion freedom and MUGs there, too, again without taking the time to learn about how many people actually use these terms, both of which have been around for at least a decade. Also, Men's Fashion Freedom is a large superset of MUGs, and includes everything from wearing foreign (non-local) garb for men to the wearing of clothes generally intended for the opposite sex. MUGs, on the other hand, refers to the wear of a specific type of clothing that's primarily intended for wear by either men, or both men and women (as are sarongs in the South Pacific). Put another way, MUG-wear isn't generally about men's fashion freedom, and lumping it in with the Skirts is errorneous, as there are many forms of MUGs that are not skirts at all (Caftans, etc.) 12:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to note that on the page <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a>, it says that "<i>It has been argued that lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion</i>" under the header <b>Notability and deletion</b>. The article goes on to say "<i>The problem with writing "Delete, non-notable" is not about whether the articles should be in Wikipedia, but that it is a quick phrase that does not tell another person why the article is non-notable.</i>" and "<i>The recent fundraising page says, "Imagine a world in which every person has free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing." We are not doing that if we are deleting articles solely due to their obscurity.</i>"</dd>

<dd>

<dd>It should be remembered that deleting based on non-notability is NOT policy. Its interesting to note that the main reason to delete non-notable pages is that they "clutter categories", which isn't a huge issue to begin with.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the purpose of notability is partly to ensure the ongoing accuracy of an article. See, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANotability_%28software%29&amp;diff=57110496&amp;oldid=52543064" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANotability_%28software%29&amp;diff=57110496&amp;oldid=52543064" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> in the software debate, where the article on a minor piece of software is inaccurate but it is not important enough to fix. Notability also gets away from <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and ensures that many views are synthesised into a balanced article. Most new articles have a main mover, but my preference is for notable minority content to be added as a short section to a more widely edited relevant article first. When it has received peer review and grown established, it can be moved to an article of its own - as recently happened <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_criticisms.html" title="Java criticisms">here</a>, for example. I haven't looked into the content of either article in detail, but a (possibly cleaned up version) of this could come in a section of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashion.html" title="Fashion">Fashion</a>, with MUG being included in <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clothing.html" title="Clothing">Clothing</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 06:50, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I strongly suspect that neither the most of the regular editors of "Fashion" nor of "Clothing" would really want to deal with the topic in any systematic and sustained way within those articles, and I'm not sure that dumping the problem child on their doorstep actually accomplishes anything. There are plenty of stub articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChurchh_dba4.html" title="User:Churchh">Churchh</a> 16:21, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps we can find a better home. It only needs a handful of experienced Wikipedians at any one time to provide and keep balance. There is always the prospect that this subject will accumulate press reports and notability with time, though given that my small company gets hundreds of press reports a year, I think they have some catching up to do. I think the bit about MUG (strange name!) is quite interesting. I'll add a condensed version of this article to <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clothing.html" title="Clothing">Clothing</a> and see if it gets reverted. Perhaps they'll appreciate it. Obviously I have no <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> pretentions if it doesn't work out. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 18:42, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It looks like theres consensus to delete, so I won't push my points further. But i'm personally curious to know peoples' opinions as to what is wrong with labeling an article with {{cleanup}}, {{notability}}, {{sources}}, {{POV}}, {{OriginalResearch}}, {{NOR}} , rather than deleting them? I.e. what harm to stub non-notable articles like this do? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 00:28, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>More entries in the database doesn't make it run any faster, it makes the life of cleanup ant workers that much more difficult, it clutter categories, non notable subjects detract from the notable ones basically. Besides if a subject is not notable, no sources are going to be available for writing a proper article. Worse, it's a slippery slope, deletion is what shields wikipedia from hundred of pages every day that could be "stubbed" and "kept". <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 00:47, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The database is filled with *large* histories of notable articles. Small non-notable articles aren't going to be a significant weight on the database. Of course, if theres more content, cleanup is going to be harder, and cluttered categories aren't an imperative problem.</dd>

<dd>One thing I could suggest is split up categories into notable and non-notable articles - with notable articles most prominantly displayed. I would think that would solve that problem. A similar thing could be done with cleanup work, notables should get precidence. However, since wikipedia is meant to be improved for the *readers*, I don't see how any of those arguments argue that deletion improves anything for readers. In my point a view an article thats labled as shitty (and is shitty of course), is much better than no article at all. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 01:16, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was quite surprised when I found out that 100 articles go through AfD each day, with many more speedied, avoiding considerable clutter. I like to preserve the compactness of information, and if useful information is spread over many insignificant articles, it becomes the job of every reader to collate it. Deletion should also help train editors on what is required and improve the quality of new articles they write and edits they make, so one deletion may result in many good articles. The discussions also ensure we talk to each other about what we are aiming for, stopping us all drifting ever further apart in our aims. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 06:20, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Whenever I find a search item that I expected to go somewhere, but didn't, I'll redirect - and thats what should happen to lots of this information, not a delete. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 07:48, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An encylopaedia contains knowledge, not just information. The information in this particular article may be more useful in context, and may have found a suitable new home. Having 200 articles, 50% of which are accurate, is deemed less valuable by WP than having 100 articles which are all accurate, even though this involves deleting 100 articles.

<p>The result of the debate was I was a bit tired and emotional when I came across this AfD, although I was sober as a churchmouse... There are some arguments for keep but they're not very strong.

<p>The result of the debate was: after three AfDs, it's time for our <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">first pillar</a> of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> to assert itself. The external references (both those in this AfD, and the previous ones) make it very clear what this is: that now and then, someone points out that Newton was born on 25th December in a non-standard calendar, and makes an appropriate pun on 'Christmas'. But <i>nowhere</i> has it been <i>remotely</i> verified that significant numbers of people actually celebrate this as an organised holiday. I'm sure Pharos' science teacher was a damn good teacher, but he's not a reliable source.</p>
<p>To head off protest that the majority for deletion isn't enough - AfD is not a vote, and the discussion here, as well as the previous ones, have served their purpose by showing that while lots of people like the idea (particularly the young scientifically-oriented ex-Christian Westerners that make up much of our systemic bias), it hasn't caught on enough to be worth including in an encyclopaedia. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:27, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Usually nominated at or about Christmas, for reasons which evaporate as soon as you check Newton's birth date, this is a festival apparently proposed by Gordon Worley which has never really caught on. Unusually, I'd say the Google Test says it all: Newtonmas: 845 ghits. "Pi day" (quoted): 357,000 ghits. Michaelmas: ~1m ghits. Lammas: ~1.6m ghits. Christmas: &gt;350,000,000 ghits. So: this is, according to the Google test, approximately 0.0002% as significant as the mainstream festival which would fall on the same date if it weren't for the fact that the calendar changed in 1582. This appears to be a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conceit" class="extiw" title="wikt:conceit">conceit</a> (in the second sense) with no substantive evidence of significance or currency.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. My main concern with marginally-notable holidays is that by WP endorsing it, WP becomes a promoter (Google scrapes WP in no time, it seems, and puts the WP entry at the top of the list) and hence WP becomes a holiday-maker. That is an active role that is unacceptable for a <i>neutral observer</i>, which WP must remain. However, in this case I found <a href="http://agnosticism.tribe.net/thread/2ba9a16c-0499-4142-a504-f5933eeaff54" class="external text" title="http://agnosticism.tribe.net/thread/2ba9a16c-0499-4142-a504-f5933eeaff54" rel="nofollow">this</a>, on a fairly popular site, which shows me that we won't be first to embrace this new holiday. Another criterion I have is whether any commercial or money making enterprise is banking on its promotion - in this case I don't see it. Add the 'WP is not paper' policy to it, and it becomes a keeper.</s> <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:11, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I am neutral on this, but 'atheist' is POV - if enough people of any persuasion celebrate something it becomes notable.

<dd>I will try to make it as clear as I can. <i>Every</i> single holiday or tradition is 'made up'. The only issue for us here in 'admitting' is whether it is <i>notable</i> enough or not. We don't judge notability by our <i>opinion</i> of it or by whether we like the name, or whether we like the people that celebrate it. We base notability <i>solely</i> on reliable and verifiable sources that tell us whether it is 'widely celebrated', at least among some communities. Note that I withdrew from voting on this particular topic, so my point is generic.

<li><b>Delete</b> It's definition is simple and doesn't show much chance for expanding into a full encyclopedia article.

It has a place in Wiktionary, though, if it isn't already there.--<a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_aprendelenguas_c441.html" title="User:El aprendelenguas">El aprendelenguas</a> 21:19, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
