<li>Not at all. You'll see I've actually cleaned a lot of them up, and spent a great deal of time on it. However, I would concede one thing: that the label micronation doesn't help. It's too broad. If these things were labelled as political movements or clubs they might stand a better chance. As it is, when lumped in with <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Minerva_1164.html" title="Republic of Minerva">Republic of Minerva</a> which has/had territory, <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutt_River_Province_3c5c.html" title="Hutt River Province">Hutt River Province</a> which has gained legendary status in Australia, and curious historical anomalies such as <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lundy.html" title="Lundy">Lundy</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Indian_Stream_4978.html" title="Republic of Indian Stream">Republic of Indian Stream</a>, entities such as this come across as vanity and cruft personified. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 00:54, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, a small wave of these AFDs against micronations, starting with the one <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">User:Gene Poole</a> founded and right after his apparently controversial Request for Adminship? There are only about six dots here to draw the lines between, and the pattern is sort of obvious. Either this is some sort of retaliatory action, or the timing is so ludicrously coincidental that nobody's going to believe otherwise. If you are serious, I strongly urge you to back off AFDing these and try and make a case on talk pages. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:02, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

I then came to <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Atlantium_31bd.html" title="Empire of Atlantium">Empire of Atlantium</a>. Well aware of the controversy, I asked for Guy's opinion on whether it would be wise to delete it given the past controversy and that <i>exactly these kind of comments would arise</i>. Based on his advice, as an admin and a user I trust, and given my further research and contemplation I went ahead.

<dd>The Irony here is that you two have started out by (<b>assume good faith</b>) accidentally hitting a bunch of the more notable and well known micronational pages, and Gene's; Gene has also been fairly active in trying to keep truly not-notable micronations (that truly are nothing more than just a web presence, etc) from getting pages or excess coverage in the main <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">Micronation</a> article.</dd>

<dd>I am not a micronation enthusiast; I don't belong to any and merely find it an interesting subject, combining aspects of small group and volunteer group dynamics with geopolitics and the evolving definitions of what soverignty means in the modern world. I have no problem with the premise that there are internet-only and non-notable micronations not worthy of WP entries. I believe that Gene would agree with that premise as well, and I think he's been actively working within the micronation article spaces to try and accomplish that, though from the standpoint of a micronation member/founder/enthusiast. Though personally involved, his NPOV seems to stay in good shape.</dd>

<dd>If this is indeed a serious interest in cleaning up the micronations section of WP, I submit to you that a bunch of AFDs are the wrong approach. I also submit to you that given the AFDs so far, there is an issue with identifying the level of notability of various articles. Purely in-wikipedia and google search sources aren't necessarily good enough. I suggest that engaging on say <a href="../../../m/i/c/Talk%7EMicronation_432b.html" title="Talk:Micronation">Talk:Micronation</a> to identify consistent and community agreeable notability standards is a good course, rather than continuing to AFD things. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:54, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The number of articles about it specifically and the number of articles that mention it while covering the overall phenomenon suggest sufficient notability. (notoriety, I guess, rather than laudatory praise). This article (and the arguments given about its notability) seems a textbook example of why the Google test does not always reliably work to judge notability. I'm at a loss as to some of these nominations. However, suggesting that there's a vendetta brewing against micronations does seem to be stretching the point a bit, lets assume good faith. <small>Lar is saying "Keep" even though this <b>isn't a vote</b> because sometimes he fears his opinion isn't clear!</small> ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 05:35, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - my instincts tell me this is little more than an elaborate hoax (the nation, not the article), and not of the same notability as <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutt_River_Province_3c5c.html" title="Hutt River Province">Hutt River Province</a>, etc. However, the references prove that it is, at least marginally, notable. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 07:08, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
