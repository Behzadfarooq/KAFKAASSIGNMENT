<p>There is no such thing as the "Ginsburg standard". Ruth Bader Ginsburg, during the hearings regarding her nomination as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, refused to answer questions regarding her personal philosphy except as it related to matters on which she had been an advocate in the past. (In that vein, she was no less forthwright (perhaps more) than Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings, when he claimed never to have had an opinion on <i>Roe v Wade' or to have discussed the case with anyone (so far as I can recall)'.)</i></p>
<p>I assume this entry is being added because of the nomination of John G. Roberts to the Supreme Court. It is part of an advance effort to legitimize any lack of responsivenss by Roberts during his nomination hearings. That is clearly evidenced by the fact that the contributer who added this entry and who added similar text to Justice Ginsburg's own entry provided no detail of the nature of her refusals, just making the blanket assertion that she "refuse[d] to answer questions posed to her by Senators" and that it the phrase "still used by some today." However, until just now there has never been such a thing as the "Ginsburg standard," and its inclusion here (and its recent adoption by a conservative pundit or two) is clearly a partisan effort that violates Wikipedia's NPOV rules. Moreover, a Google search (not definitive, but instructive) finds only five references to "Ginsburg standard," all from the last week or two. Because this entry is inaccurate and biased, I vote that it be <b>deleted</b>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff.green_338d.html" title="User:Geoff.green">Geoff.green</a> 22:15, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I'm the guy who wrote this article. Wikipedia attempts to calulate the sum of human knowledge, not randomly delete articles. Hence I hereby vote that we <b>KEEP THIS ARTICLE</b>. --user:steven</p>

<p>Ask Sen. Schumer To Apply The Same Standard To Supreme Court Nominee Roberts As Was Applied To Justice Ginsburg Dear Steven,</p>
<p>Sen. Charles Schumer of New York has gone on record as saying he would question John Roberts, President Bushâ€™s nominee to the Supreme Court, about his views on abortion and a host of other issues.</p>
<p>When asked questions concerning abortion in her Senate confirmation hearings, now Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (then the nominee of President Clinton) responded by saying that the abortion issue could possibly come before her. Therefore, she said, it would be inappropriate for her to give an opinion on the question of abortion. (Incidentally, she had previously served as general counsel for the ACLU.)</p>
<p>Her refusal to answer questions concerning abortion has become known as the "Ginsburg Standard."</p>
<p>Ask Sen. Schumer to apply the same standard to nominee Roberts as was applied to nominee Ginsburg. It is the only fair thing to do.</p>
<p>Click Here To Send Your Email To Senator Schumer Now!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>Donald E. Wildmon, Founder and Chairman American Family Association</p>
<p>P.S. Please forward this e-mail message to your family and friends.</p>

<dd>"become know as the Ginsburg Standard" by whom? The AFA? Still vote to <b>delete</b>. Also, please mark who you are when you post changes. Thank you. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff.green_338d.html" title="User:Geoff.green">Geoff.green</a> 02:48, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Fuck Donald Wildmon. This is all false anyway, because Ginsburg <i>did</i> represent her views on abortion during her confirmation hearings: "[The right to an abortion] is something central to a woman's life, to her dignity. It's a decision that she must make for herself. And when government controls that decision for her, she's being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices." That sounds pretty clear. If anything, it should be the Clarence "I've never thought about abortion" Thomas standard. Fuck Donald Wildmon. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 05:10, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
