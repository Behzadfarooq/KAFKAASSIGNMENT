<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:00, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm one of them? I voted based on the fact it is a POV (or you did poor research) entry and non-notable. No other criteria were considered. You broke the spirit of the rules and when that happens it should be pointed out. You appear to be still denying that what you did was wrong despite an RfC? I notice you are already trying to appeal to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiquette_alerts&amp;diff=36296238&amp;oldid=36285274" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiquette_alerts&amp;diff=36296238&amp;oldid=36285274" rel="nofollow">higher authority</a>.

<dd>very quick search brings up multiple sites recommending this main title.

<dd>Hello,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

<dd>Thats insinuating bullshit. There is nothing wrong with alerting users to the fact that a bunch of delete-wannabies are attacking articles and demanding they get deleted without having any good reasons at all for the delete except the POV rantings of a guy that for some reason got to be an admin. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 01:09, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If he's writen stuff then he should at least have a little slice of wikipedia? I mean, Wikipedia is huge, everyone can have a share can't they? Everyone thinks that because he isn't in the news, that he shouldn't be included in wikipedia, the so called "sum of all human knowledge". But how do we know he isn't influencial? He effects hundreds with his words..... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:22, 22 January 2006 (UTC). BTW, I hope my vote isn't discounted, I count myself as a influencial editor...

<li>The hypocrisy is amazing. In one sentence you frame this debate as being between "Christians &amp; others" and then in the very next sentence you say, "this should not be about religion". It's <b>not</b> about religion! It's about maintaining the quality of the encyclopedia! We have <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for a reason. By framing this as a debate between Christians and others "seemingly" attacking Christians by (*gasp*) voting to delete articles of non-notable Christian figures, you are doing a disservice to the AfD process. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00A5FF">Cyde Weys</font></a> 23:09, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>For F$#% sake!!!!!!! Have you actually read what I've written before spouting off that big mouth like everyone else whose's replied to my comments!!!???? NO!!! What I'm saying is is that everyone's taking it as a "Christian VS Other" debate! But it's not! What I'm saying is that if people keep on making it about religion, it will create a drift between the two parties, even if it is about religion.
