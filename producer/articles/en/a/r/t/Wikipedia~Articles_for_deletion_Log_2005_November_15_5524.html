<li>Speaking of those VFDs, the first one is a nearly unanimous vote to delete, and it was deleted. It was only allowed to be recreated on a technicality; while the article had the same content, it updated itself automatically instead of by hand. All three of those VFDs had a majority to delete. It was last listed on VFD almost a year ago. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:29, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's part of the reason I VFD'd it again. In the year that has passed, everyone who voted to delete has seen their fears born out: though the entry is named "no pictures," there are pictures, which creates a situation where you have one person claiming the authority to decide what is offensive and what is not. Personally, I think photos of a guy getting punched, someone being threatened with a dog, and a man with electric wires hooked up to his hands are just as "offensive" as anything else, but that's neither here nor there. A concensus was never really reached, and I think we can now reach a clear one: this article was a bad idea. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 16:45, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> This article has a couple of problems. (1)&#160;It is inherently POV and probably could not be made NPOV. (2)&#160;The title is highly misleading if not flat wrong. It is extremely unlikely that the people who made these statement were actually “wishing” for massive destruction in America. These were hyperbolic remarks expressing extreme disdain for certain segments, institutions, or people of America. It’s pretty much the same as all those Hollywood personalities who swore that they would leave the United States if Bush won the election. How many of them actually did so? ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 05:33, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If nobody claims permission in 7 days on the copyright problems page, it is just deleted without the need for the discussion required on AfD. Most articles are deleted without challenge. Since it is easier to delete the article this way, copyvios are only sent to AfD if someone claims to have permission and we don't want the article. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 04:10, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Blatant copyvio advert. Even if they have permission, I don't think we'd want the article. Let's do AFD anyway.

<li>Handling it as a copyright violation means that <i>it is gone now</i>. See the article.

<li>Discuss the case if it is claimed that the text is GFDL licensed, and wait for the normal copyright problems closure process to deal with the article.

<li>No, it does not "obviously" belong anywhere. Tell me, to which Wikimedia project should I add the complete cast and crew of the school play I was in when I was in 4th Grade? Or the full list of official guests received by President Clinton during the month of February 1996? Or the complete texts of the dozens of love letters that my great-grandfather wrote to my great-grandmother a century ago? All of this stuff is verifiable human knowledge.

<li>What's wrong with the first one, it's factual human knowledge isn't it? The fact is, we can agree that it belongs nowhere on Wikimedia. As for the correspondence between my <i>zayda</i> and <i>bubbe</i>, I should point out that they were nobody famous at all.

Extending national borders or, worse, ethnic identifications, into the Internet and then claiming that there is some extension of this into a content designation, is silly, counter-productive, and the fruit of boredom or malevolence. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:49, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - there is such a thing as a Belgian blogosphere. How many Americans are interested in Belgian matters, or speak Flemish? It's naive to claim that just because there's international interest, that there are no national blocs on the internet. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 13:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Non-Belgians can write Flemish, and many can write French. The point is that there is no "there" in the Internet except for the URL. In this case, it's not an article about a URL, nor is it an article that describes a distinction of difference. This is an article not about a specific place, nor specific site, nor a collection of sites that have anything in common than that they are <i>assumed to be</i> from the nation-state of Belgium. The article makes no effort at establishing what that means. Once we get away from actual space and into virtual space, how is the Belgian designation greater than some micronation's? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:35, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> because the article has nothing to say other than "there are bloggers in Belgium too". It makes no claims of particular notability for any Belgian bloggers, and completely fails to identify any points that distinguish blogging in Belgium from blogging anywhere else in the world. Remove the words "Belgian" and "Flemish", and it would be impossible to distinguish this from a generic article on blogs. What next - an article on Belgian rabbits ("The common rabbit lives all over the world, including in Belgium. It is a small mammal...")? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was marked for AfD by an anon for reasons that seems to be making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>, but then blanked (apparently the anony thought better of it). But the AfD tag was still on the page when I went over to see if it was worthy of being deleted, and I think it is. So I'll save the anonymous guy the trouble of being branded a point'er and nominate it myself.

<li>Systemic bias in favor of all things internet-related has been identified on Wikipedia also. Countless flash movies, personal websites, blogs and myspace users get articles written about them, when they <i>generally</i> shouldn't. Individual politicans may be encyclopedic, but their blogs rarely are. This article is about a website that aggregates content from a bunch of different blogs.

<li><b>Comment</b>. One of Wikipedia's recognised strengths is that it is up-to-date, especially on recent phenomena. We have articles on every single imaginable video game, most music albums you care to mention, practically every single piece of software out there, a number of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">usenet</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsgroups.html" title="Newsgroups">newsgroups</a>, Wikipedia did better than the regular news media on recent events such as the London bombings and Hurricane Katrina, and so on. Where else but Wikipedia can people find hopefully neutral information on the recent and increasingly important phenomenon of blogging, especially political blogs, which are not neutral by their very nature. NPOV articles on Blogging groups (not necessarily individual blogs, mind you), perform a vital service to the world at large. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 04:06, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Dr.Dawg is my usual blog-handle--I put my real name in here out of reflex once or twice, but I've voted only once, so "sockpuppet" is a little strong, since no deception was meant. If I can register "Dr.Dawg," I'll do it, but I'm pink enough to have to admit I don't know how! Honest enough?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First thing, I can’t understand how someone can say the Blogging Tories are “not notable” when there are prominent Members of Canadian Parliament as part of the group. I think those people are grossly mischaracterizing the Blogging Tories or wrongly mistaking them as only being two or three random blogs. Blogging is fast becoming an important medium in politics and the Blogging Tories have become one of the largest forces in the Canadian political blogosphere. There are even numerous examples where they have had a direct impact in Canadian politics. There is no reason why an important website like the Blogging Tories shouldn’t be on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEsto_fd28.html" title="User:Esto">Esto</a> 02:20, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think I know why people don't find the membership to be convincing. These people could be members of a local supper club too, right? Does that make the club significant? The blogging torries is a website who aggregrates content from people's blogs. Couldn't there be any number of such websites? What makes this one special? I could make a website tomorrow that aggregates content from these people's blogs. Their best claim to fame seems to be when newsworthy events happened which were leaked on the Internet. By having a connection to that leak, they claim they're significant. This is crazy.

<dd>Other articles are not the concern here. Web stuff is overrepresented here at Wikipedia, so it's not surprising that unverifiable and insignificant websites sometimes have articles about them. Let's judge each article on its own merits, or maybe use the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline for websites. To answer your specific question, Daily Kos appears to have significant traffic compared to the other ones, even if adjusted by a factor of 5 for the populartion difference between US and Canada. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 04:26, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For starters, as I've stated before, a larger country by <i>definition</i> generates a higher volume of Internet traffic than a smaller one, which is precisely why the notability of a website has to be defined by its <b>own context</b>. Argument by Internet traffic alone, by definition, <i>is</i> an assertion that Canadian stuff has less notability just because it's Canadian — the arguments are <b>inseparable</b> from each other, because Canada's smaller size means a site of Canadian-specific interest <b>inherently</b> can't generate the traffic to compete on raw numbers. And statistically, simply multiplying the lesser site's traffic volume by the population differential <i>isn't</i> a mathematically reliable comparison of influence. The questions of the site's influence in Canadian politics, its notable members, its media presence, etc. have already been answered numerous times. The only valid measure of influence is whether this and ProgBlog are <b>as notable within Canadian politics as <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> is within American politics</b>. The contextual relationship <b>has</b> to be taken into account. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:58, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It speaks of a dog which has "been genetically altered with both human and chimpanzee DNA. The ability to speak was given to him following an amazing 47 hour operation in which part of a human brain was implanted." It tells us "Bojack was imprisoned in the heart of a star by the Kais as punishment for his despicable ways." It says "nothing seen on screen is fake or staged".... but I must admit, I'm just a little bit sceptical about all this. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 21:29, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (I vote in protest). First off, this page was not finished. I've been having trouble with my Linksys router for the last few days, and this has been severely impeding my ability to collect the remaining data together to make a full article. Secondly, I do not take kindly to <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima">User:Kilo-Lima</a> accusing me of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> for creating the article. And thirdly, I posted enough information on that first day for anyone who cares to do so could research it for himself and thereby perhaps speed-up the process of writing a complete article. Grrr...! Fourth: "probably but unproven" is most assuredly valid--analize those words for yourselves--because even though this list has not been proven to exist per se, it is highly unlikely that any presidency so able in the art of undermining opponents could do so without a systematic method of compiling dossiers. <b>I protest to this treatment.</b> <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetfreek_088b.html" title="User:Sweetfreek">Sweetfreek</a> 06:33, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actively making war against the United States, or giving aid and comfort to its enemies, is the legal definition of treason.

<li><b>KEEP IT</b> I'm a big thief and a liar, but I'm never gonna Wenzel anyone again now that I know what can happen. Thanks to Pirate 4x4 for scaring me straight. This just proves that the free market can solve all its own problems without government intervention. --Barry</li>
<li><b>KEEP IT</b> If the term wenzeled becomes a popular internet word (such as lol or owned), then it would be beneficial to have an entry about how it came into being. The 'wenzeled' phenomena could prove to be useful to the world of academia and helps us understand how the use of language in society can be altered by the internet, especially to the fields of sociology and linguistics. ~James</li>

<li>120 out of every million pages viewed on the internet in the last 3 days are Pirate4x4.com</li>
<li>Pirate4x4 is currently #5,219 most popular site on the net... that doesn't sound high until you remember that there are roughly 46,500,000 sites on the internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
give it a few days till google spiders all the pages linking to that thread and all the pages talking about charlie wenzel(this one included) and it's going to be pretty obvious how big this thing is.
<p>really that is irrelevant as the actual thread does nothing to illustrate Mr. Wenzel's fame... the other sites do that quite well.</p>
<p>I see no reason why anyone would even suggest to delete this page, it is not an attack page.</p>
<p>If need be i can copy out some of it and re-post it here... or to verify you can register(it is free)</p>
<p>there was an attack page add4ed to the wikionary as "to wenzel" and it was rightfully deleted, however i created the charlie wenzel wikipedia entry specifically as a documentation of the phenomenon and charlies involvement not as an attack.</p>
<p>others who have contributed have even deleted the couple attacks(his reported steroid use) that did exist.</p>
<p>this is now the second attempt to delete it... how many times do we need to go through this?</p>
<p>as for Ashibaka's silly assertion that it is a no name internet celeb... remember that the thread only got publicized outside of its home forum on Friday... in 72 hours the thread had 900,000 views... not too shabby... tell me of anyone else that went from "nobody" to 900,000 viewers, hundreds of sites and multiple t-shirts and bumper stickers and bonafide slang terms in such a short time and i will agree that Mr. Wenzel is no big deal.</p>
<p>this is no different then the Flying Spaghetti Monster in that it started as a joke but caught on.</p>

</ul>
"and the begging notice at the bottom of the article" that is there because it was already nominated for speedy delete... however it violates none of wiklipedia rules to justify a speedy delete.... i can understand you thinking its no big deal... that is why i said wait a few days to see how big it is on google... also there is now an internet scam prevention and awareness site named wenzeled.com... this is a term that will stick... but since "to wenzel" was already deleted from the dictionary due to what i originaly thought was attacks(something i have gone out of my way to prevent here) i made this factual non attacking page... I do wonder now if it was simpyl deleted becasue users here were not framiliar with the term... i understand that it is a new term.<br />
<br />
to <b>Durova</b>: i was not even a member of pirate4x4 until i found out about this event so i have no reason to want to attack Charlie. I make no threat to disclose any of charlie's information... in fact i don't think that act was right, but since the term "to wenzel" was deleted from the dictionary it became obvious that you all needed the entire story in order to understand the meaning of the term... so i provided the story... nothing more, nothing less.<br />
<br />
if any of you want to read the original thread to verify that everything stated is factual... why not just use bugmenot... that's right... because you have no interest in finding out about things you don't know.<br />
<br />
since I appear to be the only one who wants to discuss this. Here is an expert of the wikipedia page on notability:<br />
<br />
<b>Obscure content isn't harmful</b> Wikipedia is not paper and (theoretically) has no size limits, and so should include "everything" that fits within its other criteria. There is room for articles on any and every verifiable subject. There is no harm in including an obscure topic, <b>because if it is truly non-notable, people simply won't search for it or link to it. It will not create a significant server load as such.</b><br />
<br />
<b>Deletion reform is necessary</b> A policy of <b>"delete if and only if the article is not verifiable in a reliable source" would make it far easier to decide borderline cases</b> and would turn AfD into a more constructive process, which would make articles Wikipedia more reliable by adding references where possible. The problem with writing "Delete, non-notable" is not about whether the articles should be in Wikipedia, but that <b>it is a quick phrase that does not tell another person why the article is non-notable</b>.<br />
<br />
to all those calling for <b>Speedy Delete</b> we have already been down that road and this article passes with flying colors any criteria for speedy deletion<br />

<p>-As for this: <i>Speedy delete. Possibly slander. A juvenile vendetta over a $25 dispute that threatens to disclose street address, telephone number, and other highly personal information. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 17:17, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</i> NONE of the information released on Pirate4X4, with the exception of perhaps his yearbook photo, was private information. It was all gathered through postings Charlie made freely and of his own accord to other sites - EVEN the part about banking info. If Charlie did NOT want that information public, he should not have posted it in the first place. This is just another reason why the article should stay - it shows not only the flamewar that can start due to dishonesty (which in reality, matters very little) but the very REAL repercussions of handing out personal information and photos willy-nilly.<br />
-- As for Slander - all of the information posted on Wikipedia is verifiable, most of it simply by reading the threads, and the rest by visiting the linked sites. The origional post for $100 has been saved since the begining by Pirate4X4, and Charlie himself owned up to the fact that the parts were actually used. Therefore, though statements made on the forums are certainly bound to contain some exageration and slander, this Wikipedia entry, which simply discusses the documented events, does not.<br />
-- As a side note, Charlie had the option of preventing his public information from being given out by appoligizing and releasing the tracking number of the shipment he claimed to have made. He was prompted to comply by releasing one digit at a time, but instead he chose to continue with his previous course of behavior.</p>

<li><b>comment</b> i know it's bad form to keep replying, but tell me Wwwwwolf, where is the sockpuppetry?... I see none, I do see a few Wenzelites who don't know the procedures here(i was one until yesterday). I would also love for someone to explain to me why this is non-notable. If you are using the google test then I understand that you don't realize that this JUST happened and google takes a little bit of time to spider pages. I'm assuming you are basing the NN statement on your opinion... but opinions don't count here... an encyclopedia has no opinions. So lets look at the facts we have. It passes the Alexa test with flying colors... <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;url=http://www.pirate4x4.com#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;url=http://www.pirate4x4.com#top" rel="nofollow">The spike is undeniable</a></li>
</ul>
<p>that aside... why, if it is non-notable, should it be deleted? Wikipedia's own documentation states(as i posted above) that non-notable is no grounds for deletion if the information is verifiable and non-POV... interest in the subject will determine how many page views the article gets and thus it's inclusion, if it is in fact... fact, has no impact on wikipedia if it is non-notable.... which, of coarse, I have just shown(through <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;url=http://www.pirate4x4.com#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;url=http://www.pirate4x4.com#top" rel="nofollow">Alexa</a>) is not the case anyway. <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodrick_7810.html" title="User:Todrick">Todrick</a> 02:18, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> I have noticed that everyone calling for deletion seems to be making assumptions, Slander, attack, non-notable, joke, private forum.... I would suggest that anyone who has an opinion on this, either for or against do a bit of research. I am going to modify the article a bit to reflect the private forum issue. Also... what was the reason for this articles nomination... thew original post said she "Originaly though it was an attack page" then she continues with the asumption that it is a unverifiable because of free registration that was only added do to the amazing amount of traffic... nevermind the listr of sites at the bottom discussing Charlies actions. It does not qualify as violating <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a> and is clearly not an attack but a documentation of actual events. So what was the reason?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, here's a few thoughts for the article-keep-vote supporters. The real reason people want the thing dead is that the article regards a rather new "internet phenomenon", <i>and</i> the article is pretty awful and in dire need of cleanup and style improvement.

<dd>We've already established that webcomic cross-overs are plentiful and that this comic "usually involve[s] some sort of harebrained scheme to increase his readership." What we haven't seen is anything to suggest any of these schemes actually worked, that is, anything to dispute Nifboy's assertion that "the comic in question is largely an entity within the webcomics spectrum, rather than having any influence outside it." Following your link to the webcomics blog "Websnark" only confirms this: One of the comments off the home page is from the creator of Checkerboard Nightmare saying "I gave it five years and it plain old didn't do enough to justify me continuing it." I'll respectfully suggest that you reconsider your vote while trying to apply the same standard that you would for other media. A self-published book filled with numerous literary allusions that only attracts a handful of readers is un-encyclopedic. An un-signed band that attracts only a very small audience while playing numerous cover songs is un-encyclopedic. A webcomic whose only claim to fame is that it did numerous cross-overs and cameos but never attracted a large audience is also un-encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:29, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Dragonfiend, I find it a testament to the strip's pervasive how you have fallen for every single meta-property Checkerboard Nightmare purported to be, in its effort to deconstruct the nature of webcomics themselves. Checkerboard Nightmare should not be deleted by virtue of it being the only webcomic that used its self-aware nature as a means to further exploration of success and failure on the internet. All other webcomics you have referred to simply use it as an excuse for lack of a punchline. Straub is being playful (as he often is) in his "admission" that the strip failed. He has been invited to speak on webcomics panels with Gabe and Tycho from Penny Arcade, Scott Kurtz from PVP, and many other popular webcartoonists. His strip has been referenced as THE standard for metahumor in webcomics by many webcartoonists and readers. Straub himself has said that if the strip did become popular, it would sort of have failed at its own mission, which is why I believe he decided to end it. He had said all that was needed to say about webcomics as a search for internet fame. If Checkerboard Nightmare is deleted, so should the equally "unsuccessful" strips Road Waffles, Framed!!! A Modest Destiny, No 4th Wall to Break and Queen of Wands. DrHot 22:44, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b>. This is a joke, right? It would be hard to consider a more notable webcomic within the webcomics community outside from absolute top tier webcomics like PvP or Penny Arcade. It was significant news and of significant impact when Straub left Keenspot to connect with Blank Label Comics (after several years on said Keenspot and significant time as one of the top webcomics on Keenspace, both of which would on their own indicate automatic inclusion over here). Clearly, whoever put this up for deletion doesn't understand even the most cursory elements of the artistic field he's trying to 'edit.' I would recommend he or she not muck around with the webcomics entries without significantly more exposure to webcomics in general and the community in particular.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Burns_bdeb.html" title="User:Eric Burns">Eric Burns</a> 23:02, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> I'm neither a fan of Straub nor his comic, but to imply that it is not a major influence in the webcomics community, or that it is 'unnotable' due to spurious statistics or because it is ended is to ignore all the discussions inspired, the events chronicled and the concepts explored by this very, very well known strip and by Straub. I would recommend that if you want to consider whether or not an entry concerning webcomics be deleted in the future that you actually consult with someone with at least a passing familiarity with them. For future reference, a strip ending does not always mean failure, and after a number of years, such as this, it almost never does. It just means that the author has said what he/she needed to say.--</s>Blackbyrd2 02:17, 21 November 2005 (UTC) <small>—<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> 216.134.160.149 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.134.160.149_a442.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.134.160.149">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<li>It's all very well to claim such things, but unless it can be confirmed, the deletion decision will progress as if such claims had not been made. Something like mentions in newspapers, weblinks to media, <i>anything</i> other than simply "it's so because I say it is."<br />

<li>And yet you're not holding yourselves to those standards. All your arguments for deletion are "because I say so". By your own admissions you don't even READ the comics you're putting up so how would you know their value? And have you ever considered simply asking Kris about some of this stuff? I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be difficult to get confirmation that he goes to the San Diego Comic Con or that he's been a speaker there. And if you're looking for a recent link at a major site, Blank Label Comics (Kris included) just got done a shortwhile ago with a guest week at PVP. - Donny (who doesn't give a flip how many edits he has)

<li>I think its clear that anyone speaking in favor of deleting this comic's entry doesn't read webcomics. Is that specific enough for you Brennemen? And whether you like to admit or not the people who submitted it for deletion are the ones who shoulder the burden of proving their point. Like I said, its as simple as asking Straub about the cons and a look into PVP's and Penny Arcade's archives show that Kris is linked by them not simply because they like his comic, but because they view him as a peer, as an equal voice in webcomics. I'm tempted to say that the shit-storm you guys unleashed simply by nominating this comic is enough to prove its worth but you're likely to question that as well. - Donny.

<dd>Since, while I was spellchecking my writing, a warning about ensuring citing appear, let me list more directly why Checkerboard Nightmare should continue it's listing:
<ul>
<li>It is a part of both Keenspot (retired) and Blank Label Comics, two places the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> lists as large enough Webcomic Syndicates to count. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041129091516/http://www.keenspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20041129091516/http://www.keenspot.com" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://www.blanklabelcomics.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blanklabelcomics.com" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></li>
<li>As mentioned above, a Google search turns up 53,000 hits, not the 212 listed by Dragonfiend. His link: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22checkerboard+nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=210&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22checkerboard+nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=210&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></li>
<li>If I'm understanding the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Directory argument correctly, it only applies if the wikipedia article is being used to provide only, say constantly updating information or scheduling. This is not the case with this article.</li>
<li>The fact that the comic is based around the quest for popularity does not mean that is lacking in popularity. Rather, it is entirely based on mocking the average webcomic's quest for fame and glory. All the various cheap 'tricks' that a webcomic will try to gain viewers are pulled out and mocked, a field that is not exactly deeply covered in webcomics. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobulus_adcd.html" title="User:Bobulus">Bobulus</a> 05:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The criterion in question was actually added as a result of this discussion, is now being used in support of this discussion, and has very little support outside that of the person who added it to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</li>

<li>While it's not as popular as Penny-Arcade or Megatokyo, I was mainly pointing out that 53k was actual number of results for the search linked to in the original objecting post, when he had incorrectly stated it was 212. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobulus_adcd.html" title="User:Bobulus">Bobulus</a> 06:03, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. I find the original argument compelling. I also want to add, as I always do, the importance of guarding against a bias in favor of internet trivia while excluding things that are more notable in the real world.

<li>I'm sorry, I don't understand this argument -- is there a shortage I don't know about, where keeping an article means another article doesn't get space? <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScix_1b53.html" title="User:Scix">Scix</a> 06:58, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, I just won't go along with the inconsistency. I've seen articles I've written deleted even though their subjects were far more notable than this trivial webcomic. If it was a genuinely notable webcomic that succeeds in meeting the general guidelines for giving websites articles, then I would vote to keep. But the original argument suggests the opposite. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:02, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for explaining. I'm don't know whether CxN is more or less important than the stuff you've seen deleted, but I'd hate to see something removed that someone might actually find useful one day. I am admittedly new here -- I'm not sure WHY anyone would delete ANY article that wasn't specious or damaging. Consistency is important, but isn't it better to err on the side of inclusion? And mightn't it be a bad precedent to fight to delete something because something else was deleted unfairly? I'm just curious aobut this whole process.<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScix_1b53.html" title="User:Scix">Scix</a> 07:17, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards my original Google search, 212 was the number of <b>unique</b> sites Google turned up when I created this AfD. Looking at the number of unique sites is commonly used to avoid over-counting sites which have multiple pages with the same keyword. For example, right now when I go to the last page of a Google search for "Checkerboard Nightmare,"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22checkerboard+nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=220&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22checkerboard+nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=220&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> I see "Results 221 - 223 of about 53,900." That means that 223 sites mention Checkerboard Nightmare.

<dd>This isn't quite right. When you perform a google search, it collects a sample of 1000 pages (based on pagerank). What you are seeing is the total number of unique pages per the thousand collected. A rough extrapolation requires therefore that you take the total number of unique hits x the total# of pages, divided by a thousand. It's far from scientific, but it gives you a rough idea of the overall web presence, compensating for Google's search return system. This, btw, is why the number of duplicates frequently changes, even over several minutes or hours. Google is returning a slightly different sample. A quick verification of this is using wikipedia itself on google. You will see that WP only generates a few hundred 'unique hits,' despite millions of returns. That is the duplication within the 1000 sampled result. In this case, based on your link above, the 53,900 google hits should be multiplied by a fifth - or roughly 10,000 unique hits. This organised forum voting notwithstanding, a defunct nn webcomic with a few rabid fans is still a defunct nn webcomic. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 13:00, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The people putting up articles for deletion for 'non-notability' need to take a long hard look at their reasons for doing so. You can't just expect to alienate one small community after another, and get a good project out of it. If in doubt, don't delete. The fact that a community exists around a topic which can protest its deletion at all is a proof of notability that overwhelms statements confessing personal ignorance from any other number of outsiders.--<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 12:38, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

I do not believe that there is a credible argument that their voice is worth less in deciding notability than established wikipedians.

Next, this is a ridiculous candidate for deletion. The rules were designed to prevent vanity posts. This is not a vanity article. CxN may not have gained a huge readership, but it was exceedingly influential in the webcomics community. Mr. Straub has spoken alongside lumanaries such as PvP and PA repeatedly. It is by nature a webcomic about webcomics, and as such is a humor parallel to a webcomics trade journal. Finally, this discussion should not be taking place.

And wonder about the deletion policy that means no one noticed for almost long enough for the deletion to go ahead.<a href="../../../j/%E2%80%A2/a/User%7EJ%E2%80%A2A%E2%80%A2K_2b12.html" title="User:J•A•K">J•A•K</a> 17:09, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote</b> Despite being a CxN fanboy, I can find no compelling reason why it absolutely needs a WP article; I think it would be somewhat remiss to let it pass without any mention at all, but the exact details of the strip are probably not of great importance (and are readily available on the strip's own site). However, I can't help but think that this deletion proposal is an arbitrary one; it's based on proposed guidelines that could potentially exclude a majority of the items on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a> (depending on how strictly the fuzzier ones are interpreted), yet I don't see anything else up for deletion and it's not like CxN falls outside of those guidelines by an especially flagrant margin. Unless someone's willing to bring out the pruning shears (or more likely, the chainsaw) on Wikipedia's webcomic section, I think this debate would have been more appropriate as part of the discussion on the guidelines for webcomic inclusion. Given the broader discussion that's taking place on webcomics policy, I think that it should be examined not only why CxN should or shouldn't be deleted on its own merits but also what makes it more or less worthy of deletion than any other questionable webcomic entry. I certainly assume Dragonfiend had no ulterior motives in moving this for deletion, but the only unique qualification CxN seems to have compared to other entries for non-major webcomics is that the series just ended. Is active update status going to be a consideration for future deletion policy, then? In the absence of any other visible reason why CxN in particular should be moved for deletion, it seems like its update status is the deciding criterion for this proposal. Either some deciding factor (whether the strip's recent ending or some other reason which I have missed) that's been applied for the consideration of this page's deletion should be brought to the talk page on websites, or it's time to take an axe to the webcomics section. 137.48.20.136 18:03, 21 November 2005 (UTC) (I have a grand total of 2 edits, as I fixed a typo once a couple months ago.

<li>Pre-emptive note: user has ~20 (non-webcomic-related) edits. To new users and/or those user with very low edit count: your <i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy" title="WP:NOT">votes</a></i> will never count as high (if at all) as those of more established editors. This is simply a precuation to prevent self-promotion. You are, of course, welcome to vote and comment. But expect such notices as the above. The best suggestion I could offer these users is to provide sources which help establish the given subject's notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm fascinated how lack of coverage in <a href="../../../w/e/b/Websnark.html" title="Websnark">Websnark</a> is being used as reason to delete, and when Eric Burns, <i>the writer of Websnark,</i> votes to keep, <i>his vote is discounted</i> because of a low edit count. If the President of the United States voted "Keep" by announcing that Checkerboard Nightmare was America's Official Webcomic, the Wikipedia admins would cross it out: "only one edit." I imagine a good way to build an edit count is to nominate as many things as possible for deletion. DrHot 01:03, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow. Discounting votes bewcause of low edit counts seems a bit ... odd. Especially as I tohught this was pretty clearly stated as NOT a vote!

If you look at the first version of the article, you'll be able to see how it did look (way too promotional). I've made it informational now, not promotive. So, delete the redirects, but not the article itself. (And I'll be having words with the member who ceated the redirects. --Elliothaughin 01:15, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to make it clear to innocent bystanders what Joe Beaudoin is referring to, for a time 83.160.38.218 kept changing the link in Cytherea's article from her own website to one called onlygonzo dot com (I'm not going to give this user the pleasure of allowing even accidental click-thrus). Presumably 83.160.38.218 has an interest in this website, which is clearly a commercial entity given that you have to have made a payment to "Deluxe Pass" to gain entrance to it. As Joe says, blatant hypocrisy. Besides, if Wikipedia were to block links to "commercial websites", does that mean we should remove all links to websites that have a commercial aspect to it, even those that have ads on them for whatever? If so, there goes all of the links from Wikipedia to pages at the IMDB, TV.com, Amazon ... <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 23:33, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Forgive me, but I don't think I'd ever use the terms 'budding' or 'prominent' in conjunction with 'banker'. Additionally, 908 Google hits is still pretty small for the purpose of establishing notability, and either way, a lot of those hits don't seem to be the correct person, anyway.</li>
<li>Which Google are you using? With quotes (the proper way) there are 385 hits, without quotes, 585. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 03:43, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Note that the <i>victim</i> gets the hits. Any in-the-news item will get a great many archaic hits for when it was in the news, and this is especially true for any person in the news in New York City.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd said that, if we keep one article on a family name, we keep them all, regardless of notability. I mean, a person or even a family may be notable, but they do not make the history of the family name more notable than another. Currently, I think that there are short summaries of the origin of family names in disambigation pages of people, but I may be wrong. By the way, the article is good.

Other than that, there's nothing actually <i>wrong</i> with the article; it's factual, it's not doing any harm, and I'd consider <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curzon_Dax_b771.html" title="Curzon Dax">Curzon Dax</a> to be a somewhat notable role (and no, I'm not a trekkie), so I vote to <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 20:54, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The lack of other acting experience <i>is</i> odd, yes, but IMDb agrees with the article on the subject. He certainly doesn't seem to have something very noteworthy through the rest of his career, at any rate...it is a trifle weird, though. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 20:56, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>TV and film aren't the only working venues for actors, but they tend to be off the Google and/or pop-culture radar. I used to attend plays fairly frequently, and I always found it odd to read the credits in the programs, which for the actor bios had long lists of major roles in major theater companies -- Richard III, Hamlet, etc -- along with bit parts like "Police sniper #2" in an Eddie Murphy movie. As an example, take Joe Vincent (presumably red-linked) -- thirty years as a classically trained actor, artistic director of the California Shakespeare Festival for four years, worked on Broadway, etc -- yet all IMDB has for him are two bit parts seven years apart, one a TV-movie. That's the ephemeral nature of theater for you, I guess. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:01, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi, The <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonang.html" title="Jonang">Jonang</a> page has a case of vandalism carried out against me. They put in corrections, with my site's name quoted. Now I wanted to make the page here, so as to make it out that the page they vandalised is being used to plagiarize me. And this for the reason that I've been writing on Internet, using the Jonang page as reference, to prove something that is typically Buddhist-speak, which is "the Kalachakra is Sakyapa". Maybe I could write about the vandalism on the Geir Smith page, and about the fact that that vandalism is caused by my speaking about that page on Internet.... and the vivid controversy around it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The debate concerns the Dalaï-Lama school of the Gelugpas, that want to have this school of Jonang, kept banned, while people like me want to get it's 500-year ban lifted. By making the ban hold, they want to suppress my school from it's freedom of speech and expressing itself. Their agenda is to utterly gag me by vandalizing the source that I use, of Jonang-Wikipedia. (But I've safeguarded the uncorrected, previous version thanks to Wiki's service of that) Maybe you can tell me what the best manner of presenting it is because I'm thinking about correcting the page tonight (French time.). I could present myself as the person making this whole page and topic, go crazy, because big interests, like the big school around the Dalaï, want to guard it's power and interests. I know this all sounds sectarian and like that, but you must all know that there is no Paradise-Lost... and there are these very down-to-earth human problems in any human entreprise, be it political, religious or other. Thanks for your times and considerations. Hope this can still find some checking for better form and content. You're sure tough bosses. Ha ha ha&#160;! That's good too, for sure....

<li>The work is established neo-Piagetian cognitive developmental theory, recast in the only way possible if one wants to take an ethological view of learning. It really is as simple as that. It should cause no controversy. If you just want to hear what you already know, there may be a problem. Otherwise no rational ethologist who takes an ethological perspective on Piagetian theory and on learning could have any problem with it. Nothing contradicts the perspective. It may help you to know that this paper was published in the official EDITED newsletter of the International Society for Human Ethology. The point of view is scientific and is testable. Human Ethology is a relatively new area and you really cannot expect much better than this if you really want an overview of a major aspect of this field.</li>

<dd>Please provide a citation (volume/number/pages), and please indicate what you mean by "edited." Is this "edited newsletter" a peer-reviewed journal? <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> means that Wikipedia articles must be summaries of <i>well-established,</i> generally accepted knowledge.</dd>

<dd>I am troubled by your statement that "If you just want to hear what you already know, there may be a problem." From an encyclopedia, I do not necessarily want to hear what <b>I</b> already know, but I very definitely want to hear what is <i>generally known and accepted.</i> Wikipedia is not suitable for publishing essay that presents fresh, original ideas on a topic, even if they are sensible, valid, likely to become generally adopted, <i>well founded</i> in established knowledge and <i>buttressed</i> by references. Wikipedia is not for dissemination of original ideas. We have nothing against original ideas, but the mission of Wikipedia is to be an encyclopedia, not a journal.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The style and content of the article also suggest original research. In fact the phrase "This outlook, I believe..." suggests that the whole point of the article is to present a point of view. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Provisionally: delete</b> The <i>topic itself</i> is definitely encyclopedic. The style and presentation are not; encyclopedia articles are supposed to teach and at least the introductory paragraphs should be accessible to the general reader. It is not appropriate for them to be written in the first person. However, there's no point in worrying yet about style. As nearly as I can tell so far, this is in fact a personal essay. It's said that it has been published, but no citation has yet been provided, and it's not clear to me whether the newsletter of the International Society for Human Ethology is peer-reviewed journal. I'm prepared to change my vote if I'm convinced that this does not fall under our <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> policy. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Newsletter for the International Society for Human Ethology is edited, meaning the editor selects from a range of essays and articles which to publish. The editor at the time the essay under discussion was published was Frans X. PLOOIJ You can email him at fplooij@kiddygroup.com . Ask him about this very article -- which was very well-received. I also am a colleague of I. Eibl-Ebesfeldt and reviewed his book on Human Ethology is that same Newsletter. I am also published (in a rare FIRST "Letter to the Editor") in the journal, Ethology and Sociobiology. That article was on classical ethology and its application to human study and was well reviewed. Anyhow, you can consult with any authoritative writer in the Human Ethology area and get an authoritative opinion. Otherwise, my opinion may well be the most authoritative opinion you have. Go ahead and have nothing instead or some amateur write some off-the-mark simplistic and inaccurate piece.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also a student and colleague of William Charlesworth (now a retired professor, University of MN). You may contact him for an opinion on my paper. He was one of the founders of the International Society for Human Ethology. I can argue no more for my article except to say that it is appropriately general and basic to be indeed be an appropriate opening article on human ethology. By the way, my real name is B.L. Jesness (Lorlarson is just my 'handle') -- Lorlarson</p>

<dd>I'm impressed that you're a colleague of Iräneus Eibl-Eibesfeldt. You may well be an authority, but <i>no Wikipedia article stands on the authority of its contributor,</i> so it's still necessary to cite sources, and still necessary to help <i>non</i>-authorities verify things.

<li>I basically agree. However, if someone could show Dr. Jesness' publication in the Newsletter for the International Society for Human Ethology has been <i>cited</i> somewhere important, in a book by Eibl-Eibesfeldt for example, then I'd consider keep-and-cleanup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>delete</b> I'm surprised we don't have a WP entry for <b>human ethology</b> the topic certainly ought to be covered. While the title of this piece is <b>human ethology</b>, the topic of the article is actually <b>Human Cognitive-Developmental Ethology: an ethological theory of human learning: a cognitive-developmental, neo-Piagetian, ethological theory -- based on the methods of classical ethology</b>. I remain to be convinced that the thesis of this essay constitutes a tradition of thought which exists apart from this essay. If this piece is influential enough to establish the topic for inclusion in an encyclopedia, then I would like to see confirmation (eg. entry in the Science Citation Index demonstrating action). The piece as it is is entirely inappropriate for WP. The ALL CAPS for emphasis, the lack of structure (headings subheadings wikilinks) could all be fixed, but this is clearly the work of a single author and intended to remain unedited by others (note use of first person eg. " I will try to outline what I see as the basic types of processes..." and this footer "For MUCH MORE on this method, perspective and approach see my larger papers Click THIS LINK <a href="http://cyberper.cnc.net/myLargePapers.htm" class="external free" title="http://cyberper.cnc.net/myLargePapers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cyberper.cnc.net/myLargePapers.htm</a> to find out how to obtain them.

<dd><b>Comment: Status update</b> After some considerable work scrolling through slow-scrolling bitmapped PDF files, I've found the paper, which can be downloaded from the HEB 1986-1987 link on [this page], and the citation would appear to be:
<dl>
<dd>Jesness, Bradley (1987): <i>An ethological conceptualization of learning: Learning in terms of the interrelated development of basic capacities</i>, Human Ethology Newsletter (ISSN 0739-2036), 5(3) pp. 4-6.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is described as a "Mini Communication" and the author is identified as "Bradley Jesness" with a Minneapolis street address (no institutional affiliation mentioned).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The PDF consists of bitmapped images and is unsearchable and very unpleasant to scroll through; scroll just about halfway down to get to volume 5 number 3.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not that it matters, as there would seem to be no copyright problem, but interestingly enough the journal does not seem to have a copyright notice anywhere. The use of ALL CAPS emphasis is a faithful copy of the paper as originally published.</dd>

<p>This page claims Goldkind was "one of the UK's first evangelists for the Internet", among other things, but there is remarkably little evidence to back this up.

For that matter, <i>I</i> was promoting the Internet as a mainstream medium back then, along with Eric Peacock, former CEO of Babygro.

<li><b>Note</b> LOL! I don't know who edited it but it's truely sad!! I assume it was you, Tim? Anyway, whoever it was, it's certainly a KUCA activist and that just goes to show what lengths tories have to go to to win an argument. I've already suggested this article can be deleted, but it's still here: yet yours got deleted! Must be gutting for you. I have the original still on disk but I'm not THAT bothered that I'm going to re-post it.

<li>The only edit I have made to the article is to put in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversity_of_Kent_4408.html" title="Category:University of Kent">University of Kent category</a> as part of a wider building up of both that and several other University categories. I don't know who wrote what about the numbers on the mailing list, but perhaps the number of paid-up members would be a better statistic to use. That the KUCA article got deleted is not gutting for me - it had been VfDed before. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 05:41, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As Chair of Kent Labour Students, I can say with some authority that this page is entirely pointless. For the record, we have over 40 paid up members (plus 100 more on the mailing list), but if people are going to edit articles out of spite or some childish attempt at "politics", then the whole thing is even more pointless. We are a Labour Club at a University; one of hundreds in the UK and no one in the world cares about us apart from our loyal members. If anyone is interested in finding out more about us then they can visit our quite extensive website. Therefore I see no reason for there to be a Wikipedia page at all.

There is a unanimous call to <b>keep</b> this article, including two votes to <b>speedily keep</b>. The article describes an important Supreme Court case from 1984; however, it is entirely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unreferenced</a>. From a brief search of law websites, the documentation available on this case is of such volume and notability that I cannot see how it might be termed "non-notable." However, it does appear that the article has been mistakenly titled. The case in question appears to be <b>UNITED STATES v. LEON, 468 U.S. 897 (1984)</b>, argued January 17, 1984, decided July 5, 1984, with Justice J White delivering the Opinion of the Court. This is not the same as <b>LEON v. UNITED STATES, 384 U.S. 882</b>, a 1966 petition for a writ of certiorari. Therefore, I will move this article to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_v._Leon_e41a.html" title="United States v. Leon">United States v. Leon</a>, and source the article to references.</p>
<p>Finally, if I may be so bold as to suggest it, this underscores yet once more the importance of paying attention to <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></b>. The verifiability policy is a central pillar of Wikipedia article policy, and I hope we pay more attention to it than we currently do.

Rather than a reproduction of a published list of bad songs, this article is made up of some titles taken from such lists with no apparent methodology.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. It is not original research to write an article that isn't a copy-paste of a pre-existing article. "Original research" would be saying "x song is bad" when no one significant has said that before; listing various songs that have been especially noteworthy for a source saying that they are bad is not "original research", it's combining old research into a new, easily-accessible way. In fact, I'd be more tempted to delete this article if it <b>was</b> a "published list of bad songs", since it'd very likely be a copyvio and in any case would be 100% useless (since an external link or "further reading" mention would suffice just as well).

<li>"entirely subjective, some people's worst song is another's favourite." - Hm. You clearly don't understand Wikipedia lists, or at least this one. The article is not about songs that <i>everyone</i> thinks are the worst ever, it's about songs that a <i>powerful majority</i> have said are the worst ever in various polls. Since <i>nothing in the entire world</i> is agreed upon 100% by anyone, I'm surprised that you'd make such a bizarre demand as to only allow this article to exist if it was somehow fancifully possible to magically see what songs everyone hates (as though such a song could exist). It makes no more sense than expanding "no original research" to "no research", as some on this vote seem to be arguing for. As long as it's not <i>Wikipedia's</i> opinion that's being expressed, but rather various third parties, the article is completely NPOV, and just needs some polishing up and expansion to reach an acceptable level of quality. Hopefully you will regret your delete votes if this page ever reaches the level of quality of, say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the worst ever">List of films that have been considered the worst ever</a>; if not, there's probably no chance of reasoning with you. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"By whom?" - By any noteworthy, major source.</li>
<li>"Why should we care?" - Not caring about an article's topic is not sufficient rationale for deletion. Plenty of people do care about this topic, because they're interested in major popular opinions and their reaction to various songs. I don't care about <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_I%2C_Duke_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg_e69d.html" title="Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg">Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, but you don't see me putting him up for VfD. And this article will benefit, inform, and interest substantially more people than Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.</li>
<li>"People's opinions vary; one man's trash is another man's treasure and vice versa." - You don't seem to comprehend the significant other aspect of that saying: yes, there is no unanimity in what is or isn't "treasure", but there is <i>certainly</i> a strong majority! Most people who see an unearthed trunk full of gold coins, for example, would call it "treasure", even though some wouldn't; the fact that there is dissenters no more means that we can't discuss what people consider "treasure" than that we can't discuss what people consider "terrible songs", as long as we cite sources. You fail to draw the line between "every song is liked by <i>someone</i>" (which is as true as it is irrelevant) and "it's impossible to call any song widely disliked because there are always dissenters" (which is patent nonsense; unanimity is not a requirement for majority): the whole <i>idea</i> of these articles is to base it on majority and widespread opinions that have been documented by major polls, lists, reviewers, etc. It's not to find any song "unanimously hated"; since such a notion is inherently impossible, I'm surprised that you even considered that as a possible goal for this article, or for any other article. <i>All</i> articles on Wikipedia focus solely on the most noteworthy, relevant, and significant bits of information related to the topics they encompass. If not, we'd have a 10,000-page article called <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Yosemite_area_c3b9.html" title="History of the Yosemite area">History of the Yosemite area</a> instead of a 16-page one. The minor details are <i>always</i> assumed to be excluded from <i>any</i> page; this one is in absolutely no way different.</li>
<li>"There is no coherent connection between entries on this list." - Sure there is. "Songs that have been considered among the worst ever by noteworthy sources". You'll have a hard time getting more coherent than that.</li>
<li>"It makes no more sense than List of songs that have been widely enjoyed" - It makes more sense because there are hundreds of ways to try to determine people's favorite songs; album sales, polls, etc. And we already host numerous ones of those on Wikipedia. This is the only page which attempts to address in a general way the <i>opposite</i>: songs that are very widely (or very noteworthy for being) disliked, according to the numerous attempts that have been made to study this. It's an interesting article on a nice subject that has a lot of potential. That's good enough for me. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I did not use the word POV. I did use subjective and bollocks, which is what I think about the article. The songs may be cited from lists that various people/magazine readerships/pundits/hacks have devised. Those lists are inherently subjective and yes POV now that you mention it. I am not in the business of wasting "<i>people's past and future efforts</i>". I was voting.

<li>Fair enough. I certainly wouldn't be so quick to judge that this article won't be deleted, though. It's only been one day and the delete votes are increasing rapidly. Out of 29 votes, there are currently 11 Delete (including 2 Strong Delete) and 18 Keep (including 4 Weak Keep and 1 Strong Keep), making the percentage for keeping the article currently only 62%. Could change easily. Anyway, I apologize for putting any words into your mouth which you didn't intend; I didn't mean to. And I'm glad you're willing to help improve the article even though you don't think it should exist—excellent attitude for Wikipedia in general. Though I still must disagree with you entirely—reproducing POVed lists on Wikipedia is <i>completely in keeping with NPOV policy</i>, which only states that we can't put <i>our</i> POV on Wikipedia; every noteworthy source's POV is absolutely fair game. That's how we can write any article <i>at all</i>: by representing all noteworthy POVs, not trying to pick and choose which ones are more or less "subjective" than others. If it's an external, significant POV, than we can mention it, no matter how distorted its views are. And if there are significant rebuttals, of course, we should include those too! -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 10:41, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>All lists on Wikipedia are automatically assumed to only have the most noteworthy examples of possible things that could be listed on them. That's why we don't have "famous" or "noteworthy" or "widely" in every single list on Wikipedia: it's pointless. Just think about it. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_believed_to_have_epilepsy.html" title="List of people believed to have epilepsy">List of people believed to have epilepsy</a>, List of Europeans, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Eagle_Scouts_9cb4.html" title="List of Eagle Scouts">List of Eagle Scouts</a>, List of people who were cremated, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_disappeared.html" title="List of people who have disappeared">List of people who have disappeared</a>, List of virgins, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_World_War_I_veterans_8f91.html" title="List of World War I veterans">List of World War I veterans</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaf_people.html" title="List of deaf people">List of deaf people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sculptors.html" title="List of sculptors">List of sculptors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_suicides.html" title="List of suicides">List of suicides</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Cubans_2ee3.html" title="List of Cubans">List of Cubans</a>, and hundreds more—think about it. These lists aren't <i>meant</i> to have <i>every</i> item imaginable, just the most <i>noteworthy</i> one: it's assumed that a "list of Muslims" or similar will only cover especially noteworthy Muslims (i.e. ones who would have their own Wikipedia article, generally), not every Muslim in the world! That's just much more efficient than having "famous" in every article on Wikipedia. In the same way as <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_speculated_to_have_been_autistic.html" title="People speculated to have been autistic">People speculated to have been autistic</a> only deals with <i>noteworthy</i> speculation, "List of songs that have been considered among the worst ever", for obvious reasons, and quite clearly to anyone looking at the page, deals exclusively with major, widely-publicized polls and other noteworthy sources for various people's opinions on the subject. It's not meant to be an objective list of the worst songs in the world, which is <i>why</i> it's called "list of songs that have been <i>considered</i> among the worst ever", not "list of the worst songs ever". "Considered" assumes "considered by a noteworthy amount of people" and possibly "considered by especially noteworthy individuals" (like perhaps if Bob Dylan consistently labeled a certain song as the "worst ever"; though that might not be within the scope of this page). Arguing that an article should be deleted because a <i>literal</i> interpretation of its title would make it unmaintainable, even though it's actual <i>topic</i>, dealing, as it does, with only the most noteworthy and well-known "songs that have been considered among the worst ever", is quite maintainable indeed, is arguing for the deletion of tens of thousands of Wikipedia articles. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Effectively, this vote is a vote on whether or not to delete the <i>entire</i> series of "X that have been considered the worst ever", since there's absolutely no significant difference I can see between a list of movies that significant sources have called "the worst" and a list of songs that significant sources have called "the worst".

<li>I think this article already does a pretty good job of policing its entries and making sure they all have sources. I agree that a separate list of "removed songs" could be interesting, to avoid having people re-add songs that have already been rejected and to keep tabs on them. Not vital, though, and could be more of a hassle than simple removing anything that isn't properly sourced and explained. I did link to some of the above pages to help people get suggestions for various ways to improve this article, though; some images would help spice it up, and it might not be a bad idea to broaden the perspective to include other determiners for being considered "worst song" (like if an especially noteworthy critic, musician, celebrity, organization, etc. called it the "worst song", not just various polls and such). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 11:57, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>* <b>Comment.</b> Unfortunately not very true. The article claims to be a list of songs that have:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>achieved a notable level of infamy, through critical and popular consensus... based on specific mentions by music critics, producers, promoters, or other industry-related individuals or groups who have presented their informed opinions</i>.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sources viewed as noteworthy and major (to quote Silence) include www.Bestandworse.com [<a href="http://www.Bestandworse.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.Bestandworse.com" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>], a site with an alexa of 106,000 that features voting on topics like <i><b>How would Jesus Drive</b>?</i> or <i><b>Least likely place to find a Nun</b>?</i>; unsourced citations from local DJs; non-industry humorists Dave Barry and Mad Magazine; humor site www.popculturemadness.com (Alexa 96,000), which doesn't explain how it came up with its list except to say that it was voted on by visitors [<a href="http://www.popculturemadness.com/Music/WORST.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.popculturemadness.com/Music/WORST.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>]; so-called BBC online polls, that had a very low sampling and were apparently not conducted either by or for the BBC. More reputable sources include VH1 (but no link is provided and I haven't found the polls online), maybe WFMU (a small local radio station) and Blender magazine, for which wiki already has an article that could be expanded-Blender Magazine's 50 Worst Songs Ever!. Now maybe I've left off a few valid sources, but I fail to see the <i>notable level of infamy</i> or the <i>critical and popular consensus</i>. I do see a list drawn from a seemingly random selection of ad hoc sources, largely geared to humor, without any real criteria in terms of polling validity, industry knowledge, or <i>informed opinions</i>. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 06:08, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is both incorrect and a duplicate. It is not a chip, it's a microprocessor. "chip" is slang for microprocessor. Additionally, this article is talking about the <a href="../../../u/l/t/UltraSPARC_T1_c53f.html" title="UltraSPARC T1">UltraSPARC T1</a> processor, which has its own article. The original author linked this page from <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niagara.html" title="Niagara">Niagara</a>, a disambig page, and ignored the already created <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niagara_Processor_7e64.html" title="Niagara Processor">Niagara Processor</a> link, which is now a redirect to <a href="../../../u/l/t/UltraSPARC_T1_c53f.html" title="UltraSPARC T1">UltraSPARC T1</a>. The only contributor is anonymous. In summany, this page is misleading and a duplicate, and does not serve to enhance wikipedia. — <a href="../../../f/u/d/User%7EFudoreaper_d99d.html" title="User:Fudoreaper">Fudoreaper</a> 22:28, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrong. You yourself said immediately above that the article should be rewritten. There's no point in rewriting an article here and then transwikifying it. If the article needs to be written afresh, as you state, then anything that is to be written <i>should be written in the dictionary directly</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:54, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Rewrite then move, copy and paste the content, new (similar) content to wikitionary, what does it matter so long as the relavent content moves to the proper place? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstaroth5_5f99.html" title="User:Astaroth5">Astaroth5</a> 10:38, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It matters in that it is sheer laziness and a knowing and deliberate imposition on the editors who transwikify articles. If the article needs rewriting, then the right thing to do is to write the content <i>in the actual place that one wants the content to end up</i>, not to write it somewhere else entirely and then ask other editors to perform the complex process of copying what one has written to the place that one desires it to be. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:59, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <i>vote pending further review (see below)</i> Despite claims that they're important in the political scene (on the talk page) in Canada, I find no actual media coverage to that effect. If they're as important as the New York Times (again a claim from the talk page) you'd think there'd be at least ONE reference to them on Google News... but alas, nothing. Doesn't really seem to be many comments at all to blog entries, suggesting not a large community. Low Alexa rank.

<li>Should Alexa rankings even be applied to websites outside the United States? It seems that the criteria for Alexa "notability" is based on the U.S. experience.

<li>This is largely a discussion for elsewhere... but I don't think Alexa is just U.S. thing. Maybe an english-speaking thing, but I think it's a pretty valid barometer of the popularity of english-language sites. At any rate the site being in Canada doesn't account for it having a rank 50 times lower than the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline. But traffic is just one part of the decision here... I was just a bit bothered that it's unreliability was the <i>only</i> reason you cited for keeping. The lack of any real verification of this blog's importance is much more at issue, I think. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 06:11, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Alexa is a self-selected sample, suffering from <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selection_bias.html" title="Selection bias">selection bias</a> and the results are highly suspicious to someone with my statistical training.

<li>The bottom line is that it's a valid ballpark estimate of traffic... not accurate enough for most statistical purposes, but enough to estimate popularity. Even Slashdot, the poster site for the anti-IE/Anti-spyware mentality, gets a high rank and has double digits of IE/Windows-using readers.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a no-brainer in the Canadian media; this site is used as part of any good barometer of Canadian public opinion. Deleting this article would be a mistake, and I think significantly demonstrates an offhand US systemic bias on Wikipedia. It *is* tantamount to saying that Canadian political debate (which naturally contains a lot of debate about US policy, for reasons any Canadian would see as obvious) is irrelevant. As a Canadian, I'm inclined to object to that. References to PB or 'Canadian Blogosphere' as 'non-notable' here seem to be offhand and poorly informed. I don't hesitate to say that an American isn't going to be naturally inclined to make an informed choice about this. There are, after all, only 30 million Canadians. . . for US perspective, that's NYC and surrounding areas, and we're a pretty politically splintered group. That said, the Alexa rankings make perfect sense, and actually don't justify deletion based on overall popularity. Overall popularity among whom? Americans interested in Canadian political scandals? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.48.129.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.48.129.117_fb2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.48.129.117">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Anybody who seriously wants to base a deletion argument on Alexa ranking alone needs to ponder these numbers very carefully. Every one of these is a legitimately notable and important Canadian media outlet or blogger whose actual importance within Canada is completely unreflected by its Alexa rank:</li>

<li>And hey, let's save the funniest for last, shall we? <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Mercer_cac4.html" title="Rick Mercer">Rick Mercer</a>'s blog gets an Alexa ranking of 3,439,915. <b>RICK MERCER</b>, one of the most influential Canadian media personalities in <i>existence</i>, only ranks in the <b>3,000,000</b> range? <b>Excuse me</b>?<br />
Any metric which ranks all websites on a single scale is <i>inherently</i> going to favour American website traffic to the expense of other countries, and can quite easily misrepresent the actual importance of a non-American site to its <i>own</i> national context. Alexa is simply <b>not</b> a reliable gauge of a Canadian website's importance within Canada -- it's a reliable gauge of how many <i>Americans</i> visit a Canadian website. If a site as undeniably important as <i>Rabble</i> can't even meet the stated guidelines, then there's something seriously wrong with the guidelines. Every Canadian voter in this debate has clearly stated that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> are notable enough. If our <b>actual experience</b> doesn't overrule the obviously flawed metric of a website whose statistical method isn't even regarded as valid by professional statisticians, then why don't we just let Alexa ranking stand as a speedy criterion and save everybody the trouble of thinking their opinion actually mattered or something? <b>Notable enough within Canada to keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:30, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just because something is supposedly notable in Canada and not in the rest of the world doesn't mean it deserves it's own article. Should a country of similar importance, say.. Christmas Csland had a blog group be notable because everyone on christmas island reads it.. of course not. Also, because blogs are webcentric, Alexa is a good metric for their notability. Of course using Alexa as a metric for Time Magazine doesn't make any sense. <a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkrewler_3446.html" title="User:Skrewler">Skrewler</a> 09:06, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Christmas Island is hardly a country "of similar importance" to Canada. And Alexa is only a good metric of how many <i>Americans</i> read a website.

<li>There are no certain measurements at hand, of course, but the evidence listed above by others is circumstantial but, in the situation, persuasive.

<ul>
<li>Lacking evidence? The evidence already presented in the article is fairly substantial; if you can't see it, Simon.Pole summarized some of it above. Do you seriously find anybody else's argument-by-Alexa-rank <i>persuasive</i> in light of the fact that a blog as widely read and talked about as <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Mercer_cac4.html" title="Rick Mercer">Rick Mercer</a>'s doesn't even manage to rank in the top <b>3,000,000</b> according to Alexa? Or were you just <i>asleep</i> during the whole <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurmant_Grewal_ed13.html" title="Gurmant Grewal">Gurmant Grewal</a> thing? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:05, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've read the article, and the "evidence" does not impress me. And as for Mr. Mercer's blog doing so poorly...guess what? As a blogger, Rick Mercer is not notable. As an actor, he is. Just because a famous person's blog isn't notable doesn't mean that all traffic rankings are crap. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:16, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Not impressing you" is not generally my bottom-line metric of notability. Its role in the Grewal affair spells notability whether that personally interests you or not. Citations by Antonia Zerbisias spell notability whether that personally interests you or not. And I'm most certainly not conflating Mercer's significance as an actor with his significance as a blogger; his <b>blog</b>, specifically, is one of <b>the most-talked-about Canadian blogs on the web</b>. Unless you're proposing that it's somehow possible for people to talk about Rick Mercer's blog as much as they do without anybody ever actually reading it, the dichotomy just doesn't do Alexa any favours. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:30, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, if my reasons for deletion don't impress you, then that's too bad, one fewer 'delete' vote on this AfD. But I stand by them, and we'll just have to agree to disagree, I suppose.

<ul>
<li>I'd be more impressed if you were actually attempting to address and/or refute the stated facts — how does PB's role in the Grewal affair not equal notability? how do regular citations by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonia_Zerbisias_3567.html" title="Antonia Zerbisias">Antonia Zerbisias</a> not equal notability? how does citation in the Parliamentary debate record by <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Cools_bff6.html" title="Anne Cools">Anne Cools</a> not equal notability? etc. — instead of relying on the "because I said so" school of assertion. But whatever floats your boat, I suppose. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(So much for me agreeing to disagree!) Anyway, regarding citations: <i>in my opinion</i> notable people citing you does not automatically confer notability onto you. Said citations are not mentioned on the Wikipedia article on Progressive Bloggers, incidentally. And their role in the Grewal thing seems, to me, almost trivial. As in, the only mention of Grewal in their article is in the 'trivia' section. Actually investigating what role they seem to have played bears this out...ooh, look out, one of them made what amounted to a diff. Notability is a subjective issue, we all know that. And I do not think these guys meet it. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 19:02, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Both Blogging Torries and Progressive Bloggers enable Canadian web users to access blogging communities of like minded individual. These communities enable anyone to engage in a common forum across Canada where ideas and politics can be shared and critiqued. Without these blogs, Canadians from the grassroots to the top would not have a central online source to measure what other like minded individuals think on topics important to them.

<li>Yeah this really is getting needlessly nasty. While I think the site is probably notable at this point, the attitudes and actions of the people supporting it (who all appear to be connected to the site) really don't make me want to vote to keep. Trolling for votes, acting like it's some big conspiracy against Canada, labeling critics as "The Vile Syndicate" in various places... that's not going to endear many people to your blog. I guess some don't care though. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 19:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah, I really don't care what you Americans think. Trying to impress upon you what is notable in the other countries of the world is up there with taking out the garbage in my book.

<li>The nastiness is being perpetrated by this "Lord Bob" guy, a self-admitted supporter of the Canadian Conservative Party, who has crawled out of the woodwork in the midst of election fever in Canada, and is doing his party-hack thing right here. Nothing from "Lord Bob" about the notability of the Blogging Tories entry. This kind of thing is another reason to fear the election of Stephen Harper: rabid intolerance, intellectual dishonesty and a love of censorship. Don't take my word for it: read "Lord Bob."John Baglow 15:11, 15 November 2005 (DST)

<li>John and Simon, would you both please tone down the rhetoric and keep this discussion on topic? This isn't about bombing or war, and it's not a nefarious Tory plot to sideline progressive discussion. It's just a debate about whether or not the article is notable enough on its own merits; the argument is easily made without resorting to ad hominem attacks. And while it <i>is</i> true that a single contextless Alexa-rank cutoff can distort the notability of a non-American site, it's <i>not</i> a conscious and intentional plot to institute American bias; it's just an accidental side effect of a policy that wasn't designed carefully enough. <b>So would you guys cut out the conspiracy theories and stay on topic, please?</b> <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 21:50, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>There's no war on Wikipedia being waged by Progressive Bloggers. There <i>is</i> a war on Wikipedia being waged by a bunch of deletionist trolls called GNAA, which isn't the same thing. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 17:39, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Next time I'll use &lt;/sarcasm&gt; to make sure that you understand. It's usually the sign of a weak argument to attack the person rather than simply presenting a compelling reason that they are wrong. Anyone who wants to keep this based upon a "campaign" instead of the evidence should have their recomendation completely discounted, as they are not adressing the issue of <i>this article</i>. I don't care if the GNAA are sodomizing nuns in the name of Cthullu, they have their facts correct - this is a non notable blog zealously defended. The fact that we aren't having a calm and measured discussion about <i>facts</i> speaks volumes, but that instead the arguments seem to be "because canadians say so". Both this and the previous AfD are examples of special interest groups shouting down common sense. Be proud, be very proud.<br />

<li>I think you should go back and read the comments in chronology. It was the GNAA who introduced the irrationality into these discussions by calling arguments "bullshit" and wikipedia entries "retarded."--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 01:02, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, the first really irrational entry I see is - <i>Yeah, I really don't care what you Americans think. Trying to impress upon you what is notable in the other countries of the world is up there with taking out the garbage in my book. You can bomb the shit out of other countries, and destroy what they've made -- but that doesn't mean you have to bring that attitude on Wikipedia.--Simon.Pole 20:40, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</i><br />
And you still have failed to adress the basic issues of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 01:34, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, there's nothing irrational about that statement. American bombing is a fact, producing many dead facts. Furthermore, when I am accused of seeing "conspiracies against Canada" (the statement this quote responds to) when Wikipedia has clearly identified a systemic bias against non-American entries, I am not the one being irrational. I did not mince words about how unsavoury it is to have to respond to foreigners saying Canadian entries are not notable. Only from an American point of view would this be seen as "irrational." Just as the view that Iraqis might not want Americans occupying their country is "irrational."--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 02:08, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The idea of this person being non-notable is a paradox, since the article proclaims his supposed "notoriety". However, a quick way to assess this article's falseness is by the mention of a "South Park Hospital". This is clearly a joke, and such a hospital does not nor ever did exist in Johannesburg, South Africa.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think a <i>delete</i> outcome is appropriate for this article: the topic is notable as Carl Hewitt has amply documented, and as I am aware of from colleagues who are working in AI. There are problems with leaving the article as it stands, as CH is using the article to push his ideas in an inappropriate manner. I'll make an alternative suggestion that instead the article is merged into a broader article, where the SCM ideas are seen side-by-side with rival theories and a more balanced picture of the history emerges. The currently stub-like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_agent.html" title="Intelligent agent">Intelligent agent</a> article might be a better home. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 15:13, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The topic has notability, agreed. Nevertheless, the position and importance of this idea in the network of sociological and philosophical concepts is still unclear. Carl Hewitt who appears to be one of the proponents this idea and the article, has extensively linked this article to other articles, (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Scientific_Community_Metaphor" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Scientific_Community_Metaphor" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>) thus possibly establishing for it a position in the network that it might not have had otherwise. This is damaging to WP. More seriously, I also regret that I need to mention the following: This action makes Hewitt suscepible to the charge that he is not acting in good faith, trying to use WP to distort the importance of his work. This is aggravated by similar behaviour in other places: see for instance <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denotational_semantics.html" title="Denotational semantics">Denotational semantics</a>, which in my view should be rewritten from scratch, with only relatively minor mention of the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a>. I would urge Hewitt to stop this activity which is widely seen as pushing his own agenda. He can usefully contribute with his knowledge and experience to WP, but does not need to mention the actor model and other work of his at every turn.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 19:15, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: This article is really an advertisment of Carl Hewitt's work, with its proper title being "Carl Hewitt's personal scietific community metaphor". It starts out OK, but quickly degenerates into a combination of discussion of this Ether thing and references to Carl Hewitt's other work. When he makes references to physics, I find this article to be erroneous. The comments of <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> and <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> above also demonstate the inappropriateness of this article. Even if the subject of this article is notable, it should be documented by someone who can do so in an impartial manner and focussed on the concept itself. Until then, Wikipedia is better off without an article on this "scientific community metaphor" than with keeping the current article. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I hope that most abstracts of scientific papers have some sort of encyplopedic value.

A second point, the article start with <i>The Scientific Community Metaphor is an approach to understanding scientific communities by extending pattern directed invocation programming languages that invoke high level procedural plans on the basis of messages...</i>. Shouldn't that be the other way around? E.g. patern directed invocation programming languages modelled according to scientific communities?

<dd>Historically, it was the other way around. The pattern-directed invocation programming languages came first and the Scientific Community Metaphor was developed afterwards. However, you are correct that at this point the pattern-directed invocation languages should be developed according to the Scientific Community Metaphor which is in fact the way that research is currently proceeding.

<ul>
<li>I don't fully agree that the only problem is the role this article plays in WP. The fact of the matter is that for or better or worse, concepts and links of concepts created within WP have a tendency to diffuse outward; this tendency is in fact one of the <i>best arguments against wikipedia</i> . For example, the relations between Latour and SCM or Popper and SCM I believe are tenuous. I don't dispute that associations have <s>not</s> been made, but does this really justify the following statement in the 4th or 5th graf of the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Latour_3467.html" title="Bruno Latour">Bruno Latour</a> article?:</li>

However, the only reason that I am not recusing myself is beacuse I know enough about software, relativity, and proper article flow to identify this article as the poor excuse of an article that it is.

<li><b>Recuse</b> per DV8 2XL above. I have already had too many unpleasant interactions with Carl Hewitt and am not interested in engaging in yet more. I agree with almost every statement made above that wasn't made by Carl: the topic is probably sufficiently notable for some mention, somewhere; this article almost certainly needs editing and revision; it will be impossible to revise due to endless edits wars and lack of civility from Carl. There is a broader problem here: Carl is repeatedly engaging in behaviour that violates the spirit if not the letter of Wikipedia policy, and he seems immune to criticism and unable to reform. I am at a loss for what to do in such a situation. Its easy enough to vote <b>delete</b> but that hardly seems fair, and I certainly don't have the energy to do more than to ask Carl to, once again, take the criticism of others to heart and try to react to that criticism in a positive, constructive fashion. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 02:45, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I personally think that the content is as important as the topic in a case like this. So if you want to moot this action, then please do the rewrite. [I can't. Although I am a sotware engineer by trade, I have not dealt with this side of computer science. Instead I do much better in areas involving physics (in which I majored), especially relativity (in which I do independent research). So I know enough to see this article as written as invalid, but not enough to fix it.] To me, this is about the article, and it's being <i>as written</i> a significant part of Carl Hewitt's egregious self-promotion campaign.

<li><b>Reply:</b> Compiling bios on Baltimore-based blues singers, past and present, including Vance, Ethel Ennis, Paul Harrison, etc. As for this being my sole edit, one has to start somewhere, but since skepticism seems to reign supreme, I get the impression that posting any info on regional musicians is an exercise in futility. Wonder if there might be some bias against Baltimore blues, since other genres seem to be represented by what might be deemed lesser known musicians in other regions. Not taking any of your comments personally, mind you. Just trying to gauge the content of the rest of the site, yet be bold at the same time. Just a thought: Rather than treat a newcomer with skepticim, perhaps a word of welcome might be encouraging.</li>

<li>I think you might be overly sensitive here. If you scan the AfD archives you will see a lot of band vanities. Yes, everyone must start somewhere - and if you are a local expert on this music scene you could be very valuable in helping to separate the vanity articles from the genuinely significant.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The differences are: (1) <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Luc_Picard_499e.html" title="Jean-Luc Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a> is a fictional character from a long-running television series and several major movies, who was seen by millions of people, while Star and stripe are fictional characters from a web comic that apparently just started this month. (2) The article <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Luc_Picard_499e.html" title="Jean-Luc Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a> clearly identifies the character as fictional in the first sentence, while Star and stripe portrays the fictional events in the comic strip as factual information albeit of the kind nobody would take literally. (Problem #2 can be fixed easily, but problem #1 can't. See <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for proposed criteria that would determine whether the comic Star and Stripe would be notable enough for a Wikipedia article.) --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:11, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page should be deleted because it is an unnecessary disambiguation page. It is general practice with articles on tropical cyclones that if there are two storms in a basin with the same name, and one has an article, a link at the top of the article pointing at the season for the storm without an article is added. The precedents of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Juan_acba.html" title="Hurricane Juan">Juan</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Klaus_9324.html" title="Hurricane Klaus">Klaus</a> do just that. I have made that very change to the <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhoon_Longwang_8c48.html" title="Typhoon Longwang">Typhoon Longwang</a> article. In addition, if the name Longwang is not retired, it will very likely be several years before there is another one. For both of these reasons, this article is unnecessary. <b>Nominate</b> and vote for <b>Deletion</b> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichelle_T_0f20.html" title="User:Michelle T">Miss Michelle</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichelle_T_bee5.html" title="User talk:Michelle T">Talk to Michelle</a> 22:02, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was initially suspicious about the likely accuracy of searching in English for a Japanese author who writes in Japanese, particularly given that the romanisation issues mean that the guy's name could also be spelt "Yuuji", "Yuuzi", "Yuzi", or half a dozen other ways, but it turns out that Japanese searches actually produce <i>fewer</i> hits (about 100, though they all seem to be about the right person). He has released a number of translations of authors like O.

<p>I have just reviewed the article in question having come across the deletion notice while searching for the artist. I am familiar with his works and while the other gentleman is not, this does not seem to me to be a reason to delete. This artist may not be as notable as Miro or Picasso, but is important for a new generation. A simple internet search using the main engines yields enough information and comments by others who see the importance of the artist.</p>
