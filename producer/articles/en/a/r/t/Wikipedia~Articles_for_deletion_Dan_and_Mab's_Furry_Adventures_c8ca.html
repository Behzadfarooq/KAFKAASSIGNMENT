<p>The result was delete. On contributions from *cough* very new members of the community, they were all suprisingly coherent and some even centered on wikipedia policies or guidelines. Refreshing. However, this debate was still only loosely structured, and the main argument appears to be regarding the strip's satisif-ication of the web material guideline. This hinges on the <b>Web Cartoonist's Choice</b> awards, and the consensus (as demostrated here) amoung the more established editors is that it does not count as a a notable independent award. This is quite arbitrary, and I've raised a section on the talk page of the guideline regarding this: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28web%29_b1bd.html#Web_Cartoonist.27s_Choice_award" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)#Web Cartoonist's Choice award</a><br />

<li><b>Keep</b>, as it has achieved notability for having won the Web Cartoonists Choice awards, a standard which has been used in previous AFDs. Also, having been written continuously for six years (longer than many print comics), its longevity should be considered, even if it isn't officially part of the guidelines. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.243.116.222_23f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.243.116.222">216.243.116.222</a> (talk) 11:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per above. It's a shame that many of the webcomics can't be featured on Wikipedia because of the current Web notability. My opinion is that if a webcomic has lasted more than a year, it can have an article. More than 5 years, it should have an article.

<li><b>Delete</b>, doesn't meet our notability or verifiablity standards. With no decent references, the article is all original research and personal point of view. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b>, Well, "wikipedia's" requirements of "notability" basically exclude any and all web references including reviews and notables such as an Awards nomination, etc... a bit elitist... but slightly understandable because of the intent of which Wikipedia opperates... Sadly it's highly restrictive. In any case, I think Wikifur does not have this rigidness of "notability". Is there a Wiki for Webcomics (not comixpedia)? If not, there should be, without this "notability" rigidness... there needs to be a version of Wiki the is more inclusive of various Internet popularity. --<a href="../../../f/e/s/User%7EFesworks_ea8e.html" title="User:Fesworks">Fesworks</a> 05:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comixpedia sounds perfect for this type of article. Comixpedia has an article on this comic <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> that was originally based on this Wikipedia article. You could proabably merge this article into Comixpedia's. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:12, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comixpedia doesn't use Wiki technology, it's HTML I believe. Also I agree comepletely that "Notability is not the same as verifiability." which does seem to be the case with Wikipedia... It seems Wikipedia just wants to be an limited encyclopedia, excluding whatever doesn't seem to be in print or a favorite of the higher Wiki Editors. It seems very selective. Not just talking about this article, but numerous others. Some articles chosen for deletion make my head spin for the "lack of notability", even though a few simple click will prove you wrong because there it is, readily available on the net. Perhaps I'll print out a version and mail it in to you guys. But whatever. There are other reference sites less anal that I choose to use instead now. --<a href="../../../f/e/s/User%7EFesworks_ea8e.html" title="User:Fesworks">Fesworks</a> 21:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>

<li>Comixpedia seemed wiki enough. Might not be a complete and usable wiki… <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadd_the_sane_dbfd.html" title="User:Madd the sane">Madd the sane</a> 03:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notability is not the same as verifiability. The two concepts are often confused as indicated [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments#Arguments_against_deleting_articles_for_non-notability|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments#Arguments_against_deleting_articles_for_non-notability|here" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] and [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Uncle_G/On_notability#The_primary_notability_criterion|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Uncle_G/On_notability#The_primary_notability_criterion|here" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]. Reading between the lines, Francis Tyers sounds like he's arguing based upon the fame/lack of fame of the comic in question - but this is not a wikipedia criteria. Though it may be a technicality, a large amount of material exists in the site's forum, which though hosted locally was produced by multiple sources that are independent of the site itself. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and DMFA is obviously not <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>. I see no reason for deletion. ANTIcarrot 07:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For clarity's sake, the forum is not hosted on the same server as the comic. In fact, neither was the old forum, nor the backup copy thereof kept for reference purposes. And all three were managed by independant people - although I'll admit the new forum is run by the author's relative. (since I host the backup, I must admit a touch of bias, and hence abstain from voting.) -- Llearch 15:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Notability rules and their application have been questioned often enough, and it's clear that they're hostile to webbased publications. Slapping well-known webcomics with semantics is a disgrace, and I don't believe that this is the aim of Wikipedia. DMFA has been nominated for an award and reviewed online multiple times. The comic is notable enough to be able to generate a healthy amount of monthly donations and has a dedicated forum with 450+ members. It's definitely notable enough for this single entry, and removing it would do more damage than good. --Sid 3050 20:56, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
