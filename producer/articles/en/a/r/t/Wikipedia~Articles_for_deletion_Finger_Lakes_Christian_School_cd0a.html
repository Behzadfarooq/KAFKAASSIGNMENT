<p>The result was <b>Deleted</b>, the boundary of notability on schools <i>has</i> to be drawn somewhere. The claim that "all schools are notable" is simply absurd, and anyone basing their reasoning on a falsehood like that is likely to be discounted. What we're dealing with here is a small, small school that is part of a church that itself isn't notable enough to have an article. Remember, AFD is <i>not a vote</i>; judgement can and must be exercised. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 02:01, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Since your essay fails miserably in its attempts to rebutt Silensor, saying it rebutts it is very poor english. A reader might get confused, and think your essay has any merit whatsoever (when it obviously does not). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>a) That is a matter of opinion of whether or not it rebuts his essay well (and I note that at least one school inclusionist seems to have had somewhat positive remarks about my essay so). b) You seem to confuse the meanings of many words related to logic. In this case you are confused about the difference between logic and grammar. To use the canonical example "Green dreams sleep furiously" is a grammatically valid nonsensical sentence. It might make sense not to make grammatical critiques when you don't understand what grammar is. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And furthermore, I have already asked you to explain what issues you have with my essay. So far you have not mentioned a single one. If you have any substantive issues please explain them. I'm far more interested in an actual dialogue on this matter than simple claims that the essay fails in some way. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:36, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I can see how this is at the margins of existing school notability precedent, but I don't want to start deleting things randomly unless there's a significant persuasive argument that uniform inclusionism for high schools is bad. This is clearly a small school, with 75 students in 12 grades, but it's more than a few people home schooling together or some such. I'm sure there are equally small schools in government run school districts around. Keep it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This school seems almost designed to illustrate the absurdity of inclusionism in regard to schools. If we had an article about the church that the school was a part of and included all the info in the article the article would be deleted as a non-notable church. Somehow we have an article about the school (which contains less information and is about only the school) and yet that should be kept? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:11, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As already observed, notability has already been brought up as a criterion. Please stop ingoring actual issues and actually discuss the matters at hand. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:38, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Notability has already been established. Arguments based upon false premises are no arguments at all. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:40, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe I took too many logic courses when I was younger but an argument is an argument regardless of whether it has valid premises. As to your claim that notability has been established, how has it been established, what facts in the article or in this talk page establish notability? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:44, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe you did - encyclopaedias adopt an epistemology based upon empiricism, not logic. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:48, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that might be relevant if this were an article page. But it isn't this is Wikispace so using words as they are generally used is a good thing. And I note that you ignored my second question: how has notability been established and what facts in the article or in this talk page establish notability? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:52, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alright, then no relevent argument has been presented - I wouldn't have expected that needed to be made clear given the context. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm confused then. Are you saying there has or has not been anything that establishes notability? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Hey, here's an idea, since "all schools are notable", then let's expand our thinking to "all teachers are notable" (after all what's a school without its teachers), and of course, "all teacher's aides are notable" (hey someone's gotta help out), oh and principals and other administrative personnel too -- just think: tens, if not hundreds of thousands of new useless articles to write.
