<li><b>Keep</b>, but <b>re-write</b>. Sukhomlinsky was a very notable educator, one of the minds behind theory and practice of Soviet humanistic pedagogics. The article in its present form doesn't do any justice to this person.

<dd>Did you get a chance to review the materials I added before voting? Sukhomlinsky was awarded a high-profile Soviet title and wrote a book which was awarded a State Prize.

<li><b>Comment</b> (this began as a <i>weak keep</i>, but I'm now sufficiently perplexed as to be unable to draw a conclusive conclusion) I've long argued that, where a subject is notable but where there is little salvagable encyclopedic content in the article apropos of him/her/them/it, stubbification or deletion (with, concomitantly, a listing on <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>) is in order, but there appears here to be sufficient content, especially in view of Ëzhiki's additions, that the concerns as to the bizarre, essayistic quality of the article ought to be allayed; there remains, to be sure, <b>much</b> culling to be done, there is a not insignificant amount of text that might be kept or substantially reworked. As to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, whilst I'm not at all certain that one's receiving a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero_of_Socialist_Labor_097e.html" title="Hero of Socialist Labor">Hero of Socialist Labor</a> or the State Prize of the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_SSR_3da5.html" title="Ukrainian SSR">Ukrainian SSR</a> confers notability, I think it likelier than not that Sukhomlinsky is notable in view of his prominence as a pedagogic(al) philosopher, which prominence is evidenced, I suppose, by his having been the exclusive subject of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Each-One-Must-Shine-Sukhomlinsky/dp/0820439886/sr=1-1/qid=1160498166/ref=sr_1_1/002-9260599-5532833?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Each-One-Must-Shine-Sukhomlinsky/dp/0820439886/sr=1-1/qid=1160498166/ref=sr_1_1/002-9260599-5532833?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">one book</a> (and a referenced subject in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_seeall_2/002-9260599-5532833?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Sukhomlinsky&amp;rh=i%3Aaps-blender%2Ck%3ASukhomlinsky%2Ci%3Astripbooks" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_seeall_2/002-9260599-5532833?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Sukhomlinsky&amp;rh=i%3Aaps-blender%2Ck%3ASukhomlinsky%2Ci%3Astripbooks" rel="nofollow">fourteen more</a>, as may perhaps be sufficient per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a>) that is, AFAICT, the subject of at least one independent, non-trivial review (so as to suggest that the book, at least, is perhaps <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html#Criteria" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">notable</a>); whether as an author the subject is notable is a closer question. I was prepared to suggest that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> exist toward his notability, but I don't think the single book to suffice [notwithstanding its having been written by a professor at a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Queensland_95f7.html" title="University of Queensland">notable institution</a>; the professor seems wholly non-notable), especially insofar as (further complicating things), it appears from the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_Archive_6_22a9.html#Sukhomlinsky_article" title="Wikipedia:Help desk/Archive 6">August 2004 HD archives</a> that the much of the text for the article was contributed by the book's author), and I can't find much beyond <a href="http://www.sote.qld.edu.au/articles/Sukhomlinksy.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sote.qld.edu.au/articles/Sukhomlinksy.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> in a reliable if non-notable source and <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~nrc/teacherresources/civic/sukhomlinsky.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~nrc/teacherresources/civic/sukhomlinsky.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> given as a teaching resource by the Russian, Eastern European, and Central Asian Studies Department at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a>.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, but <b>re-write</b>. A known Soviet educator, recipient of numerous prestigious (even though Soviet) awards. He is mentioned in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Soviet_Encyclopedia_520c.html" title="Great Soviet Encyclopedia">Great Soviet Encyclopedia</a> and contemporary Russian encyclopedias. Indeed, the article looks like an essay, but it doesn't mean he is not notable. And guys, if you never heard of a person, it doesn't mean he is not notable. E.g., I saw a DYK article the other day called <i>Raising the flag over Iwo Jima</i> (sorry for possible mispelling), which CLAIMS that this is <i>the most recognizable image in the world</i>. I've never seen this image in my life until I visited the US. How's that for not notable?? <a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKNewman_9692.html" title="User:KNewman">KNewman</a> 17:17, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>, close the vote and get to work on the article. The person is certainly notable. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:05, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> per above. An award is an award. The fact that it was given in the Soviet Union does not make it less of an award today. As to notability, how many other educators have <span style="font-size: 0.95em; font-weight: bold; color:#555; position: relative;">(English)</span> <a href="http://www.bank.gov.ua/engl/Bank_coin/Yuv_mon/Coins/Vydatni_diachi/Sukhomlin.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bank.gov.ua/engl/Bank_coin/Yuv_mon/Coins/Vydatni_diachi/Sukhomlin.htm" rel="nofollow">a commemorative coin with their face on it?</a>. Vasyl Sukhomlynskyi is a keep.--<a href="../../../r/i/u/User%7ERiurik_844b.html" title="User:Riurik">Riurik</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/u/User_talk%7ERiurik_f270.html" title="User talk:Riurik">(discuss)</a></sup> 19:21, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Others have adduced much better sources than those I found, and they of course make plain that the subject is notable. I'd intended to ask an editor able to read Russian to weigh in, as I imagined that many more references were available solely in the Russian language, such that a simple Googling wouldn't be dispositive as to notability, but several editors seem already to have taken up that task, for which they are to be commended. As to the awards, btw, I didn't mean to suggest that the fact of their being conferred by the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR thereof ought to be understood to diminish their significance; rather, as I've expressed elsewhere, I look somewhat dimly on our considering as necessarily notable those who have received similar <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_decoration.html" title="State decoration">state decorations</a> (even those that are particularly exclusive, such as the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharat_Ratna_f097.html" title="Bharat Ratna">Bharat Ratna</a>), but I've come, in any case, to rethink that view. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:18, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
