<li><b>Delete</b>. Colleges are generally notable. High schools and middle schools are an open question. Primary schools and preschools, though, generally must demonstrate some seriously unique characteristics to be considered notable. This one doesn't - the only information I see in the article is demographics, the logo, and a reference to an OfSTED report describing the school as "above average", which doesn't strike me as unusual praise. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:33, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> with some regret, because the article itself is a decent article, but the school is non notable (per Zetawoof). There are are enormous numbers of primary schools. My wife teaches at the second largest one in the UK, but it has no article - deservedly so (not?), because its only claim to notability would be size. We seem to have to have the "It's a school keep it at any cost" lobby here. That lobby needs to get a grip on reality. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory or an indiscriminate load of general stuff.

<dd>But by saying "it meets proposed guidelines", you are effectively saying that the guidelines are fixed and settled - so how could a) you be hashing them out or b) I join in the discussion?

<li><b>Delete</b> Per Catchpole, Zetawoof and others. OFSTED does not constitute non-trivial coverage by a 3rd party (since all schools have it. It isn't any different than keeping a corporation because the corporation filed a tax-return) so it fails even the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:11, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What would you accept as non-trivial coverage? A couple of articles in the local newspaper... a picture/feature from the Times Educational Supplement...? Would that meet the arbitrary criterion <i>you</i> just set for notability? Yes. Would this fundamentally change the "notability" of the school? No. But then I'm sure you would find some other "reason" to justify the instinctive delete reaction. In addition to the other, stronger arguments, deleting school pages is likely to disillusion those (new) editors who contribute to them -- editors who may have been inclined to contribute badly needed brain power to substantive Wikipedia articles, rather than procedural squabbles and the laying down of un(der)defined rules. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.104.212.155 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.104.212.155_3ab2.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.104.212.155">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>If any editor is discouraged from creating articles which do not meet Wikipedia guidelines that is an excellent thing. A page on a school is no different from a page on any other topic. It must meet and demonstrate that it meets established guidelines. Please be aware that the phrasing in your message is highly personalised with italics and quotation marks. Such pointed messages have in the past been judged to cross the threshold of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">civility</a>. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:01, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I refer you to the previous comment: "...procedural squabbles and the laying down of un(der)defined rules." If such time and passion were put into writing good quality articles on core subjects, rather than debating school pages that are <i>at worst</i> harmless, Wikipedia would be a hell of a lot better, I'm sure we can agree. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.104.212.155 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.104.212.155_3ab2.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.104.212.155">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Please sign your entries using ~~~~, which translates automatically. Wikipedia improves because people create and edit good articles and because people nominate non compliant articles for deletion. Each of those is positive editing. This article, though well enough written, is about an entirely non notable primary school. Thus it is nominated for deletion. It is now subject to formal community review and a consensus will be reached. An article that is trivial is not harmless. By existing it causes the harm of dilution of articles that qualify to be here by pap. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a collection of indiscriminate information. If you want to change that there are other places to debate it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, an article <i>should</i> meet all WP guidelines for content. The way a wiki works is that people can come along and make improvements over time. When you're talking about deletion, you're proposing to curtail that process. The issue for AfD is not the content, but the justifiability of having an article on the given topic at all. In an encyclopedia where consensus has established the value of articles on individual video-game characters, single episodes of TV sitcoms, and various internet memes that have achieved note through a month or two of blogging, I find it difficult to imagine that an actual real verifiable school with decades of history would ever be considered to be below that threshold. WP is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> a paper encyclopedia and there is no question that articles on schools can meet every official policy. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 12:40, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
