<p><i>The Demons of Darkness clan is the oldest clan in gaming history! They were established in 1997 by Mathy, in the game Diablo II - Lord of Destruction. At that time, the clan started developing hacks for games. Now, they are still the largest hacking clan for all the games they play.</i></p>
<p>It all started in 1997, where Mathy developed his first application for his clan, that was at the time pretty small. They were only 3 members. Teri, Mathy and Daniel. The program he created was a simple chat bot that soon would ruin the mood for all the chatters of Diablo II - Lord of Destruction. It spamed in order to recruit people, and understanded most common commands.</p>
<p>Later on, they created their own channel for the bot to be in, and to be their own home chat channel. Of course, this was force bruted, and was illegally. The bot sended spoofed packets and were extremely violent against Blizzard Entertainment's security policy.</p>
<p>Just on 2 months, the clan had grewn to about 70 members! They made big raid instances, they stole the items they wanted from other players, though they knew it was illegal, and killed all the other clans that dared to meet them in a clan war. They were hackers, and had a great chance to win there.</p>
<p>In 2002, the clan had reached 279 members, split over 3 games. Unreal Tournament, Diablo II - Lord of Destruction, and Battlefield 1942. In all those games, hacks were developed, and servers were set up.</p>
<p>In 2005, the clan had to cut down on members, since Mathy could not hold the pressure of developing hacks to 3 games that were already highly protected by Punkbuster, and a lot other security ensurance programs. They chopped off the Diablo II - Lord of Destruction section, and added a World of Warcraft section instead!</p>
<p>Of course, the new section grew as well, but never became very large. Suddenly Mathy desided not to play the game anymore, due to the lag of graphics, and the section became unavailable once again.</p>
<p>2 sections were left, with only 78 members. 1 section (the Unreal Tournament section) was now removed as well, and they now focused completely on Battlefield 1942. A new version of the earlier bot was developed for Battlefield 1942 server, and were able to handle commands out of normal text, by using AI (Affliate Intelligence) technology. As an example, you could say:</p>
<p>"Mathy Bot please kick 'test1' and 'test2'. I do not like them."</p>
<p>The print that would then be responded by Mathy Bot would then be:</p>
<p>"Confirmed, Master. Kicking the players you have demanded. DoD member detected. Full kicking access granted. Kicking Test1. Kicking Test2. Done."</p>
<p>A lot of other commands were available with the bot, and it became the main source of recruiting, since it was the best technology that they had on the server, exept of the genious modifications they had already made to their maps.</p>
<p>Anyway, DoD was now down on 39 members, but grew to 49 in 2006, after a great server-uptime instead of the old 6 hour server. Mathy Bot is now running version 349, and is still being developed.</p>
<p>DoD has been splitted up in different armies, led by different generals in the clan, and a lot of groups has been created that developes hacks or finds ideas.</p>

<p>Decca Simpkin, He is a ex Bare Knuckle boxing champion. I think he's taking a backseat now, and chilling out. He's meantioned in a book written by Julian Davies, called Street Fighters. And he was also on the front cover of it.</p>

<p>The lineal heavyweight champion of the world in boxing is someone who has won all the major belts (WBC, IBF, WBA) and has never lost them in the ring. Alternatively if you beat the person who did this, whether or not they possess the titles you will become the linear champion. The concept of a 'linear champion' in boxing is that the politics are ignored. It is a term used by only hardcore fans, journalists and television pundits. It looks at the lineage of the championship rather that the actual awarding of belts by sanctioning bodies. The Ring magazine are known to award their own version of a world title belt to the linear champion. Sometimes they are also referred to as the undisputed champion, or the peoples champion. However the latter can also be used to refer to a boxer who has lost but remains popular.</p>

<p><i><b>Goodbye Time</b></i> was a piece from Southern Television's farewell programme <i><b>And It's Goodbye From Us</b></i> and it began at 12:42 AM on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>.</p>
<p><br />
Synopsis:</p>
<p><i>Goodbye Time</i> began with the announcer saying goodbye. It continues with the Southern Television employees standing rather solemnly while on-air music played with a camera angle. With the music playing,this was DOUBLE HARD.</p>
<p>Southern Televsion was sad. But they were smiling over the credits.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Eve_e542.html" title="New Year's Eve">New Year's Eve</a> is great!</p>
<p>With the music playing,it was really cool.</p>
<p>In the ending, the music got to a crescendo and the lights turned off,and the Southern Televiwsion Production slide was shown,then the Star logo began to spin to a galaxy of stars with it's on-air <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingle.html" title="Jingle">jingle</a> playing for the final time with a deep extended echo. And the screen slowly and silently faded to black. There were no closing announcements, no suggestions for viewers to switch off their TV sets,not even the customary of God Save the Queen. The transmitters were simply shutted down. It was a sad ending for Southern Television.</p>
<p>8 Hours and 45 Minutes later, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_South_34c1.html" title="Television South">Television South</a> began.</p>

<p>Wasting Revolution formed on Lebanon Valley College's campus in the spring of 2004 under the name One Term President. They came together initially to play a set of covers for the college's annual spring arts festival. At the time the band consisted of drummer Scott Broody, guitarists Andrew Gena and Jordan Miller, with Jason Bachman pulling double duty on bass and lead vocals. After a successful show they decided to make the band a more serious priority and added Dave McLaughlin as their bassist, allowing Bachman to devote his efforts exclusively to singing. Shortly before the 2004 presidential election, the guys began to carry out their song writing and live shows under the new name: Wasting Revolution. Early in 2005, Brendan McGeehan joined the group as a jack of all trades player adding his guitar, bass, keyboards, and arrangement and production talents wherever necessary.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2004 the guys started writing original material that culminated in the Don't Misunderestimate Us EP. Their songs demonstrate their diverse musical influences, including Muse, Radiohead, U2, mewithoutYou, Bjôrk, and Jeff Buckley, and their work displays a social consciousness inherent in the band. Wasting Revolution's live shows are an emotional mix of rock covers and originals, showing off its creative musical interpretation and songwriting, Bachman's expressive vocals, Miller's skillful lead guitar, and Broody's technically stunning drum technique.</p>
<p>WayRev finished their new EP, entitled "Baccalaureate," in the spring of 2005. This October and November, the band will be heading into the studio yet again armed with plenty of new material that will eventually culminate in a new EP.</p>

Sisyfos minigolfclub was created in August 2005 by three young artist from Oslo, namely Hans E. Thorsen, Espen Henningsen &amp; Lars Kjemphol. The clubs name draws on the well-known myth of Sisyphus who was condemned to roll a giant rock up a mountain for all of eternity. Therefore, Sisyfos minigolf is a very difficult sport. All sisyfos courses are built to be almost impossible. The players are supposed to maintain a hope of making it, but this is going to require a lot of time, or great amounts of luck. If one makes it at all the ball always comes back to start, ready for the player to start all over again.</p>
<p>Sisyfos minigolfclub is a open club, this means that anyone who wants can join the club,can contact the board, and get their t-shirt, membercard and build their own impossible minigolfcourses.</p>
<p>Theese minigolf courses are made to be hybrids of sport and art. At the one hand, they are sculptures that illustrates Sisyphus’s struggle in various forms. But at the same time, they are also fully functional minigolfcourses that allows partisipants to take part in the Sisyfos experience of endless hours of minigolf.</p>
<p>Sisyfos minigolfclub is mainly inspired by Albert Camus famous essay, "The myth of Sissyphus." In this essay Camus is arguing that life itself is absurd and without meaning. In extention of this, he claims that suicide should be something for eweryone to consider as a opertunety to living just based on habits. At the end of the book he gets to the Myth of Sisyphus. He compares the myth of Sisyphus to the life of a normal person. As Sisyphus we all wake up, go to work, go to bed, and wake up the next day starting all over again.</p>
<p>Sisyphuses whole world revolves around the work with his stone. His everlasting struggle to the top of the mountain, his hope of his tournament to end, and at last his dissapointment at the top, when his stone once again tipps over and rolls to the bottom of the mountain. But, Camus claims, at the last sentence: "Maybe the daily work, the constant struggle for the higts is enough to fill a mans heart. To give his life meaning"</p>

<p>Martha Brookes Hutcheson was a landscape architect in the early twentieth century as it was then considered a "natural" profession for women. Martha Hutcheson designed successful residential landscapes as a contemporary with Annette Hoyt Flanders, and Marjorie L. Sewell Cautley two other notable landscape designers of the time.</p>

<p>Sandal (<i>Santalum album</i>. L), a semi-root parasitic tree is the source of the East Indian sandalwood and oil. Spike disease caused by phytoplasma is the major disease of sandal. The disease is noticed in all major sandal-growing states of India. Spike disease is characterized by extreme reduction in leaf size accompanied by stiffening and reduction of internode length. In advanced stage, the entire shoot gives the appearance of a spike inflorescence. Spiked trees die within 1–2 years after the appearance of visible symptoms. The pathogen, sandal spike phytoplasma, was first detected by electron microscopy in 1969. Phytoplasmas are pleomorphic and fragile organisms occupying relatively small areas within the sieve tubes (phloem) of the host plants. The major obstacle limiting research on phytoplasma disease is that the organism has not so far been isolated and cultivated <i>in vitro</i>.</p>
<p>Sandal spike phytoplasma is a pleomorphic microorganism and are the smallest organism capable of independent replication (ie., does not need a host). The pathogen is around 0.4 to 1.0 micrometer in diameter, has a cell membrane, ribosome and DNA. The amino acids cysteine, methionine and tryptophan are absent in sandal spike phytoplasma [1].</p>

<p>For non-specific detection of sandal spike phytoplasma by light microscopy Giemsa and Dienes’ stain are employed. Aniline blue, Hoechst 33258 and DAPI stain are used in the non-specific detection by fluorescence microscopy [2]</p>
<p>Scientists at Kerala Forest Research Institute, India had reported employing the polymerase chain reaction technique for detecting sandal spike phytoplasma [3]. The pathogen belongs to group I of the major phytoplasma groups.</p>
<p>For raising polyclonal antibody against sandal spike phytoplasma, the pathogen was purified by differential filtration technique [1]. The antibody could detect the pathogen by ELISA, Dot Immuno Binding Assay [1] and Immuno electron microscopy [4].</p>
