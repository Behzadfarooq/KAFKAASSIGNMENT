<dd>My personal take on the subject was that he noticed me voting for "keep" rather late in the peace and was pointing out that the "horse has bolted" (to use a figure of speech). Mind you, I notice that there seem to be a lot of the familar sock-puppets out voting against the retention of the list&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShot_info_7854.html" title="User:Shot info">Shot info</a> 23:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it is very curious that the same old names only seem to appear when a vote is needed or to back up editors. Probably not enough evidence to point the finger, but just suspicious. Will need to garnish more evidence by spending some more time (time I don't really have to be honest) before pointing the finger (AGF). <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShot_info_7854.html" title="User:Shot info">Shot info</a> 00:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since someone asked, the <i>proposed</i> guideline on soliciting votes is WP:CANVAS. So far as I'm aware, no-one solicited me to come and look at this debate, but I stopped to look at it because I've worked on improving articles on pseudoscience elsewhere. User:QuackGuru's request to some participants to change their votes does seem peculiar, though I don't know how it fits into any policy. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 02:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was emailed by <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">User:Fyslee</a> alerting me to the AfD, I think because I have had previous interest in similar article discussions. That said, I've not voted in favour of the current List article (although some retention of some of the collated information seems sensible). As such this was not in keeping with Fyslee's initial "strong keep" view, although I see they have subsequently changed their assessment. I am glad that Fyslee's informed me of this AfD, and note that this has been a good AfD discussion: it has both generated a wide range of opinions and some well expressed thoughts on how wikipedia might continue to develop its commentry on quackery/pseudoscience topics. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 03:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

One place that the Talk could be moved might be into an archive page under Talk:Quackery.

<p>(<i>deindent</i>) I would suggest, for now, copying the entire Talk page to a subpage of your Userspace, <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a>. Then, suggest archiving it under a related topic. For instance, if the article is merged with a Pseudoscience project, ask on its talk page if people would object to archiving the old Talk page there. If folks approve, create a seperate Archive under that Talk page for this list's Talk page (and clearly label it as such). Otherwise, just keep it in your User space for reference. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 21:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Regarding loss of the edit history, that could be avoided if the old Talk page is *moved* rather than cut-and-pasted. If this list suffers deletion, it should not be too late to ask the closing administrator to restore the Talk page to your user space along with the history. But it's worth making an extra copy just in case. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 04:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The difference is that the Rational Skepticism list is in its proper place, a subpage of a current Project. The list we're discussing is in the main Article space, where it will show up when a user searches for a similar term. That means people might be confused into thinking it's an encyclopedic list of quackery-related articles, rather than a user-defined list as part of a project. - <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 17:35, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Kesh, but why bother voting and discussing if one person can decide to move it? The votes were Keep, Delete or Move. If Delete prevails that, to me, doesn't mean move it anyway? If it is smells like bad POV here, moving it there doesn't suddenly make it smell good. It still fails the smell test. Do I have this right?

<dd>If the vote is Delete then, no, don't move it anyway. You might salvage some of the work to integrate with another project, though. As it stands, the page doesn't belong in mainspace at all. The question is whether to delete it, merge it with another project or move it to its own project. I agree that <i>right now</i> the article doesn't smell pretty. However, parts of it could be merged into another project, or it could be recreated as a new project, which would take care of the smell. Otherwise, it should be deleted. That's what the vote is about, really. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 21:00, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have re-read the initial entry&#160;:Excellent Idea!" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_related_to_quackery" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_related_to_quackery" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_related_to_quackery</a> and the more I read it more I think something is fishy here. It is this quote that concerns me:</p>

<p>What's up with that? Doesn't this violate some rules like Assume Good Faith? Quru was concerned about editors notifying others about the AfD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_articles_related_to_quackery&amp;diff=98922190&amp;oldid=98916648" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_articles_related_to_quackery&amp;diff=98922190&amp;oldid=98916648" rel="nofollow">Alert!</a> Was this whole thing a set-up from the beginning? Anyone know if this violates WP behavior guidelines?</p>
<p>I am concerned when editors use Wikipedia for their personal agendas and this is why this is smelling fishier and fishier. I also astonished at how Quackguru become so skilled in creating and editing such an extensive list with perfect syntax the day after he signs on as a new user. Would anyone care to share their thoughts about these concerns? Thanks (Also posted here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_related_to_quackery" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_related_to_quackery" rel="nofollow">Talk</a>) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteth_a418.html" title="User:Steth">Steth</a> 05:57, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ongoing comments by Steth is not assuming good faith. Steth has not helped in any way in improving the list. Seems odd to me. Has not added anything to the list. The only thing Steth has done is continued to be negetive. I smell it now a troll that is. Please comment on improving the list and stop your strange behavior. --QuackGuru 17:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>No doubt the AGF finger will be pointed by those who don't AGF, but it is worth noting that the vast majority of editors who have voted for a delete haven't actually edited an article in WP for some time but have contributed to many discussions. Note that I'm not trying to suggest anything or point the finger at anybody or accuse any editor of being nefarious, I just find it odd, that's all. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShot_info_7854.html" title="User:Shot info">Shot info</a> 08:47, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I took a quick run through the editors and found one editor with several months gap and one new editor. I don't really care about article vs Talk because that's how many professionals contribute and more common in mature articles. I found the time &amp; volume records pretty solid looking.--<a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a> 16:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
