<p>The page refers to an invective neologism created and used by only one author. While people can consider themselves secular and progressive, there are no political or social organizations or commentators that use the term "secular progressive" to refer to themselves. As such, this term is similar to femi-nazi, in that the only current use and discussion of it is from a biased source.</p>
<p>Until such time as a political or social origination or commentator takes up this label or, like the term femi-nazi, it becomes widespread enough that commentators other than Bill O'Riley can use it, I suggest this term cannot meet Wikipedia's standards.

<li><b>delete</b> not to mention that it's horribly POV without any real response included from the other side, the use of direct quotations tells me that this probably wasn't meant as an attack at all by the author, but including only one side of a definition tends to carry a strong negative connotation. That, and it's a neologism used by one author (apparently), until it's reported on in it's own right, it's just not notable. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 08:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unlike the current spirited debate about <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28sexual_slang%29.html" title="Santorum (sexual slang)">Santorum (sexual slang)</a>, this one doesn't really have much to talk about - no uses at all beyond O'Reilly.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 10:04, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> The current article is completely one-sided, yet any attempt to bring the article in line with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, because the term is not widespread enough to have attracted attention from those representing other POVs. -- <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECat_Whisperer_fe2f.html" title="User:Cat Whisperer">Cat Whisperer</a> 12:17, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep, but cite cultural/political effect</b> Quick google search of the exact phrase has ~82,000 hit, most of them from political blogs, but some from verifiable news agencies. The problem with the argument of "neoligism" in this case is that a) it passes notability and b) the two words are both weighted ones in politics so will be put together at least occasionally, whether by Bill O'Reilly or not. In this case, as much as it personally pains me, O'Reilly's use of the term has been a part of the political discourse of the last several years. I'd like this article cleaned up, given minimal POV, and focus on the effect of the term on the political culture than on strict "definition", but it IS a term currently in play and I don't feel we can hide our heads in the sand about it. Regarding the two previous delete arguments that refer to POV: Remember that NPOV is NOT an argument for deletion in AfD debates, since POV issues should be taken care of by editing an article, not deleting it. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:19, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I still vote for delete, but in the meantime I will be editing the article using these 82,000 hits to provide the opposing POV. -- <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECat_Whisperer_fe2f.html" title="User:Cat Whisperer">Cat Whisperer</a> 16:53, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've added some opposing POV to the article, but seeing how most of the 82,00 hits were blogs, that's where the opposing POV came from. I've also taken a look at the main <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_c07d.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (commentator)">Bill O'Reilly (commentator)</a> article, which already mentions Secular Progressives, and which already details O'Reilly's political views, and I don't see what this new article adds to the subject. -- <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECat_Whisperer_fe2f.html" title="User:Cat Whisperer">Cat Whisperer</a> 15:54, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As the primary author of this article, I am disappointed with the arguments in favor of its deletion. I support the existence of this article NOT because I wrote it, but for two, very sound reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> As stated above, the perceived POV of the article does not add to its "deletability." The term "secular-progressive" highlights a viewpoint of a particular political group: of course the article will be one-sided.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, if we were to extend the arguments presented on this page, ANY article on Wikipedia could be deleted just for having a point of view! What kind of intellectual climate does this create?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2.</b> The Wikipedia guidelines on neologisms state that such articles "should be edited to ensure they conform with the core Wikipedia policies: no original research and verifiability." This article uses no original research, and has been verified to an extensive degree. Having a CBS news article talk specifically about the term surely indicates that this is not a "school-child" phrase.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Remember, also, that the guidelines on neologisms are, by definition, guidelines. Official Wikipedia POLICY states that subjects must only be verifiable to have a page on Wikipedia. As previously demonstrated, this article is verifiable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As such, I support the keeping of this article on two grounds: one, that perceived "point-of-view" discrepancies are not grounds for deletion, and two, that this particular neologism is verifiable and notable.</dd>
</dl>
