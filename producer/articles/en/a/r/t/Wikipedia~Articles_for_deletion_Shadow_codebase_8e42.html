<p>nn program, vanity (I deleted the link to the author's User page. He had also created an article about himself, which I userfied.) <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 22:57, September 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>sorry, I didn't know that the creation of articles about one's self was considered vain. I was merely replicated other MUDs informational content to maintain consistancy in information about MUDs. As this codebase was a derivative of <a href="../../../s/m/a/SMAUG_e11f.html" title="SMAUG">SMAUG</a>, I wanted to make sure people knew where it came from. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatmaster_e233.html" title="User:Natmaster">Natmaster</a> 23:06, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This mud is based off of the SMAUG code. There are many players that play on MUDs that use similar coding. I'm sure that there will be many players that would be interested in seeing what exactly, this person has done to alter the code and make it their own. I'm also sure that there is an online list of the rules and procedures that must be followed on this site, and it's possible to find; however I hope we don't have to do that as I'm sure we can work this out. There are many other MUDs listed on this site, thus this should be permitted. The same rules need to be followed at all times, meaning this listing should be allowed. It's quite informative and may give others the information they need in order to start a MUD of their own, which could bring much pleasure to many --Tirion 23:47, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The web of the sole mud running this codebase has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=http://www.aeonofdarkness.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=http://www.aeonofdarkness.com/" rel="nofollow">no Alexa ranking at all</a>. Their MOTD says that as of August 1, they haven't yet begun beta testing. "Maximum Number of players this reboot&#160;: 7". And I removed an external link to them from <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUD</a>.

<li>We recently expanded to aeonofdarkness.com. Index.php have google pagerank of 4. Not all crawlers have found the new site yet, however the old site url still works: aod.genesismuds.com, which has a pagerank of 5. You might notice that the MOTD has several newer news items above that....and that magically the months flow through a whole year. Wow, August 1st doesn't mean August 1st 2005? How could that be? Everything that's important happened this year. Please stop making such insulting claims with grose misinformation. If you're going to say something like it's NN, at least do proper research.--<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatmaster_e233.html" title="User:Natmaster">Natmaster</a> 00:59, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wait - you're arguing that your mud is notable because it's received so little development that announcements stay on the Message of the Day for <i>an entire year'</i>? —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 01:13, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Well, as a current player of AOD, I feel that it is necessary to inform the general public as to it's importance in the current gaming community. The creator/s of the game have put much time and effort into the codebase and have made a very enjoyable game for even the newest mudders (opinion based upon simplicity in usage of the interface) and the assistance of the people involved in the game is something I have not seen in a long time on any of the more "popular" MUDs. AOD has been up and running for several years as I understand it and I think that it is wrong for a information site to immediately disclaim a site that they know relatively nothing about. So, as a player, not a coder or builder or person in any wise involved in the creation or upkeep of the game, I feel that it is important for the general populace to know about such sites as these. But then again, maybe some are bigoted against these sites because they have their "favorites" and don't want others to know. Vibe I am getting here is that the uninformed have attempted to make an "informed" decision based upon either personal bias or just general imbecility. Seamus Curragh</p>
<p>Cryptic, I'm so glad that you want to stop this mud from being listed. How do you think muds become popular? How do you think they gain players? They get word out on sites like this. You're being narrowminded and totally ludacris. Go back to your muds and stay there. Bye bye.--Tirion 23:45, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>And to use just a small section from your own deletion guide:</p>
<p>"Please remember that the deletion process is about the appropriateness of the article for inclusion in Wikipedia. A deletion nomination is not a rejection of the author or an attack on his/her value as a member of the Wikipedia community. Over time, the Wikipedians have invested a great deal of thought in the question of what should and should not be included. Please take the time to review those standards. Please do not take a nomination personally."</p>
<p>I would think calling someone vain in reference to their article would be a little personal. Seamus Curragh</p>
