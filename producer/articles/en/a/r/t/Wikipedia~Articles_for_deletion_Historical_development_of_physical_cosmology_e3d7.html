<dd><b>Comment</b>: The section about <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giordano_Bruno_86e7.html" title="Giordano Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a> is a good example of the "POVness" of the article. Bruno gave no real contribution to the "historical development of physical cosmology", since his work wasn't scientific at all. <s>I think he has a section devoted to him only because of his problems with the church.</s> Moreover, the text does not mention that when Bruno was burned at the stake "<i>there was no official Catholic position on the Copernican system, and it was certainly not a heresy</i>". It is also not mentioned that many believe his condemnation actually "<i>had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican cosmology.</i>" (see source: <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/" class="external text" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/" rel="nofollow">*here*</a>). --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ¬ <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/18px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">»saudações!</a> 05:02, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The original article was about the implications of Biblical cosmology, not "actual scientific advancements". Bruno was a "natural philosopher" and not a scientist; the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> was not developed until centuries after Bruno's gruesome execution. The <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbeiter_70b4.html" title="User:Arbeiter">original contributor</a> stated these points, but they were segregated when these paragraphs were removed to this article. The <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbeiter_70b4.html" title="User:Arbeiter">original contributor</a> also stated that Bruno championed "free speech", but never stated specifically why Bruno was executed. If you have a reference stating that Bruno was instead burned alive as an advocate of free speech, you should have added the reference instead of sweeping multiple sections under the rug. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 09:25, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Galileo and Copernicus were the true "natural philosophers" of the time, not Bruno. But you are right in pointing that, as I also mentioned, the text was originally related with the "Biblical cosmology" article. Your reply was important because I forgot to consider this when I wrote one phrase above (now stroked). But it doesn't change the problematic bias of the text, a bias that becomes clearer when those sections are inserted on more proper articles for them. Notice that one subsection of the text from "Biblical cosmology" was inserted in the article "<a href="../../../r/e/l/Relationship_between_religion_and_science.html" title="Relationship between religion and science">Relationship between religion and science</a>" (instead of moved here), <i>and the text immediately brought POV concerns on that page too</i> - see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Talk%7ERelationship_between_religion_and_science_e8c5.html#Case_study:_Charles_Darwin.3F" title="Talk:Relationship between religion and science">*here*</a>. Even after changes from the editors of that page to reduce the bias, the POV tag is still above that section of the article. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ¬ <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/18px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">»saudações!</a> 17:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Who appointed you to designate the <b>true</b> "natural philosophers" of history? Who appointed you to designate "bad scholarship" as you claimed in your revert war at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">Biblical cosmology</a>? These are simply your biased POV's. We would all probably agree that Bruno left little, if any, evidence of adhering to the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> that was developed centuries after his death, but that only precludes him from being considered a "scientist" by the more modern definition. We would all probably agree that Bruno's published work was not nearly as significant as that provided by the long careers of Galileo and Copernicus, but that does not preclude him from being considered a "natural philosopher". It is worth repeating that I "never stated specifically why Bruno was executed". The more in depth references I read stated that no conclusion could be certain about the charges upon which Bruno was convicted due to a lack of primary source material from the convicting (religious) court. Regardless of the specific reason, I believe that, just like the scientific method, Bruno's pleas for freedom of speech are actually more relevant to scientific advancement than Bruno's brilliant extension of Copernican concepts. There was no need to strike through your "problems with the church" comment. His fiery demise is exactly what earned Bruno's inclusion in <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">Biblical cosmology</a>.

<dd>Arbeiter, as I just found out, DixiePixie and YOU seem to be one and the same person.

<dd>That is quite an accusation. I would like to see you present your "evidence". Is it all circumstantial speculation? Do you feel the accusation is enough to justify such a claim? You should note that everything I claimed about you is backed up through article histories available to everyone.

<dd>Other users can easily check to see if they agree with me by reading the edit history of Arbeiter, DixiePixie, and Witch-King. I don't need to distract readers from anything, since your conspiracy theory is completely bogus. My engagement in what you like to say was "my" "revert war", for example, was limited to a single edit. And I don’t know how you can assume that ScienceApologist decided to move your text as some kind of evil scheme to protect religion, the bible, whatever... As a <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialist.html" title="Materialist">materialist</a>, (read his user page), I really don’t think he would be inclined to defend any sort of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">biblical cosmology</a>. Also, as his name implies, he does <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetic.html" title="Apologetic">apologetics</a> <i>in favor of science</i>; if anything, it can be said that he devotes his time in Wikipedia to defend science against religion, precisely the opposite of what you seems to be thinking.</dd>

<dd>There were basically two problems with those sections you wrote on Biblical cosmology: (1) they were off-topic regarding the original article, (2) they were (and are) POV.

From the moment I read Goodsamaritan's reply, it was obvious to me that it was an incomplete response that you were more than prepared to rebut. So, I stepped forward to supplement his post by noting that you were being more astute than GoodSamaritan seemed to assume.

<dd>Look familiar? I almost admire the subtle, rhetorical tactics Leinad-Z employed, but we should see through them and understand that such speculation can be employed without merit. Obviously, all these accounts couldn't be one person, but it made a suspicious-looking case for it anyway. That said, while preparing the mock argument above, I noticed a couple amazingly coincidental edits that were hard to swallow. Now, I'm not sure whether Leinad-Z was offering his accusations as a smoke screen or actually shifting the spotlight to hide questionable behavior. With the mock argument in mind, anybody with the time should compare GoodSamaritan's first two edits with Leinad-Z's edits of the same articles to see how one article relates to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72655496" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72655496" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> by Leinad-Z. I was involved with all three places at some point. My low tolerance for questionable behavior was surpassed long ago at Wikipedia. As some of you now know from my past edits, it is my desire to wash my hands of Wikipedia, and so this will be a parting shot.

<dd>Arbeiter, there are several paradoxes that arise if one wants to consider GoodSamaritan as my sockpuppet. For example: the first edit by GoodSamaritan, the one used as "evidence" that he may be my sock, seems to be very odd behavior from "Leinad-Z &amp; co". Why? Because the link you provided above makes clear that <i>I had a sourced quotation by two historians of science that would very easily allow the modification of your biased text</i>. It makes no sense to think that, instead of taking the easy and policy-approved route for changing that article, I would go through the trouble of creating a sockpuppet account and its elaborated userpage to edit it. BTW, as you very well know, much before GoodSamarintan's first edit I had already clearly <i><a href="../../../d/e/d/Talk%7EDedication_to_Pope_Paul_III_990d.html" title="Talk:Dedication to Pope Paul III">told you</a></i> that I would need to change the article's POV problems eventually. However, the most noticeable problem with your new theory may be that bringing the very issue of sockpuppetry (as I did at the start of this discussion) would be the most stupid thing to do if I were trying to hide a sockpuppet myself. Gosh, I was even <a href="../../../f/a/s/User_talk%7EFastfission_e166.html#A_problem_with_probable_sock_puppets" title="User talk:Fastfission">trying to bring the current discussion to the attention of administrators</a>, (again an incredibly stupid thing to do if what you say was in fact true). --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ¬ <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/18px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">»saudações!</a> 00:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, you allegedly did come back "to change the article's POV problems" in the guise of a sock puppet. Also, your own arguments here (including the one you use as the "most noticeable problem with [the sock puppet] theory") apply equally for your accusations of GoodSamaritan being Arbeiter's sock puppet. Going to a WP administrator with which you share an edit history (and therefore possible association) is also suspicious behavior. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 16:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it doesn't apply "equally" at all. Arbeirter was trying to defend himself from suspicion of sockpuppetry and needed something to try even out the discussion on the topic. On the other hand, I had no reason to put my alleged sock under the spotlight. All the time, I was perfectly aware that the argumentation you "both" were making toward me and ScienceApologist was completely flawed. Read again the deletion discussion and you’ll see that, as soon as Arbeirter tried to imply that I was denouncing sockpuppetry as a "rhetorical strategy" to hide my "shameful behavior", I wrote a key reply showing the allegations were unfounded. Until now, no one was able to rebut. Also, any attempt of <i>deleting</i> this article and <i>merging</i> its content back from were it was removed would necessarily be much harder than a simple NPOV edit. Especially because the move would be against the commonsense notion that articles should stay their respective topics. The fact is that I needed no socks, while Arbeirter did need them if he wanted to see his text back where he edited. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ∴ <a href="../../../b/r/a/Image%7EBRAlogo1.png_acf7.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/bd/BRAlogo1.png/18px-BRAlogo1.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../b/r/a/Image%7EBRAlogo1.png_acf7.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">-diz aí, chapa.</a> 19:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. It does apply equally since your were trying to defend yourself against suspicion of misbehavior in the form of a "divide and conquer" tactic. "Until now" meaning that I recently provided its rebuttal? Sorry. I would have offered the rebuttal earlier if you had invited me to defend myself against your accusations, but instead you simply started accusing the new users who ever sided with Arbeiter without even leaving them notice of your accusations. You were here arguing with yourself. HomeComputer stopped by to ask you to take it elsewhere, but you kept arguing with yourself anyway. I guess you have a hard time feeling lonely. Again, your alleged motivation is pure speculation and even contradictory. Arbeiter needed no socks for this purpose, because Arbeiter never even asked for a merger; he voted to "delete". In fact, nobody has voted for a "merge", and this accusation taints the discussion so that fewer will have the courage to vote that way. (They might just get themselves added to your ever-widening sock puppet allegations.) Again, questionable tactics on your part. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 22:19, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are you seriously claiming that the note you "recently provided" is a rebuttal? Your comment there is only saying that I shouldn’t complain about the baseless accusations you were making toward me and ScienceApologist. It makes nothing to change the fact that you were completely wrong. Again, the <i>suspicion of misbehavior</i> was bogus, I knew exactly how to respond to that, and I did so effectively in the discussion above. It was soon after that key comment (when I mention that ScienceApologist is a materialist) that Arbeiter made the desperate accusation that I was the one using a sockpuppet; it seems that he <i>really</i> didn't know how to reply to that, (and so does you). Also, Dixiepixie, the edit summary of your own first edit in this page reads: <b>“Merge back to its orginal location”</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FHistorical_development_of_physical_cosmology&amp;diff=82176767&amp;oldid=82157486" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FHistorical_development_of_physical_cosmology&amp;diff=82176767&amp;oldid=82157486" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> So, <i>please stop pretending that there was no intention to move the text back to the original article</i>. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ∴ <a href="../../../b/r/a/Image%7EBRAlogo1.png_acf7.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/bd/BRAlogo1.png/18px-BRAlogo1.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../b/r/a/Image%7EBRAlogo1.png_acf7.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">-diz aí, chapa.</a> 00:16, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I only repeated it. You were the one who said, "<b>Until now</b>, no one was able to rebut." <i>Until now</i> here means <i>the opposite recently happened</i>. With the phrase, <i>until now</i>, you led me to believe that I had already provided the rebuttal, and so I did not even look for this reply. Looking for it now, I think you're either asking me to defend a quote made by Arbeiter or defend the text written by Arbeiter. In case you didn't catch it, Arbeiter left Wikipedia at <i>15:31, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</i>. You have already missed the chance to discuss anything with Arbeiter. As for me, I am only in this discussion to defend myself against your sock puppet accusations. It was you who originally resorted to "desperate accusations" of sock puppetry so that you could "feel little need to reply to" Arbeiter's accusations. Well, it's embarrassing that I didn't think to look back at my edit summary, but great that you found it. This is further proof that I am not Arbeiter's sock puppet: we voted differently! In <a href="../../../a/r/b/User_talk%7EArbeiter_d707.html#Come_back.21" title="User talk:Arbeiter">Arbeiter's discussion page</a>, I asked Arbeiter to "come back", and "defend your edits". I thought my encouragement and a merger would get Arbeiter contributing again. Now that Arbeiter voted to "delete", and especially now that Arbeiter left Wikipedia, I feel ambivalent about the merger. In fact, I will change my vote. It's very frustrating that my efforts to retain a Wikipedian not only failed, but got me stuck with Leinad-Z's sock puppet accusations. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 10:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is NOT the place to be throwing around accusations. You people are getting WAY OFF TOPIC. If you want to go accuse somebody of sock puppetry gather your information and take it to the appropriate forum. In his defense Arbeiter and I got into some seriously heated disagreement over at another Biblical article but there was no evidence of any sock puppetry though I could tell how mad he was gettin he probably wanted to.&#160;;) hehe. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Homecomputer</a> 16:27, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Home Computer, thanks for the kind reply. But I still want to make one (last?) comment/question that is related with your first post. I did some research to find which specific discussion you were mentioning when you said that "Arbeiter was involved and there was no evidence of sock puppetry". My best guess is that you were talking about this <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Biblical_literalism_8dd3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Biblical literalism">AFD discussion</a> for Biblical literalism. Am I right?

<dd>Yeah, I got it. Actually, I have presented my suspicions but have been (from the beginning) restraining myself from advancing the evidence in regard to that.

<p><b>Leinad-Z</b>: Since you have openly questioned my gender, I feel it is no longer off topic to ask you a personal question. Does somebody pay you to provide censorship at Wikipedia? Your editing efforts obviously exceed an unpaid interest in history. By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_cosmology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76399506" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_cosmology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76399506" rel="nofollow">shielding those traditionally associated with the church</a> while leaving <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> to appear as the lone holdout against scientific advancement, you have led me to believe that you are a paid censor of the Catholic church. After all, this exception is completely inconsistent with your stated POV of dispelling the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_thesis.html" title="Conflict thesis">conflict thesis</a>". Beside this point, let me see if I understand (the up-to-date version of) your accusations. You want people to believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbeiter voted to "delete" this content, but secretly maneuvers to "merge" this content back to the original page.</li>
<li>Although Arbeiter lacked the patience to join a revert war to defend his own edits or even stay with Wikipedia, Arbeiter actually cultivated an account to look like your sock puppet, because Arbeiter somehow knew that one day, you would start a round of sock puppet allegations, and wanted to be ready to turn the tables on you. Following that line, Arbeiter<sup>*</sup> then nominated this article for deletion with the foreknowledge that it would lure you into the discussion to make sock puppet accusations just in time to beat Arbeiter's pre-declared retirement date.</li>
<li>Arbeiter created the account named <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillstone_da96.html" title="User:Millstone">Millstone</a> simply to join the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Biblical_literalism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Biblical_literalism" rel="nofollow">Biblical literalism AfD</a>, but then objected to the vote Millstone provided because the account was too new. (Wow... OMG... is it possible that even Freddulany is also Arbeiter's sock puppet? After all, just like Millstone, Freddulany agreed with Arbeiter's understanding that <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a> exists. Arbeiter offered friendly encouragement to the new user just like Witch-King, and even declared that he valued Freddulany's opinion. After all, by using competing sock puppets, Arbeiter<sup>*</sup> brought the vote tally closer to his own position -- to abstain. Don't you see it? Or am I being as paranoid as you?)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Leinad-Z</b>: Do you really think this is the simplest explanation possible? There are simpler explanations: Perhaps your overbearing approach to editing and disregard for the discussion process is spawning troll accounts by unknown persons?</p>
<p><b>Arbeiter</b>: Perhaps your sharply pointed mannerisms in the discussion pages are doing the same.</p>
<p><b>Leinad-Z &amp; Arbeiter</b>: Are you discussing your edits with your personal friends and co-workers? If so, might one of them be attempting to support you? ...antagonize you? I guess the simplest &amp; most obvious explanation of all might be that people actually exist with POV's aligning with your apparent opponent. Of course, I feel confident that I exist, but if the rest of Leinad-Z's accusations are true, I would like to tell both Arbeiter and Leinad-Z to look in the mirror, and say hello to each other. You both missed the opportunity to discuss your differences, and pull each other towards reality. If you had spent half this effort in a discussion page for the articles in question rather than hatching sock puppet accusations for each other, you two probably would have created something worth reading. For my part, I still maintain that dumping this content here was completely inappropriate. Leinad-Z should have taken his concerns to the discussion page once Witch-King reverted it back (even if you always suspected he was a sock puppet), and there was no attempt made to make this material appropriate for this article's subject; it was just dropped off here as if this page were the city dump. If <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> really wants this page to happen, he should have taken an active hand in it; throwing out the suggestion is not a sufficient effort. As for my apparent coordination with Arbeiter, it was the wikify tag that lured me into <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a>'s discussion page. The rest was documented on our discussion pages. As for always agreeing with Arbeiter, this is a fallacy. If I had followed his editing early on, I would have agreed with HomeComputer that his definition at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a> was off base and this threw the entire article into confusion. I also would have objected to some POV statements in the Darwin section of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">Biblical cosmology</a>. However, because I only investigated this debacle after Arbeiter announced his retirement, these had become mute points since they had been deleted by the time I became involved. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 17:18, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I intend to leave further discussion about the sockpuppets for a more appropriate place. Just defending myself from the yet-another <a href="../../../a/d/-/Ad-hominem.html" title="Ad-hominem">ad-hominem</a> attack: in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_cosmology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76399506" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_cosmology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76399506" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, I am reverting Witch-King’s previous reversion of the move. To leave the section about Martin Luther in the article was actually ScienceApologist’s decision. It seems to me that the section about Luther was somewhat more connected to the original topic of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">Biblical cosmology</a>, since it simply mentioned Luther's interpretation of the bible without being a report of yet-another "instance of conflict".

<dd>I guess arguing with yourself was more fun. Don't pretend you were above the ad-hominem attacks. Your ad-hominem attacks against me lured me back here. Luther used a scriptural reference from the Biblical book of Joshua as evidence that Copernicus was a fool and actually a <i>astrologer</i> instead of <i>astronomer</i>. How could this not be an instance of conflict between science and religion? Once the rest was gone, it was guaranteed to face opposition by the first Lutheran to see it. I wouldn't doubt if the person who deleted it was a Lutheran who saw Luther being isolated as the lone holdout against scientific advancement. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 23:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
