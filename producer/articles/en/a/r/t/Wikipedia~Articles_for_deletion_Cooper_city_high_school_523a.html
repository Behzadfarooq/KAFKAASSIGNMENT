<dd>Would you care to explain your comment? How does stating that X school exists and has a principal named Y constitute either "original research" or "vanity"&#160;? --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 08:55, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Vanity and original research are not about the information itself, but about the <i>source</i> of said information. To quote <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>: "Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>. Specific factual content is not the question. Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a> (one that analyzes, assimilates, evaluates, interprets, and/or synthesizes primary sources) or <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> (one that generalizes existing research or secondary sources of a specific subject under consideration)." If an individual attends a certain school and then from his own experiences writes an article, he is engaging in original research as a primary source. As for vanity, if a page is written by a person that attends a school (not neccessarily an alum, but currently enrolled), then it is no different from writing about a website one has founded or a band one has played in. If the article is well-written, informative, and objective, then this may not be an issue, but for a sub-stub like this, it is. As to why this article is vanity, I urge you to check the history of the article, specifically an addtional sentence in the original, since removed, that confirms this aspect. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:37, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nonsense. Unless the author founded the school themselves there is no way known writing an article about it can constitute "vanity" - particilarly if there's absolutely nothing self-referential about it. Under your interpretation of policy I can't write about my local church because I attended services there as a child. Nor can I write about the university I attended, railway stations I've made use of - or in fact any other public facility I may have found myself in at any time during my existence - and <i>that</i> is plainly ridiculous. In any case I've now rewritten this article myself, using data that is easily locatable on Google - and I have never been anywhere near Broward County - so your argument is moot either way.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:35, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, lets keep this civil please. You asked a question and I answered it. Just because the answer does not fit your world-view does not mean you have to get nasty. Second, I am glad that unlike other people who whine about this sort of thing you actually went out and fixed the problem so that it is no longer original research or vanity. Third, you have not "won" any competion with me, as there was never a contest to begin with, just two people who care about wikipedia and have different opinions, so you should try to be less smug in your responses. Fourth, you did not read my whole response or you would see that vanity does not matter in my opinion on school articles, or church, or subway stations, if they are well-written informative articles, so you are free to write such articles on these things in my opinion (I have never, by the way insinuated that this is anything but my own interpretation of policy that you are free to disagree with). Plus, this article was self-referential in its first form, check the history. Fifth, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a> specifically mentions high schools, so I feel you should do a little research before laying into someone like you did above. Finally, I still feel this is not encyclopedic for notability reasons and should be deleted. You are, as always free to disagree, but I hope you can muster a bit more politeness when you do. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 23:17, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as a stub or sub-stub. It neds improvement, but so do a great deal of articles in the Wikipedia. I've seen a great deal of the discussion regarding the deletion of schools, and read pleanty of arguments for and against their inclusion. The most common reasons given for deletion are, "it's just a school that nobody important went to." Think about it though: In developed countries, the majority of school aged people spend more than one third of their day in their school over the course of their day. Many children see more of their teachers than their own parents in cases where parents work shift-work. In small rural communities, the local school is often a centre of a community, and in many cases the only facility large enough for a major community event. In developing countries, the school is often the glue that binds an entire community together. I think WikiPedia should ENCOURAGE the organization and catagorization of articles on individual schools. Yes, there is the possibility that this could turn the Wikipedia in each different language version into something rivaling the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Galactica_f801.html" title="Encyclopedia Galactica">Encyclopedia Galactica</a>, but ffs people... it's digital. It's the closest thing to the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitchhikers%27_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_4c0f.html" title="Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy">Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy</a> that isn't pure fiction. By encouraging the inclusion of schools, we encourage the use of the Wikipedia by students and staff at schools. These two groups represent a huge segment of global population that we could get interested in contributing to the Wikipedia, and furturing its future development and growth. Isn't that one of our goals here?<a href="../../../w/e/a/User%7EWeaponofmassinstruction_5523.html" title="User:Weaponofmassinstruction">Weaponofmassinstruction</a> 22:35, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>think of it like this, if your experience of wikipedia is coming along and finding a whole load of boring uninformative sub-stubs, do you think that encourages or discourages you to write a decent article about your school? I have nothing against school articles, but a school article like this does active damage. If your argument (that much life happens in schools) is true, then almost every school should have something interesting and valuable to say about it. There should have been crime, punishment, disillusionment, joy, love, hate and maybe even education going on. An article which fails to reflect these, or even one of them is misleading, unverifiable, unencyclopedic, discouraging (even of other articles about schools) and just plain wrong. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 07:31, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</li>
