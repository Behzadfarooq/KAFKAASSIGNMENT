<p>It hasn't always been self published. But even then, what's wrong with a self published comic being in Wiki? Lots of comics are self published and underground in nature. That doesn't mean there's no interest in them or that they're undeserving of a "wikiarticle." You have to look at it sort of like an underground band or cult film. I hope you'll reconsidered your stance on the Halloween Man article, because we've put alot of work into it. And hope to have the chance to continue to improve it. Plus the comic itself hasn't just been a self published venture. Though that's been apart of it's history, it's also been published by atleast two small publishers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bubfan (<a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubfan_4195.html" title="User talk:Bubfan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubfan_3b9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubfan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Look up Across the Pond studios and you'll find that they've had titles out through Image, Dark Horse, etc. Type in "Halloween Man Comics" into google and you'll that there is a interest out there for this character.Not to mention that one of the artist on the comic has been featured in Wizard. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bubfan (<a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubfan_4195.html" title="User talk:Bubfan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubfan_3b9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubfan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>What? I don't know a single person who searches that way. Look at the searches before you write me off why don't you?

If you say so. How do I even know you guys aren't the same person? It's an act of trust now isn't it. If you really must now I'm at work otherwise I'd make a profile. And I came across this little debate quite by accident. But that's nether here nor there. You're dancing around the points I've made rather than simply clicking on the links. I doubt you'll find at all to confusing. It's just a list of sites. Make an informed opinion rather than an uninformed one.

<p>Is there ANY way to save this? - Russell H</p>
<p>Okay- so what exactly is the basis for wanting to delete this whole article? Because it doesn't hold enough interest between you and your group of friends? I really don't quite understand. Aeveryman 17:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quite simply (and as has been made clear) because the subject isn't notable per Wikipedia standards. Just because something is interesting to a small group of people, that doesn't make it worth an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 18:15, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Oh- I get it now. I thought the point of the wikipedia was to be able to include a broader range of (legitimate) subjects that wouldn't be in a paper encyclopedia, since the internet is such a huge resource. I didn't realize it was just a digital form of your average, limited encyclopedia. I stand corrected. Aeveryman 19:24, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If by "broader range" you mean "any silly trash me and my friends think it's important" then, yeah, you're right. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 19:29, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where is this "broader range"? A quick perusal over the official message forum shows that most threads are dead and the last posts were by the creater Drew <a href="http://futurius.net/plex/index.php?board=5.0" class="external autonumber" title="http://futurius.net/plex/index.php?board=5.0" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Obviously, someone on the yahoo group is trying to influence this vote <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/halloweenmanscreatureclub/message/2562?l=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/halloweenmanscreatureclub/message/2562?l=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and yet still, all votes by legitimate editors vote deletion. There just isn't any notability here. That doesn't mean Drew isn't talented. It doesn't mean the comic isn't good. It simply means that at this juncture the subject isn't notable. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 21:43, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Legit editors? I thought anyone who signed up is a legit editor? Look just because someone on the yahoo group is being pushy, doesn't mean that's how everyone is going about it. Cleary you've pushed some peoples buttons though. Which means people do care more about this character then you originally suspected. Atleast grant us that. As far as the message forum goes, I think most indie comics would have a similar set-up. Really anything that's not DC or Marvel has to be pushed hard by it's creator. I don't get what you mean by "dead" though. There's topics going on in there from the last week or so. Honestly I think "everyman" makes some valid points. There's some stuff on here that's just as fringy as "Halloween Man." How about this, leave the article up for say...six months to a year. You might be surprised at what happens. I'll continue to improve the article myself. I'm sure the others here will as well. ~~ <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bubfan (<a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubfan_4195.html" title="User talk:Bubfan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubfan_3b9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubfan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>As for the compromise option? A vastly reduced entry, for instance (3-4 paragrahps, a couple of external links and a single picture), with the option of expanding later? Or is it an all or nothing situation? --RussellH 20:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isn't something that can really be compromised. Otherwise there would be hundreds of stubs that never became notable but people are still patiently waiting just in case they do. If it isn't notable now, it should be deleted. If it becomes notable later, it can be recreated with the new information. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 21:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ABSOLUTELY keep it! You have a link to Madame Razz from the She-Ra cartoon and you are considering deleting THIS? That's more than a little ridiculous. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.70.95.203.html" title="User:24.70.95.203">24.70.95.203</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.70.95.203.html" title="User talk:24.70.95.203">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.70.95.203_59f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.70.95.203">contribs</a>).</small></p>

While personally I think they should keep it. Anyone who is a fan of this comic should just work on the Comixpedia article. There's already more effort being put into that one that this version. More people working on it as well. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.159.131.80 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.159.131.80_ff76.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.159.131.80">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>Delete</b> - Notability is in question, but also the quality of the article at this point. Delete and re-write; it reads like a promotional website at this point, loaded with POV and non-informative trivia....</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Solomon's main power is often described as the "power of the horror movie sequel."</i> citations or re-write; who says, and where?</li>
<li><i>More recently, a major villain in the form of the Phantom Hood has turned up to make Solomon's life hell.</i> Is the whole article written by a comic writer?</li>
<li>It reads like it's written by a fanboy; <i>Fans of the series often praise the comic's sly nods to pop culture as a strong postmodernist element.</i> or <i>Naysayers tend to note the physical similarties between Solomon and Jonah Hex.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It's basically a fansite on Wikipedia at this point... --<a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXinit_a91f.html" title="User:Xinit">Xinit</a> 20:23, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
