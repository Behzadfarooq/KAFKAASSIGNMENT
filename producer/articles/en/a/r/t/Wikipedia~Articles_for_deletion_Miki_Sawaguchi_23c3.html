<li>Wrong. WP:BIO mentions the Google Test as an "alternative test", <i>not</i> as a proposed test. It does so because this is a test that some people use. WP:BIO is merely being descriptive. However, WP:BIO <i>also</i> links to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a>, <i>which explains why this test is fundamentally flawed, in particular in the case of pornography</i>.
<p>As I said above, rather than counting search results, please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>, to demonstrate that the WP:BIO criteria are satisfied.

<li>What I read at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is, "Alternative tests... Other tests for inclusion that have been <i>proposed</i> (but haven't necessarily received consensus support) include... Google Test." If I'm wrong, if it is an <i>alternative</i> test for notability, then notability is proven, case closed. However, I notice the word <i>proposed</i> in the sentence, and say otherwise. I happen to know, because I have some degree of interest and knowledge in this area, that Miki Sawaguchi is a well-known model with extremely high visibility in both the adult and the mainstream media in Japan. Now, I know this sort of personal interest and knowledge in the field does not constitute verifiability, and I am making no claims it does. I haven't checked the article, but will work on it later, and am fairly certain I <i>can</i> prove notability and verifiability. (By the way, if I did <i>not</i> have any interest and knowledge in the area, I would not be pasting a uniform untested and unsupported assertion of non-notability on every article in the category.) <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:51, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_Test_6be3.html" title="Wikipedia:Google Test">Wikipedia:Google Test</a> specifically mentions that it is not an accurate way to determine notability of porn stars. And the actress remains non-notable for having no awards, mainstream work, notable magazine appearances, etc, even in Japan. Bottom line is, we have to either apply <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>, even allowing for a Japanese equivalent in terms of Japanese media outlets.

<li>Once again: <i>Counting Google hits is not research.</i> The Google test is fundamentally flawed, and both WP:BIO and what you are replying to immediately above link to a page that explains this. <i>Please read it.</i> Once again: Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>.

<li>This is beginning to resemble a Monty Python skit. I am <i>not</i> claiming Google is a proof of notability. I not only read the passage, I pasted it.

<li><b>Comment</b> HongQiGong continuously asserts the false claim that <i>Japanese</i> adult stars must either meet a <i>proposed American</i> test, or they must meet a standard world biography test. Again, the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <i>specifically</i> mentions Google under <i>Alternative tests</i> as a <i>proposed</i> way to establish notability, a test this model would pass easily. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Wikipedia:Search engine test</a> also "describes a method used by some on Articles for Deletion to approximate notability." And, again, I am <i>not</i> saying a Google search establishes notability (and I'm not going to bite on another nonsensical Google-test argument), however the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <i>does</i> mention it. As for HongQiGong's claim that there are only two possible guidelines for ascertaining notability (the <i>American</i> porn one and the standard world biography one), there exists an entire Category devoted to differing means of establishing notablity issues for different subjects. Applying a strict <i>American</i> test to <i>Japanese</i> topics is at best a way to ensure cultural bias at Wikipedia, at worst an underhanded way to censor Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 22:19, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, this is another <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> nomination Golbez. This is becoming increasingly more ridiculous. If this editor were <i>seriously</i> interested in notability and verifiability issues, he would tag the articles for sources, check and find sources, or even do some work and clean up or expand the article himself. He does not. Instead, with <i>no</i> attempt at checking notability or verifiability himself, he often first tags these articles for speedy-deletion, and then reverts when that tag is removed. Just short of a 3-Revert violation, he then further tags the articles for deletion with a pasted, pre-prepared, un-checked, un-supported assertion of non-notability. During the discussion, he then apparently willfully withholds pertinent information (researching using Japanese names instead of Roman letters), and engages in non-ending, nonsensical circular-logic arguments. I've been <i>trying</i> to assume good faith from this editor, but in all honesty, by nominating <i>this</i> subject-- a multi-media, international star (I will update the article with sources soon)-- for deletion on "non-notability" grounds, he has really crossed the line. It is quite apparent that his intent is to disrupt Wikipedia through frivolous deletion nominations, circular arguments, and censorship. Lots of time is being wasted by this editor. Recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Koavf#Blocked" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Koavf#Blocked" rel="nofollow">another editor</a> was blocked for mass-delete tagging of similar articles. This editor is even more insidious, however, since he is doing it slowly and wasting everyone's time with these repetitive discussions. Is there anything we do, other than follow him around contesting his obviously baseless nominations for deletion? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:15, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, not notable according to the <i>standards</i> of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> (i.e. no notablity conferred by recognition from any Japanese equivalents of the American organisations and publications listed in that proposal). Note once more that <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> specifically suggests that the Google test be discounted because it is even less accurate for adult performers than for regular people; this is no less true of Japanese performers than of Americans.<br />
More to the point, however, the article still provides no sources whatsoever for its biographical information, and thus fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> dismally. Whatever your opinion of the biographical guidelines, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> can in no way be made out to be an Americocentric policy designed to censor Wikipedia: it is a fundamental principle on which an encyclopedia must be founded. Note therefore that articles which fail it this dismally are not, in fact, keepable without the failure being addressed. Perhaps the people who want this article kept could stop railing against cultural bias long enough to ensure that their article doesn't actually violate fundamental policies like that? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 10:09, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added to the article, and added sources. The test mentioned was put into place from an entirely <i>American</i> perspective, addressing the <i>American</i> industry and <i>American</i> society. It completely ignores the vast differences between the US and some other cultures. Even the most non-notable of these Japanese models have a presence on mainstream outlets like Amazon. Miki Sawaguchi is a <i>retired</i> model, yet still has 27 DVDs, 24 Videos, and 4 books listed at Amazon. She was a regular on <i>two</i> television shows and appeared as a guest on many more. How many retired <i>American</i> porn stars with articles can show this much notability? Instead, we're forced to prove that <i>Japanese</i> models meet the <i>proposed American</i> 100-film test. How much verifiability do we need? An academic treatise on the subject? These are porn stars we're talking about. Miki Sawaguchi has had articles in U.S. magazines concerned with Asian cinema, such as <i>Oriental Cinema</i> and <i>Asian Cult Cinema</i>. I have listed as sources those I could find. The Nikkatsu Roman Porn genre existed for 30 years before a book was written on it in Japan. It took till the year 2000 before a book covering the subject to any degree was printed in English. Again, insisting that <i>Japanese</i> adult actors pass a test set up by and for <i>American</i> adult actors ensures cultural bias. If <i>any</i> Japanese adult star is notable enough for an article, Miki Sawaguchi is. Wikipedia makes claims of being uncensored, and to fight a cultural bias. If an article on a multi-media, internationally known star like Miki Sawaguchi can <i>seriously</i> be considered for deletion on grounds of non-notability, something is seriously wrong somewhere. Could it be people with no interest, no knowledge, and hostility to the subject are nominating and voting to delete these articles? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 02:50, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I see a lot of talk about a Japanese equivalent of the <i>proposed</i> <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>, but there is no such thing yet.

<li>Actually, what there is is a lot of micharacterisation of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> as being "American", for some reason. That mischaracterisation isn't supported by reading the page. It says "news outlets", not "American news outlets", for example. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:37, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> specifically makes mention of mainstream work, being the monthly feature in magazines like Playboy or Penthouse, awards, etc etc. If a Japanese porn actress do not have similar credits to her name, then she would not be notable. Mainstream work <i>in Japan</i>? Notable magazine appearances <i>in Japan</i>? Notable awards <i>in Japan</i>? etc etc. The only arguments I've heard so far for keeping the plethora of articles on seemingly non-notable Japanese porn actresses is that they have xxx number of Google hits or they have some random number of DVDs, like "24 DVDs, she's notable". What? Who decided that 24 DVDs, with no awards, no mainstream work, no notable magazine appearances, etc, is notable for a Japanese porn actress? And why are American porn actresses subjected to a much harsher test? But regardless, like I've also said before, if you do not like <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> or a suggested Japanese equivalent, we can always fall back to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which this particular actress would not pass either. Something you may not be aware of - it is already very lenient to nominate an article on a Japanese porn actress based on an <i>imaginary</i> equivalent of a <i>proposed</i> notability test. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is much stricter. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 17:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Good idea, Neier. When it comes down to one of the most well-known adult actress/models in Japan seriously being considered for deletion... something is seriously wrong somewhere. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 02:50, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've started the expansion of the article, added references, filmography, etc., etc. This is just a beginning, of course.

<li><b>Comment</b> The nominator continuously asserts that these models would not pass <i>Japanese equivalents</i> of the <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. It needs to be pointed out that there <i>are</i> no Japanese equivalents to the 8 awards, the comprehensive database, etc. listed at <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>, and any speculation on the editor's part on whether the subject would pass these imaginary tests is irrelevant. The American and the Japanese adult entertainment industries are vastly different, and <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> is a test based on the American industry. The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/503-6282232-8219950?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%91%F2%8C%FB%82%DD%82%AB" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/503-6282232-8219950?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%91%F2%8C%FB%82%DD%82%AB" rel="nofollow">Japanese Amazon</a> currently still lists 27 DVD, 24 Videos, and 4 photo-books on this model. Beyond that, she <i>still</i> passes even the American test since she has been a regular on <i>two</i> TV shows, has appeared on <i>eight</i> others, has made <i>two</i> musical CDs, and has an extensive list of magazine appearances. This is <i>clearly</i> an indication that the model has reached a wide audience, and has appeared successfully in multiple media. Articles on American subjects with <i>vastly</i> less notability have been retained (see:<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Air_Force_Amy_ece6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Air Force Amy">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Air Force Amy</a>). Japanese models who have shown far less levels of notability (see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shoko_Goto_ae72.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shoko Goto">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shoko Goto</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hikaru_Koto_2_c0f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hikaru Koto 2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hikaru Koto 2</a>) have recently failed AfD nominations. There is absolutely no valid reason to delete this article. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 17:36, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - per Dekkappai--<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 00:39, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the article speaks for itself with regards to the amount and variety of work she's done in Japan. <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> (still only a proposed guideline) is massively biased towards the US porn industry and clearly cannot be applied here. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERankler_6eec.html" title="User:Rankler">Rankler</a> 10:16, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
