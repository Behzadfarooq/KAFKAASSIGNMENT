<li><b>Comment</b> Guys, I see how you are arguing. Your view that this people can in no way be notable only being the relative of somebody. In most cases, that is true. But in some cases, it is not. This is one of those cases. First, Muslims places so much time and effort on the the genealogy of this people, that only being related makes them notable, in a Muslim POV. There are entire books that list this people and gives entries on what is known about each. Second, there is also the problem of research. Much of the information on this guys are in Arabic, meaning its hard to google them out, since they havent been translated. And when they are translated, they are transliterated in different way, making it harder to track them down. And some times, they are not even named, only refered to as " the mother of x did this and that". This results in taking a lot of time to create articles. And third, we have the problem of where to put information, if not on her own article. For example, Hind bint Awf is connected to 5 people. Am I supposed to repeat everything I find on here in each of those five articles? Every single bit of information on this people are of very high significance, where they live, who long, when they married and so forth...</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The notability claim here seems to be that one of this lady's daughters married Muhammad the Prophet, <s>three</s> two other daughters married early followers of Muhammad, and she is the grandmother of a major early Islamic theologian. The sheer number of people significant to Islam among her progeny makes her notable. Besides, if we can let Jeanne Marie Cossanges hang around for a year, we can give this article a few days to develop. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:51, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> being one famous person's parent isn't notable; having so many of your children end up in such significant marriages is a different thing altogether. From what I've read so far, fascinating, but the article needs to be improved a lot. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 05:55, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agree with Georgewilliamherbert that improvement/expansion is needed. I'd like to see the dates when this lady lived (even if approximate), an explanation of what happened to husband #2, an indication of what religion she followed, and some discussion perhaps of what kind of work her various husbands did and what work she did. Also, did she have any other children? And if alternate spellings of her name is a problem, they should be listed. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:49, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
