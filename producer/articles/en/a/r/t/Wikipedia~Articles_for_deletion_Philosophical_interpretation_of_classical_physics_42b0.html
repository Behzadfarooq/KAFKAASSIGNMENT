<li><b>Delete</b> A well written, if legnthy, explanation of why idiots like me need Quantum Mechanics explained to them in philosophical terms. He's probably right, however, Wikipedia <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> a publisher of original thought. --<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 02:35, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't delete</b> It seems to be a question of how closely one should follow one's sources. I started the article to balance what seems an outdated and error-prone point of view in other Wikipedia articles (and to learn how to teach physics), and it has progressed nicely.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As a compromise, I suggest:</dd>
<dd>Suppose we rename <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">Interpretation of quantum mechanics</a> to History of the interpretation of quantum mechanics, rename this article to "Subtleties of the relation between quantum an classical descriptions of nature", and archive this entire article and re-write it, closer to its text book sources but without plagiarizing?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is good historical material in that other article, but its title, as it is, is misleadingly outdated. Its category would change from physics to history of physics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Part of the objective for the new article should be to help understand entanglement, if possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Text book authors work hard to make it believable to people who did not grow up exposed to quantum mechanics, and maybe there is much more of that quality that can be taken without adhering too closely. This would allow this article to be checked paragraph by paragraph against its sources, as people here want, but would still be representative of a modern view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, I would prefer that this be done incrementally.</dd>
<dd>There are other article with similar outdated classical point of view.</dd>

<li>I would not be opposed to those changes, which could sway my vote. Essentially renaming this as a historical work could certainly increase its overall validity. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 13:08, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>. Can you mention briefly here, and in more depth on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Physics_a4a8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Physics</a>, which articles have an "outdated classical point of view"? We have a decent number of people who know a lot of physics, and I'm sure we can fix 'em up right quick. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 15:55, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>That is a complicated question. For instance, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat.html" title="Schrödinger's cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> has a comment by someone else that its point of view is out of date, and a way to avoid the paradox is a relatively recent addition. The interpretation section in <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> is from a classical point of view, like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">Interpretation of quantum mechanics</a>. That is like discussing electromagnetism from the point of view of geometric optics. I object to the title "Interpretation of quantum mechanics" No-one talks about the "interpretation of wave optics" anymore, as they did near <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christiaan_Huygens_6560.html" title="Christiaan Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a>' time. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

<ul>
<li>I think <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">Interpretation of quantum mechanics</a> is appropriate given what most readers <i>know</i>, and where they expect to find, and that articles should not be titled to make a a point as you're suggesting. I also think it is more appropriate to edit articles you think are wrong than to write a new article on the same subject so that you can treat it the way you want. Hence my merge vote below. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 20:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Several remarks.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) this article appears to be about QM and not classical physics. There is such a thing as the philosophy of classical mechanics, but this article does not appear to actually discuss any of it (Everything I've seen on the philosophy of classical mechanics dealt with the nature of determinism, since solutions to differential equations seem to imply determinism. More recently, that philosophy wanders off to discuss chaotic dynamics. I've never seen it discuss QM). So at a minimum, this article needs to be renamed to philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) This article could be named philosophical failures of classical mechanics if it was enlarged to talk about non-quantum issues, e.g. chaos, or the impact of special/general relativity to classical concepts of time and space. or e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mach_principle.html" title="Mach principle">Mach principle</a>. There's no discussion of the (non-)constancy of constants, (for example, the electric charge varies with distance, or e.g. <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asymptotic_freedom.html" title="Asymptotic freedom">asymptotic freedom</a>) (for example, the speed of light is locally constant, but the amount of time it takes for light to cross a de Sitter universe is something like 3 times the size of the universe, implying that in a certain sense "light slows down" when thought about in a global way, as the universe expands. Locally, the speed of light is just a conversion from time units to space units. Globally it is something quite different.). There's no discussion of mass, where mass comes from, why there's more matter than anti-matter, etc. Why the universe isn't rotating. No discussion of why time is one dimensional but space isn't. No mention of <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaluza-Klein_b6e1.html" title="Kaluza-Klein">Kaluza-Klein</a> theories as alternate conceptions of space and time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) While it does discuss some of the actual issues the differentiate QM from classical, it is written in an 'original research' style. Its a very unusual presentation of only a small subset of the topics that are usually discussed. I won't vote for deletion, but the article has failings as currently structured. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:21, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>In answer to the above 1), I think a better title can be found but it is not "philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics" or "interpretation of quantum mechanics". The probabilities encountered when using an approximation to a theory belong to the approximation and not to the theory, even if it is an approximation without which one cannot get out of bed. I don't argue with 2) 3). Feel free to change the style of my parts of it. I agree with merging and changing the title to something new. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R. Ingham">David R.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wonder exactly why the nominator is calling this original research (this is an honest question, not a veiled attack on the nomination)?

<dl>
<dd>My understanding is that the core of the POV of David R. Ingham, i.e. the core of the article as originally written, pertains to discussions supposedly in Albert Messiah's two volume <b>Quantum Mechanics</b>. Messiah is given as the researcher whose views the article is said to report, but Ingham has not responded to repeated requests to provide the citation. The thought experiment that Messiah supposedly discusses is generally known as Heisenberg's Microscope (Google for many articles that do not support Ingham's account), and it was important in the early development of quantum physics. It pertains to the problems involved in using a photon to measure the position of an electron. Articles and books pertaining to this thought experiment generally provide a diagram. Messiah's book is very well written, and very well indexed. Reading all the materials indexed under "electron" does not uncover the discussion that Ingham claims as the basis for his report. Searching the index for Heisenberg's Microscope provides nothing at all. Scanning the entire book for diagrams related to any experiment in which a photon is bounced off of an electron in an attempt to learn about it also yields no positive results. In the absence of a citation to the assertions that are at the core of the issue, the actual authorship of the assertions appears to rest with Ingham.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the numerous citations, I think I have provided most of them. The several citations I supplied apply only to peripheral issues, to statements of the sort that I would regard almost as common knowledge, and certainly not to the controversial thesis advanced by Ingham. For me, the biggest problem in dealing with this article is that the core article, the material that appears to imply that Greene and other current writers on the subject have it wrong, is extremely unclear. I, for one, cannot help to make it any clearer without a look at the original sources from which this account was derived. Messiah is one source and Ingham's lecture notes from quite some time ago on the account of a university physics professor appear to be the other source -- a source that is quite naturally unavailable. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 02:05, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If my guessimate of the meaning of Ingham's thesis is correct, then this article would be antithetical to another article <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_indeterminacy.html" title="Quantum indeterminacy">Quantum_indeterminacy</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 03:53, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Measuring electrons with photons is in there in Messiah, at least once. I will look where. I had been thinking that looking at new sources would be more useful than arguing about old ones. He uses this example at least to make the point that if one had classical light to measure with, qm would not stand, because the measuring device would violate the uncertainty principle. (Feynman also very briefly mentions this.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If that's all Messiah says then how does it support the contentions that he is supposedly propping up? And where does Feynman make his brief mention, please? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 07:45, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the central issues are that the earlier one accepts qm, the easier it is, from an educational point of view, and that, from an academic point of view, that the most reliable sources for an encyclopedia are usually text books, graduate level in case of dispute—other sources are too hard to sort through and evaluate. (I need advice on how closely they should be followed.) Verbal discussions are good except that arguments about them can't be settled.</dd>
<dd>Accepting these assumptions, the point of view that classical mechanics needs to be described from a quantum point of view and not visa versa will eventually prevail, in some form, whether I persist or not.</dd>
<dd>The next step is to read more recent text books, not to go backward.</dd>
<dd>I do not accept the view that because this is cryptic, to even some physicists, it is inappropriate for the reader who looks this far. One should hear how things really are, in simple words, as soon as possible, even if it takes time to understand. Simplify if you like, but don't write or keep things that are not entirely accurate.</dd>

<li>Wikipedia is not the place to push a non-standard view of how physics should be taught. You arguments suggest that this is original research, on <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedagogy.html" title="Pedagogy">pedagogy</a>, if not on physics. If you want to write an article <i>on</i> an alternate approach to teaching QM, and cite sources, that's one thing; but picking Wikipedia as a ground for trying out a new approach is not what this place is for. I also disagree with your views, but that's a discussion for another forum. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 06:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Userfy</b> (that is, move to a page like User:David R. Ingham/Philosophical interpretation of classical physics). Based on the comments of P0M and, more importantly, David R. Ingham himself, the article is too close to a personal essay for me. Furthermore, the article appears to be a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">content fork</a>, since David prefers creating a separate article instead of fixing (perceived) shortcomings in existing articles. However, obviously much work has gone into the article and we might want to merge some of the material into other articles, though it is not immediately clear to me what we want to merge. That is why I'm not proposing a straightforward delete, but a move outside of the main article space. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 21:15, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't know about your proposed titles. I always hate the dismissive attitude of "xyz for Dummies" books, but your idea in essence is not bad. There are a couple of problem in talking about this kind of stuff. (1) The behavior of things on this very small scale is not what we expect to see. If prisoners in cement block cells were found in some small percentage of cases to "evaporate" from their cells and "materialize" outside the prison wall, we would not even consider any possibility other than that trickery was involved. But that's what electrons can do. (2) The way of talking about things that allows us to even begin to make sense out of things can involve complicated mathematics. But it isn't impossible to talk sensibly about what is going on. Greene's <i>Fabric of the Cosmos</i> does an excellent job. I think the ideal Beginners Guide article would describe some of the basic phenomena and perhaps tell people how to do experiments that would show them some of the weird stuff. Now that laser pointers are available for tens of dollars rather than hundreds of dollars, everybody can make his/her own double-slit apparatus. (I just made one a week or so ago with a plastic box, some nails, and some toy plastic railroad tracks. Since I already had the laser pointer, my out of pocket expenses were $2 to buy the plastic items at the local "dollar store."}</dd>
<dd>Many if not most of the physics articles jump in at or near the deep end of the pool, use undefined symbols in mathematical statements of principles, etc. There is no way for, e.g., a high school student with no calculus and nothing more than a general science course in hand to have the foggiest idea of what is going on.</dd>
<dd>Probably there needs to be consideration of this issue on the "project" level.</dd>

<dd>The part of that article on measurement is incomprehensible. I have no trouble with Reichenbach, Messiah, Pauli, Greene..., but I have no idea what is being asserted there. I think I have found the part of Messiah's textbook that was given as authority, but it does not even suggest answers to my questions. There may be people here who know what he is talking about because they know the subject so well that undefined terms and terms that are wikified to explanations that do not apply in context of that paragraph will nevertheless be clear to them. So I am going to put my comments on the discussion page to <b>this</b> page. Maybe somebody will be able to clear things up. If not, it will be clear evidence of what is wrong with the argument. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 14:11, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "radical" didactic principle is that one should stick to the real facts when simplifying, even if people get less of a feeling of understanding at the time they read it, because unlearning is harder than learning. For a physics article in an encyclopedia, this means avoiding physics from popular sources that can't be justified with references to high level text books. I have illustrated this by an example of an error in <i>Physics Today</i> caused by not following this principle.</dd>
<dd>The least I may have accomplished is to call people's attention to this. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R. Ingham">David R. Ingham</a> 11:59, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the topic can not be explained at all without the use of jargon that is not accessible to reasonably intelligent people then the article needs to be edited to remove the jargon or removed. No one has claimed that we have to use "popular sources" only that the material be sufficiently explained and that it be notable enough to be referenceable. For example, only recently have you even identified the thesis of the article, "Philosophical interpretation of classical physics is a discussion of the spurious content in the classical description." (I think that is the intended thesis - correct me if I misunderstood).</dd>
<dd>The reason I am even spending time on this is because I do think that the idea that I think the article wants to convey is very interesting. I.e. that classical physics was so pervasive in our society and thinking that it influenced other disciplines in unexpected ways. Additionally, because the extrapolations of classical physics were not correct in their predictions QM was developed. Unfortunately, however, the influence of classical physics on other disciplines did not completely disappear when QM was introduced and other disciplines still make assumptions based on classical physics that have since been proven to not properly describe nature. If this can be explained well then <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_interpretation_of_classical_physics.html" title="Philosophical interpretation of classical physics">PICP</a> will be an excellent article. <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 12:41, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think a lot of the article makes a lot of sense. Basically it states that since we still insist on Newtonian mechanics which is flawed at the atomic level to describe experiments and what we measure, a probabilistic description is what we obtain. If we also knew the exact quantum state of our measuring equipment there would be no probabilities. I guess if there is a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen_interpretation.html" title="Copenhagen interpretation">Copenhagen interpretation</a>, then this article is also justified as an alternate interpretation and possible way out of the measuring problem. I wouldn't say there is any original research since it is a completely obvious alternative. I would like a better title like .... interpretation of quantum mechanics. Merging with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">Interpretation of quantum mechanics</a> is also acceptable. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 10:51, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Changed my vote to "userfy." I suspect that the author was trying to say something in the original core of the article that may be worthwhile. If it were put in clear mathematics complemented by clear Engish, then there would be a fair basis for deciding what it means and whether it is at least the point of view on or interpretation of somebody like Bohm.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 03:41, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And changed it again, assuming that the article is what is left of the original after William M. Conolley's edit. If the original author had a contribution to make, despite his difficulties in communicating, that contribution has been eroded away. Of what is left, there is nothing that should not have been well covered elsewhere. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 20:09, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just hacked most of it out and replaced it with my own interpretation, which is hopefully the mainstream one, though I'm open to correction. It could do with more by experts.

<dd>I agree with Karol, basically. The original article <b>seemed</b> to have something to say about aspects of QM that may fail to get adequate coverage in popularizations like Amir D. Aezel's <i>Entanglement</i>. Now there is nothing that is not already in other QM articles. If there was anything of value hidden in the original article behind the extremely muddy writing, it exists only in the history of the article now. I tried very hard, spending probably 30 hours reading my collection of physics books that goes back to the 60s, trying to get a line onto what he was really trying to communicate. I tried many times in many ways to get Ingham to give citations or clarifications. All of this I did in the hope we would not come to the point where anything of value would be edited away as incomprehensible. That's why I think the original article should be recovered from history and userfied. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 15:27, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
