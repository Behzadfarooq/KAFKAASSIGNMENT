<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - History is something I see on Wikipedia all the time. Why discriminate what kind of history we're looking at? That's ridiculous. Pissy people who don't like the way the page was written simply need to add their own little piece, or talk to the people who DID make it and talk to thema bout it. You people who want to delete it are people who think you matter more than you really do. Just because it's new doesn't mean you have ANY right to try and squash it down.

<li>Documenting a history on our own constitutes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original research</a>, and isn't really our place. We need to let journalists and historians document the events, and then we synthesize their documentation into a summary. Since there's no basis of journalism or historical works about the Zelda fan community, there's no possible way we can do that with this article.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 07:35, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not a page about webforums, but instead describes the broad collection of sites and other mediums that the Zelda fan community exists in. In fact, the only times forums were mentioned was in addition to another, more relevant fact. I admit the article is rather new and underdeveloped, but that is no reason for deletion, but instead renovation. There is currently some dialogue within the talk page to figure out what needs to be done. If you guys feel the article contains certain violations, such as linkspam, those can be dealt with for sure, but the article itself serves a legitimate purpose. --Major Organ 04:33, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I never stated it was a <i>list</i> of sites, but rather the history of an expansive community (or will be). As stated elsewhere, we're discussing how to rework the article in order to include notable events and moments in the history of the community instead of giving a summary of large sites to decrease the chance of spam. I also believe it is a notable enough community to pass the "indiscriminate collection of information" test. There are multiple Star Wars fan articles, and Zelda is notable enough for atleast a general overview. We will try and work on making it more encyclopedic. We just the time. --Major Organ 18:00, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Somebody used the Wikipedia is not a keeper of indiscriminate information argument. I read it over, and nowhere does it say "history" is unacceptable. I find that argument rather weak as the own definition does not specifically say "history". Just to point out - a hoax about a fake video game The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga has survived a AfD, and I swear that has less relevance than the history of one of the biggest fan communities on the internet. It is obvious the people voting for deletion are 1) Biased against this article because they are non-fans or 2)Believe fan works have absolutely no merit in the referential realm to warrant an entry in this site. There is an extensive history of Star Wars fan culture page, even more specific down to categories of works. The Legend of Zelda fan community is a phenomenom and a pop-culture icon status, not just a blantant advertising article which has no profound meaning. I concede the current version is not very reflective of that, but if this article was given more time to develop into something better, I believe the article would have better standing on this site. Sometimes I feel Wiki is more of an <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oligarchy.html" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a> because there seems to be a faction who decides what stays and what goes, especially in the Zelda articles, and it baffles me as to the logic sometimes. Not to be too self-righteous and full of myself, but how the hell did a Zelda hoax The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga remain and the article somebody made for GANNON-BANNED was deleted? The latter has more impact and presence and importance in the realm of Zelda than the hoax. Sorry to go off on a tangent, but I feel part of these AfD are personal grudges against me, whic is totally unprofessional and crap. Again, my argument - I do not get how the history of one of the biggest fan communities, not just any community, does not count as suitable material for this site. We can provide original research without a POV, and we can provide published citations from credible sources if you give us time. You are judging this article on its infancy, when the future version will turn out to meet Wiki's standards. But you are resolving this article to a Catch 22 - there is no way it can start off perfect and totally conforming to Wiki's standards - it needs time to get to that point. I never got the AfD after such a short time. Wiki's guidelines need to be ammended to either have AfSP, or AfD after a timeframe of significance to allow the article suitable time to develop into a proper Wiki article. But I'm sure this will get deleted. Perhaps it will be put at a more deserving place than Wiki. --TSA 17:29, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> if this does get deleted, perhaps <a href="http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Zeldawiki</a> would welcome your contributions TSA. You could always transwiki this over there before the close of AfD if you are concerned this is going to be deleted from Wikipedia. As for The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga, I'm not familiar enough with this particular case, but I know in some instances, hoaxes have been kept because they were so pervasive that they become notable simply for being a hoax. Again, I don't know enough about the specifics of The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga to say if this was the reasoing for keep opinions on that particular AfD. That article could use a rewrite though.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, and <b>move</b> to a better title. A well-documented and detailed discussion of Zelda fan sites on the web is a notable topic worthy of inclusion, as quite a few of them have been notable in their own right, pulling in millions of hits, as well as their interaction. They were more important and centralized in the earlier days and are an interesting aspect of the early web. Finally, no one around is more qualified to document this stuff than TSA. I don't agree with everything TSA says, here or elsewhere, but I think this is an important topic. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 17:34, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Amending my comments: TSA didn't actually do most of the writing in this article, didn't mean to convey that, but he does review it regularly. Also, I think this article is a great place to merge articles about Zelda websites that aren't notable enough on their own. I'd suggest "merge into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_209c.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series">The Legend of Zelda series</a>", but it's just too large a topic for adequate coverage in the space of that page. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 17:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> as this is an important subject that many surely care about. I don't have much knowledge of the history of the fan community, so this is useful, and it is not a collection of facts, but rather a helpful page with good info. <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScepia_1657.html" title="User:Scepia">Scepia</a> 21:10, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - entirely unreferenced, and not particularly notable. For pretty much every game or franchise there's some sort of fandom out there; the real question is whether it's sizable and active enough to take note of. This doesn't appear to be the case for Zelda, judging by the article. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 07:06, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
