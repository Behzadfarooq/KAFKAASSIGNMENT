<li><b>Comment</b> Appearing on <i>SLAM</i> does carry some weight. I read the magazine from time to time, and the letters page is consistently filled with comments about the covers. Some of the images are quite popular (like <a href="http://slamonline.com/online/2006/08/slam-32/" class="external text" title="http://slamonline.com/online/2006/08/slam-32/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>). I don't know if any of this justifies the article's existence, but it's wrong to say that the magazine isn't known for its covers. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 22:32, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The question would be whether there are independent reliable sources attesting to the notability of the covers that would override the directory concerns. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:52, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "Wikipedia also includes reference tables and tabular information for quick reference." As far as the covers being "notable," see for example <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyNjkmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTU3NTU0NDUmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2" class="external text" title="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyNjkmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTU3NTU0NDUmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where "Unlike his American teenage counterparts, Krstic understood a 6-foot-11 center needs to do more than just dunk and preen for his Slam Magazine cover shot." --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:43, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That someone mentioned the magazine in a single sentence in a much larger article is a trivial reference of the sort that does not establish notability. Is being on the cover of SLAM magazine the subject of a substantial or multiple non-trivial sources? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:34, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree; the source makes it clear that being on the cover of Slam Magazine is considered an achievement for basketball players. Here's another source, <a href="http://cbs.sportsline.com/print/collegebasketball/story/7210272" class="external text" title="http://cbs.sportsline.com/print/collegebasketball/story/7210272" rel="nofollow">"Young Huskies pick SLAM over SI"</a>: "We were on the cover of SLAM magazine and other magazines with Emeka (Okafor) on the cover," Brown said. Coach Jim Calhoun interrupted, pointing out that older folks might have mentioned other publications. "Just out of curiosity, it wasn't Sports Illustrated, it was SLAM magazine," Calhoun said. "When you've made SLAM magazine, Taliek, you've made it?" "Yeah, you've made it," Brown said. "SLAM magazine is hip-hop, it's big top for us young boys."--<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:50, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That is still what amounts to a relatively trivial mention. It's a couple of paragraphs out of a much larger piece and even if one accepts it as non-trivial, <i>multiple</i> non-trivial sources are required and even then, while that may mean that an article on the topic of appearing on the cover <i>might</i> have some encyclopedic value that does not mean that a bare list of people who appeared on the cover does. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:58, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, from the February 15, 2004, Indianapolis Star, "Whatever it is that constitutes superstardom, Indiana Pacers forward Jermaine O'Neal has attained it. His jersey is spotted throughout a recent video by the rap group State Property. He has recently been featured on the cover of Slam magazine ..." From the April 27, 2001, New York Times, "In Sydney, [Vince] Carter had changed into a preening, angry young poser, intent on showing the world he was worthy of a Slam magazine cover." It seems clear from these sources that making the cover of SLAM Magazine is of some importance. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:15, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, actually, it doesn't seem all that clear. A single-sentence mention of the magazine cover in a long piece is not a non-trivial mention. The people on the cover may well be notable, but they are not notable <i>because they are on the cover.</i> A story that mentions in passing that someone was on the cover of a magazine does not establish that a bare list of the people on the magazine is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:33, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. There does not yet seem to be much consensus about lists. I think part of the reason is that it is inherently much more difficult to set criteria for establishing a notable connection between the items on a list. The citations above create a good faith argument that there is some significance attached to appearing on the cover of the magazine, so that this list rises above a mere directory of information. Also, the list is sufficiently defined in scope to be manageable and is not based on original research. The list doesn't have much value to me personally, but without a clear reason to delete, I default to weak keep.--<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11pt"><a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i></span> 22:51, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
