<li><b>I Am getting so SICK</b> of that frinkin ESSAY that people keep sourcing!!! It says right on top: <b>This is an essay. It is not a policy or guideline, it simply reflects some opinions of its authors. Please update the page as needed, or discuss it on the talk page.</b> I am seriously getting sick of people sourcing other wikipedia ESSAYS for things in deletion. Give me a <b>DEFINITIVE</b> Policy that says "Such-and-such is able to be deleted because it's not on Amazon" or "It has few hits on google", or "The article is crap and needs to be deleted" (I have SEEN that one, in which case an AfD is NOT appropriate, a rewrite is. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikedal_6e99.html" title="User:Vikedal">Vikedal</a> 06:03, 22 February 2007 (UTC) (If you wanna complain, do it on my talk page.)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into main webcomic article until game is actually released at the very least. I still have doubts about it, it cites a forum and says it's a "canonical game by fans" which is a direct contradiction and it has images that are not discussed in the article. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:40, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Once again</b>: Canonical just means "Considered to be a part of overall continuity". I could, for example, Make a spinnoff (Let's go with The Wotch: Cheer!). It can be considered "Fan-made Canon" iff (Not a misspelling, means If and Only If) I Get the Main comic Author to run over everything and approve it. The same goes for the Halo series of books (Cite: OXM, Winter '06, the one with the Halo: Ghosts of Onyx Preview in it). They are considered Fan-made Canon simply because they are NOT made by Bungie, But the writer (In 3 of 4 cases, Eric Nylund) Got approval for the storyline from Bungie, to make sure it was in Continuity with the Halo Storyline. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikedal_6e99.html" title="User:Vikedal">Vikedal</a> 05:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Citing an essay to prove your point doesn't really do anything! You are using a policy ie <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for a webcomic! That holds little context to this case as a webcomic by its nature is different from large well known websites like yahoo.com or smaller more select ones like effingpot.com. Webcomics need different definitions just as movies in pre-production have special clarifications as movies that have been released. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 02:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Possibly you haven't read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li>I really don't mean for this to sound rude... but have you read the page?

<li>You don't need to shout, <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a>. As it happens, I responded to your own comment about the applicability of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> to webcomics.

<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> You're pretty much saying that "Hey, it hasn't been released, and google/amazon don't care, so it's not notable" to most of the webcomic AfD's i've seen. Have a look at what's happening here. If Halo 3 didn't have the fanbase, it would have no google or amazon hits, thus making it "Not Notable" and AfD'able, which i'm sure some game-hating NUT would do. Give it some time, because the whole point of Wikipedia is to be an encyclopedia, and this one definitely helped me out on some aspects of the game (Beforehand, i had no clue what the game was about).<a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikedal_6e99.html" title="User:Vikedal">Vikedal</a> 05:54, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>You are quite correct: if noone had ever bought or even released Halo 2, the article on Halo 3 would be deletable. If no one had ever read or done a production of Shakespeare, his article and the article on his works would better be deleted as well. But what kind of argument is that? Halo 3 <i>is</i> notable, the article is referenced to reliable sources (part of them independent ssecondary sources), and this is one of these cases where you know that the game will be reviewed extensively, whether it is brilliant or it sucks. On the other hand, this is a game where little is known and nothing is written by independent reliable sources, and it is doubtful if even if it would ever be released, such reviews would appear anyway. If that does happen however, and this game does get notability, then nothing stops you from creating an article for it. An encyclopedia is not supposed to give you information on everything because it may one day become notable (every kid may one day become notable), but because it is already notable, whether it is already released or not. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:16, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Congratulations, <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikedal_6e99.html" title="User:Vikedal">Vikedal</a>, you've gotten it.
