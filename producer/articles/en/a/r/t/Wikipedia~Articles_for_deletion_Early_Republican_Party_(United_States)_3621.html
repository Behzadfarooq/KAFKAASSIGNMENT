<li><b>KEEP Jeffersonian Republican Party</b> - I think this is the most unambiguous name for the party in the first-party system that developed in opposition to the Hamiltonian Federalists. It is apparently also a name with considerable currency. The other proposals are not as clear and D-R has confused people and been contested here for years. Delete both others --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 20:29, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>JimWae: the important thing is to keep the article history currently residing at <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party (United States)</a> and eliminate the two article clones whose history started yesterday. Once that is done, then the article can be moved to whatever title we can reach a consensus on. — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> (<a href="../../../d/l/j/User_talk%7EDLJessup_a6a0.html" title="User talk:DLJessup">talk</a>) 21:15, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, by all means, yes --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 04:59, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep all three and direct Jeffersonian Republican Party to Early Republican Party</b> -The early Republican Party was a seperate party from the two break away parties Dem-Rep &amp; Nat-Rep. If you want to view all of them as a continuation party with no breaks, then you can do that too. But, there was a split -right? And that split resulted in two parties with a different name than the former -right?

<ul>
<li>To put it briefly, wrong. The party before the breakup had many names, including DR and NR. But even if this were right, the PoV forks and cut-and paste jobs should be deleted. Whether the original article should be moved is another question. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:20, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note to administrator who cleans this up</b>: Currently <a href="../../../e/a/r/Talk%7EEarly_Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_46b0.html" title="Talk:Early Republican Party (United States)">Talk:Early Republican Party (United States)</a> is the actual talk page that belongs to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party (United States)</a>. Due to the cut-and-paste moves, I erroneously believed that the talk page had been left behind in one of the moves and moved it to the wrong place. I can no longer move the talk page back to its original location, although I have created a Requested Move. Please make sure that this talk page is moved before deleting this article. Thank you. — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> (<a href="../../../d/l/j/User_talk%7EDLJessup_a6a0.html" title="User talk:DLJessup">talk</a>) 21:59, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Note</b>: Vegaswikian just moved the talk page; so that's taken care of. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 22:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Exactly. This is why the page nominated should be deleted rather than redirected: too much potential confusion. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 22:11, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I would suggest the AfDs be put on hold until the cleanup and requested moves have been made. Right now, at first glance, I see articles about the Republican Party being put up for deletion (questionable on its face, you must admit), people adding articles second-hand for deletion and a revert war in the history of at least one article. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 01:02, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All these are efforts to contain the disruptive edits of User:Nikpapag by several editors. The articles put up for deletion are forks, which Nikpapag created by cuts and pastes, of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party (United States)</a>. This is the party of Jefferson and Madison, which broke up in 1824, not the present Republican party. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 03:34, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffersonian_Republican_Party_1427.html" title="Jeffersonian Republican Party">Jeffersonian Republican Party</a> was first made into a cut-and-paste by <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> at 06:52, 20 September 2006 (UTC). The page already existed as a redirect which Rjensen overlaid with a copy of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party (United States)</a>. Nikpapag <i>created</i> <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_0b78.html" title="Early Republican Party (United States)">Early Republican Party (United States)</a> as a clone of his preferred version of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party (United States)</a> about 8 hours later, at 14:43, 20 September 2006 (UTC). — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> (<a href="../../../d/l/j/User_talk%7EDLJessup_a6a0.html" title="User talk:DLJessup">talk</a>) 12:24, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Another comment</b>: The Democratic-Republican Party was, prior to Jackson, known simply as the Republican Party. We may consider that separate articles (for Democratic-Republican Party and Early Republican Party) may well be appropriate. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 04:00, 21 September 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi
<ul>
<li>This claim is disputable, and is being discussed on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Talk%7EEarly_Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_46b0.html" title="Talk:Early Republican Party (United States)">Talk:Early Republican Party (United States)</a>; but it is peripheral to this AfD. Editors on both sides of that discussion have reverted Nikpapag's edits, which are simple mischief, and interfere with the discussion. These three pages are the same article; two of them have Nikpapag's unsourced claims that Jackson belonged to the "Democrat Republican Party" [<i>sic</i>]. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 05:18, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> the fork. The closing admin can clean up the mess. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlameless_24ae.html" title="User:Blameless"><small>blameless</small></a> 20:33, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Only compounds an already confusing nomenclature. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 15:22, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
