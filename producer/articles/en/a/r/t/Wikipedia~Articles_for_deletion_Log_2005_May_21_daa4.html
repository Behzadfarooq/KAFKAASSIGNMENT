<li><b>Question</b>. I'm puzzled. This may have been intended as advertising (I can't read the mind of the author), but if so I see nothing blatant about the advertising, even in the version immediately previous to Wolf530's addition of a VfD tag. It could be that the company is insignificant, but that's a different issue (or arguably a non-issue).

<dd>Perhaps blatant is too strong a word. But considering the tone of the article touting the company's "rapid growth" and then the inclusion of the website URL, seems to me like the company has little need for an encyclopedia article at this present stage unless someone can provide us some information that makes this company unique enough to be listed on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf530_e94b.html" title="User:Wolf530">Wolf530</a> 00:56, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This isn't a blatant advertisement in my book at this stage.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Being a Baltimore resident, I am familiar with the label Everything records. I also attest that this label was present before it was "founded" on Wikipedia, as I am an acquaintance with the founder. Must there be a fancy website to show proof? Yes, the label is small and open-source, but the persons that have voted for deletion are simply not informed. As the internet is the only frame of reference for many people to conduct research on an article within Wikipedia, I understand how administrators might feel if a primarily electronic and computer-music record label does not have a notable website to display capitalist ideals. I stress that deletion of this article would symbolize the non-observation of a documented fact. I have walked into a store, albeit only in Baltimore at the time, and purchased music produced by this label. I have seen their studio, I have handed out flyers for performances. They exist, and not because of Wikipedia. The founder is merely attempting to provide this site with factual information. I comprehend WHY some would wish to delete this article, but again, I stress that decision comes from the inability to locate convenient urls for Everything Records and endless caches of online-music purchases from the label. <i>....posted at 02:02, 2005 May 25 by Pyramidman a new username whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Pyramidman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Pyramidman" rel="nofollow">contributions</a> have been extraordinarily limited.</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> no evidence of notability, aside from issues of vanity articles and using wikipedia as a hosting service.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Per earlier comments above, yes I agree Everything Records exists. But, there are several people/groups who think they are the one, true Everything Records. See <a href="http://www.absolutely.net/music/uk_new_releases_in_pop.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.absolutely.net/music/uk_new_releases_in_pop.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (see album Something Borrowed) and <a href="http://www.motherbuster.com/mullismixes/evrthing.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.motherbuster.com/mullismixes/evrthing.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Aghost found his version of Everything Records here on Wikipedia, which is not a hosting service, and something that was founded on 20 May of this year has hardly been in existence long enough to be considered notable. Aghost similarly founded Free Online University on Wikipedia. That article was put up for deletion, and it lost. See [Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Free_Online_University]. This project is little different. I don't think we should be taking the stance that anything made/edited by Aghost should be ruthlessly hunted down and deleted. I do think we should fairly and judiciously apply Wikipedia's policies. In this case, it seems very clear this article should be deleted based on Wikipedia policies. If, however, the article were re-written to be about a considerably more notable Everything Records, then we perhaps consider keeping it. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 02:38, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>There are many conflicting claims in this discussion and little <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> evidence. On the strict vote count, I find 8 clear "delete" votes, 8 "keep" votes (three had to be discounted as such new accounts that they can not be reliably differentiated from <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> accounts), one that was too ambiguous to call and one explicit "userfy" vote.</p>
<p>I was unable to substantiate most of the claims made by the "keep" voters. Even after reading through the comments and opinions presented, it is not clear to me that this person does in fact meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines.</p>
<p>Further, it is unclear whether the subject of this article participated in edits to the article or not. Someone using the subject's name for a username <i>did</i> create an account just in time to participate in this discussion (and has not been back since). Based on the pattern of edits, I have a suspicion that the account may itself be a sockpuppet. I have so far been unable to confirm or exclude that hypothesis. If the subject did participate in either the editing of the article or this discussion, please note that such participation is <b>strongly</b> discouraged. Wikipedia has two inviolate rules - articles must be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> and must be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Both those objectives are exponentially harder when the subject of a biography is participating.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion to override the strict vote count on this decision. Noting that <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhonnor_2922.html" title="User:Khonnor">user:khonnor</a> contains nothing more than a link to this article (and was created <i>after</i> this discussion was started), I am going to move the article to his user space.

<li><b>Keep</b> Khonnor is a notable, and becoming more and more so, musician. He complies with <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> #4 for having his release “Handwriting” featured/reviewed in over thirty publications, including more wide-known New York Times, NME, and Pitchfork Media. Not to mention being the feature in an episode of MTVe produced documentary series This Is Our Music. Wouldn’t MTV be considered the most prominent music media powerhouse? He also follows under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> #6. Being notable in IDM is very iffy, seeing as IDM has become quite a general term. When artists from Aphex Twin and µ-Ziq to Telefon Tel Aviv and Boards of Canada have been considered IDM -- it is almost as general as the term “alternative” or “indie.” He is, however, notable in the netlabel scene. Netlabels, although exist almost exclusively in digital format, may not seem tangible, but are definitely quite prominent. With three releases as Grandma on Monotonik, one release on 8Bit Peoples as I, Cactus and others (including Clown Connecktion, although I am not completely sure that is him). And now with a “physical” release on a “real” music label, although not a netlabel, would deem that he is quite a musician. Having over five decent releases, with a good-sized fanbase of listeners, how does any of this not make Khonnor a musician and notable for being on Wikipedia? If anything, his stub should be expanded. --Jordan Burman 09:13, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm not the creator of Wolfing Food or any spurious entries of any kind. Nor am I "health-mad" (although I confess to quoting Gary Null below). However, I am very much determined to alert the public to the symptoms of caffeinism, which I had two years ago. Within 9 months of starting a 1-3 cup a day coffee habit, I went from excellent health to psychosis, walking around with my eyes glazed over and my arms stiff at my sides. I was about 90% oblivious to the symptoms engulfing me: anxiety, restless legs, chattiness, euphoria, disorientation and delusions (including, on one occasion, paranoia and hostility). I came very close to going on heavy meds and being institutionalized, after living 30 years rarely taking more than an aspirin for anything.</p>
<p>Since withdrawing my symptoms have vanished entirely and my former health has returned. I've spoken with many others who had the same experience, and several doctors well enough educated in toxicology or immunology to diagnose it, and see their patients' health restored.</p>
<p>I believe it should remain under "caffeinism" based on the currency of the term in medical circles. "Caffeine overdose" implies an acute, one-time episode (like popping a dozen Vivarin). But caffeinism, in its most insidious form, is a chronic condition that mimics manic depression, schizophrenia and a host of other ills that last for years--and are treated not with stomach pumps but pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>The following are just a few of the many alarming statements about caffeinism by psychiatrists, toxicologists and MDs, scattered throughout the medical literature. Many more are added weekly to the Experts page at the nonprofit Web site I'm building,<a href="http://www.CaffeineWeb.com/Experts" class="external text" title="http://www.CaffeineWeb.com/Experts" rel="nofollow">CaffeineWeb.com</a>, where anyone can click on links to the original sources:</p>
<p><br />
<b>DC Mackay and JW Rollins, "Caffeine and caffeinism," <i>Journal of the Royal Naval Medical Service,</i>1989;75(2):65-7:</b> "[When caffeine is taken in excess], anxiety-related symptoms become increasingly apparent. A case of caffeinism, which presented as a paranoid delusion, is reported as an extreme example of this. A study of 60 hospital inpatients revealed that about 40% of them consumed sufficient caffeine to produce symptoms of caffeinism. It is thus recommended that all patients should be questioned on their caffeine intake. Also, caffeinism should be considered as a differential diagnosis of anxiety states."</p>
<p><br />
<b>L Tondo and N Rudas, "The course of a seasonal bipolar disorder influenced by caffeine," <i>Journal of Affective Disorders:</i></b> "A longitudinal case report shows a sudden remission of the severe course of a seasonal bipolar disorder after 10 years of psychopharmacological treatments. The discontinuation of heavy caffeine intake appears to have contributed to the outcome."</p>
<p><br />
<i><b>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV):</b></i> "The 4 caffeine-induced psychiatric disorders include caffeine intoxication, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, caffeine-induced sleep disorder, and caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified (NOS)."</p>
<p><br />
<b>Drs. JE James and KP Stirling, in <i>The British Journal of Addiction:</i></b> "Although infrequently diagnosed, caffeinism is thought to afflict as many as one person in ten of the population."</p>
<p><br />
<b>Clinical nutritionist Stephen Cherniske, Author, <i>Caffeine Blues: Wake Up to the Dangers of America's #1 Drug</i>:</b> "For five years I worked in a team practice with physicians and psychotherapists. Often, the psychological evaluation would include one or more anxiety syndromes, and the recommendation was for counseling. I would point out that the person was consuming excessive amounts of caffeine and request a trial month off caffeine prior to therapy sessions. In about 50% of cases, the anxiety syndrome would resolve with caffeine withdrawal alone."</p>
<p>"In over a decade of practice as a clinical nutritionist, I have seen firsthand, with thousands of clients, that caffeine is a health hazard. Anxiety, muscle aches, PMS, headaches....However, if that's all caffeine has done to you, you're lucky. What about people misdiagnosed as neurotic or even psychotic, who spend years and small fortunes in psychotherapy--all because no one asked them about their caffeine intake?"</p>
<p><br />
<b>Roland R. Griffiths, Ph.D, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Professor of Behavioral Biology, Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences; Professor of Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience; Formerly Research Chief, Department of Psychiatry, Baltimore City Hospitals, Baltimore, MD:</b> "The potential for caffeine intoxication to cause clinically significant distress is reflected by the inclusion of caffeine intoxication as a diagnosis in <i>DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>)(American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and in <i>ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Edition</i>)(World Health Organization). Caffeine intoxication has long been recognized as a discrete syndrome associated with excessive caffeine use. <b>Caffeinism is an older term that has been used to describe the toxic effects of caffeine resulting from acute or chronic use.</b> Caffeine intoxication is currently defined by a number of symptoms and clinical features that emerge in response to recent consumption of caffeine. Common features of caffeine intoxication include nervousness (anxiety), restlessness, excitement, insomnia, rambling flow of thought and speech, gastrointestinal upset, tremors, tachycardia, diuresis, muscle twitching, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomotor agitation. In addition, there have been reports of patients with caffeine intoxication having fever, irritability, tremors, sensory disturbances, tachypnea, and headaches."</p>
<p><br />
<b>Ruth Whalen, MLT, "How Much Mental Illness Is an Allergy to Caffeine?":</b> "Caffeine toxicity may be mistaken for bipolar disorder. Symptoms include: chattiness, repetitive thought and action (resembling obsessive compulsive disorder), restlessness, psychomotor agitation, alternating moods, anger, impulsiveness, aggression, omnipotence, delirium, buying sprees, lack of sexual inhibition, and loss of values. Toxicity is known to cause excitement, agitation, restlessness, shifting states of consciousness, and toxic psychosis, mimicking amphetamine psychosis. Allergic individuals may be erroneously diagnosed, medicated, and lost in a dark disturbed world, until death."</p>
<p><br />
<b>Dr. Sidney Kaye, Institute of Legal Medicine:</b> "The symptoms vary with acquired or inborn tolerance, but in general the patients may complain of [among other symptoms] nervousness, restlessness, silliness, elation, euphoria, confusion, disorientation, excitation, and even violent behavior with wild, inanic screaming, kicking and biting, progressing to semi-stupor."</p>
<p>"Coffee overindulgence is overlooked many times because the bizarre symptoms may resemble and masquerade as an organic or mental disease....But what a feeling of relief to both physician and patient to see the symptoms completely disappear on the physician's order to stop drinking coffee."</p>
<p><br />
<b>Sanford Bolton, PhD, and Gary Null, M.S., in the <i>Journal of Orthomolecular Psychiatry</i>:</b> "Caffeinism may result in a syndrome which resembles and may be confused or confounded with true psychotic states. This may lead to misdiagnosis and mistreatment. A question arises from the varied reports of caffeine consumption in psychiatric populations: Does caffeine stimulate psychosis or does psychosis stimulate caffeine consumption?"</p>
<p><br />
<b>Calvin Thrash, MD, Author, <i>Food Allergies Made Simple</i>:</b> "Thousands are in mental institutions today because of no greater matter than that of the use of caffeine. Psychiatrists are now publishing articles indicating that there are numerous cases of depression and anxiety in mental institutions, who need no other treatment than to be taken off caffeine.</p>
<p>"However, the use of caffeine is so traditional and firmly entrenched that it is almost impossible to remove caffeinated drinks from the diet of patients in mental institutions. Soft drink machines, coffee dispensers, and the traditional coffee break are common pastimes in mental institutions, and with those who are mentally ill at home."</p>
<p><br />

<p><b>Drs. JE James and KP Stirling, in <i>The British Journal of Addiction:</i></b> "Although infrequently diagnosed, caffeinism is thought to afflict as many as one person in ten of the population."</p>
<p><b>Clinical nutritionist Stephen Cherniske, Author, <i>Caffeine Blues: Wake Up to the Dangers of America's #1 Drug</i>:</b> "What about people misdiagnosed as neurotic or even psychotic, who spend years and small fortunes in psychotherapy--all because no one asked them about their caffeine intake?"</p>
<p><b>Ruth Whalen, MLT, "How Much Mental Illness Is an Allergy to Caffeine?":</b> "Caffeine toxicity may be mistaken for bipolar disorder....Allergic individuals may be erroneously diagnosed, medicated, and lost in a dark disturbed world, until death."</p>
<p><b>Dr. Sidney Kaye, Institute of Legal Medicine:</b> "Coffee overindulgence is overlooked many times because the bizarre symptoms may resemble and masquerade as an organic or mental disease....But what a feeling of relief to both physician and patient to see the symptoms completely disappear on the physician's order to stop drinking coffee."</p>
<p><b>Sanford Bolton, PhD, and Gary Null, M.S., in the <i>Journal of Orthomolecular Psychiatry</i>:</b> "Caffeinism may result in a syndrome which resembles and may be confused or confounded with true psychotic states. This may lead to misdiagnosis and mistreatment. A question arises from the varied reports of caffeine consumption in psychiatric populations: Does caffeine stimulate psychosis or does psychosis stimulate caffeine consumption?"</p>
<p><b>Calvin Thrash, MD, Author, <i>Food Allergies Made Simple</i>:</b> "Thousands are in mental institutions today because of no greater matter than that of the use of caffeine. Psychiatrists are now publishing articles indicating that there are numerous cases of depression and anxiety in mental institutions, who need no other treatment than to be taken off caffeine."</p>
<p><b>Following is the full text of a letter by Dan Stradford published last month on BMJ.com (formerly <i>British Medical Journal</i>), with commentary by psychiatrist and neurologist Stuart Shipko, M.D., founder and director of the Panic Disorder Institute:</b></p>
<p>"The failure to do full medical screenings on psychiatric patients is one of the greatest areas of neglect in modern medicine. Studies have repeatedly shown for years that psychiatric populations have more medical ailments than non-psychiatric patients. No one disputes this. And most of those same studies also show that <b>a healthy percentage of psychiatric patients are routinely misdiagnosed with mental illness (and often placed on psychotropics for years or for life), when they, in fact, have medical problems causing or exacerbating their psychiatric symptoms.</b> No one disputes this either.</p>
<p>The landmark 1980 study by Richard Hall et al ("Physical Illness Manifesting as Psychiatric Disease", <i>Arch Gen Psychiatry</i>, 1980, 37: 989- 995) found <b>46% of the psychiatric patients thoroughly examined had physical ailments causing or exacerbating their mental symptoms.</b></p>
<p>The California legislature was so shocked by this study, it ordered research, headed by Dr. Lorrin Koran of Stanford University, on how to improve the quality of medical exams in psychiatric settings. The result of that study was the "Medical Evaluation Field Manual," which sets a minimal standard for medical screenings and provides an efficient algorithm when full screenings are not practical.</p>
<p>The manual was distributed to all of California's counties in the late 1980s and <b>NONE of them implemented it.</b> A dozen years later, my nonprofit organization, Safe Harbor, has asked for and received a grant to work on getting this manual implemented.</p>
<p>We have posted the Field Manual on the internet at www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/fieldmanual.htm.</p>
<p>What concerns me is that I--a layman--and a group of volunteers is having to grab the psychiatric profession by the scruff of the neck to get them to examine their own patients! This does not speak well for the profession or for its organizations, such as the American and British Psychiatric Associations....</p>
<p>This medical negligence cannot continue. I would like to issue a call to medical professionals to, once and for all, set and keep minimal medical screening standards for psychiatric patients so that this easily remedied medical neglect exists no more."</p>
<p><b>Response by Stuart Shipko, M.D., psychiatrist, neurologist, founder and director of the Panic Disorder Institute:</b> "This is so true. A long time ago when I actively practiced general medicine I was the doctor who did physical examinations on patients confined to a mental ward. I found that the labwork showed excessive abnormalities of calcium, sodium and chloride. I diligently worked up these abnormalities, but concluded that the abnormalities were due to problems in blood testing. To present this to the quality assurance committee, I reviewed the charts of the previous 50 admissions and showed the cluster of abnormalities. The response? They wanted to know what my motives were and why I cared. The fact that it was my job to care went over their heads. <b>Medical evaluation of the 'mentally ill' is pretty much nonexistent."</b> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianinNYC_0ddb.html" title="User:BrianinNYC">BrianinNYC</a> 13:23, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Neologism. Self-promotion. The vast majority of reference that I can find on caffeinism use the term to mean caffeine addiction, or the (non-psychiatric) symptoms of overdose. The references that I can find that do refer to psychiatric effects of caffeine rarely call it caffeinism. Of the papers I've seen about caffeine-related psychiatric conditions, most are either about caffeine-induced anxiety. The only references to caffeine-induced psychosis that I can see in academic sources are referring to cases of patients who have had their pre-existing schizophrenia exacerbated by caffeine. The only references to bipolar are on caffeine's effects on lithium clearance.

<li>Ugh! Ok, let's not wander too far from our point (the article), here. The article needs clean up, if it's kept. Is the <i>topic</i> valid? You betcha. Is the term common? Nah. Is the term the preferred term? Probably not. So, what do we do? A <i>discussion</i> of caffeine intoxication, caffeine overdose, and the like should probably be at <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">Caffeine</a>. Therefore, I'd say <b>Merge to <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">Caffeine</a> and redirect there.</b> This way, the discussion and references stay, and we can make the information on the potential danger of over-use <i>easier to find</i> than if we have it at an out-of-the-way title. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:50, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Clarification'</i> not a second vote. Clearly the user who promulgates this article has some kind of agenda, and the article does need some cleanup. Nevertheless, this is a documented, easily verifiable and legitimate medical term (and spectrum of conditions for which it is the blanket term, including addiction, anxiety disorders, and in the extreme manifestation, psychosis) worthy of its own article, and with a indisputable body of scientific literature.

Plus it <i>tastes</i> really good with milk and tons of refined sugar. Unlike vodka, it's really easy to drink in large legal quantities without all of the dangerous physical and social effects, and coffee only improves my driving when the day is done.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Caffeine is a toxin. From <a href="http://coffeefaq.com/caffaq.html#HowMuchCaff" class="external autonumber" title="http://coffeefaq.com/caffaq.html#HowMuchCaff" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>

<p>"What purpose in the natural world does the chemical serve?</p>
<p>The answer is that caffeine is part of a plant's "chemical weaponry" to defend itself against predators and competitors. Plants cannot defend themselves with limbs, or run away from danger. Instead, they synthesize chemicals which are toxic to certain life forms. Caffeine is such a chemical; it has potent antibiotic and antifungal powers, and causes sterility in several insects. Also, caffeine permeates the soil which surrounds the plants by the accumulation of fallen leaves and berries, thus inhibiting the growth of competing plants.</p>
<p>However, in doing this, <b>the caffeine plant ultimately kills itself</b> as well. Over many years, the accumulation of caffeine in the soil becomes so great that the toxicity level is high enough to harm the parent plant. It is this that contributes to the degeneration of coffee plantations between the ages of ten and twenty-five years." <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianinNYC_0ddb.html" title="User:BrianinNYC">BrianinNYC</a> 22:47, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From <i>Caffeine Blues</i> by clinical nutritionist Stephen Cherniske: "If you were curious about the dangers of caffeine, you would undoubtedly come across a brochure entitled <i>What You Should Know About Caffeine.</i> You would find this ubiquitous brochure on information racks in hospitals, pharmacies, public health offices, or in your doctor's office. It's available throught the mail and on the Internet. <i>What You Should Know About Caffeine</i> is published by the very official-sounding International Food Information Council in Washington, DC. The brochure does not list sponsors or disclose an industry affiliation. When I requested details of industry sponsorship, I received another glossy color brochure that mentioned nothing about which organizations supply the funds to disseminate all this information. After pressing the issue through several phone calls, I finally received a list of IFIC "supporters," including Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola, M&amp;M/Mars Candy, NutraSweet, Nestle, Hershey Foods, Frito-Lay, Proctor &amp; Gamble and the Arco Chemical Company.</p>
<p>"When I asked the IFIC for scientific support for their assertion that 300 milligrams of caffeine was perfectly safe, they sent me a report published in <i>Food and Chemical Toxicity.</i> The authors of this report are both employees of the Coca-Cola Company and members of the National Soft Drink Asociation. As you might expect, the report downplays the effects of caffeine in the American diet, using some interesting techniques.</p>
<p>"For the past eight years I have conducted a systematic review of the world scientific literature on caffeine. This research has taken some real detective work. It's difficult to tell <i>what's</i> going on at first. After all, I drank coffee for over 20 years, simply because I believed like everybody else that coffee, and caffeine, had no adverse health effects.</p>
<p>"I was in for the surprise of my life. The first thing I noticed is that much of the research on coffee was imprecise. The majority of researchers refer to the standard coffee cup as a six-ounce serving, but most people drink from mugs, which contain 12 to 14 ounces or more. That's not to mention convenience store cups, which contain anywhere from 20 to 32 ounces. If you're like most people, you probably consume far more caffeine than you think you do....</p>
<p>"I also began to see that the caffeine issue is rarely taken seriously. Nearly every researcher starts from the assumption that caffeine is okay. Why? Because, consciously or subconsciously, they are influenced by the fact that they themselves depend on coffee. I have visited the offices of hundreds of scientists, professors, and clinicians. The coffee machine is as much a part of their environment as test tubes and computers. Likewise, the journalists who report health news to the public are usually heavy coffee drinkers. I'm not saying these people are dishonest, only that information can be biased by the habits of those who make and break the news."</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Worthy of an article. (There's plenty of source material that could be used to make this into a splendid article). While the <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">caffeine</a> article already discusses toxicity and abuse, those issues alone are notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 17:38, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>To clarify my view: The article should be rewritten and probably renamed. Toxicity and abuse are big issues, but whether caffeine intake can lead to a condition or syndrome uniquely called <i>Caffeinism</i> is highly questionable. How accepted is it in the medical community that caffeine intake leads to a very specific set of symptoms unique from other conditions?</dd>

<li>Delete: Just a note of comment, though. There is no rule about speedy deleting things on VfD, but I'd like to encourage admins on VfD to <i>not speedy delete on the first day of a VfD.</i> 99% of the time, the article will still be a heaping pile of speedy delete material the 2nd day, but we don't want to kill a potential article. I also agree with Denni: it really isn't <i>quite</i> a criterion #1 speedy delete (and I'm as trigger happy with criterion #1 as anyone around, I think).

<li>There are currently 16 different articles for the first 16 verses of Matt. 2. If these are all allowed to remain, this means that articles analyzing every single verse in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> would be allowed.

<li><b>Transwiki and Redirect.</b> Isn't this part of the Wikipedia project just a verse-by-verse annotated copy of two public domain translations of the bible? Wikibooks takes annotated works. Leave the redirect as a interproject navigation aid for those who don't know of Wikibooks.

<li><b>Extreme Keep</b>, and I don't do "extreme keeps" often.

Having articles on individual Bible verses or individual <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayat.html" title="Ayat">Ayat</a> from the Qur'an would "cause havoc?" That's so wrongheaded that I don't even know where to start! Just a simple quote of a verse should be deleted, but if you read this article, you'll see that it deals with scholarship and really gives the reader an understanding of the context.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: scholarly commentary on a work of literature dominating Western civilization for the last couple of thousand years is a more valid subject than Pokemon monsters, fictional kings from Tolkien, or Klingon warships, all of which are much more likely to be forgotten and have lost any relevance to people a 100 years from now than the Bible. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:31, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>- In my opinion, a complete article, as opposed to a simple reproduction of a verse in Bible, should qualify for a Keep. This applies to similar other works of same importance. I think that the possible number of articles arising out of this shall not deluge wikipedia, rather it will increase its worth. Verses in religious texts like the Bible and others comparable to the Bible are finte, say few thousand. On the other hand, just to take an example, there are 45000 asterioids in our solar system - out of which about 3000 merit attention. There are trillions of other celestial objects, and they are being discovered each day - an article on each one of the important discovery shall surely appear in wikipedia, but articles on Bible verses shall remain limited, as new verses cannot be invented or discovered. Please keep the article so that one who knows little about the significance of any particular verse of the Bible may come to wikipedia to understand the matter. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 18:41, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>-- There are multiple problems here. First, while the scholarship on the verse is fine by me, the article is lodged at a verse name, where it will never, ever be sought. This allows for someone with a POV interpretation of scriptures to use this, essentially, as reinforcement by being the only one to like to <a href="../../../1/6/_/Matthew_2%7E16.html" title="Matthew 2:16">Matthew 2:16</a> instead of [[Book of Matthew]] 2:16. If there is a Wikigloss project, this belongs there, but not in name space. The scholarship should be at <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_of_the_Innocents_aac6.html" title="Massacre of the Innocents">Massacre of the Innocents</a>, and I have a sinking feeling that, in fact, it came from there as the product of an edit war.

Saying that it will never, ever be sought as simply <a href="../../../1/6/_/Matthew_2%7E16.html" title="Matthew 2:16">Matthew 2:16</a> is dubious, but even assuming you are correct, a searcher could find the article in the way I've described. If someone uses it in a POV way, we should change what they write to make it NPOV, but the possibility of someone using it improperly is not a reason to delete this article in the first place. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko">Jersyko</a> 15:17, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> --<a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim">JuanMuslim</a> 16:29, 23 May 2005 (UTC) I think that the article needs to be userfied. For example, I would like to strip the author's name and then edit the article so that it comes from a 3rd person, objective point of view. The article is also too long. The original article was written for an entirely different audience. Most well-known, accomplished Muslims are simply not listed, because they aren't very vocal or crazy. Radical groups, such as the Nation of Islam and Taliban, are listed but mainstream Muslim organizations, such as ISNA or ICNA, are not. However, they are known among all American Muslims. I plan to help in that regard. You can learn more about LADO at <a href="http://www.latinodawah.org/about" class="external free" title="http://www.latinodawah.org/about" rel="nofollow">http://www.latinodawah.org/about</a> LADO and various LADO members have been mentioned in several articles in a number of publications: <a href="http://hispanicmuslims.com/articles" class="external free" title="http://hispanicmuslims.com/articles" rel="nofollow">http://hispanicmuslims.com/articles</a></li>

<ul>
<li><s><b>Total rewrite</b></s>. I'm not convinced by the "not notable" line, although I could possibly be swayed. I mean, have you guys seen some of the groups in <a href="../../../o/r/g/Category%7EOrganization_stubs_ed58.html" title="Category:Organization stubs">Organization stubs</a> lately?

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The new stub provided by copyright holder (viz JuanMuslim) looks fine as far as I'm concerned. The word "notable" doesn't even appear on the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, and there are lots of relatively small groups that have articles or stubs on Wikipedia.

I have also fixed the appropriate links. I would like to make <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accessory_Before_the_Act_f251.html" title="Accessory Before the Act">Accessory Before the Act</a> into a simple redirect to <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accessory_%28legal_term%29.html" title="Accessory (legal term)">Accessory (legal term)</a>, which now fully explains accesories both before and after the act, and how they differ from <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accomplice.html" title="Accomplice">accomplices</a> and conspiritors. I didn't actually make the change to a redirect, because I am not sure if this violates the rule against "moving or blanking" the page on the VfD list, but I did edit it to leave only a <i>see</i> link to <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accessory_%28legal_term%29.html" title="Accessory (legal term)">Accessory (legal term)</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 16:56, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It should specify where this is considered a legal term, if at all (someone said England?)

<dd>I think that in the US the term is mostly of historical interest, and it was always more common in the UK and the commonwealth. A current refernce seems to indiacte that it is still in use in New Zealand. Even in the UK I think the terms "before the act" and "after the act" are now less commonly used they they were 50-150 years ago. I can't offhand documet specifc dates of usage. Do you mean that the redirect page should specify usage, or that this page should not be a simple redirect? or do you mean that the page on <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accessory_%28legal_term%29.html" title="Accessory (legal term)">Accessory (legal term)</a>, should include this information?

Here is a list of references that define or use the term, including current statutes from two US States, and legal proceedings and model jury instructions from others, as well as a quote from Blackstone for historical usage. Perhaps this is enough to indicate that this is indeed a legal term.

<p><s>Hmm... Well I fear that there will be a lot of opposition, as this is a frequently edited article, but it had to be said sometime: Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This is just a list of words and their translations into English. In fact, I think it's even a bad title, as it's really like, as RickK suggested, a "List of possible Dacian cognates to words in the Romanian language" or something like that. In any case, the editors work need not be lost, they should just spend their time <b>transwiki</b>ing the article to wiktionary, so that it can be <b>deleted</b> --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 07:10, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</s> <i>Note</i>, this article has become a redirect following a page move. I suggest that we <b>delete</b> the pointless redirect (no one will be looking for "list of ...") but keep the new encyclopedic article at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_substratum_words.html" title="Romanian substratum words">Romanian substratum words</a> which excludes the list. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 08:09, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Shorten the list, expand the text. It cannot be incorporated in the <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacian_language.html" title="Dacian language">Dacian language</a> article, because we can't just say 100% that all the words are Dacian. This article deals with words of substratum and probable substratum words in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_language.html" title="Romanian language">Romanian language</a>, so it is an article on its own. The only problem is the long list, which can be shortened. There is an amount of text, and the text can be expanded easily, since many points aren't covered. This will lead to a name change, with the Talk Page also being kept &amp; moved to the new name. Decius 07:21, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As an example of what I propose, I've removed the entire list. The list is not that important, but the article is, and it does not require a list. Decius 07:29, 21 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, that move was a bit uncalled for. Did you read the vfd notice? "Please do not blank, merge, or <i>move this article</i>" (my emphasis). Anyway, you are making a mistake about deleting that list, unless that means you are going to put it into Wiktionary. It's a great resource, just not encyclopedic. Otherwise I agree with the renaming, but there's no need for a redirect to that nonsearchable name, and the six links can be fixed. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 07:36, 21 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have many articles on subtopics only reachable through links in other articles, as nobody would search for that particular title. I don't think that is a problem, as these are articles people would only be expected to continue to after reading the main articles. Anyway the VfD notice should be reinserted and the link fixed, unless <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> decides to withdraw the nomination. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:51, 21 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I should have said there's no need for a redirect <i>from</i> that useless ("list of ...") name. Current location is good. Which is why I don't know what to do with the tag, because my nomination is only for the old location which should be deleted now, and not the new one. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 08:04, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see a problem. The new article is a Wikipedia article relating to the Romanian language. The Wiktionary version was already created by Uncle G some months ago. He listed all the words that were on the list onto Wiktionary. I'll find the link. Decius 07:41, 21 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah... I see it now. I'll admit I had searched Wiktionary to see if these articles were there before nominating, but was looking for Dacian words, when they are listed only as Romanian words with Dacian derivations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> present article at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_substratum_words.html" title="Romanian substratum words">Romanian substratum words</a>: the subject as such is encyclopedic. I also don't see any problem with a short, annotated list of sample words, as long as the list doesn't dominate the article. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:51, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why? Were I interested in this webcomic I might look up Wikipedia for biographical information on the creator. I would expect to find it on a seperate page to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlock_Mercenary_c9d9.html" title="Schlock Mercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a>.

<li>By that logic, we should have a bio page for every webcomic artist. Look, the guy has done <i>one</i> comic strip, and if we merge the articles, then you will still be able to find the info by searching for his name. Although I can't think why you would need to do that, since there is an even more detailed bio page on <i>the Schlock Mercenary website</i>. You might "expect" to find separate articles for all kinds of things but that doesn't mean we create them. And I'm pretty sure this fails the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> test: as far as I know, except for his co-authorship of a software book, there is no source for any of this information except the bio page on Tayler's own site. <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob"></a>←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 15:36, 2005 May 22 (UTC)

<li>Oh come on now. I didn't say bios for single-title artists are out of the question; I just said they're not <i>mandatory</i>, as Leithp's reasoning implied.

<li>My point was more that, since we have established that this guy created a notable comic, he himself is notable by definition.

<li>The Russian monarchy is no longer reigning, but the UK still recognizes its own domestic titles such as Earl -- so if Prince Damien really were a British earl, that should be verifiable without too much difficulty.

<li>Delete: I am not sure, here. It's not recreation of an exactly same-titled article, but I believe this is a recreation in content anyway. My recollection is that a similarly nebulously-titled article existed with almost identical content. The author was not a native English speaker and was translating, essentially, a piece of the business textbook he was given at his job. In any case, the article here is impenetrable, original research. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:12, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I used to do business process modeling for a living. Still do on occasion. This article has very little to do with the general concept (which would be encyclopedic).

<li>Redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pearl_%28novel%29_3a41.html" title="The Pearl (novel)">The Pearl (novel)</a>. It <i>is</i> possible to write an article about a minor character (well, I did it with <a href="../../../g/l/u/Glumdalclitch.html" title="Glumdalclitch">Glumdalclitch</a>), but not when you're just filling out the who, what, when, and where of the character and no why.

<li>That's possible for a character like Glumdalclitch, who actually has lines and interacts with the main characters. But in The Pearl, Coyotito is treated more like a thing of great value, not a real character, because he has no lines or anything. His impact on the main characters is limited to his inate value in their eyes; nothing more. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer">∞</a> 13:28, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>Whoh whoh there. This page has some great potential to serve as the most comprehensive O.C. episode guide on the net. I've made a few changes to the first entry, check it out, we can use it as a template for the rest. We can make this better than fox's page. Also, its entirely inappropriate to say this page is out of date. Just because all the episodes haven't been written about yet, doesn't mean the information in the sections already written is out of date. People use episode guides for information on all episodes, even old ones. oregonrains</li>

<li>Less notable than schools.

<p>Hiya. I would not have imagined having an article given all the discussions on notability... but I also think that I should have no say on it, I have no say either on whether I "deserve" to be on it or not. Proof is you do not either, no one thought of asking me my opinion when it was listed here... I just learn about it on the irc channel&#160;:-) Just two notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar articles were created on the french wikipedia. I listed the articles on votes for deletion on the french pedia... As far as I know, french people decided to delete Ang and myself, as "non notable people of a non notable website". I thought it amuzing and an interesting biais...&#160;:-). If Angela had not been kept previously here, I would have listed both here as well.</li>
<li>In case the pages are kept, it would be interesting to reflect on the long term. Does that mean all board members will be listed in the future by default&#160;? Or what&#160;? It is pretty hard to define how much members are notable when we know them&#160;;-)</li>

<li>I think this vote is great news. Combined with our aim of avoiding systematic bias, Wikipedia will be a lot more inclusionist from now on. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 07:02, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hmmm, you might choose to delete it if I am no more on the board next year&#160;;-) More seriously, I'd like to thank people of all the nice comments made above. I am not in a great great great mood these days. I actually had a 2 days wikiSlow to try to feel better in the past few days, but then... there was too much to do&#160;:-) Anyway, it was very nice to see editors comments and it gave me some energy... to consider very important decisions to be made about the Foundation just today during the board meeting.

The result of the debate was no consensus to delete, but some to redirect. Instead of these suggestions, though, I'm going to redirect to <a href="../../../d/e/t/Deterministic_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Deterministic (disambiguation)">Deterministic (disambiguation)</a>, which provides a bunch of possible meanings of the concept.</p>
