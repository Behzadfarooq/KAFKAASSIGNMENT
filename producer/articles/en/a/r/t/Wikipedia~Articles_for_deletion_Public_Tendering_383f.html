<li><b>Keep</b>. I see no reason to censor this information form the public. User:OsgoodeLawyer has made it a point to delete from the Tenders page the section refering to the unatural practice of governments to award multi-million dollar public contracts without tenders and I am working with him to edit that page which will make it distinct from this one. All that is required to distinguish the two pages is show the difference between Tenders as a generic term and Public Tenders which is more specific to governmental activities of noteriety.Wiki <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">BADASS</span> Woo 2U 23:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. WikiWoo, you've been told many times that your accusations of "censorship" are uncivil and uncalled for. Please stop it. As for the article needing to exist, why? The process is the same, except in one instance it is done by public institutions, and in the other it is not. <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black"><b>Oz</b></font></a><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="red"><i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lawyer</span></i></font></a> 23:27, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If we got a penny every time someone throws tantrums about "censorship" on AfD... With respect to the process being the same, though, I can't agree (see also below). From a business point of view, sure, but as a matter of law it's quite different: Tenders by governments are not only governed by contract law (i.e. civil law, here in the old world), but also by the public law that regulates such aspects of the government procurement procedure as tendering threshold values and exceptions, non-discrimination and transparency rules, possibilities of judicial review etc. All of this affects the procedure of tendering a great deal. So this is a article on public law waiting to be written, not one on commercial usages. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You've also been warned about recreating material against consensus. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Invited_public_tenders_2f86.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Invited public tenders">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Invited public tenders</a>, where it was decided to merge this material into <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenders.html" title="Tenders">Tenders</a>. This is part of a pattern of behavior, quite frankly. You refuse to work with the community by following consensus and you don't put any importance on trying to convince people that your edits should be kept because they follow WP policy. Every change to an article you think you <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> is met with by charges of vandalism and censorship. <font face="Old English Text MT"><a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007"><span style="padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px; background: black; color: white">JChap</span></a> <big><b><a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007"><span style="color: black">T</span></a><span style="color:black">/</span><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JChap2007_1e7f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JChap2007"><span style="color:black">E</span></a></b></big></font> 00:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comments</b> The comments the two you make in favour of censorship and watering down anything concrete about municipal government activities is appaling. It is not comming from good faith but some agenda you share with keeping people from knowing facts and details of govermnent activities in Ontario Canada most particularly. From your edits I know that you know as much as I do in many cases but are here to distract my work and to intefer with expansion of public knowledge. I am calling is censorship because you want to keep plainly written material that anyone can understand about these things off and keep adding a POV designed to mislead and confuse readers. I could just as easily call it vandalism. Only its a vandalism with the purpose of censorship and distracting a knowledgeable editor from addding interesting and important public information.Wiki <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">BADASS</span> Woo 2U 00:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>agree with nomination. no reason for separate existenc of article, and ideal candidate for <b>merger with <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenders.html" title="Tenders">Tenders</a></b>, that way, both will no longer be stubs. Don't see why there should be a prolonged political discussion on the subject. A merged article should maintain a NPOV, meaning we should write only about that which can be sunstantiated. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't see any content overlap at this moment. More importantly, though, as a jurist professionally involved in government procurement (or public tendering, if one prefers that term) I can attest that as a matter of law and practice it is substantially different from private tendering, at least in countries party to the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement. As such, it deserves its own article, as a merge would probably lead to inapt generalisations with regard to both types of tendering. The article needs a lot of work, though. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 16:19, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm loathe to go against the apparent consensus at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Invited_public_tenders_2f86.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Invited public tenders">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Invited public tenders</a>, but your argument is very compelling. One problem: "public tender" can have several meanings. Should this be merged to Public Procurement? <font face="Old English Text MT"><a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007"><span style="padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px; background: black; color: white">JChap</span></a> <big><b><a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007"><span style="color: black">T</span></a><span style="color:black">/</span><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JChap2007_1e7f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JChap2007"><span style="color:black">E</span></a></b></big></font> 17:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wouldn't recommend that, as Public Procurement redirects to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procurement.html" title="Procurement">Procurement</a>, which is again a very generic subject matter. We do ought to have an article on the specifics of procurement by the government, though, and I recommend moving the article at issue to Government procurement, which is unambiguous and appears to be an internationally accepted way to refer to this subject matter - at least insofar as the <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_1c1a.html" title="WTO">WTO</a> <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gproc_e.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gproc_e.htm" rel="nofollow">uses it for its work</a>. The previous AfD consensus, incidentally, appears to be that the <i>subject</i> is notable but that the <i>term</i> then used was unverifiable, and that the content ought to be merged because it was just a dicdef. That sort of consensus doesn't preclude recreation as an actual (although not yet very good) article, I would think. I'll try and contribute something if it's kept. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 18:37, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, if the article is expanded beyond a stub/dicdef, it would be a great subject.
