<p>The result was <b>keep, possibly merge pending discussion</b>. Despite the numbers&#160;!voting delete, I don't think I've ignored consensus closing this AfD the way I have. Around the 5th/6th November the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_probability&amp;oldid=85240673" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_probability&amp;oldid=85240673" rel="nofollow">original research essay</a> was removed, and replaced with the beginnings of an encyclopedic article. Many of the earlier&#160;!votes were based on the OR essay which no longer exists. There appears to be agreement that this is a subject worthy of an entry in an encyclopedia, and the article may need to be reduced to a stub and built up again with the content from <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_probability_temp_50ad.html" title="Philosophy of probability/temp">Philosophy of probability/temp</a>, or merged into <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html" title="Philosophy of mathematics">Philosophy of mathematics</a> or elsewhere.

<li>How could you say so firmly that is original research? Could you say what research is about? What is its subject? And what are the obtained theoretical results? It is in fact just an expanded definition of "philosophy of probability". The philosophical concepts can not be presented just like the mathematical ones - simply stated and in a standard manner. Any definition or presentation would look like an essay. I could give you all the bibliography for finding all ideas of the article in works of classics. It is nothing original there. --infarom

<li><b>Delete</b> but <b>userfy</b> at User:Infarom for the time being. I think that an article on the philosophy of probability (the meaning of statements cast in terms of probabilities, the epistemology of probability) is a valid subject. This reads too much like an essay for main encyclopedia space <i>for the time being</i>, but the author says that he has a bibliography he's prepared to add. I'd let him work on it a while longer and try again once he's done a bit more with it. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The only issue I have with userfying the article is that it makes it harder for it's development to be collaborative.

<li><b>Keep with modifications</b> --- such as, adding Bayes, and others, plus tie better into the more non-mainstream elements on the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html" title="Philosophy of mathematics">Philo of Math</a> discussions. As an aside, 'encyclopedia' is to be both broad and deep (that is comprehensive and complete). Now, as one who regularly uses 'wiki' as a pedagogical tool (yes, even for my own periods of pursuing edification), I cringe when I think that some want to limit what threads unravel within this environment. Some of the pages on 'wiki' are priceless in terms of collecting, aggregating, and presenting information - then, providing a launch point for further study. Now, this article is apropos to several items addressed on the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html" title="Philosophy of mathematics">Philo of Math</a> page, such as <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html#Fictionalism" title="Philosophy of mathematics">this one</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quasi-empiricism_in_mathematics.html" title="Quasi-empiricism in mathematics">this, too</a>. <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 15:13, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This page was created by a new user, User:Infarom, and then listed for deletion a scant five hours later. Infarom has responded to this AfD reasonably and has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_probability&amp;diff=86007010&amp;oldid=85240673" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_probability&amp;diff=86007010&amp;oldid=85240673" rel="nofollow">worked since its listing</a> to accomodate the issues that have been raised. There seems to be general agreement that the subject of the page is a valid topic, so what is at issue then is the current content. I don't see any attempt to push a point here even if the initial creation contained original research by Infarom. Neither deletion nor userfying seems to me to be warranted—this can all be handled by the normal article development process. It would be a better use of people's time here to put the effort into improving the article instead of debating whether to delete it. Let's not <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite the newcomer</a> and give him and others a chance to work this into an article. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 21:27, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've not participated before in a deletion process, however I have experienced the 'deletion' event. Is it a simple majority vote? If we take 'userfy' as stronger than delete and allow that comment content overrides a 'delete' vote (meaning, the vote is dependent upon changes being made to the page), then the count (at the time of the time-stamp of this comment) is 7 deletes and 6 nots. Who mediates the controversy? This suggestion (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_probability_temp_50ad.html" title="Philosophy of probability/temp">Philosophy of probability/temp</a>) by <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> would be a very good starting article. <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 16:06, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are a bunch of administrators who close AFD discussions. Sometimes they get closed early, if the article is shown to meet a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a> or a <a href="../../../c/s/k/WP%7ECSK_91ce.html" title="WP:CSK">criteria for speedy keeping</a>, or the outcome just becomes totally obvious.</dd>
<dd>AFD is <i>not</i> a vote, although it sometimes gets treated as one. AFD is meant to be a discussion to <i>measure consensus</i> as to whether an article adheres to our policies and guidelines, or could be cleaned up to do so, or if instead it is unsalvagable and needs to be deleted. If everything was running on time, the clear closes would happen on the sixth day after the AFD discussion began, so November 8 in this case. AFD closure is a process that is normally backlogged, and it isn't unusual for the discussion to run a few days extra. This article is definitely evolving to be better.</dd>
<dd>Both the temp page and the current draft of the article have their points; they ought to be combined. I'd now say that this is far from being original research. It does need further work, but so does almost every article here. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:51, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note to administrators - The /temp page could be altered with content from the main page and be of value. Comments related to 'original research' may have applied to the initial contents; they cannot apply to the concept or its importance. Adding to my remark from above, I've noticed that 'wiki' now doesn't seem to allow time for evolution. No page, that I know of, manifested itself with 1 edit for which there was never a change. I can see jumping on vandalism. Why jump on someone proposing a topic even if the approach seems self-serving initially? By the way, when something is deleted, are the contents gone or are they still accessible in some log? <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 21:07, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
