<li><b>Comment</b> Who is supposedly attacked? If there was no basis for speedy delete as an attack in the AfD for "Clinton Chronicles" then that argument fails here too, and it should turn on notability. I do not see in the article sales figures, or figures for number of downloads or number of DVDs in circulation, or mainstream mention as was used as arguments to keep the aforementioned film of the other political flavor recently. Is this related in some way to the HBO film to be shown Nov 2?

<li><b>Delete</b>, not speedy though. I don't think this meets the speedy requirement of an attack page. It is however a film with no external sourcing to demonstrate any sort of notability. The only thing I can find is that it apparently screened at the 2004 Hampton International Film Festival. To me that isn't sufficient to prove this film is notable. Considering the lack of any external sourcing demonstrating notability and the fact that the only real reason being advanced to keep runs counter to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox, I think this is a clear case for deletion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:44, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>55,000 Google hits ought to furnish notability in the absence of any approved guidelines governing films. I don't have a dog in this race, but I think we all know what the notability guidelines were set up to achieve: Filtering out trivial stuff like YouTube segments and student films, while preventing deletions of films that have some meaure of past or current relevance. Additionally, when liberals or conservatives attempt to delete articles they don't agree with, the community suffers. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 20:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That same community suffers when liberals and conservatives attempt to keep non notable articles to push a POV. 55,000 articles does not reflect the movie does it? considering many of those do not even mention the movie. Also its 575 unique items and many of those simply refer to the controversy the movie was named after, not vice versa. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 20:46, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>To rephrase from somewhat idiomatic English: I'm not interested in pursuing a discussion on POV, however it is the case that several voters here have similar -- and indeed overlapping -- edit histories, in which politics opposed to those of the film seem to play a substantial part.

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's not the case. 1) The film was shown at at least one major festival, and is commercially available. 2) Your Google search seems to produce rather different results from other Google searches, and a link would be appreciated. 3) The 'YouTube floodgate' implies that professionally-made, budgeted independent films with a festival presence are indistinguishable from videos that kids make at home with camcorders. I believe there's a clear and obvious distinction which need not be explained. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 19:30, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Conclude your search then cycle through the number of pages until there are no more, tell me how many are listed at the top entries C - X of Y. That X is the total of unique hits, meaning if one page mentions it 8000 times, then you will get 8000, however 1 entry. Hits and unique hits are different. This also counts for pages on a domain, so if we use livejournal as an example, it will consolidate all of the livejournal hits into 1 entry, that is a unique hit. Hopefully that helps you understand how google works a little better and why the google test is not used. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 19:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its good we were able to come to an agreement that Ghits are not valid in determining notability, as the article itself constantly points out. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 19:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would be good in that case to strike your argument about '575 unique Google hits,' which is based on methodology specifically warned against by the Google Test article. In comparison, the figure of 55,000 ghits represents an uncontroversial and indeed near-universal observation in regard to VfDs. I don't believe you're claiming that ghits are inadmissible on principle. Because if so, that's quite a long and involved argument with far-reaching consequences, VfD-wise. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 20:12, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually I am, the article you linked on the google test explains repeatedly that its not a fair assessment of notability. Please read it more carefully. Thank you. Also considering you never actually debated my points in relation to release, money earned or anything else in notability (films) I will take this back and forth as over, and quite pointless as it seems your own proof <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a> says its not all too reliable either. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 20:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(many colon marks) I believe my argument is that in addition to 55,000 ghits, the film was shown at at least one major festival, was budgeted and professionally made, and as such is not equivalent to a YouTube video. You seem to want to 'win' this discussion, and I am perfectly willing to let you do so. However, it would be good if you could state your argument for deletion once and plainly, rather than using 'delete' as a constant around which different and contradictory arguments may orbit. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 20:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am not sure what you are talking about, you actually replied to my arguement. I will lay it out again if its not clear: <i>Non notable. One screening [1], no awards, being distributed by the makers (see distributors), no wide release, no theatre release at all actually. The page is also highly unsourced and unverified, so per WP:V as well</i> Hope that helps, it is listed above. As for winning, AfD is for discussion on the topic, this isnt a vote, so debating your point, ghits being a useful guage of notability is perfectly valid, however if you do not want to defend that point I understand and will not reply to you anymore. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 12:44, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a succinct summary. Thank you. My disagreement comprises three points: 1) Participation in a major film festival is notable, and is not fairly described as 'one screening,' which implies that the film was only screened once, somewhere. In fact, there seem to be <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=kGx&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=votergate+festival&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=kGx&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=votergate+festival&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">multiple screenings</a>. 2) Ghits are generally considered a quick-and-dirty test of notability, despite claims made in this discussion that they carry no weight at all. This is an uncontroversial statement that would ordinarily be regarded as <i>a priori</i> true. My position is that it is inconsistent to create an estimate of 575+/- unique hits (from a total of 55,000) as an argument toward deletion, and then to disallow ghits entirely when such methodology is shown to be faulty. 3) Re: distribution, theatre release, etc., yes, you may have a point. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 15:48, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps those film festivals are not widely recognized that the IMDB page does not often recognize them, some seem to be specifically guaged at that genre of work, meaning its not a industry film festival. If it was Cannes, I would think there would be a sense of notability, at least if it won an award. However appearing in festivals that are crafted for tis type of film is not the same as industry festivals like Cannes. The basic idea is notability, appearing at non-notable places does not increase that. As for the ghits arguement, sorry if you misunderstood me. I do not believe in the google test and attempted to argue on your basis before just dropping the bomb that the article itself says its not reliable. It was an attempt to reacha middleground, perhaps us stating its something to attribute but not establish, like a piece of the puzzle. However that went south. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:17, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. In-person showings aren't the only test for notability. This film is being distributed primarily online, rather than in brick-and-mortar theaters. If someone creates an article about a serious documentary, I see no reason why we can't keep the article. A move to Votergate (film) would be called for only if we had another article at Votergate, but I could see moving it now on the theory that we might well have a more general article in the future. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 01:12, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with the comments of JamesMLane above and would add the following. First, an observation: it is clear from the comments here that there is by no means any consensus about the deletion of this entry and that therefore it should be retained as is. Second, with regard to the handful of comments above alleging that this film is non-notable and/or political, I strongly disagree. Such comments run counter to the facts and the evidence is readily available on line and in the pages of the thousands -- that's right THOUSANDS -- of mainstream and alternative media articles, both in print and online, on the subject of electronic voting. The Votergate film series was the first to identify the security defects in touchscreen voting systems. These are systems that 80% of Americans will vote on this November. Votergate catalogued the 3 ways that the machines may be hacked: (1) physical; (2) smartcard; (3) central tabulation. These revelations provided the basis for numerous investigations and governmental reports, including the Carter-Baker Commission (a bi-partisan Commission). The aftershocks of this film are still being felt, and the issues raised by the film have been taken up by grassroots organizations (both partisan, non-partisan, and bi-partisan) across the country. It has been a rallying cry for election protection in this country. This film played an essential part in the fight for honest elections across the United States. (And, in light of the comments here I must again reiterate that honest elections implies an expressly non-political point of view.) The goal of this film is to have every American's vote count as cast. And, that is something that everyone who values knowledge, truth and the right to be heard -- whether American or not -- should support. In the final analysis, this film series deserves recognition and retention as an entry both for its prescience on the issue of voting systems and because it has served a purpose only the rarest of films achieve: it moved hundreds of thousands of people to action.Heat Miser&#160;20:03, 1 November 2006 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_miser_7ab4.html" title="User:Heat miser">Heat miser</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeat_miser_7362.html" title="User talk:Heat miser">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heat_miser_f12c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heat miser">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

What I ask of you is a WP:RS and WP:V source stating that this movie started this movement, if you can produce <i>some</i>, enough to show its the general belief of media outlets, then I will surely chagne my vote.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please re-read my post. I have not made "the claim that this movie started the entire movement to take a look into voting machines." Rather, I made the claim that this film publicized the movement and moved hundreds of thousands of people to action after these issues were disclosed. So, first, I would agree with Auto movil below as to the fact that Bev Harris was one of the first ones to start this movement. I am not aware of her "Black Box Voting" films. (Bev does however make several strong appearances in the Votergate films, and these films are historical records of her work.) Nonetheless, if there are such films, I would submit that they also would be entitled to a separate entry, since this is the singlemost important issue facing our democracy. If people's votes are not counted honestly, then we do not have a democracy. Second, I note your certain contributions to wiki so let us look at your entry for Timbaland. You must feel that Timbaland is notable and worthy of an entry here on wiki, or else you would not have wasted your time. Surely we can agree that Votergate had at least as much impact on American society in the last 2 years as Timbaland and Dr. Noyd? Third, in response to your comment to Auto movil above, Votergate is clearly not just a "YouTube" video (although the director/producers seem to now be savvy to using YouTube as an avenue for advertising). It is in the IMDB database. If there is time for me to find additional sources before this comment period closes, I will do so, but a simple Google search will turn up a plethora of reviews, entries and media about the films, including the IMDB entry. Finally, I am of course interested in continuing this dialogue with you, but I must note again that at this point there is clearly no consensus here on deletion, which is the standard set by wiki for removal.Heat Miser;15:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>Ok so the new claim is "and moved hundreds of thousands of people to action after these issues were disclosed", do you haev a source for this that satisfys WP:RS and WP:V? else this is all just your personal opinion on the movies and not really anything that cna be added to the article to allow it to meet requirements. Also since you do not know, IMDB is now editable by readers. Further I am not sure what you see as no concensus, so far the only arguement made is lots of ghits and claims that it motivated hundreds of thousands, which I would like to see a source for, and your bickering at my edit history, which i remind you, discuss the content, not the editor. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 12:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is not MY "new" claim. This is the claim I made in my original statement, that you deliberately misinterpreted in an attempt to make my case more difficult to prove. Similarly, the standard you have set here also overreaches. As shown by Derex above with regard to the Clinton Chronicles, the standard for notability you have set is not the standard for material here. You have moved from one argument to the other in an attempt to provide a basis for deletion. Why are you doing this? I don't know. I do know that your entry on Timbaland suffers from the same defects you are trumpeting here. And, no, I did not give the example of Timbaland to get into your edit history. Only you seem to be concerned about that. Rather, I sought to use your entry on Timbaland in order to communicate with you by using an example you were familiar with. I did so in the interest of moving this discussion forward. I ask you, if you feel Timbaland is worthy of entry here, why not Votergate? This brings up another point. Timbaland is ancient history. The Votergate films are a continuing series of films about a seminal issue of importance to the maintenance of real democracy in the world's only superpower. They are continuing to be produced as we speak. They will continue to have impact. They are therefore not "history" but reality. They deserve inclusion for this reason as well.

Now people are videotaping those procedures across the U.S. That's sounds pretty notable to me.

So, with regard to your first statement: there IS in fact at least one independent source on the very first Google search page. With regard to the broken link, I don't understand your argument.

<dd><b>Comment</b>You mean like Wikipedia? IMDb has clear database inclusion criteria. It clearly qualifies as an independent source. I invite everyone here to review those criteria. Simply because it is "edited partially by registered accounts" does not in any way reflect on its prominent position in the industry as a respected and authoritative source. I in fact submit that IMDb is run by people far more expert than those here on the subject of whether or not a film is notable or has an impact, and they take that responsibility very seriously. Finally, are you suggesting that wikipedia, because it is editable by the people, is somehow not authoritative or independent?

<dd>Well, just to be clear, according to your link, this is a wiki guideline, although there is a box on the link that claims it is the subject of dispute. Nonetheless, I just reviewed it, and I can tell you unequivocally that I believe in sourcing and verification. You sound like you agree with the guideline and believe in this too. I will therefore attempt to provide you with some reliable sourcing regarding IMDb's authoritative status in the industry, and also regarding how IMDb operates (you have assumed it operates in the same manner, but in fact it operates differently than wiki, and the differences are critical to this discussion). First, I must reiterate that IMDb is an authoritative source and well-accepted in the motion picture industry. Here is an independent, reliable source for that proposition: <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/" class="external free" title="http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/</a>. A simple Google of IMDb will turn up numerous similar articles about IMDb's history, bios of its founder, and details about its operations. I invite you to educate yourself about this reputable, established, authoritative, reliable source before you comment further so we can have a meaningful discussion. In a nutshell, IMDb is similar to wikipedia in that it will allow members to submit material, but it is not identical. There are significant differences, and these differences relate specifically to how editing is executed. Unlike wiki, at IMDb, new material and revisions are submitted to a board of editors who are primarily based in Seattle. The LA Weekly article discusses this as well: <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/" class="external free" title="http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/</a>. Thus, as you can read in the article, no revisions are carried out by the community without prior review, fact-checking, and judgment FOR NOTABILITY, ACCURACY and other criteria by VERY savvy industry professionals. There can be little doubt that if a motion picture is listed at IMDb, especially one that is 2 years old, it has been vetted, the information is accurate AND it has been found to be notable.<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_miser_7ab4.html" title="User:Heat miser">Heat miser</a> 05:38, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Friend you have now mischaracterized at least two of my posts. Either you have a problem with reading comprehension, or you are deliberately misstating my written words in an attempt to railroad this community into deleting this entry. Why? If you actually read my post above, or the article itself, you will find that it DOES NOT say that IMDb was wrong, rather, it said that the company, Diebold, was wrong and HBO/IMDb were correct. I stand by the fact that IMDb is an independent reliable source of experts on film. The folks there, of course, watched the film prior to ruling on its inclusion. Have you even watched the Votergate film? By your own admission you have not. And yet you would delete an entry here about it. Again, I must ask why? Is it hurting you to have this entry? What is your deal? You still have not responded at all to my Timbaland example. Are you interested in reaching a consensus here on what to do? Why does Timbaland deserve an entry and Votergate does not? Finally, as to your last point, whether or not Votergate was around as a term prior to the creation of the film has no bearing on the notability of the film or this entry. Was "Godfather" in use as a term prior to the release of "The Godfather?" Maybe that entry should be expunged as well? Heat Miser 20:57, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didnt say you said IMDB was wrong, reading comprehension indeed. I am stating IMDB was wrong, Votergate and Hacking Democracy are two different movies, Diebold mistook one for the other, the movie the article is about, is Hacking Democracy, not Votergate. Also IMDB is not a independant reliable source ran by film experts, I am not sure what gave you taht idea, can you name these experts on film you believe run IMDB? I am sure you cannot. Since you cannot grasp this concept I will reiterate it one more time for you, The movie is not notable for anything, there is nothing that makes it stand out, its has not broken any records, screened anywhere important, been released in theatres (which still wouldnt be enough), its not notable, the more you go on about it leading hundreds of thousands to be inspired to the topic and refuse to give a source stating it, instead go on a tangent about something new and my edit history instead of providing such a source which you have been asked for now 3-4 times, the worse it makes your point look, which is that its notable cause it inspired people, something you have yet to prove, prove it already instead of writing paragraph long diatribes. Also I ask you not make foolish comparisons between Godfather the movie and the term Godfather, since if you bothered to read what I wrote, I was stating the phenomenon came before the movie, hence the google hits, its not a rationalization for deletion, its a rationalization for the high google count, which itself does not signify notabilit,y per its own article <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a>.

<dd>First, with regard to IMDb: IMDb is a reliable source by any definition, for reasons I stated in my response to GRBerry above. To summarize, IMDb is not a user-edited site. It is run by VERY savvy industry professionals and any new or revised material is FIRST submitted to those professionals BEFORE it is posted. The professionals who run IMDb can be readily identified and sourced by running a search for "IMDb" on Google. They are "players" and their large editorial staff is well-financed by their corporate parent, Amazon. The article I cited for GRBerry is one of many that comes up in the search results. IMDb is therefore reliable and it is both relevant and probative of Votergate's notability that it is listed there. Second, with regard to the Hollywood Reporter source, I respond to your comments here in my post on Smeelgova's thread below and I would ask that we continue dialogue on this source there. To summarize, the fact that Diebold thought that a new Votergate was coming out, and that they acted with strong-arm tactics to stop it shows the great extent of Votergate's impact and how notable Diebold believes it to be. Finally, to reinforce the fact that it is not just Diebold who believes Votergate was notable and worthwhile, and also to put to rest this "notability" debate, I include this link to Alexa: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=votergate.tv" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=votergate.tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=votergate.tv</a> If you examine the 3 year time frame, easily accessed by clicking the "3yr" tab, you will see that over 60 million -- that's right -- 60 MILLION people accessed the website showing portions of the Votergate film in the days leading up to and following the November 2004 election. I hope we can agree that Alexa.com is a reliable source, and that this readily demonstrates the notability and incredible significance of this film. You are correct that I originally said "hundreds of thousands." But it was actually over 60 MILLION people. Even I did know it was that high. I hope you will agree that this reliable Alexa.com source, plus the previously-mentioned 55,000 ghits sourcing mentioned by Auto movil and Derex above, puts the notability issue vis-a-vis Votergate to rest. Since Votergate is clearly notable, and furthermore, people are working to fill out the entry to bring it up to wiki standards, I would ask you to revise your "delete" opinion and change it to a "strong keep." <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_miser_7ab4.html" title="User:Heat miser">Heat miser</a> 07:55, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am going to ignore you now, you still have not provided that source and wrote another massive diatribe which is kind of annoying, please read <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a> for more information on why its not a reliable sign of notability.

<dd>Also you must be new to certain internet phrases, but hits do not equal people. A hit is registered when a page is reached, so if the site has 50 pages and 5 people visit and hit all 50 pages then they generated 1250 hits. If one of those people come back and review all 50 pages again, you are not at 1500 hits, get it? Hits do not symbolize individual people, nor do they even symbolize 1 person per visit. So 1 person can check out the site everyday for a week generating millions of hits on their own. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 14:39, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>From the producer...</b> Hello Wiki!! I am a producer of Votergate, the film in question. Permit me to thank all of your for your passionate arguments on both sides of this debate. Everyone involved in our documentary film believe in what you are doing as active members, and we use wikipedia regularly, even if we do so on a drive-by basis and (like me) are not "members" or regular contributors. So, thank you for your efforts to make this the best online encyclopedia. We truly believe it is a privilege to be included on your site at the moment. For several reasons, I would like to make the following contributions to this discussion and I hope this will bring about a positive discussion. Thank you for your consideration.
<dl>
<dd>A. As I documentary producer, I must do extensive research on my issues of interest, and this often includes documentary film history. I have used wikipedia over the years for film and cinema research on a variety of topics, and I plan to continue doing so. As a general matter, one of the most difficult topics to find information about is documentary. I have often been hard-pressed to find important information on obscure documentary topics that are nonetheless important to me as a film researcher, and as a film historian. Wikipedia has already made unbelievably important contributions in this area.</dd>
<dd>B. I believe the category of documentary film is special. Often, documentary is shot on extremely low budgets, and distribution is extremely difficult. "Getting the word out" is also not easy. On the flip side, documentarians have produced some significant material about the human experience. Now, I'm sure by now some of you are singing "Cry Me A River", but my point is this: if Wikipedia is to be the world's encyclopedic resource, it seems that one of the best things it can do is retain significant information about a very underreported area of art with a high level of social importance.</dd>
<dd>C. I don't believe that retaining information about documentary film, so long as it is accurate, will cost this site money or prestige. Far from it. As evidenced by a number of documentaries over the past few years, the category of documentary film is growing and I think wikipedia should be a resource for such films.</dd>
<dd>D. I won't pretend to have an answer for how to distinguish a notable documentary from one of lesser quality. In these days of reality television and YouTube, such a distinction is likely to become more difficult, not less. In any event, I believe this to be a very important issue, and I pledge to stay involved with it.</dd>
<dd>E. Turning to this debate specifically, I would make the following proposal and commitment to the Wikipedia community. (i) We would be wholly comfortable if the suggestion above to move our entry to Votergate (film) was approved. (ii) We would be willing to undertake the creation and buildout of an "Election Reform (films)" entry, where all the films on this subject, including ours, would be accurately described with the appropriate links. This would obviously be a longer term project and would include a great number of films over the last few decades.</dd>
<dd>F. Finally, to clear up at least a few issues raised above. Votergate is entirely non-partisan. We premiered this film at the National Press Club in early October '04 and had both John McCain's campaign manager Trevor Potter from the Election Reform Institute, and folks from more left-of-center good government groups like Common Cause presenting at the same podium. We have footage from the event and the subsequent premieres that I would be happy to post at YouTube if you require sourcing. In addition, the film was accepted into and screend at both the Hamptons Film Festival and the Eureka Film Festival. It is certainly true that this is not on the level of "Sundance", but it is a well-established festival with significant respect in the industry. With regard to IMDb, we feel very lucky to be listed there. I can tell you with 100% certainty that IMDb is absolutely curated and it is difficult for indie documentaries to get on the site. We certainly felt that was an achievement.</dd>
<dd>G. In conclusion, we feel documentaries of merit should be listed here at Wikipedia. I would suggest that acceptance in one or more film festivals, broadcast on television and budget size (ours was over $100K) could play a role in determining notability. In the end, it is my hope that Wikipedia will err on the side of being overly inclusive where documentary film is concerned, especially where issues of such importance are at stake. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to discussing this issue further with you all. Vgate Producer 19:41, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>a) Wikipedia is not a repository of produced films, its not IMDB. As an encyclopedia it would lose any respect if it just turned into a repository of stuff, people looking for a film to watch should not goto an encyclopedia, they should goto IMDB, Blockbuster etc.</dd>
<dd>b} Wikipedia currently does "retain significant information about a very underreported area of art with a high level of social importance", it has an article on documentaries, your own documentary doesn't fit this bill as its too specific and not about an art, but just a specific topic. However further, its not wikipedia job to promote anything including areas of art with little attention.</dd>
<dd>c} As pointed out in point A, which is something I particularly feared was being argued by the other user, Wikipedia is not IMDB. Its not here to promote or expose anything and its not here to be a respository of every film ever made nor book printed etc.</dd>
<dd>d) We have guidelines and proposed ones, you can read that WP:Notability (films), things such as awards would help, screenings, records, etc. This film particularly doesn't meet any of that.</dd>
<dd>e) If you would like to create an article on the phenomenon of voter films then feel free to do that, this article however is not about that and its deletion or non-deletion would not be based on its creation or lack there of. Further per WP:RS and WP:V you would need sources that meet those requirements to discuss those films and the points in the article you attempt to right, remember to follow WP:OR.</dd>
<dd>f) IMDB entries can be added by the readers, its not 100% "curated", there are also thousands of festivals world wide, determining notability by appearing in the non-notable ones does not work, an appearance at Sundance or Cannes would have went further, an award at one of them even further. However lacking even those leaves little left.</dd>
<dd>g) Its already been established by the general concensus on Wikipedia that not all films deserve articles and surely not all documentaries of there being millions or varrying notability and quality. I keep hearing issues of importance, and that is a problem, as every documentary is created by someone thinking the issue is important, its very subjective, hence why criteria is based on notability, not subject.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the commentary. I am not adding them to show notability. I am adding them because they are relevant articles to Votergate. Smeelgova 17:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>The topic of the articles are Hacking Democracy, to say they are relevant simply because they are mentioned, even though they arent the topic is not really of quality for External links. EL's are suppose to have information about the subject that the article does not, in this case that is not what is taking place. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 20:30, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. First, I hope we can agree that Hollywood Reporter is a reliable, independent source. (If we cannot so agree, there are several other sources including Forbes Magazine that reported this story.) Second, if you read this article, you will see that Diebold, a multinational, extremely powerful, well-established, public company with billions of dollars (US) in revenue, actually was so affected by the material contained in Votergate, that it took it upon itself to invest significant resources in attempting to shut down a film that it THOUGHT was descendent from Votergate. In other words, Diebold believed, albeit mistakenly, that the HBO film WAS a new/revised Votergate. Diebold felt that they had to shut it down because it was so powerful and damaging to them, and they attempted to do so. If this is not an example of notability, I don't know what is. This particular source article relates directly to Diebold's corporate "state of mind" when they sent the cease and desist letter to HBO, and effectively demonstrates how powerful Votergate continues to be since its release 2 years ago. The Votergate revelations spoke truth-to-power and caused questioning of Diebold's shoddy and insecure system design by activists, legislators and election officials around the country, which in turn resulted in millions of dollars in lost Diebold contracts. Diebold could not afford another Votergate. Diebold could not let another Votergate see the light of day, and, believing that another Votergate was coming out, Diebold attempted to squash it with its full corporate armamentarium. You demand evidence of notability? This article has it in spades. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_miser_7ab4.html" title="User:Heat miser">Heat miser</a> 05:38, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
