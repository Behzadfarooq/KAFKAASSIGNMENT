Birt Acres</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>He applied for a job with Birt Acres, another almost forgotten film pioneer. Acres specialized in photographic emulsions. In 1892, he became manager of Elliott &amp; Sons, manufacturers of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographic_plate.html" title="Photographic plate">photographic plates</a> in Barnet. Acres experimented with movement during the projection of clouds and waves, which he took on successive series of glass plates. He could, therefore, use the assistance of young Cooper as experienced photographer.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a>, Cooper assisted Acres on a journey to film the commercial opening of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_Ship_Canal_4984.html" title="Manchester Ship Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a> on <a href="../../../7/0/_/70_mm.html" title="70 mm">70 mm</a> film. This film size was introduced by <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodak.html" title="Kodak">Kodak</a> for their snapshot cameras. Acres glued three or four of these films together into one roll and used this for his first film camera. Later that year, they filmed with the same camera at the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henley_Regatta_5ab5.html" title="Henley Regatta">Henley Regatta</a>. A strip of this film is kept in the archives of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Modern_Art_08fc.html" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> (Moma) in New York.</p>
<p><a name="Kinetoscopes" id="Kinetoscopes"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Melbourne-Cooper_9a32.html" title="Edit section: Kinetoscopes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kinetoscopes</span></h3>
<p>In the same year, the first <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetoscope.html" title="Kinetoscope">Kinetoscopes</a> appeared. These machines used 35 mm film. The German chocolate manufacturer, Ludwig Stollwerck, who had large interests in <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slot_machine.html" title="Slot machine">slot machine</a> shops in several countries, asked Acres to provide him regularly with 35 mm films for the Kinetoscopes which he acquired from <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Edison_ebd8.html" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a>'s agents. Acres re-designed his camera and, in 1895, patented a 35 mm camera, the "Kineopticon", on the construction of which he was assisted by a young mechanical engineer, Robert W. Paul. In March 1895, Acres filmed with this camera <i>Waves at Dover Pier</i>, and later the <i><a href="../../../e/p/s/Epsom_Derby_8317.html" title="Epsom Derby">Epsom Derby</a></i> and the <i>Oxford and Cambridge <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat_Race_8d65.html" title="Boat Race">Boat Race</a></i>.<br />
In June 1895, Acres travelled to Germany to sign a contract with Stollwerck and to film the <i>Opening of the <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiel_Canal_6b5d.html" title="Kiel Canal">Kiel Canal</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiser_Wilhelm_2aa1.html" title="Kaiser Wilhelm">Kaiser Wilhelm</a> Reviewing his Troops</i>. Acres was therefore the first who traveled abroad in order to make newsreels. Soon, his films were shown, not only in England and Germany, but also in Denmark and America, where Acres had sold his cameras and projectors. During the next two years, young Cooper was cameraman for many of the short films which were produced for the Kinetoscopes, such as <i>Arrest of a Pickpocket</i> and <i>Spilt Milk</i> in which a farm hand unsuccessfully flirts with a maid who is milking a cow.</p>

<p>In 1897, Cooper made a trick film <i><a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird%27s_Custard_a500.html" title="Bird's Custard">Bird's Custard Powder</a></i> in which the contemporary Bird's poster comes to life. An old man, walking downstairs carrying a tray of eggs, trips over and smashes them. But no worry - he uses Bird's Custard Powder. Cooper also made a commercial for <i>Keen's Mustard</i> for which he animated the setting sun at Blackpool into a rising sun.</p>

<p>In 1899, Cooper made for <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryant_and_May_ee25.html" title="Bryant and May">Bryant and May</a> what is considered the earliest surviving stop-motion advertising film, <i>Matches Appeal</i> (also known as <i>Matches: An Appeal</i>). The film contains an appeal to send money to Bryant and May who would then send matches to the British troops which were fighting in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Boer_War_db66.html" title="Second Boer War">Boer War</a> in South Africa. It was shown in December 1899 at The Empire Theatre in London. This film is the earliest known example of stop-motion animation. Little puppets, constructed of matchsticks, are writing the appeal on a black wall. Their movements are filmed frame by frame, movement by movement. With this film Britain was 6 or 7 years ahead of animation pioneers in France and the United States.<br />
When he was needed, Cooper assisted Birt Acres who had established the Northern Photographic Works for the manufacture of 35 mm film stock. In his own time Cooper filmed many short comedies, newsreels, sports events and travelogues. He sold them to R.W. Paul, the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwick_Trading_Company_4429.html" title="Warwick Trading Company">Warwick Trading Company</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Urban_bfd3.html" title="Charles Urban">Charles Urban</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Williamson_72c8.html" title="James Williamson">James Williamson</a>, William Jury, the Walturdaw Company, and many others, also abroad.</p>

Bert Massey and Bertha Cooper in <i>Grandma's Reading Glass</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1900, Cooper made another "first". He filmed in his father's photographic studio in St Albans a boy and a girl who are playing grandson and grandmother in <i>Grandmother's Reading Glass</i>, of which film historians generally agree it is the first instance where close-ups are deliberately cut into a medium shot. He sold this film to William Jury, Pathé and the Warwick Trading Company. The close-ups represent what the boy sees through grandmother's magnifying glass and are much enlarged projected on the screen: a <a href="../../../b/o/v/Bovril.html" title="Bovril">Bovril</a> advertisement in a newspaper, a cat's head, a canary in a cage, and grandmother's eye. The girl playing grandmother is Cooper's youngest sister Bertha, the boy is Bert Massey, a young son from the neighbours, and the eye in the close-up is that of Cooper's mother Catherine Cooper.<br />
Unfortunately, long before the film was rediscovered in Denmark in 1960, the French film historian <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georges_Sadoul_e065.html" title="Georges Sadoul">Georges Sadoul</a>, in his "Histoire du Cinéma Mondial", credited it to a Brighton Film-maker, Georges Albert Smith (1864-1959) who, in 1903, had made his own version. It is a pity that Cooper's version is disputed and sometimes still credited to Smith.<br /></p>

<i>MacNab's Visit to London</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1903, Cooper was commissioned by the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Cavendish%2C_10th_Duke_of_Devonshire_0290.html" title="Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire">Duke of Devonshire</a> to film a garden party at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatsworth_House_fc30.html" title="Chatsworth House">Chatsworth House</a> in honour of the King and Queen. He astonished the guests by filming them during the day and showing the developed film in the ballroom the same evening. He repeated this feat by filming the <i><a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Handicap_d827.html" title="Lincoln Handicap">Lincoln Handicap</a></i> (1903) and later the <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_National_28a5.html" title="Grand National">Grand National</a></i> (1903), showing the films the same evening at The Empire Theatre, processing them in a railway coach on the way back to London. This was reported in the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i> as a record.<br />
In 1904, he filmed a drama <i>Rescued in Mid-Air</i> in which a lady, after a traffic accident, finds herself floating in the air hanging onto an umbrella. She strands on a church spire, from which she is rescued by a professor in a helicopter-like flying machine. Cooper, possibly for the first time in film history, used tracking shots of the floating lady and applied parallel action scenes of the lady on the spire, cheering crowds in the street and the flying professor in the air.<br />
Cooper played, as the Scotchman MacNab, the lead in the slapstick send-up of the game of golf, <i>MacNab's Visit to London</i> (1905). He made <i>The Motor Pirate</i> (1906), which is one of his masterpieces, in which bandits in an armoured car are making the roads unsafe several years before army tanks were constructed.

<p>The demand for moving pictures was great in those early days, and during this time Cooper sometimes made almost a new film every day. Cooper's films were sought after because of his many outdoor locations. One of his popular dramas was <i>The Blacksmith's Daughter</i> (1904) about a young girl deceived by the local squire. Another one was <i>For An Old Love's Sake</i> (1908) about a rich man's suicide who, with his life insurance, rescues his warden from ruin.<br /></p>

<i>A Dream of Toyland</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These films are still in existence, just like the little gem <i>A Dream of Toyland</i> (1907), in which dolls and toys are wonderfully animated to play, in a dream of a young boy, their roles according to the one-frame, one-picture technique. "A stop-and-start film", as Cooper himself used to call it. No less then 76 copies were sold to the United States and many others to several countries abroad. This was followed by another animated film, <i>Noah's Ark</i> (1908) in which a young girl dreams that Noah and the animals of her toy ark come to life.<br />
In order to protect his rights as maker and producer of these films which were too often copied or duped, Cooper, in 1906, became one of the founder-members of the British Kinematograph Manufacturers Association, KMA. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> commissioned him to make a documentary, <i>London to Killarney</i> (1907) which, at 3000 feet in length (some 50 minutes in projection), is one of the longest films made at that time. In 1905 he made a remarkable documentary, <i>The Empire's Money Maker</i>, or <i>A Visit to the Royal Mint</i>. It is one of the earliest surviving examples of available light documentaries, because Cooper was not allowed to use artificial light when filming inside the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Mint_5401.html" title="Royal Mint">Royal Mint</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Melbourne-Cooper_9a32.html" title="Edit section: St Albans Picture Palace">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">St Albans Picture Palace</span></h3>
<p>A palace for moving pictures: in 1908, Cooper, in order to lift going to the cinema from its low status, opened in St Albans what the <i>Shell Book of Firsts</i> considers to be one of the first cinemas as we know them today: the Alpha Picture Palace which had a sloping floor, a separate fire-proof projection booth, uniformed ushers and usherettes, free teas during the intervals, and the cheapest seats in front, not at the back. All these features got special attention in the press. The St Albans Picture Palace was a commercial success. In the same year, he married the young Kate Lacey. They had three children.</p>
<p>In February 1909, he visited Paris where he had been once or twice before on business, but this time to represent his Alpha Trading Company at the first international film congres, the <i>Congrès International des Éditeurs du Film</i>, in order to secure the rights of film producers. In the same year, encouraged by the success of his new cinema in St Albans, he opened in <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letchworth.html" title="Letchworth">Letchworth</a> a second Picture Palace. This was not a success in a town populated by church-going people who disliked the moving pictures. Two fires in the cinema got Cooper into serious financial diffculties.</p>

<p>After twelve years, Cooper folded up his businesses in St Albans and, with his wife and young children, he moved to Manor Park, Lee. During the day he made here a series of surprising puppet animation pictures for Butcher's Empire Films, which had its studios at the back of his garden. One of his most beautiful animation films was <i>Cinderella</i> (1912), which was distributed in hand-coloured versions. In the evenings Cooper, for a while, became manager of a new cinema in Harrow, paying his debts in St Albans.<br /></p>

<p>With his assets of the Alpha Trading Company and capital of a semi-retired officer, Andrew Heron, Cooper established Heron Films Ltd., a company which set out to produce longer films, comedies and dramas, with the theatrical company of Mark Melford, a well-known actor in those days. Cooper also established Kinema Industries Ltd, for which he made several documentaries and newsreels, among which the notorious <i>The Suffragette Derby</i> of 1913 at <a href="../../../e/p/s/Epsom.html" title="Epsom">Epsom</a>, in which suffragette <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emily_Davison_c965.html" title="Emily Davison">Emily Davison</a> can be seen being trampled to death by the King's racing horse. It was filmed by Cooper with his camera at the finish and his brother Hubert at <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tattenham_Corner_a796.html" title="Tattenham Corner">Tattenham Corner</a>.<br />
Both companies were wound up at the outbreak of the First World War when Andrew Heron reported himself for active service. Cooper became munition inspector in Luton, while the family lived nearby in <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunstable.html" title="Dunstable">Dunstable</a>. After the First World War, Cooper and his family moved to Blackpool where he became manager of Animads, a subdivision of Langford's Advertising Agency Ltd. He made a number of animated advertisements films. Among them: <i><a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadbury.html" title="Cadbury">Cadbury</a>'s chocolates</i>, <i><a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddy_Whiskey_702d.html" title="Paddy Whiskey">Paddy Whiskey</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_Roll_3677.html" title="Swiss Roll">Swiss Rolls</a></i>, and <i>Clean Milk Campaign</i>.</p>

<p>Arthur Melbourne-Cooper retired in 1940 and moved to Coton near Cambridge. Here, in 1961, he died. His wife died the next year. They are buried in the cemetery of St John's Church, Coton. Though he is almost forgotten today, he lived long enough to give testimony of those very first years of film history and of his own career in a number of interviews of which 15 were recorded on 17 reel-to-reel tapes.<br />
In 1996, the city of St Albans with the British Film Institute, to celebrate 100 years of British films, erected a plaque on a flat building at the corner of Alma Road and London Road, commemorating that Cooper once had on this spot his Alpha Cinematograph Works.<br />
The above information comes from sources, much of which was collected by Cooper's eldest daughter Audrey Wadowska (1909-1982) during a 25-year research about her father's career. The following lists are a selection of the most important sources and references. A complete list of sources, references and literature is published by Tjitte de Vries in <i>Arthur Melbourne-Cooper, A Documentation of Sources</i>, Frankfurt am Main 2004.</p>
