<p><b>Delete</b> - Article was originally succesfully <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prodded</a>, but then recreated by <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a>. The organization itself has little notability outside of its own members. Most of its Google hits are either promotional press releases or single name mentions in a CJN article. They seem to be not much more than a fringe group, one of any number of left wing independentist Jewish groups who make similar claims to "represent" the Jewish left. As someone who is involved at the national executive level of the Jewish community, I can tell you that I hadn't heard of this group until I stumbled across the article. IMO, the article itself is a vanity page. Perhaps, if they gain stature as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Jewish_Congress_c521.html" title="Canadian Jewish Congress">Congress</a> of the "Left" they should be entitled to a page. But at this point, the organization does not meet any standard of inclusion criteria and is simply unknown in the community, completely NN. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 05:14, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia is not a place for promoting a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point of view</a>. By claiming that this organization is notable "because their existence shows dissent", meaning that they are notable by virtue of their representing the "other side", you are demonstrating that this article is simply to promote a point of view. - <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 20:54, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's rather convoluted logic. NPOV means we have to have a balanced viewpoint in articles and in the encyclopedia as a whole - this means reflecting various sides of a debate even if one side is much larger than the other. No one is saying the ACJC is "as notable" as the CJC or B'nai Brith but they are notable because they represent a dissenting voice. Recognising that is not promoting their point of view, it's simply being NPOV as an encyclopedia. Similarly, if the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Canadian_Congress_6da1.html" title="Muslim Canadian Congress">Muslim Canadian Congress</a> had the same general viewpoint as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Islamic_Congress_e1b1.html" title="Canadian Islamic Congress">Canadian Islamic Congress</a> there size alone (about 100, same as the ACJC) might not make them notable enough for an entry but as they represent a dissident liberal voice in the Islamic community (against Sharia law, for separation of church and state, for same sex marriage) their notability is established. We shouldn't be pretending that the Jewish community in Canada or internationally is monolithic and speaks with only one voice, that is not only POV and one-sided but it discredits the Jewish community and we shouldn't be doing that.<a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Homey_391b.html" title="User:Ex-Homey">Ex-Homey</a> 21:58, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> -- the ACJC is just one example of a significant development -- the growth of organisations willing to speak out as Jews against Israeli policy. Whether you agree with them or not, you cannot ignore the phenomenon. The proposal to delete seems to be an attempt to marginalise this viewpoint. But that is not the way to conduct a political argument. Leave the article on Wikipedia, and engage in any polemic on the talk page, or elsewhere.
