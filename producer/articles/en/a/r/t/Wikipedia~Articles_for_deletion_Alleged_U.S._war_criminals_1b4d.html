<li><b>Keep</b> If you are not aware of the scores of scholars and human rights activists who accuse each of these U.S. officials of war crimes, then you are too ignorant to work on it. (I will add them, but this article for now, just like every other article on this site according to all the disclaimers that I have been reading, is a work in progress.) It is not "original research." Actually, I know that "original research" is not the real motive to get rid this article.

<li>I can just about believe that this COULD be NPOV, if exact details of who had accused that person of war crimes were included (and limited to formal sources). If it were, though, it would probably live somewhere like <i>US Citizens accused of war crimes</i> - or be incorporated into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_war_crimes.html" title="List of war crimes">List of war crimes</a> (which itself has issues with encyclopaedicness at the moment).

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is another list, and has all the usual problems of such, centering on the problem that the criterion for inclusion on the list is unclear and not agreed, and even when the criterion is relatively clear, it is still often a POV whether something should be listed or not. Unlike regular articles, where facts and arguments related to the matter can be presented, lists are binary: something is either on the list or it is not. Of necessity, if there is a dispute over inclusion, one POV gets to win, since an item can't be both on a particular list and not on it at the same time. That means that many lists inherently violate NPOV. People reacting negatively to this list might reconsider their support for a substantial number of the list articles. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:52, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

As it stands now, the article/list is POV. One of the first things I was taught in journalism school is that the word "alleged" is not a protection against libel, and should not be used to further an agenda. My biggest problem is the article itself reads like a criminal indictment document which renders it completely POV because there will be people wanting to argue the opposite. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:45, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/retitle or merge preferable</b> Just make sure that none of these officials are indicted by any legitimate authority (a disclaimer that ought to be noted in the intro) but rather accused of a host of things by advocacy groups.

<li><b>Keep</b> but improve along the lines suggested by <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">BD2412</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a>, and <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a>. Although past VfD votes don't establish binding precedents, I note that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_War_Atrocities_d9b0.html" title="List of Japanese War Atrocities">List of Japanese War Atrocities</a> survived VfD even <i>without</i> the "alleged" in the title. In voting to delete that one (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Japanese_War_Atrocities_delete_9325.html" title="Talk:List of Japanese War Atrocities/delete">discussion</a>), I said, "NPOV permits citation of attributed charges of atrocities . . . ." The article we're now voting on takes that approach. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 05:02, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, clearly not neutral and unlikely that it ever can be. There is room for Allegations of war crimes by the United States, but this should probably be written from scratch, and should make a clear distinction between <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crimes</a>, which this article does not.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 16:40, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Would do much to <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">counter systemic bias</a> to have a page detailing US war crimes as well as Japanese, German etc. Just because no American has been prosecuted for war crimes doesn't mean that they haven't occurred. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 03:24, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, obviously List of notable schools in United States shows that everything American should be out of Wikipedia (see also <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">WP:VFU</a>). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 05:45, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
