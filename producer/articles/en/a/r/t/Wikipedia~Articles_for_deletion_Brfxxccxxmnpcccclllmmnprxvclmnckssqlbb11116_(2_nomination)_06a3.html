<li>Karada, to validly merge any content the history needs to be kept too. Either you have to get an admin to do a history merge or retain a redirect.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

First of all, this means that the article doesn't really contribute to the rest of the encyclopedia. Second, the other articles linked from those lists all seem to have some substantial claim to notability as people, whereas this one is just an anecdote. Finally, the verification worries me too; the sources are weak, and they've clearly been squeezed for every last drop of information.

<li><s>(edit conflict) <b>Weak Fringing Keep</b> First and foremost, this is a spoken article (that didn't effect my opinion), which is pretty wacky.

<dd>The 'A' name is listed there twice, I think if both of those names belong to one person they should stay on the same person.

<li>I would like to see this article <b>merged</b> into an article about the law in question. It could include what if any controversy surrounded the law's introduction, public reaction, events that led to the case, and fallout (if any) after this case. That would be a good read; if there's insufficient information available, perhaps an article about legal controversies or challenges to laws in Sweden? I'm not familiar enough with the country to recommend a specific place to put it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A lot of electrons are spilled at AfDs about whether or not a topic is real or notable or important. While one would think they were based on their use, there is no policy regarding notability or importance, just guidelines and suggestions. The real question ought to be: "<i>is it encyclopedic?</i>" Does this article provide understanding of the topic at hand so as to its meaning and how it relates to the broader field of knowledge of which it forms part? In pondering this, I read the entry for <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. I know that's not a policy either, but it certainly provides some guidance. Looking at <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, I have to conclude that this article is not encyclopedic.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. People "manufacture" notability all the time, some by hook, some by crook. I could "manufacture" my notability by writing a bestseller fantasy trilogy or some other stuff like that. (One day. One day. =) That said, I fail to see the worth of the subject of the article aside of perfectly good material for <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">WP:UA</a>. Even if I'd support unusual "unusual" encyclopedic topics, I'm not sure if this is famous enough of a case.
