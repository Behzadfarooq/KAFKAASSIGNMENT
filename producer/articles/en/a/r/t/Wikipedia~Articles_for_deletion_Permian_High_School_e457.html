<li>The school was featured in a sports movie called <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_Lights_b557.html" title="Friday Night Lights">Friday Night Lights</a>, or something like that; apparently, they're a very highly-ranked high school football program. <b>No vote</b>. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 18:24, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Meelar is right. In fact, given the feature-film status of Permian, I'm very surprised that the article isn't larger. I'm not a football guy, but I watched <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_Lights_b557.html" title="Friday Night Lights">Friday Night Lights</a> on the way home from China. <b>Keep</b> as a stub, and maybe think about making it a contribution/project thingie. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.158.31.195.html" title="User:216.158.31.195">216.158.31.195</a> 18:34, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>. Is there anything to say about the school that is not covered by <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_Lights_b557.html" title="Friday Night Lights">Friday Night Lights</a>? Is it notable outside of the book/film? To give a different example, a number of people were featured in the documentary film <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116481/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116481/" rel="nofollow">Hands on a Hard Body</a></i>, who would not be notable except for their appearance in the film. In such a case I can see having an article about the film that mentions them, but not separate articles for each person, because their notability is restricted to appearance in that film and can be adequately addressed in that context. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 19:17, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Apologies to Tabor here; I inadvertently did a mouse drag and inserted a comment by me into his edit (sounds weird, but it's true) I said: "There really is little point listing this kind of school for deletion when perfectly normal junior schools are routinely saved without the benefit of print, silver or technicolor." --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:32, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There isn't really a good answer to your question; there's a lot of controversy over whether individual high schools are notable enough to get articles independently. See <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> for more. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 19:52, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although its not much of a stub, it does (through the reference to the "winningest football team") identify the school sufficiently, and for the reasons noted above the school has notability (if that were required for a school). <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 19:40, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this is one we can all agree on.

<li><b>Keep</b> - notable American Football team with a school attached. (School National Champions in 1972 and 1989). I may disagree with their priorities, but given that we'll write articles on every minor sportsperson, a team that attracts five figure crowds is notable. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 16:01, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Wow, you're right! It was listed for deletion <b>four minutes</b> after being created. This anti-school campaign is becoming very silly, and it has to be said, having a negligible effect, or possibly a large one in the direction opposite to that intended. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:26, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wow, heaven forbid that people who think that crap is crap should want to list it for deletion!!!!!

<li>Clearly the nominator here failed to do minimal research. This is not the way to perform cleanup or RC. The fact that since April 22nd some seventy school articles have been listed for deletion and their discussions all closed without deletion, and a further twenty deletion listings that have not yet been closed also seem to be headed for a non-delete result, also suggests to me that those nominating those ninety schools for deletion in the space of six weeks are failing to do proper research, failing to consider alternatives before going to VfD, and failing to judge the mood of Wikipedia on the matter of schools. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:18, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - On a side note, it makes me really feel as though wikipedia is getting its job done - from the first "winningest football team" entry to the current brief, but encyclopaedic, entry, the article's really evolved <i>because</i> of the spotlight cast on it by VfD. Pretty neat. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.158.31.195.html" title="User:216.158.31.195">216.158.31.195</a> 18:14, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think I agree, but I'd rather see Wikipedia get to the point where admins on cleanup use Google more so we don't end up with an article on VfD in the first place.

<li>They wouldn't have had the chance with this one, it was on VfD within four minutes.
