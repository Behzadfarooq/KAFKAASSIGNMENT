<li><b>Keep</b> Perhaps if we've never heard of a described product type and it doesn't exist on the internet, it's not real!? Luckily neither is the case. If this were an advertisement, I would then label it as weak, a weak (possibly counterproductive) advertisement. I prefer to research things before commenting, let alone taking the time to actually add a wiki. A quick YAHOO on *purifying drink* brings up the official website of the said American product, and a YAHOO on *soberade* brings up about a dozen of the European versions of the described product type. Another easily obtained widley distributed news article shows how a french version of the product type was banned from France (aka controversial). Of course REDBULL and TUARINE were also banned in the U.S. in '92, although that didn't last very long obviously. If Wiki were around in the early 90's it may have been a bit pretentious to delete the *energy drink* entry, just because no one knew of this phenom product type in the states for years after it had arrived. I suppose we could delete all new, underground or relatively unknown product categories until they are readily available at WalMart or MTV breaks a big story on them, but I dont have that kind of time, and it seems very anti-wiki to me. --Cadillacula 00:46, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment: Re-creating</b> Okay based on the above comments I am recreating the Purifying Drink article, void of a specific product name or example. It simply describes a product category. Please refrain from saying the product type or category doesn't exist... simple type in "purifying drink" or "SOBERADE" into YAHOO and browse through a dozen products on the market or so that lower B.A.C. - Wiki users deserve to be aware of such products, wether popular or not. Order the products via their respective online stores for even further physical proof.</li>
<li><b>Lastly</b>, if one 10 word sentence of the Purifying Drink was a source of issue... why will no one petition the following far more blatant and detailed advertisements for deletion?: <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockstar_Energy_Drink_a5d1.html" title="Rockstar Energy Drink">Rockstar Energy Drink</a>, Monster Energy Drink(search), Von Dutch Energy Drink(search)... Before an article about a product type (Purifying Drink) is again brought under fire, I feel one must explain why the previously mentioned advertisements on specific product brands are allowed to exist unscathed. Fair enough?--Cadillacula 22:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Google is the search engine of whose choice exactly? KEEP - it's now a non brand-specific nuetral and new (to some?) broad product category/type description. Oh dear, I wonder if this is what it was like for the first man who discovered fire and tried to bring it back to his tribe. I am not sure why my research is proving far more effective than a few of the others here, it seems so simple. Next time you are conducting extensive research on the said product type with your *search engine of choice* try OUTOX, DTOX, BANGOUT drink, SECURITY FEEL BETTER, SOBERGUARD, NOTOX drink, the list goes on. Real products you can purchase and consume, right now. I apologize if I am the first one to expose this product category to the known world. All very convincing as 'purifying drinks' and 'soberades'. Again I ask if something is not instantly evident in someone’s quick off the cuff internet search does this mean its not real or its presence shouldn't be felt on Wiki. Is it inconcievable that a piece of new knowledge be made more readily accesible to a Wiki user than to a Google user? My point is clearly not to advertise any brands (unlike the dozens of *energy drink* Wiki entries) only the CATEGORY. Contrary to someone elses findings, two of the ENERGY drinks I specified (Monster Energy Drink and Von Dutch Energy Drink) do indeed have WP articles which read like true advertisements, however for whatever fault of the Wiki system, they only show when you do a specific search and click on their 100% relevant listing, as I thought I clearly indicated by putting the word SEARCH after I mentioned each of them (see *Lastly* above). Rockstar is factual, exists, and makes unproven claims to boost energy, mind and spirit with special ingredients, it is also far more of a specific brand advertisement (posted by its founder) than a quick article about a new type of drink category.

<li><b>Delete?</b> On the other hand the following article, for example, is an advertisement: <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockstar_Energy_Drink_a5d1.html" title="Rockstar Energy Drink">Rockstar Energy Drink</a>, most likely posted by the noted guerilla style marketer Russell Goldencloud Weiner.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I believe my original words on the article's discussion page will suffice: "I have challenged the deletion of this article for the following reasons: This is the second-most important speech tournament in the US, open to far more than just the "Catholic home school debate" that the claimant mentioned. (In fact, it is open to both public and private schools.) There is substantial precedent for making articles for each year's version of an event - see the Super Bowl or the World Cup - and, even if this is a speech tournament, I believe that there is a strong enough speech community to churn out plenty of info for articles like this one. (See Victory Briefs Daily <a href="http://www.victorybriefsdaily.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.victorybriefsdaily.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> for just what I mean, though you might have to check a few months back to find the NCFL and not NFL stuff.) --JKLPirate 02:12, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no assertion of notability and I can't find any. I don't know where the points above about "sounds like a really big shopping center" come from.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Shopping centres certainly can be notable, particularly if they are the largest in the region or architecturally notable. However, this one does not fit either category. The line has to be drawn somewhere or else every shopping arcade in the world could be included.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Many of the keep comments can be discounted on the basis of their being based on the commentors experience rather than applicable policy. The argument that this should be kept because it doesn't fit in the main article is somewhat redundant, if it is POV there then it is POV here. There don't seem to be enough sources to warrant a separate article from the parent, and with the quotations removed from the article, it would be best presented in the main article, giving the information the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">due weight</a> it deserves.

<li>Please read the verifiability policy carefully:<i>Articles should rely on <b>credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy</b>. For academic subjects, the sources should preferably be peer-reviewed. <b>Sources should also be appropriate to the claims made: outlandish claims beg strong sources.</b></i>. One peer reviewed obscure journal article (with a sample size of six subjects ) plus some large scale surveys whose only source is a Falun Gong promotional page is not sufficient here, especially given the enormous claims made by these reports. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:17, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>ok. that seems a good comment. If I understand correctly, so you mean although the source is a published journal paper, it has to be cited by any other source to be cited on wiki?

<li><b>Delete</b> per the above. Over 50% of the article is text copied from elsewhere. Might as well read the original studies if you want the info.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I second fnhddzs's words and want to add that, as part of the Falun Gong article, this information is very relevant since one of the most common claims made by Falun Gong practitioners, as well as the founder himself, is that it is beneficial to health. The page mostly contains results from actual scientific and physiological research and surveys. Although these researchers may support Falun Gong, that does not render their findings POV. The fact that they were published in scientific journals furthers their credibility. I don't know what you're talking about regarding a connection between the editors and the researchers. Also, like all wiki pages, this page is subject to improvement and further editing. I expect that the majority of the quotes will be better summarized in the near future.<a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMcconn_bf39.html" title="User:Mcconn">Mcconn</a> 07:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As I mentioned above, wiki does not care about whether it is genunine or not. For example, if Wallstreet newspaper said a physicist named ABC said the moon is tetrahedron. Wiki articles could report it as long as it mentioned the source since the Wallstreet newspaper is a nice source. <a href="../../../f/n/h/User%7EFnhddzs_3193.html" title="User:Fnhddzs">Fnhddzs</a> 19:39, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry. If an article starts with <i>Research into</i> I expect an article on a research <i>field</i>. Something that has produced enough peer-reviewed journal articles to write a balanced review <b>summarizing</b> the key theories and disputes. Replicating the findings of <i>one</i> third-tier article is not what the title of this article implies, and looking at the edit history I'm not confident that this article will go anywhere, lengthy discussions on the talk page or not.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd say it's relevant of course, no issue with that.

The publisher of claims of positive health benefits from their own research surely cannot be "reliable" in this sense. Note the definition of a primary source includes the following: "In general, Wikipedia articles should not depend on primary sources but rather on reliable secondary sources who have made careful use of the primary-source material." I don't think (from what I have seen) this has occurred in this case. But I say Keep, and feel sure it will be sorted given time. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 13:38, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The large-scale surveys sourced from <a href="http://www.falunau.org/healthsurvey.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.falunau.org/healthsurvey.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> appear to be highly dubious too. For instance, these supposedly official scientific studies demonstrate their methodological authority by stating "The data was input into a computer.... The data was analyzed with Microsoft Office 97 Excel version 8.0" (how impressive!). To confirm (why does this have to be confirmed in this way?) something as simple as gender and age distribution of their sample size, the researchers confidently state that used two different statistical methods (again with the indisputable Excel 8.0). The conclusions of the surveys are also completely pro-Falun Gong with very little scientific discussion. In fact, they sound like propaganda or advertising: <i>"The survey showed that the number of people learning Falun Gong was growing bigger and bigger. This was, based on the analysis of the survey, because 1) the practitioners of Falun Gong were able to prove its extraordinary effects through their own practice. After doing Falun Gong, their health was improved. Their intelligence was enhanced. Their minds were widened and clarified. Their bad habits were quit. Their family lives were in amity. They become compassionate in their hearts. Their relationships with other people were harmonized."</i>. This is nothing like genuine scientific research.

<p>"Verifiability" in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true. In fact, editors are strongly discouraged from conducting this kind of research, because original research may not be published in Wikipedia. Articles should contain only material that has been published by reliable sources, regardless of whether individual editors view that material as true or false. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth.</p>

<dd>Well, aside from the issue of basic verifiability in terms of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>, the only source for the large scale surveys is a Falun Gong promotion page. Take the large scale surveys out, and you're left with a sample size of six with six control subjects in a peer reviewed journal, which, well, raises the issue that not all peer reviewed journals are equally believable.

<li>Peer review is not sufficient to guarantee reliability of a source. Anyway, regarding the research study example which remains - this study, <a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2005.11.29" class="external text" title="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2005.11.29" rel="nofollow">according to its full abstract</a> takes 6 (six) Falun Gong practitioners who exercise in a Falun Gong way for 1-2 hours a day (and possibly exercise in other ways too for more time - the abstract isn't clear), for at least one year previously, and up to 5 years. These Falun Gong exercisers are then compared to a control group of 6(six) people who <i><b>have not followed any exercise program of any kind for 1 year or possibly longer</b></i>. This second group of people are called a "normal and healthy" group by the research authors. Now, I'm kind of a couch potato, but even I know that doing NO exercise whatsover for a YEAR is not "normal and healthy" (unless you're in some kind of manual labour job), and even a 6 year old can predict that the 6 who are doing special exercises 1-2 hours a day (more than most people!) possibly besides any other exercising will turn out to be healthier than the control group. Again, peer review is not the hallmark of sound research. Now I'm off to the gym machine. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:39, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I posted some impact data on the journal and the lone cite to the article on the Talk page. As I mentioned there, the article is probably worth a one-liner, with a caveat about micronumerosity. For those who don't know the scientific publishing industry,m at the bottom of every specialiaztion there are a lot of journals that are essentially scams that milk university libraries for shitloads of money. This journal, by impact factor, seems slightly above that level. It's still not anywhere near what I would consider a sole reliable source for a science article, not to mention that the article itself should write about seconday sources (textbook science), not paraphrase primary sources at length.

<li><b>Keep</b>. To get it out of the way, I've only got 31 main namespace edits, but no vested interest in the fate of this article. I've been reading the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Gong_9fb1.html" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> and related talk pages for a while, and at this point I tend to agree that this article is both required and probably the most neutral formulation of the name available. In response to Cordesat's argument, this isn't an indiscriminate list of information, as, from what I've read since first hearing about Falun Gong (May something or other), health benefits are pretty central to the practicioners' claims. Moreover, I tend to disagree with TeaDrinker that the name is inherently POV, or, rather, wonder if anyone can think of a better phrasing? "Supposed health benefits of Falun Gong" implies they're dubious, at best; "Health benefits of Falun Gong," that they're confirmed and true; perhaps, "Claimed health benefits..." As it stands now, the name only states that the claims of health benefits are being studied. All of this has been hotly debated on the main article's <a href="../../../f/a/l/Talk%7EFalun_Gong_1301.html" title="Talk:Falun Gong">talk page</a>. I'm the first to agree with Bwithh that the study which made up much of the content (it has since been removed) is an utter sham; that doesn't invalidate the topic, in my eyes. The current quality is marginal, but the numerous editors of the FG pages should be given a chance to keep working and clean this up; it's taken them quite a while just to get this far. At least let trialsanderrors' suggestion of <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a> run its course. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilodespotos_0942.html" title="User:Philodespotos">Philodespotos</a> 05:17, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First, on the name, I would recommend <i>health effects</i> rather than <i>health benefits</i>, but that's a minor issue.

Third, I tend to agree that health effects of FG warrants its own article <i>if there is in fact a research field on the topic</i>. And I'm less sanguine than you that this field actually exists in any meaningful way. Discussing one unvetted article at length is simply non encyclopedic, regardless of its scientific value. So the question is: <i>what other material is there to turn this into an encyclopedic article</i>?

<li><b>Strongly Keep</b>. Many sociological analyses of Falun Gong's spread in China are <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductionism.html" title="Reductionism">reductionist</a> instead of acknowledging that the relevant questions are extremely multifaceted. Falun Gong's popularity cannot be taken out of the context of its alleged (and possibly empirically verifiable) health effects. The Chinese government initially promoted Falun Gong because it could potentially save large sums of medical expenses. Falun Gong won several prizes and was nominated twice as the "Star Qigong School" in Beijing's Asian Health Expo in 1992 and 1993. The Chinese qigong community has cultural competence to evaluate the effectiveness of different practices, and Falun Gong is the most popular and widespread form of qigong in history. In addition, supernaturality has been one serious discourse in the scientific research on qigong for a couple of decades, so Falun Gong's extraordinary (and fantastical?) claims are no reason to belittle any serious considerations of its validity. Last but not least, this is a <b>daughter article</b>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You know what. I think the word "Research" implies some negative doubts on the object following it. It does not mean this article has to be about academic research.

<li><b>Keep</b> A really important aspect is that Falun Gong practice has really profound health benefits. Even Master Da Liu the Master who introduced Tai Chi to North AMerica said at the age of 95 that he now asks all his students to practice Falun Gong.. So research into health benefits of the system is really relevant. Further the research was done at Baylor College- one of the Nation's top 10 medical institutes..</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First congratulations to the great health benefits HappyInGeneral received. I would say although Falun Gong practitioners all say Falun Gong is good (even after 7 years of persecution), they say it with a solid reason of which health benefits are significantly correlated. Yeah, maybe personal testimonials here are not very to the point. But media reports mentioning health benefits would be helpful, I will try to find more of that. By the way, the cause for nomination of deletion was POV, now it changed? Anyway, we are doing a vote. Cause is not that important, I think. <a href="../../../f/n/h/User%7EFnhddzs_3193.html" title="User:Fnhddzs">Fnhddzs</a> 03:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I vote to keep.</li>
</ul>
<p>although science would probably be unable to completely prove health benefits of Falun Gong and qigong practices - since there is still an issue of belief and enlightening - there are at the same time hundreds of thousands if not millions of cases. Alot are also documented as self evident testimonies.<br />
It would be silly to ignore the experience of such a huge number of people just because they hadn't published it in a well known newspaper.<br />
Falun Dafa never bragged about being able to cure people, this is not a main purpose of the practice and there is no need to show those to prove or validate for Falun Dafa. It stands for itself in all its glory and splendor.<br />
For Wikipedia, which aims to have factual information, health benefits surely happened and there is no problem to mention it.<br />
Just my opinion, Kobi Lurie.<br />

The reason for this index page was to provide a method for Wikipedians and readers to see which articles are available inside Wikpedia (ie blue linked).

<li><b>Comment</b> A list of notable individuals associated with Australian history is different from an enumeration of biographies in a given reference volume; even as the content might be identical, the former would not need to reference the <i>Dictionary</i> (as, for example, any number of our lists, see, e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_novelists_from_the_United_States_f1d6.html" title="List of novelists from the United States">List of novelists from the United States</a>; there are, of course, those of us who believe categories comprise articles sufficiently such that lists aren't necessary, but there's no consensus for that view) and would surely be differently-titled. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:03, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page was originally created by user:Alacrainc (the user's only edit). The tone is of a sales brochure, not an encyclopedia article. It has been unimproved in over two months.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. This is a difficult debate to close, and I will do my best to explain my logic in closing it as "delete." The nomination has been proposed on grounds of non-notability. This is a common accusation against articles which turn up here, and an important one. Articles which fail to establish notability may be deleted even if they are verifiable and referenced. Now, there are four broad categories of "keep" votes present here.</p>
<p>The first asserts that all high schools are notable. One user cited <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> in support of this; this policy was rejected by the community and has no bearing here. Nowhere is there a binding assertion of notability for <i>high schools</i>, as opposed to four-year colleges and universities. No one has linked to any policies or guidelines which would reinforce such a view. The fact that previous articles on high schools are generally kept does not reinforce this debate. Therefore, such an assertion must be treated as a question of personal preference. The second category brings forth news sources to demonstrate notability. These sources discuss the school's construction. While the design of the school is indeed interesting, discussion of said design belongs in an article on urban design trends or architecture. The school itself cannot be notable in this instance simply for being built. Hundreds if not thousands are built or renovated every year; any local newspaper is bound to cover such a thing. There is no demonstrable evidence of wider notability for the <i>school</i> as opposed to the <i>design</i>. The third category is that of utility. Allow me to quote a user: "This is a valuable article for people that live near the school." That may be the case, but utility is not and never has been a reason to keep an article. Plenty of things are "useful." I find the walk-throughs on gameFaqs.com useful, but that doesn't make them worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia (not that such a consideration has prevented the ballooning of some game-related articles). The fourth category, finally, is the X, so Y category. Broadly, this is the assertion that because X exists, Y should exist; conversely, if Y is deleted, so should X. This has never been a proper keep/deletion criteria on Wikipedia. An article must stand or fall on its own merits or lack thereof, particularly when X and Y are not remotely similar in scope or quality.</p>
<p>In summation, then, this debate has failed to demonstrate a wider notability for this high school that would <i>at this time</i> merit inclusion in Wikipedia. It is entirely possible that future events will render said judgement obsolete, but Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Therefore: delete the current article, without prejudice to re-creation.

<li><b>1.</b> After the three seconds I looked at the SHS article I have no doubts that the article establishes notability. After looking at the AVHS article for three seconds I also had no doubts that notability was <i>not</i> established (although I did a Google news search just to be sure). <b>2.</b> There is no such thing as intrinsic notability. There are classes of objects that are considered notable because as a class they receive enough outside coverage that the discussion is moot. A Fortune 500 company is notable. A Formula 1 driver is notable. An accredited university is notable. High schools are not as a class notable. This doesn't mean there aren't high schools that are notable, it means that the listed articles have to establish notability for themselves.

<li><b>Comment</b> AVHS began last year and was heralded by the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_Sun_6e2b.html" title="Las Vegas Sun">Las Vegas Sun</a> as the "biggest and potentially most efficient campus the district has built" <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sun/2005/aug/29/519273478.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sun/2005/aug/29/519273478.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. The school was built to hold 2700 students, but currently only holds 1500. The building was designed to "rewrites the book on modern high school construction" according to the architect that designed it. The point to all of this is that this high school is completely notable, even though it isn't Stuyvesant. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 06:48, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I am usually a defender of school articles, however, I firmly believe that this article has no place on Wikipedia. I also disagree with Truthbringer's rationale, not every school is notable. If that rationale was true then we would have to extend it to every single establishment that exists within most towns and cities. This school was recently created and there is absolutely not claim to notability and it does no stress it's subject's notability. We speedy delete any article that comes through new pages that doesn't stress the importance of it's subject. What gives this school a special exception to go around the rules? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 06:17, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, I think the difference between a school and "every single establishment that exists within most towns and cities" is that a school is a place that children are forced to attend 6-8 hours 5 days a week. In that our children spend 30-40 hours in school each week, individual schools assume an extremely notable role in our society. The microcosm of their politics often reflects those of society as a whole. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 07:21, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But that doesn't make it notable. That makes it the standard normality. A school has to at least stress it's importance. I'll use a good example: <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_High_2e9a.html" title="BC High">the school I went to</a>. The reason for it's notability is not just the alumni lisy and the 140+ year history, but was also affliated with a college, gets mentioned in large papers for academics and athletics, and it actually does whatever it can to stick out. If we keep a high school article that DOESN'T stress any importance at all, and suggest we keep it because it's the normality, that just doesn't click. This school is also too recently formed. I don't object to most school articles since they at least present interesting facts and at least attempt to seperate the school from others. But this article in it's current condition, and with the current facts just doesn't merit an article yet. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 13:06, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strongest possible non-speedy delete</b>. I said this before - schools have <b>no</b> inherent notability. Give me a reason why this should be here (besides the fact that it exists), and I'll change my mind, but from the looks of it, there is nothing notable or newsworthy (on a national/international scale, mind you) about the school, any of its students, or any of its alumni. --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a> 06:54, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as the current article is written, this school is a total nonentity. I'm very much opposed to this idea that a school is somehow inherently notable because people attend it. Self-congratulatory public relations commentary from the city or the architects about its supposedly revolutionary design doesn't help with the notability case, and it doesn't sound like it's been around long enough to get any independent assessment thereof. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 08:33, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, schools are not instantly notable institutions, they are institutions but just because they belong to the general public does NOT make it a notable establishment. If this logic were true would we draw it to fire stations, police stations, etc. Since they also are part of public works. Something, I mean I use a small measure of something when dealing with school, has to happen to make in notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> I rarely vote in these school debates, but this one is too much. A recently-created high school that got a lot of local news coverage because it was created and has almost no other claim to importance? I'm sorry, but this fails any standard. If being a public building that people attend regularly is enough to be notable, then why is it that houses of worship that cannot assert notability are frequently deleted? Voluntary or involuntary attendance really doesn't change much. As far as I can tell, this article fails to assert its subject's notability, and were it anything other than a school (or maybe a Pokemon...) it would be nowhere near as controversial a deletion. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGassyGuy_6931.html" title="User:GassyGuy">GassyGuy</a> 07:32, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this article. Though needing expansion, it is inline with other properties listed on the Fairmont wiki page. I think it could use a clean up to get it to at least those standards. Now as to whether the Fairmont page should have all its properties listed...that is open for discussion (i'm sure wiki doesn't list all the Holiday Inns in the world). So...keep if we are going to keep the Fairmont entry as is and label as needing expansion...otherwise delete ALL the Fairmont properties links and just highlight significant ones within the Fairmont article (like the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa) <a href="../../../k/s/p/User%7EKsprayDad_7406.html" title="User:KsprayDad">KsprayDad</a> 07:08, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> let's all cool down and let me make my point clear. There is avery decent entry for the organization running all of these camps and I'm just saying that there is no need for individual entries. There are countless summer camps everywhere in the world and it seems pointless to me (but not to others) to have an entry for each of them. Camps that have a well-established history or a particular significance in some respect should stay. The articles posted up for deletion appear to be neither. Note that I am not advocating the deletion of the URJ article just the related campcruft ones. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The two articles for deletion today -- the Shefa Network article and this one -- both arguably have only modest (but not miniscule) notability compared to major Jewish denominations and figures. But they seem to be getting a different mixture of keep and delete comments.

<dd>I certainly wouldn't conclude that.

<p>Still I feel that this article is unmaintainable, and is not likely to be updated for some time considering the author of the article has left Wikipedia. Furthermore it doesnt really look that encyclopedic for a helper article of a major airport, and even if anyone is looking for such data, they'd look up the operating authority themselves.

<dd>Good point! Self-published fiction seems like it could fall outside the intent behind the prohibition of self-published works. That is, self-publishing is a legitimate route to notability in the realm of fiction (as opposed to astrophysics). I've just left the author a note regarding ways to demonstrate the book's notability. All in all, I should have used the "prod" tag instead of an AfD nomination.

<li><b>Delete</b> Certainly looks interesting, and there's definitely a market for it, though it hasn't seemed to find that market yet considering the hit count on the official site is around 500 and the book is only available from CafePress (at a jaw-dropping $21.00!!!).

<dd>Quick answer: Nominator knows nothing of radio presenters in that country. However.... it was likely from the articles themselves, that one was notable and the other two were unlikely to be. Which is basically what's being agreed by others who know more. (To answer your question, the basis for AFD was noting one NN creation, and checking the author's other recent edits as a matter of course. Its a commonsense check in case a person who's still learning WP policies, inadvertantly has created or edited other NN articles on a similar theme. Alan Jones was a similar theme.) <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 16:24, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. An article should support its own notability, even to a reader with no familiarity with the subject.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article does not make any sense to me. What is this "motion" thing? These curves are not wiggly worms, are they, that change shape as you look at them? What is on the horizontal axis of these curves? Isn't that time? So are there two kinds of time, a meta time for seeing how evolution in normal time evolves? And on whose authority does Wikipedia claim that shift, rotation and curvature are the three main movements? Rotation looks like pseudo scientific junk; it does not commute with linear scale transformations and can turn graphs of functions into non-functional graphs. "Curvature" does not appear to mean what <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curvature.html" title="Curvature">curvature</a> is supposed to mean. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>"What is on the horizontal axis of these curves?"</i>--- exactly! What do the axes mean? That is basically the problem with PCA; statisticians can't tell you what it means to rotate "options price" into "oil production" or whatever. The geometry makes sense because mathematicians can deal with abstract euclidean space, and the euclidean metric happens to be consonant with elementary parametric statistics (e.g. Gaussians), but how is one to interpret a rotation (as in the principle axis theorem) outside the realm of euclidean geometry (i.e. independent of the original meaning of the axes)? ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 10:10, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>People, people: you and I may be trained as mathematicians: we know what "rotation" and "curvature" are "supposed to mean", and we beat anyone with a big stick who is so <i>sloppy</i> as to use it to mean anything else, but it seems clear enough to me from the context that by rotation is meant "vertical shear" (which certainly does take functions to functions) and by "curvature" is meant some quadratic term. <a href="http://www.americanbanker.com/glossary.html?alpha=P" class="external text" title="http://www.americanbanker.com/glossary.html?alpha=P" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is just one of the many Google hits for <i>PCA "yield curve"</i>: note that it implies that yield curves are <i>the</i> important application of PCA in finance. <b>Keep</b>. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 10:36, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Undecided on this, but if it survives, it needs cleanup, as it reads like an advert with a NPOV veneer - virtually all citations are manufacturer's own claims, the section called "Criticism" simply shills for "Version II" (the fact it's $20 more than the original is hardly appropriate for an encyclopedia), and so on. Be careful with Ghit-counts on this one too, as I believe "das Keyboard" is acceptable German for "the keyboard", and that will distort the count. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 11:47, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>RJHall, I don't think that a link is the correct instrument to use if you want to specify which meaning of <i>trillion</i> you are refering to. If you use a link, the reader must follow the link to see what you mean. The text should stand on its own as much as possible. Either use scientific notation, or say "trillion (a million times a million)" or something like that. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 02:37, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes well I correctly enter a "million million" and then somebody (presumably unfamiliar with the ambiguity) "corrects" the text by replacing it by a "<a href="../../../t/r/i/Trillion.html" title="Trillion">trillion</a>". Comparable things happen with scientific notation. These things happen on Wikipedia, and linking to an ambiguous description page is not the solution. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 15:06, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>i am the only one i know ho has an ability to do the types of things such as create wikipedia articles. this is why i do this. i have created several other srticles, one about the word "haterade" which was deleted, and i just dont know what you are looking for here.</p>

<dd>GabeJohnson, if you are indicating that you want the article to be kept, I suggest that you edit the comment so that it begins with *'''Keep''' just to make that clear. What we are looking for here is an indication that the article is not <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">vanity</a> and that Gabriel Johnson is a person who ought to have an encyclopedia article about him. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is one set of guidelines for this; click on the link to read the guideline. Look at the guideline and see what things about Gabriel Johnson might apply. If he has written a book which has won an award, mention the book and the award. If he has been "the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person"--for example, if major Florida newspapers have written about Gabriel Johnson and the Florida Free Press, mention them. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:11, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In which case, you should blank (delete all the text from) your article.

<dd><small>(That will cut this discussion short, which otherwise will continue for about five days. But for the record, that will <i>not</i> guarantee that an article on Gabriel Johnson will never be included in the future, however, should someone decide that Gabriel Johnson has become famous or notorious. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; like Britannica or any other encyclopedia, we do not include biographies simply because people have requested that a biography of them be included, nor do we remove them simply because people have asked that biographies of them be removed. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:27, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li>Actually, blanking the article doesn't work, as bots will automatically revert the edit. If the author of an article wishes it deleted, he/she should tag it by putting <b>{{db-author}}</b> at the top of the page. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think it might be an idea to mention this on the CSD page. It still says there that blanking by the author is a legitimate way of G7-ing an article - "If the author blanks the page, this can be taken as a deletion request." <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 20:29, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This was nominated for speedy deletion under A7 (no assertion of notability), but I wasn't sure what the notability criteria are for churches, and felt that an article that has been around for more than a year should at least have a discussion before deletion. <b>No vote.</b> <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23"><font color="green"><b>EWS23</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">Leave me a message!</a>) 22:48, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
