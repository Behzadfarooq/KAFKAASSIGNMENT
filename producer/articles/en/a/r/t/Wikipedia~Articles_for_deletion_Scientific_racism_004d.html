<p>Hi! I think this entry should be merged into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> since this last entry considers racist ("scientific") theories. Leaving it as it is now is, in my opinion of course, a racist POV, as it may let believe that there is such a thing as "scientific racism". I am aware that the entry is not really racist, as it considers it as a pseudoscience. However, the title itself may lead in error - the proof of that is that I was sure, before reading it, that this was some entry written with racist bias. I would also like to add a last point: to my knowledge, "<a href="../../../r/a/c/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">racialism</a>" is the name given to attempts to scientifically justify racism (see <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Andr%C3%A9_Taguieff_1f01.html" title="Pierre-André Taguieff">Pierre-André Taguieff</a>'s works on racism). So, I think we should considers these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>merge it into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> (which should at least include a resume of this, as to let readers of the racist entry use the hyperlink to "scientific racism")</li>
<li>merge it into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">Racialism</a> (which, by the way, is really badly written now, claiming that "racialism" is distinguished from "racism" because it has some "political weight" or whatever - whereas it is a synonym of what you fellows are trying to define as "scientific racism")</li>
<li>if you really don't want to consider those merges, for reasons that I will try my best to understand, you really should change the title. Believe me: maybe for you it is not equivocal, but the simple fact that I read it like this is a probable sign that I won't be the only one. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 03:04, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Lapaz doesn't know what he or she is talking about and I imagine did not read the article. The term is a common one used both in historical discourse and academic discourse about race. And if one is not aware of it being a separate term, one could easily consult the books references (one of which features it as a primary part of the <i>title</i>), or any of the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22scientific+racism%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22scientific+racism%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">over 66,000 Google hits</a> or over <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22scientific+racism%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22scientific+racism%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">5,800 Google Books</a> hits. Not a neologism, but a specific "type" of racism, one which claims to be based on scientific facts (sometimes contrasted with "base" racism). The article itself is very NPOV: if one actually <i>read</i> the content it would see that it attributes all POVs, and even goes great lengths to discuss the controversies, discredited research, etc. The term is, frankly, pejorative: nobody <i>wants</i> to be called "scientic racism", as it implies the work is <i>not</i> actually "science" but actually <i>just</i> racism. The Google links above show pretty clearly that the term is used, in the same way we use it, by hundreds if not thousands of mainstream sources, the vast majority of which are anti-racist (Stephen J. Gould, PBS, hundreds of academic books). It is completely distinct from racialism (which Lapaz also doesn't seem to understand in a NPOV way), and is obviously a topic rich enough (an entire article's worth of content) to deserve being a separate article from "racism", though it of course should be mentioned in the latter (as it is). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:06, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> with the similar article <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenics</a>. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 03:29, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eugenics and scientific racism are related but <i>not</i> the same thing. Read the two articles and you will see this. Scientific racism pre-dates eugenics and also exists completely separately from eugenics; furthermore, eugenics is not always about race, either, nor is it necessarily "racist" (it is often classist, sexist, and many other -ists). "Scientific racism" refers to research which supposedly validates racist ideas; "eugenics" is a philosophy advocating the changing of a society's gene pool by means of selective breeding. Not the same thing at all, though they have intertwined histories (there was much scientific racism in the history of eugenics). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:30, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
