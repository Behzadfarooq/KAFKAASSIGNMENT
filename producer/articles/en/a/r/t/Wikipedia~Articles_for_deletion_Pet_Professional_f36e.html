<li>Voting to <b>Keep</b> if only because several well-known (to me, at least, who knows nearly no web-comic producers) web-comic writers are heavily behind this and believe it will take off in a big way.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Hush whiners. Would you rather prefer the term "pet professional" to refer to the veterinarian? And I've yet to see something else as unique in referance to this term. Also, quite an original theme as well as funny. - Gravitron, pet owner (all you slashdot critics-dissers need a good hour in subspace SVS duelbox spanking, damned sony station newbies)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. Regarding this voting process, on May 01, at 3:42pm (unknown time zone, I'm guessing CDT/-6), the webcomic author added a request to his page that his readers come spam this vote process. Unrelatedly, I doubt Simoncursitor's claim of "several" web-comic writers being behind this; I suspect the list is just Scott Kurtz. --jholman 03:45, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, it was mentioned in 01/05/05's PVP so it's relevant to me. Plus as long as some people feel this is relevant who are the rest of us to delete it?

<li><b>No Vote</b>(already voted - keep). Just a small addendum, allow me to be the first to land a five across the eye of JHolman, not as a reader, not as a voter, but as a person who can't stand stupid people making deceptive remarks, spreading misinformation knowingly and twisting facts to advance their agenda. The author didn't request that his readers will SPAM the place, he asked them to come and vote to keep, adding a joke that if you don't like it still go and vote keep. Now please tell me, what is exactly wrong about someone asking their supporters to show their support by voting in a place publicaly open to votes, whereas people are expected to voice their oppinion regarding something? Get a clue, trencher. - Gravitron

<li>We ignore all votes by brand-new users and votes by unsigned in anonymous users, primarily because there is no other surefire way to make sure that people aren't repeat voting under different names and IPs, and also because we expect Wikipedia users to be a little more familiar with the site before they start participating in policy discussions. So you're just wasting everyone's time without accomplishing anything, because <b>all of your votes will be discarded</b>. If anything, you're hurting your cause, because the more such votes turn up, the more established Wikipedians become convinced that the article should go.

<li><b>No vote</b> How come the page stopped displaying all of the comments? Someone sabotaged it using a wikipedia script exploit? Is there a "page 2" that I missed? Lets see if this edit will fix it. Ah, yes, there we go. I don't like registering, I'm TIRED of registering across a gazillion of sites and forums and blongs and what not. Plus, all it ended up doing was generating a torrent of SPAM towards my email, be that 90% advertisements and 10% of retards emailing me about things I could care less to know, like their family problems, why I like the wrong kind of games or that I should believe in god and he'll save me. It's not like I'm that an unknown in the world, hiding behind proxies and shit, most know me anyway. Do I piss you off? Your problem, weak mind. Go a few rounds on Samurai Spirits II vs Mizuki/cham-cham on hardest difficulty, it'll piss you even more that the PC cheats. The truth hurts, if you can't handle it then enter your pink sphere with&#160;?ignore %tickname on macro. If you rather be a tyrant, then just be a tyrant, have an inner board for judging things if you fear votes so much. Not that I'll despise you any less, but you won't have to be pissed by people with free mind. Oh, and "established wikipedians", was that a joke? It's like calling an established forumer on someone with ten hundred thousand of posts. I'll have more trust in a casual passying-by poster to be genuine and not running multi-accounts to rig-boost numbers than I would in your resident members of "established wikipedians", because in the end, they're a community, with a bandwagon and a single flag, as such, they're far more devoted and capable of mischief than a just-stopped-2-say-my-thing person. It's like mindless goons of something aweful. Try throw a poll there, half of them will deploy 5,000 zombies to do voting for them and use multi-proxies to do the rest of the other half while banning them from access. - Gravitron (forget the article, I'm fired on the principle here...these wiki guys are crooked or decent?)
