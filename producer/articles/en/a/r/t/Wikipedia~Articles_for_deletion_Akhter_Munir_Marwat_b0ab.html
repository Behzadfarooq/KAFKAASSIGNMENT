<li><b>Strong Delete</b>, I know for sure that the title Additional Secretary is in no way equivalent to "associate deputy minister" or "undersecretary". An additional Secretary in Pakistan is just a middle level Bureaucrat in the Civil Bureaucracy and thats all. And just in Pakistan there are more than 250 people in the same scale working for the Federal Government. This can be checked from the official website of the Government of Pakistan at <a href="http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/" class="external free" title="http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">Marwatt</a> 03:23, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article be kept, as this is Bio-Graphy of Senior, reknown and famous bureaucrat of Pakistan, who is also the son of very famous person. Beside this in Pakistan Addittional Secretary is more powerful then Senior Ministers, U/C. Beside this there are many many articles here on WP those relates to some unknown people. <b>Here I also would like torequest you that don't follow what <i>Marwatt</i> and <i>Nigar</i> opinioned here. They both are personally and politically against to this person. I also have an evidence for this. If WP needs, I will surely provide them confidentially</b>. They are keep on editing his name in artilce "MARWAT". But they don't hesitate in mentioning some unknown personalities there and some Bureaucrats who are Juniors to Additioanl Secretary. I don't think that they have right to ammend this site inany direction they need. I would like WP to remain nuteral as there policy. Marwatt (user) himself first ask me to create a seprate site for him but here his condemning the site. I don't would like such people to play with Credible and our-own WP.

<li><b>Comment</b> Being a Pakistani myself I would like A.M.Khan to consider withdrawing his stupid statement that a "Government Servant in Pakistan is more powerful than a senior minister". This article is pure vanity and nothing else. Being a son of a famous person as well as one of the thousand officers in the Civil Bureaucracy of Pakistan does not entitle that person to fame.

<li><b>Comment</b> The article seems to include a fair share of hyperbole. Yes Mr. Marwat is a civil servant of some repute in Pakistan. Is he someone of enormous influence in the country?

<p>DMG (district management group officers) in pakistan wileded enormous powers in the past and were essentially mini kings of their areas. I think more references are needed, has the man written any books? had any published work? been associated with any major development projects? besides that the article needs a bit of a rewrite ..it sounds like a press release in some parts.

</ul>
<p>1) Yes, he is really some one of enormous influency in Pakistan. Being on so many high-posts, <b>first licenced private pilot of Pakistan</b>, clearly proves that he is someone of high repute.</p>
<p>2) <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZakksez_1fb7.html" title="User:Zakksez">Zak</a> demanded some refferences and also wr-writing of this article. Let me tell you that when ever new things are going to be added here in this article, I will surely add some refferences here, I promise. As far as re-writing is concernced, kindly, let me know what should be added and what should be deleted, thanks.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I usually don't do that but this is in defense of my vote to <b>Delete</b>. I am myself a Civil Servant and a member of the erstwhile “POWERFUL” DMG (District Management Group). There are more than 2400 Officers in this Cadre working all over the country and this is not the only Cadre in the Civil Bureaucracy of Pakistan. There are 12 other Groups which have their own Officers (their numbers running into thousands)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Superior_Services_of_Pakistan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Superior_Services_of_Pakistan" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Now turning towards this article, apparently this article on Mr. Akhtar Munir fails all the tests of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He has not written any notable books nor is he a recipient of national/international award. He hasn’t done a deed (association with a project of national importance) which should have been noticed in the national or international press. The supposition of the creator of this article that Mr. Akhtar Munir is the “First Licensed Commercial Pilot of Pakistan” is preposterous (seriously lacks credibility) because Pakistan came into being almost 59 years ago and I know for sure that Mr. Akhtar Munir is not the first person to obtain a Flying License. As a matter of fact a local son of the soil Mr. Qazi Sajjad (who unfortunately has no entry at Wikipedia) was the first man to achieve eminence for flying a glider (made entirely by him). This persistent love with flying earned Qazi Sajjad another distinction of being the first Civilian to teach at Risalpur’s Air Force Academy. My humble plea is that this article is nothing else but pure vanity and a self projection of a person whose only distinction is his ascendance to a senior middle level position in the civil bureaucracy of Pakistan but then so does thousand others. Should then they all be accommodated at Wikipedia? -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">Marwatt</a> 14:30, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
