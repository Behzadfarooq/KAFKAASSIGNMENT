<dl>
<dd><i>I call for deletion of this page on the grounds that it has no potential to expand into something encyclopedic. I suspect there is next to nothing known about this unfortunate kid except that he died in infancy. In those days even a lot of royal children died in infancy, do they all get an entry? It might be argued that this one was a bit exceptional since he was heir to the throne. However James IV had about 4 children who died in infancy, who were all heir during their lives of a few hours to a few months, James V had 2 sons who died in infancy, 1 of who was heir. Also, it misspells his name, it should be Stewart. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 11:58, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>I still fail to see why this information should be removed from the Wikipedia. Even if the child himself does not merit an article, any Wikipedian can perform a merge and redirect. Any Wikipedian can also move pages to correct spelling errors in titles. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 20:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The older twin of a 15th Century king of Scotland who died in infancy merits a mention in the article on that king, perhaps, but this article doesn't seem very expandable, and the subject well below the threshold of notability for biographies. Did this unfortunate infant become celebrated in any way at all? Seems like no more than a footnote in a (thick) history of Scotland rather than an article in a general encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:04, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Centauri, there are (literally) hundreds of millions of "documented" historical figures. All my great-grandparents were "documented", in that their birth, marriage, and death certificates are in the public records. That doesn't make them notable in the least. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:01, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please restrain your sarcasm. I strongly doubt your grandfather was the member of a royal family.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 00:06, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not being sarcastic. And which is your argument, that he's a "documented". Or that he was a member of royal family? "Documented" would mean that any person who is known from historical records and/or who receives the slightest mention in any historical book or article should have a Wikipedia article about them, even if all that is known about him or her can be captured in one sentence. For example, we should have an article on William Shakespeare's wife, since she is a historical figure who is documented and at least gets mentioned in any biography of Shakespeare. "Member of a royal family" means that there should be an article about every child (grandchild? great-grandchild?) of every monarch in the history of the world, even if he or she did absolutely nothing, and even (as in this case) if he or she died in infancy. If either those seem too extreme, feel free to come up with more reasons to keep this article. Maybe eventually you'll find one that makes some kind of sense. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:30, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My position has been stated above in a clear and concise manner. If you wish to discuss your opinions concerning the general notability of historical figures please post them to my talk page. Oh, and denying that you are being sarcastic and then ending your post with a sarcastic comment is a bit self-defeating. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 01:47, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Since you accused me of sarcasm when I hadn't been sarcastic, I decided I might as well let her rip, especially since you present such a juicy target. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:16, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps it might be a better idea to concentrate on making a contribution to Wikipedia that doesn't involve "targeting" other editors - juicy or otherwise. Your comments here are sailing dangerously close to constituting an endorsement of personal attacks.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 02:39, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
