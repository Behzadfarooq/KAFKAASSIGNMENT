<li>Okay, so we don't have a strict policy for that, but last time I checked Wikipedia was not a court of law.

<li>I find it appalling that some editors are now putting so little thought into their discussion contributions that they feel able to use templates for them. The fact that this template provides no way to <i>address the article actually being discussed</i> is exceedingly ill-considered. But perhaps the most ill-considered thing is that the editors using this template have not only given no thought to the article being discussed, they haven't thought about the simple consequences of using a template. There's a strong argument to be put forward that any such transcluded votes should be discounted from discussions entirely, for the simple reason that they are <i>unsafe</i>. The person closing the discussion has <i>no</i> idea (without a significant amount of cross-checking work) whether the current content of the template reflects the actual opinion of the person employing it, since someone else could have come along and modified the template contents. (A mildly <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> change would be to modify this template to read "<b>Abstain</b>. The user of this template has unwisely allowed xyr professed opinions in many discussions to be changed en masse with a single edit.") And no, the name of the template is insufficient rationale by itself for some judgements, especially with respect to the decision between a keep-with-merger and a keep. In that way, this is a significant new burden on those who are closing discussions, and arguably crosses the same "too much complex work to determine what the voter's opinion <i>actually is</i>" threshold that the "peculiar votes" crossed. <s><b>Delete</b> to encourage the use of this template to cease, or, failing that, <b>Modify</b> to read as an abstention vote after substituting in existing uses up to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">04-12</a>.</s> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:08, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)

<li>My vote above was cast on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>, and in terms of what deletion means to templates, which involves the process of orphaning the template. As this is now a <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> discussion I modify my vote to <b>Keep</b> and substitute in any existing uses up to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">04-12</a>. I confirm my agreement with <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>, and (apparently) <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> that subsequent transclusion of this template should be discouraged. Votes transcluding it after <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">04-12</a> should be considered unsafe and consequently be discounted. (The fact that a big VFD notice has just appeared <i>in the middles of several VFD discussion pages</i> should have brought this issue to the original users' attention forcefully enough for further notice to be considered unnecessary. ☺) I concur with <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> that the best course of action is for the users of this template to voluntarily individually orphan it themselves. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:28, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - we give wide latitude to user sub-pages, and this same text can be inserted via copy and paste. Essentially, there is no way to stop this sort of thing, so why try.

<li>They will be left with a red link to that page. At the conclusion of this vote (no matter keep or delete), I would strongly suggest that we inform voters have them immediately correct their votes to use simple text only. I also could assist with a bot that would do the text replacement, but I'd rather the voters fix it themselves. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 14:57, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)</li>
<li>Or, put another way: Largely the same thing that would happen to those votes were Mr Pelican Shit to come along today and vandalize the template to read "<b>Pelican shit</b>.

<li>My delete above stands. My reasoning for it, which got sidetracked by petty jurisdiction issues, was later articulated quite eloquently by Uncle G; I also refer to <a href="../../../n/n/_/Template%7ENn_7336.html" title="Template:Nn">Template:Nn</a>'s <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_e2bf.html#Template:Nn" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion">discussion</a> on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>; it's exactly the same case, and looks to be overwhelmingly deleted. I suspect that <i>this</i> template will be kept only because those inclined to vote keep on everything like its POV better. That aside, all these issues seem to be more a matter for <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a>, and neither TFD nor VFD. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 15:21, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Inappropriate and a slap in the face to what VfD is. This should, frankly, be speedied. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 16:22, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Normally I would insist that User namespace be sacrosanct, but this is a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Thing_c3ab.html" title="Bad Thing">Bad Thing</a> for both technical and philosophical reasons:
<ul>
<li>Transcluding multiple votes from multiple users onto the already-large, already heavily-used VfD page represents a substantial unnecessary draw on Wikipedia's servers.</li>
<li>Multiple votes may be changed after they are cast simply by editing the template, either by a well-meaning but misguided individual or a malicious vandal. (Both of the above can be avoided by 'subst:'ing, but it is apparent that many template voters are not doing this.)</li>
<li>Template encourages copy-paste voting. Knee-jerk votes from editors who don't read the articles in question and can't even be bothered to type a comment themselves are <i>not</i> helpful to building consensus. If you can't be troubled to even find a VfD comment you agree with and write "<b>Keep</b> per reasoning of JohnDoe", what are you doing here?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I too am frustrated by the inclusionist tendency to vote keep seemingly without actually reading or weighing the quality of the article in question. However, disallowing templates will not magically make people change the way they approach voting on schools, nor will it prevent people from merely cutting and pasting in the same vote, nor will it prevent people from merely typing "Keep. School." over and over again. I don't think template security is much of an issue - templates can be abused just like anything else can be abused here. The issue here is schools, and one that should be thrown open to the whole of wikipedia for a final stab at consensus instead of arguing the same issue over and over again. The reason people are using templates is that the same arguments are coming up over and over again, because all of these schools and school articles are almost exactly identical. It is not avoiding evaluating an article, it is a response to the very nature of the issue. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 17:53, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and refer to Rfc--I agree with Gamaliel. The fact that something like this even exists is a sign that something has gone wrong over schools that cannot be fixed by vfd. This template won't stop people from cutting and pasting or other tactics, as Gamaliel says. What's really needed is a genuine <i>consensus</i> on school articles, which clearly doesn't exist. It might be impossible, in which case I suppose we get the status quo, but there should be a sustained push from the people who actually care about this on both sides of the issue (read: not me) to come to some sort of agreement and avoid this divisive argumentation. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 18:50, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>EXTREME KEEP</b>. None of the votes here are a surprise really. As I just posted over at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_St._Joseph%27s_Secondary_School_cc9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/St. Joseph's Secondary School">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/St. Joseph's Secondary School</a>, the message remains the same whether it is communicated by way of template or not. The only difference is saving a few bytes of diskspace on Wikipedia's servers. If bandwidth is more expensive than diskspace, then I have no problem creating a macro in lieu of using Dr Zen's template. But the core of the issue here is that someone has nominated yet another perfectly fine template which exists in someone else's userspace — not cool. —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 01:08, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>You might be interested to know that I also tfd'd Template:Not notable, which read "<code>*'''Delete'''.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If you believe all schools are fit subjects for an encyclopaedia then your reason for voting keep is the same on each occasion. You could type exactly the same thing in for each vote. Why deprecate using a template to do it? I do not see the same commenters attacking those who vote: "Delete, not notable" for every school. (I don't see how that is a "discussion", frankly.) There is no difference. I don't believe it's an "abuse of the deletion process". That made me giggle. Naturally, only "the other side" ever abuses anything. It strikes me that VfD causes a great deal of strife and diminshes Wikilove to a great degree. I don't suppose the factionalism, which is, after all, powered by a desire on both sides to reach the same goal (although each side has a different idea of what the goal actually <i>means</i>), is much helped by having a page that encourages its expression. Perhaps you should have approached Dr Zen if you really didn't like his having a template and spoken to him about it, and to those who use it. Have we all forgotten that this is not a warzone and the way to resolve disputes is first and foremost to talk to one another? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:15, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Regarding the nominations, this is the sequence as I understand it:
<ol>
<li>Radiant! nominated the template at <i><b>T</b>fD</i></li>
<li>Netoholic closed the discussion there on the grounds that it is explicitly stated that TfD deals only with the Template namespace. This is in the user namespace.</li>
<li>Netoholic put a note on Radiant!'s talk page explaining his actions.</li>
<li>I have Radiant!'s talk page on my watchlist (becuase of our correspondence over the proposed restructuring of Categories for deletion), and saw I saw the message.</li>
<li><i><b>I</b></i> (<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>) then made the VfD nomination, citing Radiant's reasoning from TfD. I did not make it explicitly clear that it was my nomination to VfD, not Radiants, although I felt I had implied this sufficiently, hindsight leads me to believe I was wrong.</li>
<li>At various points the page was blanked, restored, large parts struck out, unstruck, rewritten and reverted, etc. At some point in all this, the vote was closed (I think by Radiant!)</li>
<li>Snowspinner then reopened the debate, and renominated it in his name.</li>
<li>Radiant! removed all attributions to him and doesn't want anything to do with it.</li>
<li>Dr Zen, in whose userspace the template was, emailed SlimVirgin to ask that it be deleted.</li>
<li>RaD Man quieried this, but the upshot was that it was deleted.</li>
<li>Around the same time, an identical template was made by RaD Man in his userspace.</li>
<li>Carnildo nominated that template for deletion (VfD), directing the discussion here.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>So, the people responsible for the VfD are myself (<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>), <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> but <i><b>not</b></i> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>, who has stated several times he wants nothing to do with it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, it's in userspace. Secondly, until Wikipedia actually comes up with an official policy on whether schools are notable or not, every VFD vote is going to involve the exact same arguments. I can understand why school inclusionists might want to save time by using a template for each VFD on that subject.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't like seeing things deleted from user pages, but is it really that necessary to even use this template? Assuming people just want to vote on VfD without looking at an article and arguing on its merits, why can't they just cut and paste some text?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although in general, I believe that what's in a User's space should be left alone, in this case, this is simply a bad faith VfD vote process.

<li><b>Comment</b> Why on Earth do people want to make templates for voting? There is not much typing saved by doing so. Besides, if people forget to use "subst:" they will be in a vulnerble position from people vandalzing their template (and thereby all their votes using it) to read "<b>Delete</b> A high school. No high schools are notable. Wikipedia is not a vanity site for high schools". Also, it appears to be the people who dislike school articles who keep voting to delete this template, but I really don't think it matters, why prevent your opponents from exposing themselves to template vandalism? <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 09:58, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
