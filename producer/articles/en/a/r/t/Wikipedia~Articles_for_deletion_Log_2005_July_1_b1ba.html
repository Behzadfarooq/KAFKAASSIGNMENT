<p>My research, which has been confirmed by two other wikipedians who claim knowlege on the subject, has determined that there is actually no <b>Lubawa County</b> in Poland. Therefore no article by this title should exist. There is a <a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubawa.html" title="Lubawa">Lubawa</a> which already has an article, but no Lubawa County. So, this page should be deleted, as it is innacurate and impossible to fix. <a href="../../../g/b/l/User%7EGblaz_afaf.html" title="User:Gblaz">Gblaz</a> July 1, 2005 01:08 (UTC)</p>

<li>Changing gender orientation under duress has been scientifically proven -- homosexuality has been induced in rats through a combination of high population density and lack of stimuli (plain white walls, no features, no visible exits, identical tasteless food day in and day out), even with access to the other gender. That phenomenon would make a notable article.

Modeled after the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_tax.html" title="Fair tax">Fair tax</a> article, it could be submitted that this article on NESARA be split into two articles: one about the NESARA internet hoax, with a reference to the legitimate version; and then a seperate article about the legitimate NESARA bill itself as currently under review by the Presiden't Commission for Tax Reform at www.taxreformpanel.gov; and presented to many congress persons over the last decade. I am currently not aware of any Wikipedia litmus test for legislative proposals as being limited only to proposals that are submitted to congress and have a bill number. Though some NPOV issues are raised due to the lack of arguments against NESARA, that can easily be addressed by expanding the appropriate section.--<a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> 30 June 2005 22:28 (UTC).</li>

<dd>The article is now split into two</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I split the article into two, one for the conspiracy theory, one for the legislative proposal. I was uncomfortable with this information being mushed together in one article from the onset, and this makes so much more sense. Especially now that it's being considered for deletion, and the reasons for or against deleting one are so much more different from the arguments for and against deleting the other. So this discussion is on deleting the article containing information on the legislative proposal. I vote AGAINST deleting it, but I do think it really needs to be compressed to about 20 percent of its current size, and needs more balance. - <a href="../../../s/e/d/User%7ESednar_f2f1.html" title="User:Sednar">sednar</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/d/User_talk%7ESednar_585c.html" title="User talk:Sednar">talk</a> <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_sednar_f708.html" title="Special:Contributions/sednar">contribs</a>)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> both articles -- this, so that there is a "fair comment" NPOV articel on NESARA, for those who want to know about it; and the <i>conspiracy/hoax</i> page so that people who hear about it can find out the (relatively NPOV, though Ms.Goodwin would not agree) objective view of NESARA-the-patent-nostrum --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 1 July 2005 07:08 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete both</b>, not significant enough for more than a brief mention in an article about social engineering projects proposed by minor non-governmental organisations. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 1 July 2005 07:16 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> both, especially after the split. In the legislative sense, NESARA does seem to one of the thousands of proposals. Regardless of one's opinions about the viability of the proposal, it is now very <i>famous</i> proposal in some circles, connected to <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoaxes</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a>, etc. If somebody would come to WP looking for information about it, these articles can really clear things up. No doubt there is the usual risk that pro-NESARA folks will try to vandalize them to adovacate their POV, but it has not lead to deletion of even more controversial places. - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 1 July 2005 10:06 (UTC)</li>

<li>Some random person drafting a bill and publishing it on the Internet does not mean Congress has ever considered or will ever consider it, any more than if you or I did the same. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 1 July 2005 19:34 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First NESARA was drafted in 1991 before the internet. It's in a published book called "Draining the Swamp", a movie is being made of the hoax version of it, and it is under official review by the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President%27s_Advisory_Panel_for_Federal_Tax_Reform_add2.html" title="President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform">President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform</a> at <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov" class="external free" title="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxreformpanel.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second, I was not aware that entry on the offical <a href="../../../t/h/o/THOMAS_c2a4.html" title="THOMAS">THOMAS</a> Congressional record was a WP requirement for a legislative proposal, let alone a litmus test for such an article's removal. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 20:18 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trolling accusations are inappropriate; <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. The thing is that I don't believe there <b>is</b> any "legitimate" NESARA bill. Sure, a few private citizens in a country of 250 million people might support such a bill, but that doesn't make it a bill "under consideration by Congress." Therefore, there should only be one article, discussing the conspiracy theory surrounding this phantom bill, and it should be under the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> label. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 1 July 2005 19:30 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good faith assumed, if not trolling, then certainly the reasons for VfD seem to be a matter of POV regarding the article's validity. One only need check out the references to be convined the validity of the article and its necessity in a public encyclopedia. If you wish to propose a change to VfD guidelines, feel free to do so. Currently, there is no rule limiting articles on proposed legislation to only articles submitted in the Congressional <a href="../../../t/h/o/THOMAS_c2a4.html" title="THOMAS">THOMAS</a> record. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 20:40 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please demonstrate that the President is actually reviewing this bill, beyond simply linking me to a generic government agency website. Otherwise, a legislative proposal that has never been, and most likely will never be, actually considered by a legislative body is not notable. The conspiracy theory, however, is. Article should reflect that. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 1 July 2005 20:30 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In an email received by Dr. Harvey F. Barnard on May 2, 2005, he told me he has spoken with the Vice-Chair of the panel, former US Senator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Breaux_0c48.html" title="John Breaux">John Breaux</a> from his home state of Louisianna, and sent him a copy of the book "Draining the Swamp" at John's request. I can provide this email, if necessary.<a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 20:41 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay; reasonable minds may differ at this point. I suspect Mr. Breaux was simply being polite&#160;;-) However, I cannot prove a negative and prove that Congress will <i>never</i> consider it; that would be impossible. Still, evaluating how truly radical the bill is and what little solid evidence there is IMO that it truly is a "legislative proposal" in the sense of anyone in the legislature actually caring about it, I still maintain that the proposal itself is not notable, and that the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> article need discuss the proposal only in the context of the notable conspiracy theory. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 1 July 2005 20:50 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you can explain what makes the bill any more radical than the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, or the FairTax Act of 2005, and therefore not worthy of inclusion in WP; if not only to serve as an article of reference from which a large internet hoax was based from? At this point, I am sure you can agree we are merely discussing a POV difference on the merits of the bill. We are really not talking about its legitimacy, or validity, or about any particularly applicable VfD WP deletion rule. Splitting this article was the most appropriate solution to the debate between text overload, and I agree that the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> article could use some better summarization, but no more I would expect than to see in <a href="../../../f/a/i/FairTax_e056.html" title="FairTax">FairTax</a>. Because there is no real VfD rule infringed here that can not be addressed by its splitting, I would appeal to the community to consider this VfD irrelevant and closed. Of course, in the spirit of the community, I'd still like to hear of any recommendations for cleanup of these split articles, if you feel they need it. After all, this is wiki.&#160;:)<a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 20:58 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agree that article "to serve as an article of reference from which a large internet hoax was based" is appropriate; see my "cleanup" vote above. Disagree that we're not discussing applicable VfD WP deletion rules when, IMO, one of the subjects of the two NESARA-related articles is not notable.

<li>Put as briefly as possible, and listing only the most obvious reasons, the proposal is crackpottery because: it is written by one individual, an autodidact, and promoted through an organization that is purely web-based; it has been around for years and has not found a single legislative sponsor; the bill and its promotional literature uses the lingo of fringe groups such as tax protesters, survivalists, and marginal populists.

<li>First, may I remind you that it is the reason the hoaxters coopted the draft that it has a hard time finding Congressional support, and second the "lingo" is used by supporters of the FairTax and other tax reform proposals that have Congressional sponsorship. I think you present a weak case on it being "crackpot" so far. Besides being crackpot, I still don't see how it yet has to violate a Wikipedia deletion rule.

</ul>
</li>
<li>I'll also offer the following as further support for the proposition that the NESARA proposal is crackpottery, on the related principles of "the company they keep" or "by their fruits shall ye know them." It was posted on a NESARA discussion board <a href="http://www.thewordfiles.com/nesara/index.php/topic,19.0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thewordfiles.com/nesara/index.php/topic,19.0.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> by a supporter of the NESARA proposal, and it pertains to the Terri Schiavo (or Terri Schindler Schiavo, depending on your POV) fuss of a few months ago:</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><i>An innocent woman has been publically executed after 13 days of court-ordered torture. Our judicial system has failed the higher law. The other two branches of government should have followed the higher law, just as people disobeyed the Nazi order to not harbor Jews during WWII. At the very least, if NESARA was law, it would have helped foster a culture of governmental honesty and openness that could have shed the light on the conflict-of-interests so rampant in this case - and maybe even prevented her murder by court-ordered dehydration. May she become a martyr for real change.</i></p>

<li>I think you're getting desperate, and still have yet to prove its crackpottery. You've gone to fishing on my message board and all you can find is some obscure quote I wrote on my own message board months ago. Besides, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that in a government were honesty is fostered as a culture, that it would also permeate its judicial system, and that in principle, had such honesty been more forthcomming in the Shiavo case, the judge would have been pressured to recuse himself from it due to his conflicts of interests in the case. And no one will say it's "crackpot" to believe government should try to be more honest with its citizens. If you think this is a crackpot comment, well, ... I let your beliefs stand for what they are. You make the case against yourself, and fail to align your previous statement as having anything remotely to do with this VfD - and I might add, your statements about my own quote are way off this topic. Besides, I have yet to meet another NESARA supporter who shared my particular view in that quote anyways, so you have yet to make a case that even NESARA supporters in general are crackpots (or even myself for that matter).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a related note, just because you deem maybe one supporter of the bill a crackpot (which you still can't prove), doesn't mean the bill itself is crackpot, which is what you have yet to prove - and is the point of this VfD discussion - and is what I'm still waiting to hear. You should judge the idea on its own merit, and let it stand by itself, for the article is not about me, nor about you, but about an NPOV on a bill responsible for one of the most well-known internet hoaxes still ongoing. I'm still waiting, and I'm sure those following this conversation are still waiting to hear a valid case too. We're at day 5 of this VfD and still you have not presented a valid case for deletion. If you have no further response in regards to the merits of this bill, and can't produce valid arguments in favor for its deletion according to the WP Deletion Guideliens, then I rest my case. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 5, 2005 18:55 (UTC)

<li>As I've stated repeatedly, I haven't taken a position on whether this article should be deleted or kept, so it's not really accurate to say I'm "desperate" one way or the other. I've only posted a bit of information and commentary and it's all seeming to take on a life of its own. Based on Inigmatus' last post immediately above, I'm more convinced than ever that NESARA is one of the crackier pots around.

<li>And back to something that does actually have to do with this VfD discussion: <i>NESARA is not a bill</i>. Until it gets introduced in Congress by an actual member of that august body, and thereby becomes a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_%28proposed_law%29.html" title="Bill (proposed law)">bill</a> and acquires some notability, NESARA is simply somebody's idea (good or bad).

</li>
<li>Just a note on notability - I posted this to the other vfd page too - I did a lexis/nexis search for the word "nesara" -- fulltext, not just titles -- for all dates available and found only one use of the word, in a letter to the editor from 2001 written by some guy in denver. That seems to be very non-notable. And the creator of this page keeps insisting that this is one of the "most popular internet hoaxes" which first should have no bearing on the page about the economic theory but second is simply not true; there is nothing about it in the Snopes urban legends database. So I am even more convinced now that this article and the other one refer to items that are not yet notable in any significant way.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 5 July 2005 20:09 (UTC)

<li>I think there is some confusion in terminology that it would be as well to make an effort to clear up, involving the three distinct concepts of (1) Internet hoax; (2) Internet scam; (3) <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin-foil_hat.html" title="Tin-foil hat">tin-foil hat</a> delusions. Concept (1) is the kind of thing you find on snopes, like the tourist on the World Trade Center with the airplane heading at him. Those are spoofs deliberately manufactured to amuse or deceive. Neither NESARA item ("Dr." Barnard's idea nor the "secret bill to be announced imminently which will pay off all our mortgages with space alien currency") is that. The NESARA item in this VfD‚ÄîInigmatus' NESARA, found at <a href="http://www.nesara.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nesara.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>‚Äîis very marginally concept (3) and does not appear at all to be concept (2). The "other" NESARA item‚ÄîDove of Oneness's ravings at <a href="http://www.nesara.us" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nesara.us" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>‚Äîis very heavily concept (3) with a bit of concept (2) showing up as well. If either one is notable, or delete-worthy, it's for different reasons.</li>

<li>It's just a bill, not a law. There are many thousands of bills every year. We neither need nor want articles on every one of them. Worse, it's not even a bill yet. It's an unsponsored "draft proposed bill" which, if the article is to be believed, espouses a fundamentally flawed theory about money. Unless someone can show much better evidence that this proposed bill is getting considerable public discussion or that NESARA has entered the public discourse, I have to vote "delete". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 6 July 2005 00:32 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps you can back up your statement that the article espouses a "fundamentally flawed theory of money"? The hoax about serves as the appropriate level of public discourse. The purpose of this ariticle re-make was to make it clear to seperate the two since it would be in the public's best interest in investigating the hoax/scam or the proposed bill.168.103.83.38 6 July 2005 04:37 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can but it's not relevant to the discussion because being a "fundamentally flawed theory" is not a deletion criterion. My comment was an opinion that I probably should have reserved to the article's page. The only relevant question to the deletion debate is whether or not this theory (flawed or not) is sufficiently in the public debate or historical record to justify an encyclopedia article. So far, I have seen insufficient evidence.

<li>I agree these should be deleted too. I looked on lexis/nexis again and "Harvey F. Barnard" gets 0 hits; "Harvey Barnard" gets two but neither are relevant (a name in a long list of names). I also note that Inigmatus is the user who uploaded that photo and there is no copyright information on it; I wonder if it is from a private collection and this is some sort of vanity page? The page says he died in May so Inigmatus probably is not Dr. Barnard himself though. I'm curious to see how Inigmatus responds next.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 6 July 2005 00:59 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The information taken from the NESARA Institute website is public domain, and I did post verbatim the bill description since it did a better job than I could have. Thanks for cleaning the article up. Guys, look, I'm not out to defend the thing to the death, I'm just pointing out that there is relevant information that this article, and now the split article also addresses in full what I think is perfectly within the public information scope of this wikipedia. This article was originally about the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a> and I thought I was doing a public service by pointing out that it was based from an original bill proposal that does have merit, and it would serve the public interest to know the difference.</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately, I can't motivate hoax and urban legend websites to update their information as easily as I can wikipedia. If you advocate for the deletion of this article, then you're advocating for something that goes against the founding idea of this wiki: namely the suppression of relevant information. It doesn't matter who or what I am, (but I'm not with the NESARA Institute, and I'm not Dr. Barnard). I like the NESARA proposal, and I spent three days pouring over the information after first hearing about it from WorldNetDaily to see if this guys was legit or crackpot. I found he was legit. Moreover, when I spoke and corresponded with him just weeks before he died, the more I realized this guy has faced an uphill battle since the hoax came out in force 5 years ago. After taking the time to read his recently published book, which was also requested by members of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President%27s_Advisory_Panel_for_Federal_Tax_Reform_add2.html" title="President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform">President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform</a>, I offered to do what I could to set the public record straight wherever I found it, so when people start looking for it they don't see only info about some hoax, but also info about the legit bill. Now I see just how fustrating his own work was in this regard as I find people here in WP who without researching the issue simply now want to delete an article I modified with info about the legit bill, and so also now delete an entire article that has stood uncontested for over a year.</dd>
<dd>Granted, this is wiki, and mercilessly information is modded and changed. However, I will do what I can to keep this relevant public information up in respect to a dying man's wish, and available to the pitifully duped uninformed NESARA community that has sprung up around the hoax version, and available to the public and Congress persons that NESARA is more than just a lame hoax, but is based off of something that is legit, and the public would like to be informed if they too knew there was a difference. There, I've said my two cents. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 6, 2005 04:38 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think there is enough substance and bare notability to the NESARA proposal to warrant an article of about two paragraphs, but certainly not more. If the article is slashed to that length (a task I may undertake, though not imminently) my vote would be <b>keep</b>. But as others have pointed out, the decision is bound up with the decision on the <i>other</i> NESARA article, the one dealing with the conspiracy-theory version of this proposal, which I personally don't have the will to deal with as just reading it makes me ill. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 6 July 2005 05:05 (UTC)

There is no reason why all kinds of minor things in various utterly unimportant fantasy and SF universes with a strong following among geeks should have articles, while the most influential piece of literature in the Western world for the last 2000 years should not be treated in equal detail. Practically every chapter and verse of the Bible has been extensively commented, quoted, paraphrased, illustrated or alluded to in art, music and literature many times over. Wars and major religious splits have been caused by the interpretation of some verses. Even an individual chapter such as <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> is certainly more important for Western culture and history than everything concerning <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_8732.html" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_universe.html" title="Dune universe">Dune</a> put together; heck, I'll even throw in <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolkien.html" title="Tolkien">Tolkien</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, not to mention all the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> garbage.

<li><b>Keep</b> Discussion of the religious texts of all of the world's religions are appropriate for an encyclopedia. The Bible, Quaran, Gita, Tao te Ching, and many others all contain content that has had hugely significant historical and social impact. I cannot imagine an encyclopedia that did not extensively cover these. It's reasonable to organize content by the chapters and verses of these texts since this is how most people refer to them. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 1 July 2005 17:51 (UTC)

<li>Organizing by verses has the unfortunate consequence of implying that <i>every single verse</i> of the whole text merits an article, which is the principle that some editors wish to establish, but which is simply untrue of large swathes of the text. Of course, this is the discussion of the article on the chapter, not an individual verse. However, if you support articles on individual chapters of religious texts, let alone individual verses, you should vote "keep" at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Akilam_Two_64e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Akilam Two">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Akilam Two</a>, which is the deletion discussion of an article on a chapter of a religious text.

<li>Enough has been written about the New Testament that there is something to say about pretty much every verse. So far I've worked through most of the first four chapters of Matthew. Based on only a half dozen, of the many hundreds, of sources I have been able to write two or three paragraphs of content on almost all of them. There are some verses about which there doesn't seem to be much to say, (e.g. <a href="../../../1/4/_/Matthew_4%7E14.html" title="Matthew 4:14">Matthew 4:14</a>) but these are few and far between. We might as well include them to have a well organized structure. The same does not seem to be true of <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akilam_Two_1841.html" title="Akilam Two">Akilam Two</a> and its cohorts, which are all very short and it has yet to be demonstrated that larger articles can be written on the subject. Since there are only a couple sentences on each verse, there is no reason they should not be merged. The same might be true of other parts of the Bible. In the discussion at <a href="../../../1/6/_/John_20%7E16.html" title="John 20:16">John 20:16</a> I already noted that the verse by verse approach should perhaps only be confined to the Pentateuch and Gospels. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> July 1, 2005 20:08 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Enough has been written about the New Testament</i> ‚Äî I agree that there are <i>certain specific</i> parts of the text that have generated controversy and detailed analysis by many people. Indeed, I was the one who wrote <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primacy_of_Simon_Peter_0355.html" title="Primacy of Simon Peter">primacy of Simon Peter</a> describing the controversy centring upon <i>a single word in a single verse</i>. However, it is important to reflect the actual secondary sources, and the secondary sources do <i>not</i> show an even attention to all verses of all chapters of all books of both Testaments. The attention is decidedly <i>uneven</i>. There are verses <i>even in the Pentateuch and Gospels</i> that have simply drawn no attention whatever. Blanket principles that every verse, or even every chapter, deserve articles, are wrong; and structures that, on "symmetry" or "good organization" or "completeness" grounds, encourage filler articles (or, worse, original research) for the individual verses that secondary sources effectively do not touch upon, are bad ones. (I didn't call the article that I wrote Matthew 16:18, 10th word, notice. Not only is that a bad structure that encourages fillers "for symmetry", that's not the common name of the subject.) It's worth noting that most secondary sources are structured in terms of <i>groups</i> of verses, rather than in terms of individual verses. It's daft to treat Matthew 6:9 to Matthew 6:13 individually, for example; rather than treating it as <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>. (Again, note that the common name of the subject is not the verse number.) The same goes for the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>, the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_talents.html" title="Parable of the talents">Parable of the talents</a>, and many others. All of those are from the gospel that you are writing about, notice, and you will end up duplicating them, badly. Your individual verse-by-verse approach is wrong. <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> shows that even <i>chapters</i> need to be grouped together. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-01 21:20:19 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Most of the secondary sources I have been using go verse by verse (<a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor_Bible_Series_fe5f.html" title="Anchor Bible Series">AB</a>, Tyndale, NCB). Though they do sometimes group related verses or slow down and go word by word. Of course attention is not even, but I have yet to find a verse that none of the sources have anything to say about. I have also already run into the issue of duplication and found that is not much of a problem. The <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Magi_0a2e.html" title="Biblical Magi">Biblical Magi</a> are solely found in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_2.html" title="Matthew 2">Matthew 2</a>:1-18, but there is little duplication between the verses pages and that article. Similarly the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a> article has little overlap with the first half of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a>. I am about to start work on the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> and have few concerns over duplication there. That article currently runs to some 4.2kb. Going by previous averages the total size of the series on the verses will be some 300kb. The series will no more duplicate the main page than <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Pelosi_1644.html" title="Nancy Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> duplicates <a href="../../../1/0/9/109th_United_States_Congress_d141.html" title="109th United States Congress">109th United States Congress</a>. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> July 1, 2005 21:45 (UTC)</li>

(Wikisource, which takes public domain and GFDL works, has the full KJV text, notice.) KJV is a special case in copyright law, and superficial arguments both about it being "crown copyright" and about it "preceding copyright laws" are flawed, as the situation is more complex than either. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-01 21:20:19 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed, in the UK the status of the KJV is a mix of confusing crown copyright regulations that are also almost certainly incompatible with EU law and the international treaties that the UK has signed. Fortunately, Wikipedia is based in the United States and is only beholden to U.S. copyright rules, so the legal status of the KJV in the UK should matter no more than the legal status of a fair use image there. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> July 1, 2005 21:45 (UTC)

<li>English law is quite simple to understand in this respect. EU law only applies because it is turned into UK acts of parliament as an uncontested semi-automatic process (involving an army of civil servants, quite often turning a 2 page EU law into a 50 page UK act). It is the crown which is sovereign, not parliament, and so crown copyright has absolute precedence. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 1 July 2005 22:51 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Livajo. Many chapters of the Bible are deserving of individual encyclopedic articles. Many are not. Those with verifiable NPOV information should be kept. Others can be merged into their respective books until such information is contributed. Those concerned about "systemic bias" are advised to contribute articles about whatever they feel has been slighted. The importance of the Bible and its notable passages to an English-speaking audience need not be questioned. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 1 July 2005 21:59 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That's not entirely true. I got here from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_15.html" title="John 15">John 15</a> which has sufficient notability and has already survived VfD.

<li>Let's not make too much of this discussion. We are indeed talking about <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> here. While comparisons to other articles and discussions are important to this discussion, we're still talking primarily about the article that was nominated for deletion. If you would like to work out a comprehensive deletion policy on religious texts in general, or even on the Bible in general, then let's talk about it in a separate discussion, and not in a single VfD discussion. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 2 July 2005 02:10 (UTC)</li>

<li>If that is the case, I think the Matthew 1 article stands as a pretty good example of a notable passage with verifiable context. It focuses on inter-scriptural references and could benefit from more about how this passage has influenced history ("calculations" of the age of the earth, etc). Much could be done with it and it certainly does not qualify for deletion. If this discussion is indeed about one article, can we ask <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratesJedi_4545.html" title="User:SocratesJedi">SocratesJedi</a> to remove the tag from all the other chapters that currently bear the Vfd notice pending this vote? <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 2 July 2005 05:16 (UTC)</li>

<li>In my opinion it is inappropriate to make policy about article structure on VfD. Many of the chapters grouped under "and all similar articles" are very good articles, some have survived VfD already, and their qualifications for deletion need not be discussed again. The only thing "similar" about them are their names. If you want to propose a policy about how to rename, merge or restructure the articles, do it elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 2 July 2005 14:38 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are dozens of versions of the Bible, and dozens of Holy Books of other religions. Should Wikipedia host commentaries on all possible permutations? Also, scriptures are almost by definition open to interpretation, so any article is bound to be hopelessly subjective and controversial. If people wish to study the endless meanings that can be attributed to any Bible verse, there are plenty of churches willing to accomodate them. An encyclopedia should give the whole thing a wide berth. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoatBringer_f2ea.html" title="User:StoatBringer">StoatBringer</a> 00:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's hard to believe that every single bible chapter deserves an entry any more than every single movie or every single musical group. Entries should certainly be created for the stories of creation, the great flood, the story of Job, etc. but not by mechanically describing the contents of every chapter. Such detailed analysis is only asking for original research. --<a href="../../../t/y/s/User%7ETysto_ecb9.html" title="User:Tysto">Tysto</a> 2005 July 2 04:46 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> the body of existing theological exegesis, historical and literary analysis, and cultural influence of every scrap of biblical literature is sufficient to eliminate the invitation for original research.

<li><b>Keep</b> this content out of the principle that it is notable and can be encyclopedic.

<dd>I'm confused by this (but new, so willing to learn). Mind you, I have no connection with the original creation of this article nor with the site, but I would think that being a commercial site would have no bearing on notability. This site is unarguably the oldest Web site that deals with this topic, and that seems to me to be notable. If it were free, that would not change the status of the notability, and Wikipedia doesn't seem to shy away from listing <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wall_Street_Journal_8de1.html" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a> or <a href="../../../e/v/e/EverQuest_5a5e.html" title="EverQuest">EverQuest</a> based on their being commercial, subscription-based services. Are those "nothing more than advertising", as <a href="../../../t/y/s/User%7ETysto_ecb9.html" title="User:Tysto">Tysto</a> says, or do we have some formula that relates degree of notability to degree of commercialism somewhere?

<li>Anyone editing Wikipedia is at a computer connected to the internet. They can easily connect to any game server online and play chess or checkers or whatever they choose, with the added stress relief of being away from Wikipedia. Companies have break rooms because their employees can't take 15 minutes off and drive to the nearest air hockey establishment. Wikipedians can take 15 minutes off and connect to the nearest game server far more easily. If they could do that without taxing Wikipedia's servers, all the better. ‚Äî <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 5 July 2005 03:31 (UTC)</li>

Firstly, Tim Tam Slams are most commonly performed with coffee, not tea, and I've never heard of them being done with tea, and a quick survey of my office shows no one else has heard of people using tea either. Secondly, I've never heard Tim Tam Slamming called Tea Sucking before, though the term Tim Tam Slam is well-known to me and in the circles I move in. If the new content does have a place on Wikipedia (as, strangely, a lot of people seem to think it does), it should probably be under <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Tam_Slam_4c8a.html" title="Tim Tam Slam">Tim Tam Slam</a>. Tea Sucking is something altogether different. I would prefer if the original content were restored and the VfD page reset to monitor the desire for a page that really is about Tea Sucking (as opposed to Tim Tam Slams), but this probably isn't going to happen. My recommendation is that the current content be moved to Tim Tam Slam and we forget the whole sorry Tea Sucking saga. I think I'm done with trying to contribute to wikipedia. Might go start a blog instead. grlea 5 July 2005 07:53 (UTC)

<li>I dunno, I think the guy in the picture is totally fakin' it. A lot of them do, ya know. Sure, they have the string and the little tag hanging out of their mouth, but it isn't connected to a tea bag at all. It probably isn't connected to anything.

<li>Actually, reread it, there is no "linguistic" controversy. That is the point of the article: to use <i>etymology</i> to prove the distinctness of the two words.

<p>I found that an editor named Jasontb had added doubleseat briefs to the underwear article, added a picture of said briefs, set up an article for doubleseat briefs, linked everything to the <a href="../../../b/v/d/BVD_0df0.html" title="BVD">BVD</a> article, and then inserted a promotional link to Tiger Apparel in the BVD article.

<li>OK, no need to be sarcastic. I simply meant that if the shop is notable, and perhaps has an interesting history, then what's the problem? Of course there will never be an article of every shop in every city - just like there will never be an article on every song from every album, but some contributors take the time to write about particular songs and that's fine. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartpol_6226.html" title="User:Martpol">Martpol</a> 1 July 2005 12:12 (UTC)</li>

<li>For starters, the phrases "Wikipedia is not paper" and "If it's notable and has had an impact on a few thousand people, it's probably in our encyclopedia's domain.

The only I haven't nominated him is that I <i>know</i> that the completists would all vote to keep him and I'd lose.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I can buy the idea of some people wanting to delete a railway station article--perhaps one could argue that they're not that interesting to anybody--but I find that suggestion of deleting <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_b611.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV of the United Kingdom</a> utterly baffling.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Because William IV was <i>not</i> one of the most notable kings of the United Kingdom. I'd like Wikipedia to have articles on <i>only</i> the most notable Kings, <i>only</i> the most notable stations, <i>only</i> the most notable Pokemons, <i>only</i> the most notable schools, etc. Having articles about inferior kings, inferior schools, inferior Pokemons, etc. makes Wikipedia inferior.

<li>Well this is where the problem begins. You say that William IV was "not one of the most notable kings of the United Kingdom." Leaving aside the question of whether a monarch is intrinsically notable (I think most people would concede that this is the case) you are stating <i>your</i> judgement of whether or not William was notable. And yet the article itself tells us all about his active role in walking into the House of Lords in the middle of a debate and proroguing Parliament in 1831. And in 1834 he became the last monarch to appoint a Prime Minister against the will of Parliament, when he chose the Tory Robert Peel to govern with a Parliament having a Whig majority. And you say this guy isn't notable? Surely some mistake! --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 4 July 2005 19:20 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> valid article of interest to some people even if they are trainspotters as P Ingerson dismisses them as. As a so-called completionist, I think that it is good that Wikipedia is becoming a comprehensive reference work as was initially intended. The concept that P Ingerson would delete what he describes as obscure kings and queens is deletionism taken to the nth degree and would be a ludicrous policy for any work aspiring to be an encyclopedia. Either we want to be a thorough reference work or we don't - if we don't then I will find other things to do with my time. As for RickK, his leaving had nothing to do with votes for deletion but was a dummy spit after he was blocked for 24 hours for breaking the 3-revert rule. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 1 July 2005 23:48 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've got nothing against railway stations in general, even the ones that I've used. For example, I'm proud to have contributed to the article on <a href="../../../g/i/p/Gipsy_Hill_railway_station_87ba.html" title="Gipsy Hill railway station">Gipsy Hill railway station</a>, which is notable because of its historic architecture, including the LB&amp;SCR's coat of arms set into the walls. That's a notable station, so it should stay. But I believe Silver Street station is not notable. Now, if anyone can rewrite the article to demonstrate notability, then I'll happily admit that I was wrong and change my vote to Keep. Just one tiny, little sign to show that Silver Street is more notable than an average station, that's all it would take. And so far, no-one's managed that. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> ‚Äî <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 4 July 2005 11:44 (UTC)</li>
<li>Isn't it an unreasonable demand, though? You don't think it's enough that it's a railway station, you're asking for it to be <i>more</i> notable than "the average railway station". Well I have no idea whether it is more or less notable than that, but recall the case of William IV above. Participated in a constitutional crisis, prorogued Parliament in the middle of a debate, appointed a Tory Prime Minister against the wishes of a Whig Parliament, and the last monarch to exercise that prerogative. So your notability criterion is either extremely high or here we have demonstrable that fact that something that doesn't appear notable may later be shown to be notable. Notability isn't something to take that seriously. It's just a good rule of thumb that enables us to delete articles about bus drivers and the like. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 4 July 2005 19:26 (UTC)</li>

I don't think you're referring to the "patent nonsense" classification, because it's not gobbledygook, and it's not something I made up. It's a conspiracy theory. The article is about the history and claims of the conspiracy theory.

Sure, a few private citizens in a country of 250 million people might support such a bill, but that doesn't make it a bill "under consideration by Congress."

In all VfD discussions I usually defer to article precedent over deletion rules. If related articles exist for the same reasons the target article exists, then I believe the targeted article should be allowed to stay as well.

The entry for <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodtimes_virus.html" title="Goodtimes virus">goodtimes virus</a> in wikipedia is short and to the point, unlike these articles.

NESARA has been discussed on radio on the Jeff Rense program. NESARA people often hold public protests and show up at other groups' protests, (see <a href="http://www.nesara.us/gallery11/photos/image007.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nesara.us/gallery11/photos/image007.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> for an image of a NESARA protester standing next to Ralph Nader, also <a href="http://www.nesara.us/gallery12/photos/seattle11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nesara.us/gallery12/photos/seattle11.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and that entire page for more), have carried out expensive truck billboard campaigns in Washington DC (<a href="http://www.nesara.us/gallery13/doit.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nesara.us/gallery13/doit.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> for images, and see "The Trucks" <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/projects/dove/story/4511399p-4236397c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/projects/dove/story/4511399p-4236397c.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> for more detail and verification that they're not photoshopped images). They also hold protests outside the world court in The Netherlands (see <a href="http://www.ashtar.nl/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ashtar.nl/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> for the images of these protests - yes, the site is crazy, I'm posting the link for the images). They frequently send postcards to the world court, and to members of congress - one congressman, John Shimkus, had to point out in his newsletter to constituents that it was a scam <a href="http://www.house.gov/shimkus/n32202.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.house.gov/shimkus/n32202.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

Journalist John Gorenfeld (who has previously been published on wired.com and salon.com) recently put an article on his webpage about NESARA called "The Clinton Cargo Cult". <a href="http://gorenfeld.net/john/" class="external autonumber" title="http://gorenfeld.net/john/" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. I believe this addresses your criticism of unverifiability (discuss). I would not call this the biggest hoax in internet history, but I think it is more widespread then most in the pro-delete camp would expect. It's also notable for the absurdity of its claims, and further for the astounding fact that some people believe it. I think that some of the hostility towards this article is due to the fact that some people might be thinking I'm trying to promote the scam - far from it. I think this is a dangerous scam that has cost many people a lot of money. Now, "notability" is subjective to some degree, but consider what other articles are considered notable enough to be included in Wikipedia. We have an article on The flora in the fictional Star Wars Universe, an article on <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Wish_II_%28album%29_13f3.html" title="Death Wish II (album)">The Sound Track to Death Wish II</a>, and an article on <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_P%C3%A9tomane_23a1.html" title="Le P√©tomane">a 19th century Parisian entertainer who farted songs on stage</a>.

<li><font color="#3CA370"><b>Comment</b>Well said sednar. Now I wonder if the pro-delete camp will also get a clue of the obvious need for making people aware of the legitimate NESARA bill wherever the NESARA hoax is being discussed. Dr. Barnard commented to me last month that the hardest part of pushing for Congressional sponsorship is the popularity of the hoax, as all members of Congress approached, he said, refuse to discuss NESARA because they "get so many postcards about it" - referring of course to the NESARA conspiracy supporting Take Action Teams that advocate its duped members to send postcards to everyone in government to "announce NESARA now!" Can't the pro-delete camp see the need to set the record straight - and what better place to do so than wikipedia, the free (and popular) encyclopedia?<a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 6, 2005 04:52 (UTC)</font>

<li><font color="#3CA370">I'd like to try to nudge this towards consensus if possible, as the discussion seems to have slowed down. Though it leans in favor of keep (8 to 5, with 2 redirect suggestions), I don't see a satisfying consensus being reached anytime soon. On the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_NESARA_1576.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/NESARA">NESARA deletion discussion</a>, the resolution to that discussion involved re-editing the page to reduce it to a small portion of its original size. I think it was appropriate for that article, because before that the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> article was heavily POV, and reproduced every little point of the NESARA proposal. Someone suggested doing the same to this article, but I don't think the same solution is appropriate here. For one thing, the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a> article is not POV, is not arguing any case, and is not promoting anything (agree?). So it is not burdened with the redundant, promotional material that the NESARA article was, and so there is really nothing to reduce (if you disagree, please make the edits). Rather, the main argument that has been levied against this article is the claim that it is simply not notable enough for inclusion. If that is the consensus that ends up being reached, then I'd say delete it altogether rather then keep a stub in an attempt at placation. But in this discussion I've argued that it is notable, and many agree with me. I don't claim that it is of overwhelmingly urgent importance, just that it is important enough to include, and is certainly not a completely idiosyncratic non-topic. I've provided evidence of that and answered claims regarding notability and verifiability, and most of my points have not been refuted. I think that unfortunately, the claim made earlier that this is "one of the largest and wide-spread internet hoaxes" (not made by me), ended up becoming a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument that was easily torn down. I'd like to reframe the discussion and try to reach a consensus that this conspiracy theory, while not the biggest of all time, is notable enough for inclusion as its own article, of roughly the length that it is now. - <a href="../../../s/e/d/User%7ESednar_f2f1.html" title="User:Sednar">sednar</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/d/User_talk%7ESednar_585c.html" title="User talk:Sednar">talk</a> <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_sednar_f708.html" title="Special:Contributions/sednar">contribs</a>)</font></li>

<li><font color="#3CA370"><b>Comment</b>. Probably you are right and with the quality standards used on the English Wikipedia (higher that the ones that can be afforded in some other languages Wikipedias) the heading of the article is a <i>neologism</i> with not enough hits and it should be discarded; as author of the article I am not going to argue on that; but I think it is neither <i>original research</i> nor, certainly, <i>promo</i>. What is said on the article was found in a serendipitously way and not as the result of any personal research, so I have no theory of mine to fight for.</font></li>

<dd><font color="#3CA370">I found myself not able to incardinate this idea in any existing article (I am not sure of the English I use) and I thought (and I think) that it was (and it is) more natural to state that fact through the neologism, saying clearly that the heading of the article is a neologism. In the article the important thing is not the heading but the idea, there are articles identified not by words but by phrases. But, perhaps, I am wrong</font></dd>

<li><font color="#3CA370">False dichotomy is a situation in which one side inaccurately (i.e. false) alleges that there is a choice between two options (a dichotomy). <i>Di-chotomy</i> means <i>two options</i>. A <i>false dichotomy</i> is a situation in which it is not accurate to state that the two options given are the case, i.e. the dichotomy is false. I am a linguist, trust me on this. The option you give as second option is not an accurate representation of the situation, therefore it is a false dichotomy.

Consequently, creating the article would contradict such a result from this VfD, and thus be a delete-on-sight instance. There is a good reason for not putting Matthew 2:1 etc. up for deletion in this VfD - so that we can get all the silly paper-thin arguments that disguise ideological votes out of the way first. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 22:30 (UTC)</font></li>

<li><font color="#3CA370">The answer to this is the great extent of scholarly work on each particular verse.

<li><font color="#3CA370">I think the reason why some verses have been kept and others deleted is quality. Bible verses that have been deleted have often been low-quality articles (e.g. contained no real information, were too original-researchy, etc.). Bible verses of similar quality to Matthew 1:x have all been kept on three separate occasions; see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_John_20%7E16_8122.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20:16">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20:16</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_John_20_56c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20</a>, and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Matthew_2%7E16_a415.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Matthew 2:16">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Matthew 2:16</a>. As to whether all verses are notable, I don't think that they all are. However, lack of notability is not a reason for deletion. According to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, the solution is to merge and redirect to another article (which is how I voted in the VfDs linked immediately above).

<li><font color="#3CA370"><b>Comment</b>: since most of us can agree that some bible verses are more significant/notable/important/whatever than others, it seems it would make sense to start with those, rather than just going chronolgically here. I seriously doubt we're going to see 30,000+ articles on these (to use someone else's figures; I assume they're basically accurate) so we might as well get the important ones first. Likewise I think it would make sense to have an article on the each chapter before we start working on the verse, and see what we can cover that way. The way we're going I see us having some chapters of the Bible with an article on each word, while others have no article or a stub like <i>Lambastatians is a book from the Bible</i> (yes I made up my own book for an example, don't give me crap about it).

<li><font color="#3CA370">It wasn't a compulsion, I was curious as to whether there was systemic bias on VfD (in general), which would, of course, be a serious problem (i.e. VfDs leading to inappropriate decisions which would not be made in a less systemically biased environment).

<li><font color="#3CA370">The universal standard in scholarly works is to go verse by verse when doing a detailed commentary. The current chapter divisions of the Bible were not added until the 13th century, and attempting to show how the author of Matthew intended his narrative to be divided is an important area of study. Going verse by verse does not preclude positing methods of grouping them. These groupings can also get quite complicated. <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_E._Brown_78be.html" title="Raymond E. Brown">Raymond E. Brown</a>, for instance argues that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_20.html" title="John 20">John 20</a>:2-10 is one section inserted in the middle of John 20:1,11-19. Of course many other scholars reject Brown's view and there are several other schemes for dividing John 20.</font>
<p><font color="#3CA370">I was not stating that the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> article is over 50kb, I was stating that the verse articles on the genealogy when added together are over 50kb. I'm sorry for not being should have been clearer. The merged pages you are proposing would be huge, especially since a number of the topics you thought were uncovered actually do have substantial articles. <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection_of_Jesus_9d9f.html" title="Resurrection of Jesus">Resurrection of Jesus</a> is already 29kb and could no accommodate the content in the commentary on John, much less the unwritten information on the three other Gospels. Also your statement that "several of these articles have no content at all apart from primary source material" is totally false.</font></p>
<p><font color="#3CA370">I fully agree that topics like the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temptation_of_Jesus_585b.html" title="Temptation of Jesus">Temptation of Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_of_Jesus_b896.html" title="Baptism of Jesus">Baptism of Jesus</a> are deserving of articles, but the content of them would be quite distinct from the verse pages.

Similarly that <a href="../../../1/1/_/Matthew_2%7E11.html" title="Matthew 2:11">Matthew 2:11</a> mentions that Mary and Joseph were living in a house has nothing to do with the Magi, but is again important information.

However individual verses should not form subjects of articles unless those verses are particularly notable in their own right to the extent that they have had a separate existance, such as the <a href="../../../n/e/c/Neck_verse.html" title="Neck verse">Neck verse</a> (NB I am not a <i>notability</i> follower normally, here it is appropriate).

I tried to help balance a few of these at some point, but I predict that this verse by verse approach will be generally dominated by atheist 'academics' (note how many of them want this kept in), with an occasional pendulum swing in the other direction. Failing a delete, better to merge the material. But to give an example of bias, I would take exception to an article about David's prayer of repentance being at <i>Psalm 51</i> rather than <i>Psalm 50</i>, because the Psalm 51 chapter numbering is based on the Jewish Hebrew Masoretic texts, rather than the Greek Septuagint text upon which Orthodox Christians have been relying since the first century.

I agree with those who feel this discussion is large enough that should it take place outside VfD.

It has nearly <b>400 strips</b> and has been regularly updated, without missing a day, for the past <b>two and a half years</b>. This is a comic that is regularly posted on messageboards and communities like LJ (how I first heard about it), so it might not get much direct traffic. Perhaps Alexa alone may not be sufficient in determing if its worthy of inclusion? On a related note, the author has stressed in the past that he is mostly relying on word-of-mouth and does not currently utilize mass traffic influx techniques like ad placement. So it may be more of a slow grower. It is a decent project and is still worthy of note.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disassemblance may have a relatively small following but its strong and loyal. It constantly gains new members and *is* growing. There is no sense in removing the article when it has the potential to boost Disassemblance's notoriety and actually make it "worthy" of a wikipedia page. Disassemblance has much to offer the comic-reading community. But without pages such as these many of them will miss out on this entertaining, witty and insightful comic. Also, do you really have to rely on a website to see what is good and what isn't? If you read the comic yourself, you'd see that it deserves this page.

<li><i>Comment:</i> Alexa and traffic are being pointed out as the only area, so far expressed, where Disassemblance fails the 'inclusion test.'

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disassemblance is not just a webcomic that's out there to get statistical ratings or advertising. Mr. Hart makes more than jokes and 'pot shots' in his strips. It is an intellegant strip that addresses a myriad of current social, economic, cultural, religious and HUMAN issues. Dissenters would do well to go through the comic archive and experience the range of strips. Disassemblance.com is also not a site that is just about the comic. Disassemblance.com is a COMMUNITY -- a refuge for people to experience honesty, open dialogue, support, and a lot of fun in it's forums. The level of civility/etiquitte on the boards is unparalelled to any other forum i've been part of, and yet it is a natural friendliness -- not strained or fake. I'd love to see the article here in Wiki expanded to reflect Disassemblance's true nature and encompass more than just the stip. 65.40.121.21 3 July 2005 00:06 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I've been follower of Disassemblance since right after it came online. It's a great comic that is more that worthy to be on this site. It has a very loyal following and even though it's small it's been growing. I remeber when their was only a hand full of people that read it and now there's more than two hand fulls. The writer of Dis has chosen not to site whore and that's one the reasons that I like it so much. I believe that there is something in this comic that everyone who reads it will get out of it, be it a simle, a laugh, a giggle, an idea, a deep though, or even a tear. I don't think chosing that it should be deleted because it doesn't get that much traffic is a good reason when it meets all the guidlines.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disassemblance is a highly amusing webcomic that focuses on some serious issues. It's certainly one of the more noteworthy webcomics out there.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disassemblance is a very unique comic. First of all, it has a most unusual reader demographic which seems to break fairly evenly into 1/3 christians, 1/3 atheists and a 1/3 pagans. That is a very unusual balance of readers. And it gives insight into the gem that is Disassemblance. The fact that the author has managed to capture relevancy to such differings groups and to bring these readers together (and for the most part - quite peacefully) is impressive. Perhaps due to the unique content &amp; message and the author's method of delivering the messages. The content of the strips deal with every day life issues but all within the objective of building further understanding in mankind of one another. They are extremely reflective while at the same time quite humorous. I've read quite a few web comics, and sure many are more true to life. But few are quite as imaginative and so very satirical and yet at the same time very optimistic. I am actually amazed at the reader retention of Disassemblance. I have repeatedly been surprised to find out that someone I sent a comic too a few months back is actively reading the strip. Especially when it includes my own father, co-workers, etc. I find it interesting that Disassemblance crosses the age barrier as well with readers ranging from teenagers to 50+ year olds. Disassemblance is a comic that has been built up soley by word of mouth (and a bit of merchandise stickers/T-shirts/etc). Is it as large as Red vs Blue. Nope...but many of us find it much more relevant. Furthermore, I can say that Disassemblance has had a direct impact on my life, in bringing things to mind and affecting active thought on my part with regards to the issues. Often necessitating change on my part. That is an impressive "achievement" for a web comic. So sure...you can delete Disassemblance but Wikipedia would lose much respect in my eyes for doing so. Disassemblance is a great and unique comic that needs more support and attention...not less! People need to hear the messages Disassemblance comics say. And in truth, we need the humorous approach to let us hear them openly with out taken to our defensive postures. Please show me another web comic that is not simply humorous but address socio-political issues and has a reader demographic that ranges from teens to baby-boomers, conservative Republicans to leftist liberals, includes christians, atheists, pagans and treats such with relevancy. So if Disassemblance's only failure is to rank low on Alexa (not that I've ever heard of Alexa before) and if such were to be the justification for it's deletion. Than I will strongly question whether Wikipedia's will truly continue in it's goal or simply become another bean counter like so many other web indexes. Disassemblance has a strong, loyal, and growing following. It provides a unique perspective to a broad demographic in a humorous and enlightened way. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesaj_92fa.html" title="User:Thesaj"><b>The Saj</b></a> (July 7, 2005) <i>"The Saj" is 65.85.113.98 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.85.113.98.html" title="User talk:65.85.113.98">talk</a> <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.85.113.98_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.85.113.98">contribs</a>)</i></li>

<li>Ditto. I've never bothered to register, though I use Wikipedia all the time, and have even edited/added to articles on occasion. If you want to register click on where it says "create account" in the very top right of the screen. It doesn't take much to register, and after what has gone down with this article, I don't think I can continue without registering myself.--64.223.199.2 9 July 2005 00:16 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Precedence</b> It seems that those who have opposed this article do so on the grounds that this webcomic fails the "Alexa Test." I would like to note that Wikipedia already contains entries for a number of webcomics that <b>have no Alexa traffic entry</b> but have been allowed to remain here on Wikipedia...

<li>So what are the justifications for Disassmeblance being singled out? Disassemblance meets the inclusion guidelines in all respects but the "Alexa Test", but obviously the "Alexa Test" is not all there is, or even "has precedent," if other webcomics "make the grade" without it. The bottom line is that Disassemblance is a good webcomic, regularly updates, has longevity, a loyal fanbase, and worthwhile subject matter and viewpoint not seen in many strips. It is worthy to note, and its lack of inclusion, would not only be unfounded, given the precedence, but also a terrible mistake. --24.198.18.42 9 July 2005 05:38 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I support the article for the comic Disassemblance, but I'm not familiar enough with the author to know if he is worthy of inclusion himself.

<p>This seems to be a made up term, at the least it is a neologism and as such is unsuitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Wiktionary</b>. This term does appear to be used by many Durham students, and is increasingly used by Oxbridge sports teams. It would seem hard to expand into an encylopaedia article without being somewhat controversial though -- more appropriate as a dictionary entry perhaps? -- <a href="../../../s/j/b/User%7ESjb90_b5e1.html" title="User:Sjb90">Sjb90</a> 2 July 2005 13:32 (UTC) (relatively new user).</li>
<li>A cautious <b>keep</b>. Not sure what the original proposer means by "a made up term"; presumably it was made up by someone at some point, like most words; but Google hits show that it was clearly not made up by a Wikipedian. Equally, guidelines only prohibit neologisms which do not have "realistic evidence of existence via search engine hits", which is not really the case here (<i>all</i> words start out as neologisms; that doesn't make them intrinsically non-notable). Equally, far from all the google hits for 'Doxbridge' are about a particular sporting event; though it is true that the most prominent use of the term is for the Doxbridge sports tours (so called simply because Oxford, Cambridge and Durham are the universities that take part). It's true, however, that it's not a particularly common term (~300 Google hits), and it might merit deletion on that basis; but I don't think that the reasons given in the proposition are actually true. Transwiki to Wiktionary is a thought, but the article already contains some non-dictionary content; I think there might be potential for an article on the extent to which Durham is connected to, and differs from, Oxbridge. <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 3 July 2005 22:35 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Uh, well, the top Google hit for it is from Cambridge, and then there's an Oxford hit before the first Durham one appears at hit 10.... As I say, I don't feel very strongly about keeping this term, but there's no need to use it to insult a whole university. <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 4 July 2005 16:05 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with TSP: I'm edgy about it developing into a longer encyclopaedia article, but Google shows the term being used 60 times in the ox.ac.uk domain, 57 in cam.ac.uk, and just 33 in dur.ac.uk (though this disguises the fact student pages may commonly be hosted in alternative domains in one or more of these universities). This isn't just a term used at Durham. <a href="../../../s/j/b/User%7ESjb90_b5e1.html" title="User:Sjb90">Sjb90</a> 8 July 2005 17:51 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As with TSP; it's a neologism, yes, but one which does have some real-world existence. We do, however, have a page for <a href="../../../o/x/b/Oxbridge.html" title="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> - a <b>merge and redirect</b> to there would seem sensible, given the term is an extension of the Oxbridge portmanteau; it'd complement that page reasonably well. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 5 July 2005 16:24 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b>. I'm a Cambridge student and I've never heard of the term. It appears to be an attempt, made in poor taste, to boost the status of Durham by linking it to Oxford and Cambridge. Not fit for wikipedia. Sarah 08 July 2005 15:06
