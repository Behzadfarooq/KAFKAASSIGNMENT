<li>The age of the articles cited is irrelevant, and the <i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> article most certainly <i>does</i> count towards satisfying the primary <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion. An article in <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_%28magazine%29.html" title="Spin (magazine)">Spin</a></i> would also count, but the aforementioned hyperlink is not it. It is a picture, published by the creator of the article's subject, of a purported <i>Spin</i> article. It doesn't even have a date so that people can go to the actual magazine and find the actual article. For all that the world knows it could be a mock-up made using Photoshop. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:13, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> Particularly low Alexa ranking, but I wonder how a reference's age can make it invalid. We use Encylopaedia britannica 1911, and that is far older.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This may be a case of my heart ruling my head, but it seems to be a worthwhile project, and this one that should appear even though it teeters on the brink of lack of notability.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, As a student of computer science, I believe that although these languages may not be practical for actual use, the knowledge obtained from the study of such languages can highly beneficial to anyone who needs to understand language theory. The loss of any programming language, algorithm, or proof, even if esoteric, is (in my opinion) a horrible thing. Indeed, a case could be made that any piece of information, product, or idea is useless, and we could choose to include only 'widely accepted' and ubiquitous items in wp (of course, useful, widely accepted, and such criteria would have to be defined by someone, and likely their definition would be different from many others'). This information *is* information, and I see no reason to suppress it, unless it can be demonstrated harmful, and also demonstrated to be in no way beneficial. --Adam Choate (<a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERareJuliet_ee56.html" title="User:RareJuliet">RareJuliet</a> 16:01, 24 September 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>As a student of computer science I agree with the first sentence of your rationale. A requirement for inclusion of a topic in Wikipedia is wheter or not secondary sources have previously been published about it. To my knowledge there have not been any on Iota and Jot. This language should be preserved for future generations on the author's webpage (or a copy of it at archive.com), not in Wikipedia. —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R.

It may be that there was little to go on, except for Zizzi's paper itself, but I did read that more than once and have compared with other formulations of LQG. The reasoning seems sound, especially if the reader has also read her "Minimal Model" paper. Zizzi's work was cited in an article in November 2004 Scientific American entitled Black Hole computers by Seth Lloyd and Jack Ng. The Emergent Consciousness paper was published in the journal of NeuroQuantology in 2003, and supports the Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR model of consciousness. The Big Wow article was written to fill a blank space, as the link in the Orch-OR entry had remained red for too long, and this author is familiar with Zizzi's work. I am trying to be as objective as possible, but the only other reviewer to the author's knowledge is Joy, in her Telic Thoughts blog, which can be accessed at <a href="http://telicthoughts.com/?p=473" class="external free" title="http://telicthoughts.com/?p=473" rel="nofollow">http://telicthoughts.com/?p=473</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathanD_689b.html" title="User:JonathanD">JonathanD</a> 03:30, 22 September 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> I actually <i>like</i> <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loop_quantum_gravity.html" title="Loop quantum gravity">LQG</a>; it's a bit of a maverick theory (which is part of what I like about it), but it is <i>respectable</i>. There is a difference, though, between "maverick" and "fringe". Zizzi's work is interesting, but I do not believe that it is a correct or even particularly rigorous interpretation of LQG: it's <i>ad hoc</i> and seems to set out to prove something by assuming aspects of it to be true to start with (which is <i>not</i> a reason to delete the article: I could be wrong, after all). The arXiv paper linked to in the article also doesn't talk about consciousness at all...it offers us a "minimal model of quantum gravity": using quantum computers and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole_entropy.html" title="Black hole entropy">black hole entropy</a> to address issues of the Immirzi parameter in LQG. On the other hand, <a href="http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0007006" class="external text" title="http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0007006" rel="nofollow">this paper</a> <i>does</i> talk about Penrose Orch-OR stuff (and barely touches on LQG except for <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_network.html" title="Spin network">spin network</a> blab, which could come from <i>anywhere</i>), but it is <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">bollocks</a>, as far as I am concerned. It is based on a most tenuous analogy (which is not strictly <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formalism.html" title="Formalism">formal</a>), and the argument is unconvincing. But again, that isn't a reason to delete the article: it just needs a <i>lot</i> of help to come straight, because the article is only barely talking about what the papers are saying. And this is help I am not sure is merited, because...</p>
<p>This theory is not sufficiently notable at the moment, and nor is this particular research program yet developed and prominent enough, to merit inclusion in an encyclopaedia: it seems to largely be limited to Zizzi. Citebase mentions 10 cites of the LQG paper, 4 of which are papers with Zizzi as author <a href="http://www.citebase.org/search?type=identifier&amp;submit=Cited+By&amp;identifier=oai%3AarXiv.org%3Agr-qc%2F0409069" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citebase.org/search?type=identifier&amp;submit=Cited+By&amp;identifier=oai%3AarXiv.org%3Agr-qc%2F0409069" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and 6 cites of the consciousness paper, with 3 of those by Zizzi <a href="http://www.citebase.org/search?type=identifier&amp;submit=Cited+By&amp;identifier=oai%3AarXiv.org%3Agr-qc%2F0007006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citebase.org/search?type=identifier&amp;submit=Cited+By&amp;identifier=oai%3AarXiv.org%3Agr-qc%2F0007006" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <i>NeuroQuantology</i> publishes more bunk than reasonable content.

<p><b>Uncertain</b> I believe Byrgenwulf's assessment of the ad-hoc nature of Zizzi's line of reasoning is a legitimate claim. It <i>is</i> somewhat tenuous, if taken as a proof of validity, but if the paper is viewed as attempting to show the feasibility of the universe having the capacity for reaching the computational threshold for conscousness, during the inflationary period, it does this fairly well. I do agree that the "Emergent Consciousness.." (Big Wow) paper is not a particularly satisfying formulation of LQG, but it does highlight some interesting possiblities about how consciousness might first arise, and her later "Minimal Model" paper does the LQG thing more justice. It's possible the focus on this topic should center on Penrose's work, as this subject does evolve from his "The Emperor's New Mind" book, which I particularly enjoyed. I jumped in with something, when I noticed a RED link on the Orch-OR page for this topic.</p>
<p>For the record, I believe a complete unifying theory will reveal 'Stringy' aspects to reality, and a real value to the LQG approach. It may well be that Noncommutative Geometry may leapfrog both, in addition to being a part of the underpinnings for both String Theory and LQG. I don't claim to have those answers yet, but I know the various contenders well enough. No unique Calabi-Yau space has been found, and a hundred thousand answers that work (from M-theory) is no answer at all, or no usable one. I do acknowledge that Strings are still considered a 'safer' bet and are considerabley more mainstream than LQG, at this point. Insofar as Zizzi's paper draws several of its conclusions from work of Whitehead and Chalmers that is not widely regarded as factual, I feel it could suffer deletion, for being tenuous.</p>
<p>If the test is whether this idea has captured the popular imagination, and is a jumping off point for more legitimate work on the possible quantum origins of consciousness, it may pass that test. This is not to say that the quantum mechanical nature of consciousness has been proven, but it has not been disproved either, at least not in a satisfying way. In this regard; Zizzi's paper may be a significant landmark for consciousness researchers. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathanD_689b.html" title="User:JonathanD">JonathanD</a> 04:24, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look. I brought up the issue of LQG because my own research interests are tangentially linked to the LQG program, and I would dearly like to see more <i>balanced</i> reporting of it on Wikipedia. Just properly done. Although I don't think that this "big wow" stuff has very much of any worth to offer at the moment (and have my doubts that it ever will). I read the "minimal model" paper, and I don't think it does LQG very much "justice" at all. I also brought up LQG to try to illustrate the difference between a "non-mainstream" but respectable theory, and something that is so obscure and "fringe" as not to merit inclusion.</dd>
<dd>This is also not the place for baseless, armchair speculations on "quantum consciousness" and unified field theories. It doesn't matter what anyone's personal opinions on string theory are, as informed (or not) as they may be. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, and this is an editorial discussion to do with whether or not a given article should be included, not a <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophistry.html" title="Sophistry">sophistic</a> <i><a href="../../../a/g/o/Agora.html" title="Agora">agora</a></i>.</dd>
<dd>Penrose's views on "quantum conciousness" are notable: he has written widely-read books on them (arguably to avoid peer-review - but that's another matter), and people are aware of them. I understand that you "jumped in with something" to fill a red link. That is commendable. The problem is that the article as it stands doesn't say very much of anything, and certainly is not a viable reflection of the contents of Zizzi's papers. It is also obscure enough that it doesn't warrant fixing. <s>Do an article on Penrose, name it something decent, and I'm sure everyone will be happy.</s> No, strike that. <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_consciousness.html#The_Orch_OR_model" title="Quantum consciousness">This link</a> should be <i>exactly</i> what you are looking for.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>modify</b> and change name. I am the framer of the original posting here, and I'm glad the article has sparked some debate, if not a lot of support as it stands. I agree with some of Byrgenwulf's most recent comments, though perhaps not his conclusions about what to do. I would agree that <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penrose.html" title="Penrose">Penrose</a> certainly deserves a lot more attention than Zizzi, and should perhaps be the main focus of any writing on this subject. I had prepared some material offline which I pasted into the article before reading his most recent post. It was my attempt to address some of his earlier comments, to allow for possible inclusion under the current name. I would be happy to expand, edit and/or re-direct the content that has been originated here, given a clearer idea of what is called for. I did receive an e-mail confirmation from Paola Zizzi that the earlier posting (first paragraph) accurately reflects her intended meanings of the "Emergent Consciousness" (Big Wow) paper, and I added the second paragraph just today, with conciliatory remarks about the relative acceptance, and an explanaton of why it is called by that colloquial name. Please remember that the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> was also just a fanciful way of descibing something that didn't have a name before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let it be known that I did a more thorough search for papers inspired by the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Wow_theory_48d2.html" title="Big Wow theory">Big Wow theory</a> concepts using a web seach for <a href="../../../p/a/o/Paola_Zizzi_4d51.html" title="Paola Zizzi">Paola Zizzi</a> and paring down to references that pertain to the line of reasoning explored by that paper, and I found a lot more material than I expected, and quite a few more citatons of this work. And the term 'Big Wow' seems to have been a catalyst, as well. Perhaps there is no other single term which sums up this concept so aptly, just as the 'Big Bang' did. Perhaps that was not the most apt despcription either, but the name stuck. I shall include a few more references and citations, if I have time later today. If I am not compelled to recuse myself, I vote to keep this article, or modify it for possible inclusion under a different name. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathanD_689b.html" title="User:JonathanD">JonathanD</a> 18:52, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Please Keep - Important Citation Discovered!</b> Jonathan back again, respectfully requesting that this work's impact be re-assessed. I was about ready to throw in the towl on this item myself, but have discovered a bunch of additional citations and derivative work. Note that her work was cited in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Chaitin_2019.html" title="Gregory Chaitin">Gregory Chaitin</a>'s <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Turing_37ec.html" title="Alan Turing">Alan Turing</a> Lecture last year in Sweden, entitled "Epistemology as Information Theory: From Leibniz to Ω". She was listed among the 'real physicists' who are working seriously on researching the view that the universe is made of information. Ergo; I would state that it's becoming more clear that the Big Wow is indeed a seminal landmark, and clearly does not fall in the category of NN, as Wikians like to put it. I'll try to weed out the lower quality external links, once I get time. Again; <b>please reconsider</b> the question of this article's relevance as someone of Chaitin's caliber would not cite her work in this way, if that work was not significant.

<p>This organization is nn. The available reliable information on this topic indicates that only 22 lodges of this type exist in North America, which is easily less than one-tenth the number of Masonic lodges in any given state in the US or province in Canada. Only three exist in Australia. The relevant RS hits on Google are a paper on the concept, a list on a webpage, and this article. Therefore it is not yet at the point of being notable, and the article is serving as an advertising vehicle to increase visibility rather than being due to already established notability. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 02:59, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>"Oppose Deletion."</b> Of course, I'm just the editor of Orato, but I'm not sure I understand the logic. When I do a search for "obscure rock bands", I get a list of 1146. While I'm all for maintaining the entries on all 1146 of 'em, why delete a reference to one of the world's first meaningful citizen journalism sites, with more than 1600 registered correspondents and more than 10,000 visitors in August? I would be more than willing to clean up the article to eliminate marginal passages. Paul Sullivan.</p>

<p>I see no copyright violation and wonder what is gained by deleting the Hogan articles from wikipedia. Hogan´s writings offer a unique perspective from an intellectual who also has extensively experiencesd life and culture in Latin America. All of us will be diminished if the choice is made to delete.</p>

<p>No copyright violation. This material is in the public domain. Also, Hogan's books (with the exception of Mexican Mornings) were all published buy university presses and small presses, not vanity presses. He's as notable as Jimmy Santyiago Baca and has won most of the same literary prizes including the NEA. In addition, his credit as historian appears on the Berenger movie and his book is a best seller in Mexico.

<p>Seems like the copyright notice on the author's page is to protect the images. The other information, date and place of birth, books published, etc. is clearly in the public domain: birth records, books in print, Directory of American Poets, etc. I am not the author but it seems to me that this entry should stay whether it was submitted by him or his wife or daughter, or just some fan. He is a well-recognized writer and certainly appears as author of many books on amazon.com, has several articles in monthly review, alterinfos, and seems to be pretty famous in Latin America.,etc. We wouldn't turn down a page on Clinton just because Chelsea submited it. 200.52.124.151 20:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Melissa When I google Michael Hogan+Mexico I find about a hundred entries mostly referring to the author's articles on Latin Amnerica, his books on history and poetry. Fairly notable in Latin America, I would say. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.116.194.50 (<a href="../../../2/0/1/User_talk%7E201.116.194.50.html" title="User talk:201.116.194.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.116.194.50_68cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.116.194.50">contribs</a>).</small> I feel a little responsible for this thread. In my work as a professor at the University of Guadalajara I was browsing through Wikipedia to see how discriminating my students might be in their online research (on various subjects), when I came upon the site listing all the "Michael Hogans". Noting that the "American poet" was listed but there was no biographical info, which seemed both a necessary and an easy blank to fill in, and being short on time but wanting the info to be as accurate as possible, I simply emailed the poet himself and suggested he provide the data -- never imagining that questions would arise as to his "importance". I think the copyright issue has been thoroughly addressed, so will just briefly concentrate on why an entry on this writer is of value. I and my colleagues, in the U.S., Mexico and other countries, have all had students of various ages who very much wanted to research both the work and life of Michael Hogan, poet (and historian, essayist...) He has been a working, regularly-published writer since the 1970's (the majority of his publications by respected U.S. presses, and the few seeming "self-publications" having been sponsored by well-known Latin American educational institutions -- choices of presses having been made in response to requests by educators on both sides of the border, and in other countries, for more immediately-available texts.) He has worked with many other poets who are inarguably part of any "canon" of poetry in English (Baca, Bukowski, Ginsberg, Piercy, Stafford, etc. etc.) and is well-known as a valiant and gifted director of successful programs aimed toward both advanced and under-served communities of writing students. He also maintains strong links with other writers and scholars throughout the U.S. and Mexico, in Ireland, Italy and Germany, etc. -- another reason that his presence on the "world-wide" web makes particular sense. And, if breadth of readership were a criterion, the fact that his work currently appears in important English literature anthologies (by the most established U.S./international publishers) and thus reaches hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of students, would be motive enough to have his background data available to them. If actual authorship of this wikipedia entry is of concern, there are various of Hogan's colleagues throughout the world who'd compose another version -- as I noted at the beginning, my concern was for accuracy in the entry, and that has been achieved.Lmayo 01:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)Prof. L.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&gt; This article reads like an advertisement.</p>
<p>My apologies if it reads like an advertisement. Consupport is a free service, like google is a free service. In fact I have used the google entry to try and make the consupport article fit in. If you have any suggestions that would make it look less like an advertisement, I would appreciate them.</p>
<p>&gt; For some reason it has no link to the website being described</p>
<p>There is a link. It's the first link under General Information. It's after "You can look at Consupport on ..."</p>
<p>However as you didn't spot it, and you do consider it important enough to comment on, I have also added a link to the official homepage, in a section called External Links, using the same method as in the Google entry.</p>
<p>&gt; The only incoming links are from the talk-page for the sole author (who also just &gt; happens to run the site) and from <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gaming_convention.html" title="Gaming convention">Gaming convention</a> (to which it was recently added &gt; by the same editor).</p>
<p>There was a message a few days ago which said there were not enough links to the page. Originally I wanted the page to settle in before I added lots of links to it, but following your message I went round and added in links in the most appropriate places.</p>
<p>I will look round for more links to add.</p>
<p>The problem is that many of the conventions that consupport supports do not themselves have wikipedia entries. I could add these conventions as well if you think it's worthwhile.</p>
<p>As I say, it's a service like Google. And I have tried to model the entry on google. Google has a section on "Products and Services" - would it be better if I changed the titles to also use "Products and Services?"</p>
<p>All suggestions and comments on improving the entry are appreciated.</p>
<p>All comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>

<dd>One very important thing that the article on Google has that your article on Consupport lacks is a section titled "References" that says <i>where the authors of the article on Google got their information</i>. This is something that all Wikipedia articles are <i>supposed</i> to have. I'm sure if you had such a section with an appropriate number of references to publications not produced by Consupport that discussed Consupport your article would get a lot more, um, support. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 16:55, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>I've figured out how to do references and put a couple in (including one to the web site itself, like google does). The problem is that there is very little written about the subject, which is why everything had to be developed from scratch. There should be a lot more information, but many commercial companies keep the information confidential to avoid competitors.</p>
<p>As I find more references, I'll add them</p>
<p>Ratty. 20:45, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Added a couple more references. If anyone knows of any other references where we can refer people to, please either post here, or feel free to edit the page.</p>

<li>Passantino is a major figure in the online music criticism community, his move into mainstream print media is one of the most important developments in current British music journalism signalling a major shift in media dynamics. He is a very controversial figure and his, sometime brutal, criticisms are mentioned in a number of wiki articles such as the Tori Amos entry.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.31.205.186 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.31.205.186_563e.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.31.205.186">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Passantino is hen fap. He lives in a world of virtual chat-rooms, discussing the merits of wrestling while picking his nose.

<dd><b>Reply</b> You are right expandability is not an official reason for a delete vote, but I guess I was going with the "no rules" policy in thinking that given the above stated situation it doesn't seem like a worthy article and deleting the article would improve WP. Furthermore I think the lack of information-expandability- does indicate a lack of notability, since the subject is not notable enough to have very much information about him available for people to research beyond his editing positions on two magazines. If the article was expanded to include more substance I would be easily persuaded to <b>Keep</b></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As stated above, the very existence of this man is a seismic paradigm shift in the media stratus. Journalis 02:35, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Unless I'm missing something here there is no assertion of notability in the article . I cannot find a biography on him, news article with him as the subject or any information that he's made a lasting contribution to the field of music journalism. The stylus magazine website lists him as a <i>senior writer</i> which shows that he is just another journo of no significant consequence. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 10:50, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> You'd think a notable, contemporary, British journalist would get more than 130 total and 25 unique Google hits, but Alli Pyrah does not. And the single award she won is probably not notable, either, as "EDF Energy South West Media Awards" gets only 190 total and 25 unique hits- and the second hit is this WP article on Alli Pyrah. The site that hosts these awards used to have a WP article, but that was deleted a few months ago due to lack of notability. Of course, Truthbringer would vote to keep a verifiable article on my dog, so I'm sure he never looked at what the award actually is. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:41, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Unnecessary article. Doesn't even deal with the topic it is named for. We don't have articles on airports that serve the 747 or other aircraft.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The nominator may not have understood this issue. The A380 also needs an appropriate terminal building to load passengers through two doors. Toronto's Pearson International Airport has constructed a new terminal building, in part to allow it to handle the A380, and the cost of the new building is part of the reason why landing fees at Pearson are so high. So the number of airports which can serve the A380 is limited by runway length, terminal capacity and economics: many airline routes don't consistently generate the number of passengers that an A380 needs to operate cost-effectively. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 19:20, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I must say I understand the issue on the A380 just fine. Special buildings are not needed to load and unload the aircraft, only if the airport wishes to use both levels of doors at the same time, otherwise just using the lower doors like on all other aircraft is fine. Airports can be altered to better accomodate the A380 with its facilities, but it's not necessary to do so. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 08:29, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b>; if we want a list of airports capable of handling the A380, then this isn't it; if it's meant to be a discussion of destination of A380 routes, this is crystal-ballism; if it's meant to be a discussion of the problems that TruthbringerToronto mentions, it belongs in the A380 article.

<li><b>Delete</b> per the reasons I gave when I made the second nomination (not enough verifiable information for an NPOV article; what info we have can be covered in <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>). That said, I'm not sure what to think about this latest nomination. Under normal circumstances, I would say it's way too soon after the last nomination. On the other hand, the last nomination went several days without being listed, and I suspect this might have skewed the results. It seems -- and this could be just my imagination -- that AfDers who vote early are more likely to vote delete, and those who vote later are more likely to vote keep, and the last nomination may have sort of missed the delete voters and picked up all the keep voters. So I'm adding my vote and hoping people take this nom seriously, but also acknowledging that people saying "what the heck?" have a point. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 15:52, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Device file systems are present in a number of UNIX-based operating systems.

<li><i>"has been the <b>subject</b> of multiple <b>non-trivial published</b> works whose source is independent of the company itself"</i>. Any published (whether that's print or not I don't know) work whose <b>subject</b> is devfs? Setup HOW-TOs and tutorials are trivial. I think this criteria wants to mean it was subject of research, but maybe I'm wrong.

<li>Four such works are listed in <a href="../../../d/e/v/DEVFS_2527.html#Further_reading" title="DEVFS">DEVFS#Further_reading</a>. Tutorials are <i>not</i> trivial.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am not disagreeing with forks. I am disagreeing with <b>these particular forks that you have created</b>, for the following reasons: (a) a "wave" that lasted a whole century? (b) during the middle of this "wave of colonization" (post WW2) virtually every single colony went in completely the opposite direction and gained its independence from Europe? (c) this "wave" suddenly stopped... when... on December 31st 1999? (d) how is anyone ever going to stumble across this article unless as a link from another article? (e) where did this title and chronological division come from - you? if so, it's original research. If anything a new article should be created, "History of Colonialism", not these. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 11:47, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The second phase of modern European colonization, that associated with European industrialization, ended in the mid-to-late 20th century. It began, arguably, for the British, in the late 18th century or perhaps with the Napoleonic Wars, before the first phase ended everywhere (e.g. Latin American revolution). For the French 1830s-1850s; Germans and Belgians late 19th c. So what? (Hey, is this a rolling <i>wave</i>? Just a thought... though I would prefer a different title.) The fact that in the early 20th century some societies were highly industrialized while others were essentially peasant societies <i>at the same time in different parts of the world</i> doesn't mean both things weren't true or that it is wrong to speak of the industrial era in places where that obtained even if for other places it didn't yet. A few colonies still exist. More importantly, in many ways the peak of European colonial engagement in Africa came after decolonization of India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Trotsky called it "combined and uneven development" and you don't have to like his politics to see that it's a pretty good way to describe history on the global scale.

<ul>
<li>Gsd, you are now arguing that there's nothing wrong with creating sub-articles, but just with the title of these articles. First, clearly there is no reason to think a century stopposed on December 31st, 1999. Most historians date the beginning of the 20th century with the First World War, in 1914. Clearly dates are <i>always</i> debatable. In fact, the whole principle a cutting a period in two is debatable, and is probably one of the main characteristics of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernity.html" title="Modernity">Modernity</a>. I just thought it was a more or less convenient way to break the Colonialism article in two sections (and you have never argued in the Colonialism page that dividing it according to these two <i>broad</i> distinctions was illegitimate). Second, if your issue is with the title, then you should ask for the page to be moved to a better name, and not ask for deletion. If you rather name the article "History of colonialism from the 15th century to the 19th century", IMO it doesn't make any big difference. I have to add that I disagree with your proposal to remain only with "concrete articles": as if Colonialism from 15th century to the 19th century wasn't concrete. And I think an article dealing with colonialism should deal with this subject as at least an European matter, and not according to national lines. Although the British &amp; the French colonization are not the same (and you've deleted all content in the Colonialism article addressing these distinctions), clearly both belongs to a common historical phenomenon. It is not the <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khoikhoi.html" title="Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> who colonized Berlin! <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 14:59, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am not disagreeing with forks. I am disagreeing with <b>these particular forks that you have created</b>, for the following reasons: (a) a "wave" that lasted four centuries? (b) during the middle of this "wave of colonization" a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_a493.html" title="New World">whole continent</a> went in completely the opposite direction and gained its independence from Europe? (c) this "wave" suddenly stopped on December 31st 1899 and a new one started? (d) how is anyone ever going to stumble across this article unless as a link from another article? (e) where did this title and chronological division come from - you? if so, it's original research. If anything a new article should be created, "History of Colonialism", not these. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 11:47, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is an argument for improving the titles and tweaking the dates, not deleting the articles. The point about "a whole continent [going] in completely the opposite direction" (actually two continents) is an argument <i>for</i> two more detailed articles complementing a concise general article. The terms First and "Second British Empires are frequently used <i>exactly because</i> of the effects of the American Revolution. Iberian colonialism rooted in feudalism and slavery (and the Caribbean slave colonization by other powers) was dramatically different from the colonialism of European industrialization. The main ambiguity (relative continuity for the British) is the result of British early industrialization plus defeat of the French in India, Canada and the Napoleonic wars. The dates should overlap and not be hard and fast. "Opposite direction" is misleading anyway for the western U.S. and Canada -- there is a respected school of U.S. Western history (e.g. Earl Pomeroy, Howard Lamar) that looks at the "territorial phase" of legal status of various conquered areas as colonial not only in regard to conquered native peoples but also vis à vis the fully incorporated states, including governance and economic dependency &amp; resource exploitation. Perhaps there is a similar argument for interior Brazil &amp; Argentina, don't know that history. <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECclowe_b59b.html" title="User:Cclowe">Ngwe</a> 22:30, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What's wrong with splitting by centuries? Who uses this concept of "waves"? <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 06:34, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Quite - these "waves" are phrases coined by Lapaz. But in my opinion, even splitting by centuries is imposing arbitrary time slices. It took the Portuguese from 1415 to 1540 or so to get from the coast of North Africa to Japan, and discussion of this can't be split in two at 1500. Similarly for the Spanish conquest of the Americas - Columbus arrived in 1492 and it continued through into the 1500s. Similarly for the Scramble for Africa, around the turn of the 1900s. The subarticles already present in the article on what might be described as "standard headings" (ie ones commonly found in books or used by historians) are enough for further discussion. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 10:59, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see how splitting at 1900 is any better. Other options exist, like splitting by country or by recognized watershed events (e.g. the Indian rebellion). <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 19:17, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Gsd, you are now arguing that there's nothing wrong with creating sub-articles, but just with the title of these articles. First, clearly there is no reason to think a century stopposed on December 31st, 1999. Most historians date the beginning of the 20th century with the First World War, in 1914. Clearly dates are <i>always</i> debatable. In fact, the whole principle a cutting a period in two is debatable, and is probably one of the main characteristics of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernity.html" title="Modernity">Modernity</a>. I just thought it was a more or less convenient way to break the Colonialism article in two sections (and you have never argued in the Colonialism page that dividing it according to these two <i>broad</i> distinctions was illegitimate). Second, if your issue is with the title, then you should ask for the page to be moved to a better name, and not ask for deletion. If you rather name the article "History of colonialism from the 15th century to the 19th century", IMO it doesn't make any big difference. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 14:56, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I agree with Lapaz that reorganizing according to a different scheme does not require deletion of this article. Gsd2000 could withdraw the AFD nomination and then we could get to work to determine if there is a mutually acceptable organizing scheme. Gsd2000's proposal below looks good to me. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 04:46, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Improve the titles, work on the dates (e.g. say 15th c. to early 19th c., late 18th c. to late 20th c. &amp; allow overlap), rework levels of detail &amp; avoid duplicating language in unified (&amp; more conceptual) article on colonialism vs. more periodized articles dealing with colonialisms of different forms related to different world economies. But those are reasons to edit, not to delete. <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECclowe_b59b.html" title="User:Cclowe">Ngwe</a> 22:30, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Again, I'm not opposed to subarticles in any way.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. There are plenty of local shows with strong followings on Wikipedia, that don't get deleted (Uncle Floyd Show, Scholastic Ball Report). Sure is was produced by college students, but it didn't air on college TV, it aired on commercial television, WKNT. Is it verifiable? Just check the programming logs (archived federal documents as ordered by the FCC) of WKNT from 1995 and 1996(reruns). It was quite an accomplishment for college students to transcend "student television" and achieve legitimate commercial status. It should stay up, if only for that.

<p>There are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> for this battle.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>During the Civil War many battles were fought in the wilderness, with the opposing forces not sure where they were, particularly in relation to arbitrary county lines.

<p>[keep]] maby less casualties happend and the year might be off i was just going by my grand fathers old storys that his grandpa told him about my great great great grand pa who was actually in the battle of salyersville dont delete the deaths could easily have been exagerated over the years and i guesed at the month. so keep it and change it some im actually frome magoffin and i know they were a battle of salyersville but soldiers storys are often exagerated it was suposed to have happend before the battle of puncheon creek like a few hours before it but it did happen just change the date and year.]] [us men from back here aint bad for lying i promise me and many people belive the event happend its part of local folklore of the area.] [my pa also told me that they were a unioun recruting station at one end of salyersville and a confederate station at the other]</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Weak keep</b>. The best solution would be to merge into the Sonic page whatever isn't there already. Lots of video game characters have powered-up forms, and aren't generally given seperate articles. Even the most famous, Super Mario, is a redirect to Mario's page. That said, I am strongly opposed to outright deletion, as a lot of good information would be lost.

<dd>If it were a new article like you say, I'd suggest Super transformations in Sonic the Hedgehog series; long and unwieldy, yet accurate. The problem is that it reduces the article to documenting just another series with a Super transformation instead of a discussion of the character and his imitations. The former of these two options cannot do the latter justice, but the latter can discuss both. (as evidenced by the present article.) --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidH</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidHOzAu_91ad.html" title="User talk:DavidHOzAu">Oz</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EDavidHOzAu_59c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:DavidHOzAu">Au</a> 06:20, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> It is a notable transformation of a notable character; also, given that "Super Sonic" has made more appearances than the other "Super" incarnations of other characters, it stands to reason that Super Sonic should have his own article. Any differences between Super Sonic versions (and there are a few) could be documented here. Finally, as another Wikiuser has noted, merging this with Sonic's article would inflate it too much. --PeanutCheeseBar 15:45, 24 September 2006 (EST)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I agree with PeanutCheeseBar, a notable transformation of a notable character, and he has made more appearances than the other super characters.

<p>Dubious validity, and non-notable. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a genealogical directory</a>, and this guy is notable, if at all, only for who his descendants might be.

How did the "son of a poor man" become an Army general? In which Army? In the 18th century British army, you didn't become a general unless you were from a noble family or similarly privileged background.

If someone wants to write an essay attempting to define what they mean by organic growth and why this is a good thing it might become a non-buzzword but right now it is simply an undefined collection of words (I'm particularly puzzled about what in the growth would be "organic" - this is a good sign of something being a buzzword when it has nice-sounding irrelevant phrases attached). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:10, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The thing about these estates as that they are extremely numerous. The UK has many thousands of similar estates. They can contain a few homes or a hundred or more, but they are legion. There has to be something really notable about such a place before it is more than indiscriminate information. Every set of public housing is "an estate". Every builder's development of 3 homes behind a gate is "an estate".

<li><b>Comment</b>: You and I are verifiable, Dystopos. Does that mean that we are suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia just because we have an entry in the phone book, or are on a register of electors? If so then be prepared for a huge influx of articles about verifiable subjects that are not worth inclusion in an enclyclopaedia. You or I may even be notable in a very minor manner. I am an expert in my worklife in a minor field, but I am assuredly not notable for an encyclopaedia, and I would support the deletion of any such article about someone like me. With regard to the fact that this estate takes up a reasonable section of a streetmap, Necrothesp, it may well. But it is not itself a district, it is simply an estate. It will be the <u>district</u> that has notability with the estate forming a minor part of the article on the district. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 06:13, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Ofsted report is a trivial report, no more demonstrative of notability than similar reports on nursing homes, audit reports on public companies, and similar mandatory inspections which result in written results which may, or may not, be visible on the web. The BBC reporting is also trivial, merely regurgitating league tables. This is reporting on a par with the telephone book, a birth record, etc. There is no non-trivial reporting on this school. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 09:49, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for addressing the sources. But that is nonetheless untrue. The Ofsted report is far from trivial, and is <i>nothing like</i> a telephone book entry. It is a 31-page detailed work that covers topics ranging from parents' views on the adverse impact of the rate of staff turnover through the school's new ICT room to the school's performance in SAT scores. Please actually read it.

<li>All UK schools in the state sector have OFSTED reports. There is nothing notable about these. They are unexceptionable and nopt inherently notable, nor do they confer notability. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 10:49, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are erroneously conflating "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exceptional" class="extiw" title="wikt:exceptional">exceptional</a>" and "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/notable" class="extiw" title="wikt:notable">notable</a>". You are also applying notability to sources, which is highly confused thinking. The important aspects of sources as far as we are concerned as encyclopaedists is how much they contain on the subject and who wrote and fact checked them, i.e. their depths and provenances as I wrote above. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:13, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is kind of you to point that out, and kind to use a $10 word when a $1 word will do. I am not doing anything of the sort. There is nothing notable about a generic document like an OFSTED report. They are mandatory reports by the regulator of schools on each and every school in the nation, at least in the state system. The content of such a report is only likely to be notable if the school itself is, in some manner, revolutionary. Even "Special Measures" is not notability, just a category of school which faces closure unless something is done about the appalling performance there. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 11:23, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is not I who "must have a rationale", but the discussion. It interests me that you have found this news item but not edited the school article to reflect this new information. I suggest you add it if you feel it asserts the school's notability. As for assuming good faith, I do, always. I simply found your words offensive, and said so. I am sure you wrote them in good faith, but one perosn's good faith can sometimes offend other people. I would also suggest to you that you should have said "stop <i>behaving as</i> a sanctimonious ass" if that is what you felt.

The article is atrocious, though, and definately needs a major cleanup of both grammar and POV (every band member leaving the band is listed as a desertion. funny)<a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuyanakoolaid_5548.html" title="User:Guyanakoolaid">Guyanakoolaid</a> 23:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps if someone (a) familiar with the band, and (b) fluent in English, could work on it, it could be easier to see the band's acomplishments.

<li>I suspect that "desertion" wording, as well as many other problems, may be the result of using a machine translation program, which often produces bizarre results. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:56, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I honestly tried to clean this up, but it is pretty hopeless. However, searching an album title + Jeans produces a ton of results (including walmart.com! as much as I hate walmart, if they're selling your album, it's gotta be notable) and the band is clearly notable. I still vote Keep, but have deleted most of the content from the article. I really see no other way, it was almost complete gibberish, and what could be deciphered was mostly gossip and POV.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Looks like really notable, and making history, as a hoax. Just to be sure, as 'The Remercie Por Grazie' was supposed to be the only famous work and the title means 'The Thanks For Thankfulness', that the article's author had not created one title from a work that was published in two languages, as 'The Remercie' and as 'Por Grazie': The latter is only found preceeded by the first, when 'Emfazie' occurs – just as in the article. Indeed I too found only identical texts and a few clear derivates, Wikipedia is bigger than itself... The text is doomed to survive for years to come. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../o/c/t/Oct_3.html" title="Oct 3">3 Oct</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 23:01&#160;(UTC)</span></li>

<dl>
<dd>This may sound crazy, but... besides wondering whether I should print it, frame it, and hang it above my bed – a hoax that survives for 4 years is something like an <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a>. Nowadays one actually studies urban legends. I assume at some time academics could become interested in getting the <i>original</i> hoax article and its possible early changes. One might examine it for its methods to survive so long, etc. Would there be a way to insert a box 'historical hoax' at the top of the article and protect it indefinitely, maintaining the history?<br />
For the record, the IP address used to create the article, has no other contributions on Wikipedia (unless a username would have been created for further activities). — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../o/c/t/Oct_3.html" title="Oct 3">3 Oct</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 23:39&#160;(UTC)</span>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article documents an ages old "threat". I want to be clear. I do not mean that Islam is a threat. I mean that the phrase Aslim Taslam is a threat. As such, though the article is very poor indeed, it is a valid and notable stub. I have deleted one link to an NN forum on the basis that this was surplus to requirements, nd feel that, though potentially contriovefrsial, the article earns its place here. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 11:52, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's not even a valid point. A notable subject must not start with a higly detailed article. If the subject is notable, it's okay to begin with it as a stub. To be honest, I don't know much about this subject, but I'm sure other people do. That being said, we should give this article a chance. Besides, I've cited sources. You may not consider the Jerusalem Post reliable, but I think it is fairly reliable. And it's not like you can't cite sources from the media. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">EliasAlucard</a>|<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliasAlucard_c666.html" title="User talk:EliasAlucard">Talk</a> 01:18, 25 Sept, 2006 (UTC+1)

<dd><b>Comment</b> But every article is required to define its lemma.

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's because I don't know anything about the subject. My God, you can't expect every contributor to be an expert on the articles they're working on. THAT'S THE REASON WHY WIKIPEDIA IS A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT. Now instead of complaining, you could help out. All of your reasons to delete this article aren't good enough.

<li><b>Delete</b>: there is a vast corpus of Islamic scholarship out there...if this is real, then instead of harping on about the "recent Papal controversy" (a loathsome phrase), cite the source, expand the single badly written sentence into something that can (while keeping a straight face) be called an article, and there we go.

<li><b>Delete</b> - The two games are <i>not</i> two parts of the same story. Having an article that describes these two games and only these two games is equal to having an article which describes Star Wars Episode IV, and Star Wars Episode V - and nothing else. It is not logical. The two games are <i><b>not</b></i> a duology. The article is extremely factually inaccurate, not least in describing the two games as as a duology, when they are absolutely not, and I can't help but think that some things are there are jokes. For example, <small>"Oddworld: Abe; or, The Destiny of the Mudokons (often referred to as Oddworld: Abe by fans or abbrieviated to OAOTDOTM, OATDOTM, OATDTM, The Mudokons or simply Abe)"</small> - as a fan of Oddworld for nearly 10 years, I can guarantee that there is absolutely nothing even slightly factual about what I just quoted. It's all wrong-wrong-wrong. To be honest, the reasons people have put for keeping the article show a vital misunderstanding of the situation - I hope I've helped. —<a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbraham_Lure_ed6e.html" title="User:Abraham Lure"><u>Abraham Lure</u></a> 13:10, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

But there is essentially no point in this article, when the content is covered by both the seperate games, and the <a href="../../../o/d/d/Oddworld.html" title="Oddworld">Oddworld</a> article. This is such a mishmash of random information from both the articles, and absolutely useless.

<li><b>Delete</b>, the article Chrishan is currently an unopposed prod that has stood for four days (it can be deleted tommorrow). Given the likelihppd that the artist will be found non-notable and his article deleted, I see no way that the album can be notable. If Chrishan is instead sent to AfD and even kept, the album remains given that a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=17+chrishan&amp;hl=en&amp;rls=en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=17+chrishan&amp;hl=en&amp;rls=en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for "17 Chrishan" returns no meaningul results. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 21:55, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Whereas I'm not against the deletion of individual maps, I think that a main list should be kept. Unlike say Halo, which some may feel that the multiplayer is a peripheral part of the game (I am not one of these), these maps form the core of the Battlefield 2 gameplay. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I disagree there. I wouldn't be against anything like the list of maps within the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Day_of_Defeat%7E_Source_8ccf.html" title="Day of Defeat: Source">Day of Defeat: Source</a> article, but the way they've organised it, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a> article also contains the Special Forces expansion and the 2 booster packs. If the expansion pack was a separate article, and the booster packs clumped together in another article, the having the maps inline like SM64 would be fine. But because it isn't, I think this is OK. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 23:23, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an obvious case of misinterpretation of Wikipedia policy. We all agree that Wikipedia should not include game guides - that is, articles where there are instructions, hints, guides, tips, and other text where the article generally instructs the reader how to play the game. What Wikipedia is here for is to state facts and other reference information - and that is all this article does. I would really like to know what separates this article from any other game related article. How does this qualify as a game guide? If this article was merged into <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a>, would that article also be a game guide? Are all game sub-articles game guides? Has the user putting this up for deletion even considered that people might come to Wikipedia to look up this information? Isnt that the whole point of Wikipedia - for people to look up factual information? <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemy_B_eda6.html" title="User:Remy B">Remy B</a> 03:31, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I've put up all of the articles having to do with each different map for deletion. I don't see why we need a article for something that is already covered on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a> main page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/8/v/User%7EM8v2_b3d5.html" title="User:M8v2">M8v2</a> (<a href="../../../m/8/v/User_talk%7EM8v2_4d29.html" title="User talk:M8v2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_M8v2_c80c.html" title="Special:Contributions/M8v2">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This information could easily be merged into the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a> main page, as it was at the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_64_2f79.html" title="Super Mario 64">Super Mario 64</a> page. Splits, such as this, should only be made when there is sufficient information on the subject that it warrant a unique article - but really, what information could be provided in <i>this</i> article that could be used at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a>?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - It appears to be copied from the in-game description of the maps (not manual), but it <i>is</i> highly useful information.

<p>This sub-stub (current entire content: "B. Volkan Yucel (18 January 1978) Turkish writer.") does not identify who this person is or provide any evidence of notability even within the Turkish-speaking world, let alone the English one. Google has only about 50 distinct hits for this name, the top ones of which don't look like potential reliable sources. Not speaking Turkish, I can't tell if any of these sites make a notability case, but the fact that (A) tr:Wikipedia apparently has no article for this person, although it lists 8 other names with "Yücel" in them); (B) the U.S. Library of Congress lists no such person, although it has 33 Yücels or Yucels; and (C) Amazon.com knows nothing of this person, make it look very much like a vanity article. en:Wikiquote also has the corresponding <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/B._Volkan_Yucel" class="extiw" title="q:B._Volkan_Yucel">q:B.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Once again, notability is subjective and is not a primary criterion for Wikipedia articles. Ignoring that for a moment, it would also be astonishing to argue that a century-old school and village landmark is less notable than, say, <a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_The_Gay_Pumpkin%2C_Charlie_Brown_c44a.html" title="It's The Gay Pumpkin, Charlie Brown">a single episode of <i>Will &amp; Grace</i></a>. But here we are again taking up arms against the real world just because its underrepresented on Google. Let me repeat the very first heading under the official policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> "Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page." Is there any doubt that a great deal could be written from verifiable sources on a primary school in operation since 1897? Certainly more than could ever be said about <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Feiss_b080.html" title="Ellen Feiss">Ellen Feiss</a> or <a href="../../../l/o/i/Loituma_Girl_50da.html" title="Loituma Girl">Loituma Girl</a>. The consensus relative to "Wikipedia is not an Indiscriminate collection of information" refers to TYPES of articles (FAQs, Travel Guides, Memorials, Instructions, Plot summaries) and does not address notability, for which there exists ONLY the proposed guideline for use as reference. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 22:52, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> with some regret, because the article itself is a decent article, but the school is non notable (per Zetawoof). There are are enormous numbers of primary schools. My wife teaches at the second largest one in the UK, but it has no article - deservedly so (not?), because its only claim to notability would be size.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per Catchpole, Zetawoof and others. OFSTED does not constitute non-trivial coverage by a 3rd party (since all schools have it. It isn't any different than keeping a corporation because the corporation filed a tax-return) so it fails even the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:11, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What would you accept as non-trivial coverage? A couple of articles in the local newspaper... a picture/feature from the Times Educational Supplement...? Would that meet the arbitrary criterion <i>you</i> just set for notability? Yes. Would this fundamentally change the "notability" of the school? No. But then I'm sure you would find some other "reason" to justify the instinctive delete reaction. In addition to the other, stronger arguments, deleting school pages is likely to disillusion those (new) editors who contribute to them -- editors who may have been inclined to contribute badly needed brain power to substantive Wikipedia articles, rather than procedural squabbles and the laying down of un(der)defined rules. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.104.212.155 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.104.212.155_3ab2.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.104.212.155">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>If any editor is discouraged from creating articles which do not meet Wikipedia guidelines that is an excellent thing. A page on a school is no different from a page on any other topic.

<li>I refer you to the previous comment: "...procedural squabbles and the laying down of un(der)defined rules."

<li>Please sign your entries using ~~~~, which translates automatically. Wikipedia improves because people create and edit good articles and because people nominate non compliant articles for deletion. Each of those is positive editing. This article, though well enough written, is about an entirely non notable primary school. Thus it is nominated for deletion. It is now subject to formal community review and a consensus will be reached. An article that is trivial is not harmless. By existing it causes the harm of dilution of articles that qualify to be here by pap. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a collection of indiscriminate information.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, an article <i>should</i> meet all WP guidelines for content. The way a wiki works is that people can come along and make improvements over time. When you're talking about deletion, you're proposing to curtail that process. The issue for AfD is not the content, but the justifiability of having an article on the given topic at all. In an encyclopedia where consensus has established the value of articles on individual video-game characters, single episodes of TV sitcoms, and various internet memes that have achieved note through a month or two of blogging, I find it difficult to imagine that an actual real verifiable school with decades of history would ever be considered to be below that threshold. WP is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> a paper encyclopedia and there is no question that articles on schools can meet every official policy. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 12:40, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
