<p>Wikipedia is not a game walkthrough guide. This is just a list of non-notable characters in an otherwise-notable game. Nothing in the article asserts the notability of even a single character, let alone the hundreds mentioned. Furthermore, the article has been tagged as OR and unsourced for months yet has never been fixed. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 19:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is notable because it gives the background and history of the characters in the game. It is definitely of interest to those who play the game, and it's hardly a "list" - there is a lot of information in there. I've played the game for years, and it's got a lot of background info in there that I didn't know about, although I will definitely agree that citing sources would be most helpful.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, there's nothing that asserts the notability of the characters in the game. Certain characters in a game definitely are notable because they have become known beyond the game itself, have been mentioned in stories or other fiction, etc. If a character from this premade list is notable, then there needs to be a reference to a source indepdent of the publisher of the game that discusses or treats with the character in a non-trivial way; and these sources need to be primarily about the character, not simply a passing reference to their existance in the game. Thus, it isn't that game characters can't be notable (I would agree that many are; <a href="../../../h/k/-/HK-47_1c7d.html" title="HK-47">HK-47</a> from KOTOR or <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minsc.html" title="Minsc">Minsc</a> from Baldur's Gate are good examples of game characters that have achieved notability on their own, because they've become widely recognized as strong characters that have influenced game development. But this article is nothing more than a laundry list of names that would be better served in a gaming wiki, where comprehensive game guids are accepted. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 02:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The game is as notable as can be; the pre-made characters (nor any characters in the series, user-created or developer-created) are not even the least bit notable. Aside: Has anyone <i>ever</i> used a pre-made character? Who doesn't create one that 1) looks just like them, or 2) looks incredibly weird/fat/ugly? -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:13, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Because the game is notable does not mean that every character in the game is notable. This is essentially a gameguide. Even if notability is eventually established these characters should be merged to the main article per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. <b>Do not keep as a seperate article</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> I've played the game for years, but there isn't anything notable about these characters outside of the fandom itself. Non-notable minutia of notable topics doesn't belong here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Now, why are we even looking at this. This article has been looked over before, and was unanimously kept. Isn't there some kind of Double Jeopardy policy in Wikipedia? And if there isn't, there should be. One can just keep nominating an article until they get enough people along to vote for a deletion, even rallying a group of people they know to do such. I'm not saying this is happening, but I find the nominating of an article twice as being very unfair and unprofessional.</li>

Sorry, no <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benton_v._Maryland_00ec.html" title="Benton v. Maryland">Benton v. Maryland</a> here. It does go both ways... deleted articles can also be recreated at later points too. So, if <i>Make Room for Goopy</i> or <i>Everybody Loves Bella</i> becomes a primtime phenom, the article can be recreated. There's been a push by the higher-ups in Wikipedia toward quality over an earlier call for quantity. The old votes were mainly <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> style votes. We've also gotten some tougher guidelines since then.
