<p>Nominated for deletion on the grounds that the subject doesn't meet the notability criteria set out at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html#Criteria" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)#Criteria</a>. He has published a small number of papers plus two online books that he has self-published on his own website, having apparently not found a publisher for them. According to the article, his main claims to fame are that he has extensively promoted controversial political and historical assertions (note that he is an anthropologist/psychologist, not an historian or political scientist) and that he was allegedly sacked by the University of Pennsylvania for his political activities. He seems to be a fringe figure at best. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 20:30, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b> They do fail the criteria, but that doesn't mean they're not noteable. He does have a list of papers published in some respectable journals (Oxford). But I don't know if I can trust it since most of the references are from his website. Definately needs more sources, if none can be provided, delete. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 23:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The subject may have written some papers, but he's never had a book published. The only sources are from his own sites. I did a more thorough search and found little more to establish his notability. We can always restore the article if he becomes more notable. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 00:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Wait</b>. I assured the person who originally flagged this entry that a colleague of mine would be providing a section on Gil-White's influence in Anthropology/Psychology/Evolutionary Biology that would establish his notability. Furthermore, I believe he does satisfy at least one of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Notability guidelines for academics</a> 81.129.153.28 01:31, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> this researcher is often quoted in the race and intelligence debate, especially here on Wikipedia, has made the news when his university decided not to renew his contract and in essence decided not to let him teach his course (whereas students put together a petition enjoining the university to let him teach). This character is steeped in controversy, but at the same time, notable for his opinions and academic contributions. Google returns 21,300 hits for "Francisco Gil-White". What more is needed to assure notability? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamdrake_e551.html" title="User talk:Ramdrake">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ramdrake_7c03.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ramdrake">contribs</a>).</small></li>

If his article is deleted, fringe "scientists" funded by the <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pioneer_Fund_f842.html" title="Pioneer Fund">Pioneer Fund</a> should also be considered for deletion.

On the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Talk%7ERace_and_intelligence_2341.html" title="Talk:Race and intelligence">Talk:Race and intelligence</a> page, his criticisms have been downplayed, and he has been characterized as a "vanity website" guy, in a clear attempt to remove his criticisms from the record. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 03:54, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Gil-White is an established acedemic, not a "fringe figure" as someone here has suggested. Please refer to his impressive [<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=francisco+gil-white&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=francisco+gil-white&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">returns on google scholar</a>]. Central to a claim for notablility is the importance of his work on the evolution of prestige based hierarchies. This work has had a tremendous impact on the evolutionary psychology / memetics communities. His paper on prestige in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_and_Human_Behavior_596b.html" title="Evolution and Human Behavior">Evolution and Human Behavior</a> has been cited in respectable journals 99 times in the past four years. I will add more detailed content to the main article about his work on the evolution of prestige later today. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmart1_3446.html" title="User:Cmart1">Cmart</a> 15:35, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
