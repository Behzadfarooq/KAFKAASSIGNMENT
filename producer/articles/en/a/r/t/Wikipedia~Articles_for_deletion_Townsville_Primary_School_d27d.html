<li>The Queen appears at about 100 events per year. Other members of the Royal Family attend functions at about the same rate.

<ul>
<li>Notability is established <i>precisely</i> by proxy. The claim of notability is that it was opened by a senior minister of the Singapore government and visited by the head of state of the United Kingdom. Other schools are said to be notable because some of their students went on to become famous (a movie star, a Senator, a major writer, and so on). It's all by proxy. Even <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wilkes_Booth_03b2.html" title="John Wilkes Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> only has an article because the chap he aimed his gun at was a President and not a toilet cleaner.

<li>The Queen's building of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff_University_a727.html" title="Cardiff University">Cardiff University</a> on the Cathays Park site were opened by the Queen and consequently deserve an article because of that? The Queen opens dozens of buildings each year! I can't see why you are mentioning <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wilkes_Booth_03b2.html" title="John Wilkes Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> either. Are you implying that anyone became a Head of State <i>precisely</i> because he attended Townsville primary school? The autism program the school is involved in is more notable, however, I feel that that program deserves an entry, not a school which is involved in it. It's the equivalent of having a <i>List of roads in Washington, DC</i> and no entry on the <i>White House</i>. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:17, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It was just a stub. Now I've added the involvement of the school in the Pathlight project on Autism, one of only three schools planned to have colocation with Autistic facilities for the purposes of integration, the 2001 MOE Excel (innovation) awards held by the Singapore government at the school. Not to mention a government efficiency award received by a head of department at the school.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> primary schools are less interesting than secondaries.

<li>And now added to Townsville Primary School/Temp a speech made by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister, and a widely referenced web page tutorial on simple machines produced by students at the school. Queens, senior government ministers, deputy prime ministers, major educational initiatives, national mainstream newspaper coverage, how much notice must be taken of a school before people saying it is not notable realise that, well, there are a lot of people out in the real world, some of them senior politicians, who happen to disagree? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:01, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
