If it fails the notability guidelines for songs, it has to be deleted. Furthermore, a song being a single is NOT enough to justify keeping an article. In response to Anthony; the fact that other articles dedicated to individual songs exist has no bearing on this particular afd; a lot of those articles need to be deleted as well and will be in time, some do deserve to stay because they pass the notability guidelines. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 15:41, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Blue Shoes" is a good but non-notable album track, and there's no useful content in this article that could be merged. The existence of other articles on songs recorded by Melua isn't really relevant here, because the songs a) were released as singles, which makes them at least somewhat notable, and/or b) they are already-famous songs that Melua has covered. Another issue is that the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piece_by_Piece_%28album%29_4381.html" title="Piece by Piece (album)">Piece by Piece (album)</a> article is rather short as it is right now, which is rather odd given that we have five articles on the singles. I personally would rather have efforts put on expanding album articles to a decent size rather than spreading information about the songs across several separate articles. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 19:54, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep —</b> Article was poorly written and needs copy-edit (I did some) and wikifing. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with it. Java is a new concept, so anything related to it can be labeled a neologism. The problem presented is real and the article factual. In fact I received a <s>US</s> patent for a solution to the problem some 5 or 6 years ago. It could in fact be used as one of the references. (I must put a link to the patent on my user page if I can find it&#160;:-) Anyway, please check the article again, it looks much better now. -- <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetri_Krohn_f1f9.html" title="User:Petri Krohn">Petri Krohn</a> 04:30, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. It is fairly unique as helmets go: most of them are designed to prevent blunt-force trauma (e.g. a football helmet) or keep an airtight seal around the head (e.g. diving helmet). Welding helmets keep too much light from rendering the user blind, and protect from errant sparks.

As it's used in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rust_Belt_c38c.html" title="Rust Belt">Rust Belt</a>, it's probably best to have a category made for those cities.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A category gets the job done easier.

<p>Someone better have a good explanation to why this has existed for over 2 years on Wikipedia. Why are we listing people by hair colour? What about a list of people with black hair which would encompass pretty much everyone of african and asian descent? There seem to be quite a few useless people lists on Wikipedia, but this one is probably shouting out the loudest to be deleted. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:32, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - While it looks like this is going to be deleted, I thought I would mention that while "living" redheads may not be as useful a list (though I wonder about that), a list of historical figures who had red hair <i>would</i> be. As would be the fictional characters. (When one writes a paper on the methodologies of authors in describing the "how" of character design, for example.) So if possible, I'd like to suggest that the list be split to List of fictional redheads and List of historical figures with red hair, and (if consensus suggests deletion) delete the rest. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 14:23, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree and can help make these lists when the time comes. Assuming deletion succeeds, will the two lists (List of fictional redheads and List of historical figures with red hair) be split into "==Natural redheads==", "==Natural redheads who dyed their hair another color==", and "==Notable people who dyed their hair red=="? Or . . . will these lists have each of the subgroups combined? <b>~a</b> (<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArichnad_d429.html" title="User:Arichnad">user</a> • <a href="../../../a/r/i/User_talk%7EArichnad_2e77.html" title="User talk:Arichnad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arichnad_abd7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arichnad">contribs</a>) 16:15, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While it may be useful to know about famous or historical people who dyed their hair red - along with the reasons why (such as <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucille_Ball_0936.html" title="Lucille Ball">Lucille Ball</a>'s, fame for it) - In looking over this discussion, I think that that would be what should be jettisoned. Especially since eventually it could list anyone, since these days, <i>anyone</i> can dye their hair. COnsider the title for such a page: List of people noted for red hair, who actually dyed it red. (Though I suppose there may be a way to shorten the title?) And also, since I think nearly everyone who would be on that list would be from at least as recent as the 20th century. So by default the two lists I suggested should be about "natural" redheads. As for the reason for separate lists from <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">Red hair</a>, is because it's a natural "split", due to length. It's just being done proactively. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 14:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Group nomination of this page and its 2003 and 2005 equivalents. All three were created in May by PC3700DDR (<a href="../../../p/c/3/User_talk%7EPC3700DDR_3e3c.html" title="User talk:PC3700DDR">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PC3700DDR_4ba9.html" title="Special:Contributions/PC3700DDR">contribs</a>) who has since been inactive. They remain sub-stubs with little or no content. There may eventually be some value in creating such articles (though I frankly doubt it) but since no one has made any significant edits in any of them over their six-month life here, it seems that they are bound to remain very low-quality stubs. I would have proded all of them, except one already was and the prod was removed by the creator (with no explanation of course). <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 03:39, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Then prod it again and tell them, to provide a reason when removing that tag. Also, I suspect they either copied from a print source by the same name or that they are working from memory.

<li><b>weak keep, or failing that merge</b> - coming from a country which has honey as a fairly major industry, I am aware that types of honey vary immensely from location to location. Given that, I can see the potential for the growth of these pages. Having said that, there is not that much here at present which could not be successfully merged with the main article.

<ul>
<li>I don't know. You may have misunderstood my comment - that is, that I can undestand having separate articles simply because I know a little about the honey industry due to its prominence where I live. My point is simply that honey does vary from place to place - given that there is honey produced in Finland, it would make sense to have an article detailing its history and varieties. This article could be expanded to cover that, but if that doesn't happen then merger is a reasonable option. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:18, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b>. Article is largely cruft in my opinion as I don't believe Vinyáyá is a large enough character in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artemis_Fowl_d3ae.html" title="Artemis Fowl">Artemis Fowl</a> canon to warrant her own character. I think she was mentioned once in one book and appeared for one scene in another, with little effect on the plot. The article is at most a paragraph and, pending any major and sudden developments in a later work, probably couldn't be expanded. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 21:30, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would disagree due to her status as head of Section 8, seeing as that organization was the base for much of the 5th book. The article would indeed be short--not much more beyond supposition truly could be incorporated except for trivial things about her person, the fact that she's somewhat close to Holly, etc--but it does have expansion possiblity due to both possible future books and the movies. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrashCart9_2d82.html" title="User:CrashCart9">CrashCart9</a> 05:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b> Without any guideline or other source which has criteria these meet, and without multiple independent reliable sources showing their notability, I see no basis for having articles about them. Not every identifiable thing with data in a website or book somewhere needs an article. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:09, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> Almost harmless perhaps individually. But collectively articles such as these make Wikipedia worse, and encourage more of the same. Anyway basis for deletion is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOTindiscriminate</a> information.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 21:18, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b>. Inclusion in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> is the best way to present this information. If a particular tower has some separate notability, because a giant ape climbs it or whatever, then a separate article would be fine. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 12:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

But no sources, press coverage or anything else is provided to suggest why a sporting event planned 8 years hence should have its own article now. World-level events such as the Olympics can get away with this, but based on the article as it now stands, there's nothing to suggest why this one should. Considered PROD'ing but I'm willing to give this the benefit of the doubt. <i>Additional</i>: please note that I only nominated the 2014 article; the 2007, 2009 and 2012 articles were added to the AFD by others.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> A brief search through the Gale and Proquest peridocial databases yields about 13 newspaper mentions. All seem to be about individual students rather than the school itself. There are two articles (in local paper, the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_County_Register_1dde.html" title="Orange County Register">Orange County Register</a>) about stellar performance in nationwide high school science comeptitions. There were a couple articles about students who did some humanitarian projects, again from local paper. LA Times has an article profiling a student who "Easily Jumps Language Barrier, Keeps Going; With an awesome 5.1 grade-point average, Oanh Nguyen has earned a spot at USC's medical school" I don't know if this confers notability. I'm leaning towards no becuase none of the articles had the school as a subject, thus failing <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 06:18, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>5.1 GPA is hardly an honor. I had over a 5.1 (just take a couple APs and Honors), yet I didn't have any articles written about me. In any case, GPA is a relative measurement, based on how hard a schools' teachers grade. (See <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grade_inflation.html" title="Grade inflation">Grade_inflation</a>) We should not be basing a school's notability off of a <i>single person</i> (or even multiple people) with a high GPA. I'd even hold off on basing school notability on average standardized test score (ie SATs). (However, if a school was identified as a high performing school and parents adamantly try to get their kids into it, like what happened in some <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> schools this past year, then I'd say that is notable) <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 11:22, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

The article will still benefit from expansion but it seems that some are too intent on destroying articles to allow that. This AfD seems to be yet another extremely bad faith nomination made just hours after the school survived a DRV, showing that there was a broad consensus among Wikipedians that the previous AfD process was contaminated by bias. Without allowing any opportunity to improve the article after the end of the DRV, this AfD seems to be further proof that there is no intention to improve Wikipedia, but a concerted effort to impose a narrow deletionist view in the face of an overwhelming consensus to the contrary.

<li><b>Comment</b> You (continue to) wrongly assume that a claim to notability automatically implies notability. It does not. Yes, Fairmont has a claim to notability -- being a Blue Ribbon school -- indicating that non-trivial outside coverage is <i>possible</i>. However, <i>actual</i> notability is shown by <i>actually finding</i> such coverage, which we can use to write a good Wikipedia article. Yet the only non-trivial outside source that anybody has found in the 10 days of the first AFD and the DRV is the 255-word write-up in (the local edition of) the LA Times. This is not enough to build a Wikipedia article on. You say this article will "benefit from expansion," but you provide no evidence that this can be done. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fwiw, Alansohn, the renomination was standard procedure since the call to restore at DRV was just a slight majority. On "can't impove", the article was userfied in your userspace during the DRV, so neither of your claims are anywhere near factual, and I would recommend you re-read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and previous AfD. I fail to see the "very hard to deny" argument by Alansohn: do you mean the old argument for many (school) AfD's that the article will somehow improve in the future, although no one really says how it will improve and what sources will be used to do that? The Blue Ribbon is not giving any notability, as indicated by the lack of press coverage and in-depth articles the award has generated, and the International Baccalaureate program is even worse in that regard (the schools pay to become one: not really an award, isn't it?). This school is not notable, and those wanting to keep it have had more than enough time to demonstrate the oppposite, but have failed to do so.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Subject is still notable as an International Baccalaureate school, part of the Blue Ribbon Schools Program, and for being the largest and oldest non-sectarian private school in the area.

Additional concerns are that they are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced, and that there are problems sourcing them</a> and that they contain <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

Also nominated are the lists of idioms for the letters R through Z inclusive (V was never created) and the page to which all the lists were transcluded.

<p>Non-notable candidate. Ran three times for Congress and lost each time. She has nothing else to confer notability upon her. She's just an eye doctor. This is a tough one for me since I have contributed to the article myself. But honestly, she probably isn't going to run again much less get elected. So it makes sense to nix the article. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 05:06, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> Judging from the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Melissa_Brown_4414.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Melissa Brown">last AFD</a>, her notability was established by the publication 120 medical articles.

<li><b>Reply</b> She's run some consultancy called the "Center for Value-Based Medicine" for some years. Writing papers I am sure is part and parcel of the endeavor. However, it gets 100 or so google hits and her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evidence-Based-Value-based-Medicine-Melissa-Brown/dp/1579476252/ref=pd_sim_b_4/102-0989394-0420132" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Evidence-Based-Value-based-Medicine-Melissa-Brown/dp/1579476252/ref=pd_sim_b_4/102-0989394-0420132" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> barely cracks the Amazon top 250,000. I can't verify the number of works that have been published and whether or not they are in mainstream journals.

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually that's the problem, nothing has changed.

<dd>That's not true. Membership in the American Congress is much more powerful than governmental offices in those countries, and individual candidates here are much more widely publicized (i.e. more money is spent promoting them), whereas many newer democracies elect candidates via lists prepared by their party. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 05:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A major-party nominee for Congress is notable. If she's retired from politics, that means only that no one will be reading the article to get information on which to vote. It might well be of interest to someone interested in the history of the elections for the seat.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article is relevant, even though it is related to a peculiar (humorous?) expression. It is informative enough, so that people who come with a question will get an answer. Its style and formatting should be improved.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the concept is useful and used all the time in engineering contexts.

<li><b>Keep</b>, It's probably necessary to keep this article though it does need some major revision. The article should approach from a more scientific/engineering point of view and then briefly mention the popular culture references at the end.

And then you used a name that no longer has the palindromic effect claimed by the article to be so important to the author's transliteration to find books on Worldcat (which still doesn't explain why the ISBN's don't line up with any of the other books)? The two books that you do find under the new non-pen name aren't referenced anywhere in the article (making them further suspect). And finally, one of those two books is written in korean according to your Worldcat search.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but should be checked by those with the ability to verify facts in Japanese, and unverifiable claims removed; while ju66l3r is incorrect to believe that this needs deleting, he is correct to be concerned about <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.<br />
For example, I believe that the article is incorrect to state that the Mephisto award is an annual event, given that -- unless I'm misreading something -- it would seem that over 30 Mephistos have been awarded since 1996. If other parts of the article are equally unreliable, considerable cleanup may be required. Perhaps an {{expert}} tag would be appropriate once this AfD has been cleared up. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:02, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are a number of contested Prods of White Zombie album tracks, but in order to ensure that each is considered on its merits, I'm listing them individually. This particular track was not released as a single, but contains lyrical references to various films, as well as a spoken-word section delivered by Iggy Pop.

<p>No explicit citations; only external link is dead; I gather that it is seriously questioned whether such camps ever existed (as against merely eugenics-based matchmaking). It is possible that there is article potential here, such as about whether they existed, but the current article has been sitting for some time as a probably misleading stub going nowhere. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:12, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><s>*<b>Keep/Rewrite</b></s> The article needs proper sourcing and rewriting, but the topic is immensely relevant for an understanding of Nazi Germany. I will see what I can do to find some references, beside Wikipedia-irrelevant personal memories of a conversation with an old lady who was directly involved. As far as I remember, the matching took physically place at specific "institutions". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 11:17, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I realise the topic is controversial and I may be affected by personal recollections. This <a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/hate_groups/hategroups164.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/hate_groups/hategroups164.html" rel="nofollow">source</a> may give an idea of what was going on. While the existence of the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebensborn.html" title="Lebensborn">Lebensborn</a> program is undisputed, the unresolved issue is whether such matchings were actually encouraged and to some extent organised, as my lady told me. There are <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Lebensborn.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Lebensborn.html" rel="nofollow">claims</a> that they were, but apparently the rumours, that were widespread even before WW2, could not be substantiated by historians (<a href="http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/innenpolitik/lebensborn/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/innenpolitik/lebensborn/index.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 12:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> 60 years after the fall of Hitler, there should be ample archival material to substantiate claims such as those made in the article if the claims accurately describe the Lebensborn program.

<li><b>Comment</b> She came in third place in one of the most popular competitive reality shows on television. I'm not saying all ANTM contestants are notable, but other contestants on ANTM have not received anywhere close to the amount of publicity that Amanda Swafford has received. Her condition (retinitis pigmentosa) has given her a fair amount of notability as well.

<p>Incorrect name for what I believe is called a hood. Material is already covered more thouroughly in beekeeper article. Currently nothing more than a dic def. Creator of this article nominated <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welding_helmet.html" title="Welding helmet">Welding helmet</a> for deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:43, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Redirecting would be misleading because of the article's faulty name.

<li><b>Keep</b> in one form or another.

<li><b>Move</b> to (new article) Beekeeping protective clothing (or similar - perhaps Beekeepers' Pr..). No such thing as a beekeeping <b>helmet</b>, but the article can act as a starting point for a more comprehensive article (which the wiki needs&#160;:)). I think that, at this stage, an article on the single part of equipment (the hood/veil) as separate from the rest is pointless. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 14:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My personal experience says that the name is faulty, too. The sources, such as <a href="http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/sanders88.html" class="external text" title="http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/sanders88.html" rel="nofollow">Charles A.

I say go with the sources rather than my personal experience. ☺ However, it is more commonly called a "beekeeping hat and veil". Research confirms that, too. There's nothing here that isn't at <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beekeeping.html#Protective_clothing" title="Beekeeping">Beekeeping#Protective_clothing</a>, not even the picture, and no indication that a break-out <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> article is yet required for that section. <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beekeeping.html#Protective_clothing" title="Beekeeping">Beekeeping#Protective_clothing</a>, as I was about to do. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I checked some beekeeping supply websites, and the term "Beekeeping helmet" doesn't appear to be a term used in the industry. From what I gather, protective clothing they wear consists of a "bee suit", along with a sun helment, and a "bee veil."

<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't realise any of it had worked... The tool I use to list things for AFD seems to have went crazy and messes things up. Anyway...

Just under 200 odd countries. Say upwards of 100 seats in each national parliament (easily). Maybe 5-6 candidates contesting each seat on average. That would put us over 100 000 candidates to write an article on per election cycle. How many election cycles are there historically in each country?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Let's see here. A sixth-grader (i.e., probably an 11-year-old) writes a series of books and wins a prize for the best book by a kid in his grade in his town. He is excited, and he or his family decide that he should write about the books on Wikipedia. Unfortunately, being the newest of newbies here, he is not familiar with our notability and deletion guidelines, so the new page gets prod'ed and then listed here on AfD the day it is created. Since the page is going to wind up being deleted, perhaps speedily so, this is bound to be disappointing to a younger person proud of his accomplishment. I would urge that we at least try to do it without saying there's "no evidence the books exist" or accusing the new editor of "vandalism" (it's not always apparent to a newcomer why "prod" tags can be deleted but AfD tags mustn't be). I recognize that the younger editors are subject to the same rules and guidelines and notability criteria as the rest of us, and this page shouldn't be kept, but there has to be a more humane way of dealing with this type of situation. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:30, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First thing, I don't see anything that's been said here that's particularly cruel, second, there's plenty of other places where this can be posted, WP is hardly the only web site on the internet, third, it's going to be deleted anyway, what's the diff if it's done now or later, fourth, if you allow exceptions for 11 year old kids, every hoaxster is going to suddenly become 11 years old and make a façade of being a little kid being cruelly persecuted by the heartless cabal, fifth, if one is going to take up creative writing, one might as well get the fear of rejection thing out of the way <i>early</i>, and last, is this the longest run-on sentence you've seen today, or what? <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 21:12, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

I do not accept the assertion that this faculty is not "notable"; in fact, a google search indicates it is. Its own website indicates it has a sizeable law library, which is significant. I cannot see why this law school is any less encyclopedic than any of the many other law schools that have articles.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Agent 86 makes a reasonable point about the law library, but I don't see independent evidence that Calcutta's is anything special - for example, the best in India is claimed to be at <a href="../../../i/l/s/ILS_Law_College_828c.html" title="ILS Law College">ILS Law College</a>. And the Calcutta department of law doesn't feature in any Top-10 lists that I've seen. Nothing outstanding about these two Calcutta departments (or their libraries) is evident either from the latest <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Assessment_and_Accreditation_Council_bcd2.html" title="National Assessment and Accreditation Council">NAAC</a> accreditation report<a href="http://www.naac-india.com/Reports/university%20Calcutta.WB.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.naac-india.com/Reports/university%20Calcutta.WB.doc" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> even though the university as a whole gets a "five-star" top rating. Oh, if you want to know, Calcutta University has 58 departments. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 08:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC),<br /></dd>

<li><b>Keep the article</b> Merda is correct when he reffered to the NAAC. But why everyone is forgetting that a page in the Wikipedia is also something to boast about itself! Moreover, if unless and untill we make an effort to highlight the performance of the Department, not only the NAAC but its own students will also never come to know about its credentials. For almost last 100yrs the Department had given the society numerous emient legal hawks and I think now, when the University is really turning around from the typical mediocracy which once got associated with its image, we must put a thrust in this process by putting forwad its emient Departments.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>My point is, if you squash an effort to make the department's presence over here, you yourselves who are advocating for systematic credentials, will thaw the Departments progress. Why can't we give our effort together and build this article with the datas collected from its current performance and hundred years of legal prescence?Smartsaha 01:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This in no way can be considered an "extremely minor" event, since for one thing, we have already prvoen that in the article by stating the number of people who have attended these tournaments, and second of all, we have many members who come from at least an hour or more drive from Ann Arbor, from places such as Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo, which are quite long drives for something such as a gaming tournament, so there has to be a fair amount of significance to draw them here all they way from where they live. Also, for someone who has such awards and accolades from Wikipedia, I find your scathing sarcasm disappointingly low. Tcoveney 16:36, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am just a huge fan of his music and was suprised to see he did not have a wikipedia page, so i took the liberty to make him one, as for reviews, i posted some on the discussion page of the mike pinto, and below<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous reviews at this link: <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/pintomike" class="external text" title="http://cdbaby.com/cd/pintomike" rel="nofollow">Cdbaby.com reviews</a> Here are just a few examples:</p>
<p>5 stars Reviewer: Sammy Snead / Rasta Roots Radio The first time I heard Mike Pinto’s solo Acoustic album, I was immediately intrigued by the passion and soul pouring from each song. This seven song demo cd is extremely authentic, pure and quietly epic. It was the top music investment to date in the 21st century, until now with Mike Pinto's debut album “Little District”. Produced in the heart of Philly with legendary hometown artist/producer Tim Sonnefeld from the band Townhall, this cd instantly raises the bar for any musician attempting to drop a flawless cd from start to finish. Mike shines with his remarkable story-telling songs such as "Bills Song" "Chilean Lover" and his instant classic "Tricky Nicky". This is the rare reggae/rock/latin/ska/dub release that's both gripping and touching. We all owe him a great amount of gratitude for giving the new music world hope.</p>
<p>5 Stars Reviewer: Mike from KY I am an avid collector of Reggae/Island/Party/Feel Good music. I own over 1000 CD's and Mike Pinto is one of the Best artist in Music today and one of the best CD's I own. He will definitely cross over to the mainstream audience once his music is discovered.Mike Pinto is making the best music available anywhere. If you haven't heard of his music you are really missing out on some of the most intelligent feel good music that is available. Don't hesitate and buy music from Mike Pinto and support creative music at its finest. Mainstream bands don't even hold a candle to him. Listen to it and you will become addicted to some really fantastic music with awesome feel good reggae vibes with a twist.One of the best song writers in the industry today. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/i/p/User%7ERiptorfire_e53e.html" title="User:Riptorfire">Riptorfire</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/p/User_talk%7ERiptorfire_8742.html" title="User talk:Riptorfire">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riptorfire_1d0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riptorfire">contribs</a>) 22:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Quality does not equal notability. Mike from KY wrote: "He will definitely cross over to the mainstream audience once his music is discovered." If that's such a certainty, then you can write an article on him when that happens.

<li><b>Comment</b> Riptorfire, these CDBaby.com reviews don't meet the broad standard of what a "published work" is. What we're looking for here is something that meets the standards discussed in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. Same deal with the national tour. If you can show how the tour was reported by multiple reliable sources, that could work, but a quick google search says no dice on that. Did the single chart, as Powers asked? If you can show us that the single charted, that could provide a keep for the article.</li>

<dd>Just to note this one more time, a deletion finding here is no impediment to Pinto's eventual sucess or any sort of statement about his musical ability. People go to myspace.com to find new music to listen to, not wikipedia. The notability standards of Wikipedia are there to make the encyclopedia more useful for general readers, not to provide some sort of arbitrary stumbling block designed to impede the upward rise of bands. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 18:01, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> I see what you are saying, i think what i will do is copy all the coding, and maybe wait to see if Mike can hit a little more mainstream, because i reviewed the criteria, and while i do greatly enjoy his music, he really does not meet enough of the criteria. I believe it is ok to take this down, but maybe i can resurrect the article when Mike gets his name out there a little more, and meets Wikipedia's standards. <a href="../../../r/i/p/User%7ERiptorfire_e53e.html" title="User:Riptorfire">Riptorfire</a></p>

<p>I freely acknowledge that collective nouns exist -- gaggle of geese, murder of crows, and all that. However, this particular list appears to be filled with nothing but spurious and/or joke collective nouns. For example, a group of actors is called a "cast"? Not hardly; only if they're all working on the same production as actors. A "faffing" of geeks? Come on.

<p>I believe this article's topic to be something that neither requires nor merits a Wikipedia article. I believe that the current low quality of the article (which seems to be not much more than a recitation of demographic statistics with the addition of a single paragraph of not-fully-relevant history) does not, as some might suggest, mean that the article should be improved. I believe, instead, that it demonstrates that a Wikipedia-quality article cannot be written on this topic. The poor article quality is, of course, just a symptom of the lack of encyclopedic nature of this topic. First, I believe that this article has been created to bolster a school of thought which believes that this identity exists. An article on that sort of racialized thinking might be valid, of course, but that's not the same thing as creating an article which should only exist if you buy into their belief system.</p>
<p>As an example of the sort of confused thinking that must have lead to the creation of this article, the "Ethnic group" infobox template has been used. However, this confounds the concept of a skin colour and an "ethnicity". Ethnicity, as reported by Statistics Canada (for example), includes most national identities that can be seriously considered. "Quebecois" (apologies for lack of accents) is included, as is "Canadian", "Irish", "Lebanese" and "Ethiopian". THOSE are ethnicities (or at least, they're worthy of Wikipedia articles, because they clearly encompass a set of people who understand themselves by the label. However, the set of people who understand their own ethnicity to be "White Canadian" is very different from the set of people described by the label.</p>
<p>Finally, I will head off the most obvious and useless argument - which has been used both in the article and on its talk page. In fact, the first sentence of the article is, I believe, nothing more than an attempt to justify the very existence of the article. Any article that must do that is on shaky ground.) The argument basically says that because StatsCan counts it, it must be a valid article. This is an irrelevant point, as StatsCan counts numerous things that are not worthy of articles - can you picture an article with the title "Single Family Dwellings in Kenora"&#160;??? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 16:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Certainly not by me. I don't believe that I'm someone who can comment on those groups' existence within the milieu of the countries in question. However, I would certainly have the immediate reaction that the concept of "White American" certainly is much more present in the mass media of that country than the concept of "White Canadian" is in Canadian mass media, making "White American" more article-worthy than "White Canadian". <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 17:23, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> In response to Ashley Morton, I agree that the term confounds color and ethnicity. I primarily consider the term to imply the physical description of light-colored people which would not be an ethnicity, but my sources I used for citation said it meant European ancestry. In the sense that white is being used as a synonym for European ancestry, white is in fact an ethnicity. I consider the "single family dwelings in Kenora" to be a poor analogy. Surely, not everything should be an article on Wikipedia, but Wikipedia considers ethnic groups to be noteworthy. User:AshleyMorton claim "Canadian" is noteworthy enough to warrant an article, but aren't recent Chinese Canadians culturally or if I may ethnically different from European descent Canadians with a long history in Canada? If your definition Ashley Morton of ethnicity revolves around history and culture, European Canadians have a separate culture from other Canadian groups like Aboriginal Canadians.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 10:52, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regardless of the eventual outcome, this argument doesn't hold. If an article were created called "White Newfoundlander", for instance, it would be even more tenuous than this one. How about "Iberian Canadian" (to lump together people from Portugal and Spain", or "North Asian Canadian" - my point is, simply because you can categorize a group of people and put them under a single label, does NOT mean that that categorization holds equal value to the encylopedia project as all other groups. "Chinese Canadian" - of course! That has to stay - it's a group with many elements of common history, identity, etc., etc., etc. Most relevantly, most members of the group see that as group to which they belong. I and many other white Canadians do not see "White Canadians" as a *group* to which we belong. Similarly, we clearly should not have an article for "Canadians who own umbrellas", because that group does not see itself as a group, and even though it has common elements (nationality, umbrella-owning-status). So, yes there IS logical justification for "singling out" White Canadian - it does not share the other common traits or historical identities that ethnic or cultural groups that have legitimate articles share. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 20:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, to be clear, I'm not using a categorization to disagree with the existence of white Canadian. I'm simply arguing that it, as a group, as an "identity", doesn't meet the sort of criteria to be in the same place as many of those other ones you list. I suspect that if I knew more about the circumstance, <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Australian_ec50.html" title="White Australian">White Australian</a> might also be something of which I'd support the deletion, but that's key - I don't know. I DO, on the other hand, know about the circumstances of fair-skinned people in Canada. I am one, and I know many. In short, they have nothing in common OTHER than their skin colour. At that point, it is either labelling for the sake of labelling (at which point my "umbrella" example is relevant) OR it is a strategy to foist this identity upon the world, as if it is an existent subject. That, I believe would be Wikipedia inventing the world, not Wikipedia describing the world. ...and that's not okay. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 23:36, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is absolutely nothing that makes the situation of white Canadians any different. For example, even in the UK, where it can be argued that whites are the indigeonous population (instead of immigrants), there are differences between English, Scottish, Scots-Irish (in Northern Ireland), Welsh and Cornish cultures. There are even differences in culture within those groups (such as south and north England), different economic classes, different subcultures and other differences that lead to a non-homogoneous culture. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 00:17, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that's true. From a quick look at the respective articles, it appears that "white British" and "white Australian" are both defined by a census question about ethnicity, and the British article specifically addresses the cultural groups. In contrast, the Canadian census does not mention "white" at all in the question about ethnic origin, only in a separate question about visible minority status—race and colour are separate variables. Although we're trying to clean it up, some editors are conflate the two concepts based on orthogonally-opposed data variables, to paint their own picture of a white "Canadian race", completely insupportable by the data.&#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-12-06&#160;00:37&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<li>Of course you can keep one and not the other.

That's like saying there needs to be an article on "Italians in Canada before 1400" because we could write an article on "aboriginal people in Canada before 1400" - Sure, it's equal, but the facts intervene and inform us that one doesn't exist. Of course, I'm not saying there are no white Canadians - I'm saying that you can't off-the-cuff generalize from one article of a certain type to another of the same type - you must actually consider the validity of each article seperately.<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 23:50, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

"White Canadian" is a meaningless label, of at best <i>suspect</i> POV status, which does <i>not</i> define a unified group that has any common history, culture or social context unique to the circumstance of being white.

Wikipedia's job is to reflect <i>terms that are actually in use in the real world</i>, to write about and reflect topics that <i>other</i> sources have <i>already</i> deemed encyclopedically significant. "Black Canadian" fits that criterion; "White Canadian" does not. European Canadian is a <i>much</i> better approach to this — while I'm still not sure there's that <i>much</i> that can be written about the topic, and would therefore <i>still</i> have to think very carefully about whether it was keepable as written, the title comes <i>much</i> closer to reflecting the distinctions that actually exist in Canadian culture as defined by the external sources that determine the encyclopedic value of a WP article. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:43, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a group of people in Canada. People of European ancestry. It is a relevant article related to Canada, and is not "low quality", it is similar content in all other "ethnic group" articles. If you delete this, why not delete "Chinese Canadian" or "French American"? You don't have much of a reason why you would like it deleted rather then critisizing its quality. But it shows accurate facts and percentages etc., and seems pretty fine to me. Don't see any reason for it to be deleted. Are you a racist&#160;? A racist American could delete "African American" then. "Not relevant" what are you talking about, it is the majority ethnic group in Canada, how is that not relevant? I think maybe you are scared it is racist, or something like that, but either way your personal opinion does not matter 100% and you should focus on wether the article can benefit any reasercher, or wether it is relevant. It IS relevant. If they have an article on "African Canadians", who are around 4 % of the Canadian population I believe, why on earth can't there be an article for "White Canadians", the largest ethnic group in Canada? I fail to see an adequate reason for deletion, rather than some sort of personal grudge. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanRP_d875.html" title="User:RyanRP">RyanRP</a> 03:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, Michael Z., the point you just made would mean that all the ethnic group pages should be deleted, because that's basically what they all are. And the "Latin American not counted" part was always there, on the original version. Seriously, with your argument, that means we should delete EVERY ethnic group page for EVERY country on Wikipedia, because what you say is "wrong" with this article is what every ethnic group article is. Information about a certain group of ethnicity in a country, what percentages they are in population, and the like. 03:34, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And eron, if you say that, then lets have "African American", or "Indian British" deleted aswell. Seriously, "White", no matter what your personal opinion is, DOES exist. there are WHITE , PEOPLE. They are REAL they EXIST. every group of people "really exists" but white people"?? That certainly isn't true!

<dd>I don't think you understood what I was implying by my comment.

<dd>No. "Black Canadian" <i>actually</i> exists in the real world as a term <i>actually</i> in use to define a cultural grouping.

<p>James Girvin WikiWebGeneral 05:24, 6 December 2006 (UTC)is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life. <small>— WikiWebGeneral (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WikiWebGeneral_4d13.html" title="Special:Contributions/WikiWebGeneral">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p>I feel that any person should be entitled to a page as long as the page is useful to others who may find what that person does interesting and useful as long as these arent personal adds or jokes. Why does allowing James Girvin to have a page hurting anyone. You allow people who have done zero for society like Paris Hilton to have a page but you don't allow good people have one. <small>— <a href="../../../j/d/d/User%7EJDD1985_375b.html" title="User:JDD1985">JDD1985</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/d/User_talk%7EJDD1985_da97.html" title="User talk:JDD1985">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JDD1985_f90b.html" title="Special:Contributions/JDD1985">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.

<dd>That Paris Hilton has an article is not a reflection of her value to society. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability guidelines</a> are not based on whether a person is good, or whether it isn't "hurting anyone".

<dd>I looked at the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability guidelines</a> and I feel that this subject fits very nicely within the bounds of Wikipedia. I understand why Paris Hilton is here and I was just making a point much like the James Girvin Article.

<li><b>Delete</b> article completely unencyclopedic.

<p>Contested speedy. I appreciate the project is trying to improve the coverage of fire services in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Oak Grove Fire Department is part of WikiProject Fire Service, which is building a comprehensive and detailed guide to the fire service around the world. As it is part of a global WikiProject this article should not be deleted. Recommend to keep article. Additionally, it is considered common courtesy to inform the author of an article when their article has been marked for deletion. This was not done by the requestor but I have now informed the author. --Drew30319 18:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I tagged it because I attempted to tag all fire service related articles, and plan to leave it to others to make them noteworthy. I have tagged a number of articles which I even plan to nominate for deletion or merger. They are tagged as a way to categorize them, not as a way to state their importance to the project.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this page. This page is NOT about the town "Oak Grove" with a population of 376. If the "editors" would do more research they would know this. The town they are referring to is in northern Arkansas. The Oak Grove Fire Department referenced in this article is located in central Arkansas, in Pulaski County. I believe this article is a fair and true representation of the Department as a whole, as I am a member of it. As for it's notewortyness, who is the judge of that. I beleve it is noteworthy to those who are affected by it, which is more than 4,000 (not 376). Also, it is a good information article for other small fire departments that may have some questions about how to structure themselves. On a free encyclopedia how can anyone suggest deletion of an article that is both founded in fact, and written neutrally? I believe this is an abuse of deletion abilities. If the creators of Wiki were so concerned about every article being of particular interest to everyone in the world it would stand to reason to accept all (rule-abiding) articles they could get. I certainly have no interest in an article about the Pickwick Lake Dam, however I venture to guess that those persons in that area do. Therefore I wouldn't suggest deletion of that article just because I do not have a personal interest in it. Please realize that this is not a print resource, and as such it's resources, while finite, are large enough to preclude this type of wanton disregard for smaller towns in not-so-popular states. I urge you to remove this deletion tag and keep this article. I have no problem editing it if that is required. However, please give the people of this Community their due, let this page stay. Thank you. Joe.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The topic is encyclopedic. Problems over content are not solved by deletion. If we decide to delete this, it will be questionable whether anyone is allowed to create an article about the real Liburnian language without some tedious and problematic "resurrection" procedure here. (I would consent to any sort of deletion of this page only if the deletion deletes hoax content edits, but not the topic itself.) <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaed_5b84.html" title="User:Maed">Maed</a> 07:34, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I'm glad to hear the opinion that the topic is encyclopedic. Can you then refer me to some resources so I can read about it for myself? I have not been very successful yet on my own (I'm usually pretty good at finding resources) and am doing my best to remain open minded. I will try to locate the references noted on the article's page.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless someone has the specialist knowledge to present differing opinions from a NPOV.

<li>Thank you, Dewrad. It certainly is better, but I'm still concerned that this article may be speculation dressed up as knowledge. The article has too many un-cited, <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">vague assertions</a> like "It appears to have been...", "may well have been", "a number of linguists argue" and "probably very early in the Common era" while giving the impression that such theories are more or less established as facts. The title and overall approach to the topic may be inherently POV since apparently not everyone agrees it was a distinct language. The sources seem rather sparse. The Wilkes book only mentions names and the Untermann article is 16 pages long, but may not be all about Liburnian. --<a href="../../../h/j/m/User%7EHJMG_daa3.html" title="User:HJMG">HJMG</a> 16:16, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Specialized knowledge is not necessary. What is necessary is that a language with an iso code and multiple mentions in major reference work in the subject is notable. (this is an article about the Liburnian language, so it also does not require specialist knowledge to see that any doubts about a neo-Liburnian language is besides the point.

<li>Thank you DGG. I agree about the language having an ISO code. Good point. And, for "multiple mentions in major reference works," you must then consider two works, Trask and Price, adequate, even if all there is in each work is 1-2 sentences.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It's not a good article at all, but I suspect most of the claims made in it can actually be sourced from previews etc., so it probably doesn't actually violate any inclusion policies.<br />
The Wikipedia approach to substandard articles is to improve them, not to delete them. Therefore, before this is considered for deletion, it should be cleaned up by removing non-encyclopedic content and claims that genuinely <i>cannot</i> be verified from the multiple sources provded. Only then will it be clear whether there is actually any content here or not. If there turns out not to be any, then deletion can be considered, but as I said, I suspect it will turn out that most of the claims are verifiable. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not an expert on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, but I think these two related pages violate it. The concept of an Unofficial Rubgy Union World Championships is one that does not exist (or at least, is not shown to exist) outside these pages. <i>any facts, opinions, interpretations, definitions, and arguments published by Wikipedia must already have been published by a reliable publication in relation to the topic of the article</i>.

I like the concept and I like the <a href="../../../u/n/o/Unofficial_Football_World_Championships_7223.html" title="Unofficial Football World Championships">Unofficial Football World Championships</a> on which it is based, but I think it consists entirely of original research. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 13:34, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The state of an article is not a valid way to determine notability.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: Agreed that the poor condition of an article does not, in and of itself, confer non-notability on its subject. But the quality of relevant articles are useful as circumstantial evidence of notability in the absence of other indicators. And unfortunately, there is such an absence. A well-written and well-linked article on the Norwegian site might suggest systemic bias is behind the poor quality and unclear arguments for notability of the English article. But the article on the Norwegian site is also in a problematic state, so the fact of its existence is little argument for keeping the English article. So we're left with an orphaned stub with no coherent claim to notability: Eckhoff was a professor, and he published "Rettskildelære". Which may or may not be a notable publication, but at this point we have to guess. If someone can develop the stub to the point where the claim to notability is clear, I'm happy to change my vote. Barring that, I don't see how delete (with no prejedudice against recreation) is controversial. Even stubs have to assert notability, and the bar should be higher for orphan stubs. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 19:06, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This was created by a fellow member of my class. It's not intended to put pressure on the professor - the professor asked us to come up with our own grading scheme. However, I think it was mistakenly placed on Wikipedia, which is not a free host.

<li>At the moment, the article is nothing but raw statistics, which read a lot like "Hey, look how good we are!". I am unsurprised to see information in support of the site being posted by the same person that used the word <i><a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">we</a></i> in the review.
