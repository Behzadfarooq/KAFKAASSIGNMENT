Additional concerns are that they are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced, and that there are problems sourcing them</a> and that they contain <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The only defence put up was the non-argument that these lists are useful. Also nominated are the lists of idioms for the letters C, D, E, and F. Transwikiing to Wiktionary, for the ones that aren't in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Idioms" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Idioms">wikt:Category:Idioms</a> is optional. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 06:58, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe that summary deletion was the incorrect action to take for the (A) article, and a suitable period of time should have been allowed for a transwiki to take place - preferably by placing a notice on the article "freezing" it and requiring transwiki by a particular date. There are editors still contributing to these articles, and I think it is simply rude to delete the articles from under them, so to speak. Since the principle of removal from Wikipedia has been agreed in the AfD debate for the (A) article, there is no argument to keep the others - that is obvious. I would ask that the good faith contributions of many editors is not simply trashed. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 08:55, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You are free to ask any admin if he/she would put a copy of any deleted article as a subpage of your userpage. As long as the article is not offensive etc. There is no problem with that. You can work on it from there then. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 09:04, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Anyone can request userspace undeletion for transwikiing. As for yanking the articles out from under the editors, they have five days to save their own copy, and for the A one they had more. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 09:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I thought that at one time it was actually policy for people <b>not</b> to save deleted articles in their userspace, otherwise I would have preserved a copy for a transwiki operation. It's possible I misunderstood, or the rules changed. Anyway, would a kind admin please undelete List of idioms in the English language (A) and drop it as a sub-page into <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_Idioms_dd5d.html" title="User:West London Dweller/Idioms">User:West London Dweller/Idioms</a>. I'll copy the rest, or if whichever friendly Admin does the job, they could copy all the pages as subpages of the above and speedy delete the rest. Thanks.

<dd>Well, yes - but I don't own the articles - I can't speak for all other editors. What I'll probably do is take a copy while the AfD debates are going on, and let the proper process take its course. Summarily deleting them and putting them all in my userspace doesn't seem like proper process to me, convenient as it may be. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 09:22, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I didn't understand the first eleven words of your closure notice. I had (&lt;-note past tense) no idea what 'userfy' meant, and my reading was that I would need to ask for info idiom by idiom, when I didn't have a list to refer to - which seemed almost Kafkaesque. Thank-you for putting the entire article in my userspace. I will copy the other articles to the same place, to avoid wasting other people's time, and not participate in further AfDs on these articles. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 09:22, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That sounds like a fair question to me, see above. If WLD is willing to work on/marshal others to work on transwikiing these, I don't see a problem with userfying them all at once. Breaking them up into separate discussions is useless in any case, except as a test of whether you'll get the same result nominating the same thing for deletion six times. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 06:10, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That is not meant to make you change your mind, simply to correct a possible misapprehension. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 10:14, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s>Change to <b>Speedy delete all</b></s>. Every definition from <a href="http://www.ue.edu.ph/manila/uetoday/?nav=14.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ue.edu.ph/manila/uetoday/?nav=14.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> has made it in to its corresponding article, which means a CSD G12 copyvio. <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a> <small><sup>[ <a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">T</a> ] [ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">C</a> ]</sup></small></b> 14:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Change back to <b>Delete all</b>. I've changed my mind again. The copyvio isn't that blatant, and there is a lot more text and content in the current articles than there are in the linked page. But add copyvio to my list of reasons. <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a> <small><sup>[ <a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">T</a> ] [ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">C</a> ]</sup></small></b> 14:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>As dicdefs and as unsourced or original research. I hate folk etymologies, where someone sits down at the keyboard and decides what the history of a word or phrase is based on their own hunch. When no source citation is provided, that is the implied source, and it is wrong as often as not. Then this sometimes incorrect info will get cited by kids in research papers, and prank ones (made up in school one day) will get added, with no basis for judging which should stay and which should go. If each was footnoted to a reliable publiched source and did not violate a copyrighted definition, then such a database would be valuable on one of the Wikiprojects, perhaps Wiktionary. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:45, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>transwiki</b> all of them. These idiom list articles are really informative to non-native speakers, and sometimes to native speakers too. As long as they don't contain any neologisms or in-jokes, the content is encyclopedic too. They should be contained in at least some Wikimedia project. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 19:24, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep/transwiki</b>. It's sad that deletionists have become so impatient that they can't put a transwiki tag on an article and give people a few months to transwiki to the appropriate project. Do people here just not understand the concept of transwiking at all? --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 01:02, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep! There is something really whacky going on here. How can this be considered a valid AfD <u>before</u> the transwiki has been done? --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnel_MacKenzie_91fe.html" title="User:Connel MacKenzie">Connel MacKenzie</a> - <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie" class="extiw" title="wikt:User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie">wikt</a> 17:15, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Transwiki" (like "userfy") is a neologism created a couple of years ago. Many of the people who contribute to Wikipedia in various ways are not computer experts, and if there is an article explaing it a reference to that might be appreciated. All I see are computerspeak jargon loaded pages about backlogs and logs and templates, with no overview. To the naive outsider it would appear that anyone could save a copy of an article and upload it to another Wiki. I suppose the cryptic transwiki process might preserve added context such the edit history comments, or history of AfDs? It is not immediately clear why an article that could be copied and uploaded in a few minutes takes months to "transwiki" and why it has to stay in the mainspace under some type of suspended sentence of deletion, or why editors should have to leave an unencyclopedic article alone and mark their calendar for some unspecified number of months in the future to check back and see if it is gone, or put it on their personal watchlist and see every minute wikilink added, or comma removed, or vandalism added and reverted for several months.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:57, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep until properly tranwikied</b> The content represents a lot of research, and while lacking references, is definitely of encyclopedic value IMHO.--<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 20:05, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete All</b> per above and per discussion in "(A)". Largely original research, and it's a question of opinion as to whether a number of these are actually idioms. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:08, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
