<li><b>"Keep It"</b> by TAB - This show is on TLC, on a special called "I Am My Own Twin". I am watching it right now, on TLC which happens to be a division of the Discovery Channel networks - <b>yes, TLC</b>, and it was on a month or two ago as well. I would think that TLC tries hard to validate the stories that they show. Lydia was not the only person featured on the show. There was another woman named Karen Keegan who had the same Chimera DNA issue, as well as the case of a baby born as a hermaphrodite. I've never known TLC to be a National Enquirer type network that shows false things. As for the google search, there are two other links on the results page that bring her up under the topic of chimera. So, she is out there in the search engine. The TLC show doesn't list the people featured on their show, otherwise her name would probably show up there if they listed names. I'm sure you could simply contact the TLC network to verify this story. I don't see what the big deal is with verifying this when it's already been featured on a major cable network such as TLC. <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/schedule/series.jsp?series=111185&amp;gid=0&amp;channel=TLC" class="external free" title="http://tlc.discovery.com/schedule/series.jsp?series=111185&amp;gid=0&amp;channel=TLC" rel="nofollow">http://tlc.discovery.com/schedule/series.jsp?series=111185&amp;gid=0&amp;channel=TLC</a> <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 24.17.20.143 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.17.20.143_aaa6.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.17.20.143">contribs</a>) 07:59, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep it</b> -- Chimerism is a rare gentic anomaly; there are only two current cases being followed in the United States. Lydia Fairchild is the only case that has caused legal precedent for human chimera.

<li><b>"Keep It"</b> - Hello? It is verifiable by virtue of the fact that it was on a national information network/channel and had to pass the smell test of the producers, etc. etc. of that show on TLC. It is <b>not</b> just original research. Maybe it was 'orginal research' <b>before</b> it was screened by a reputable cable network and broadcasted to millions. But now it fits the 'verifiable' qualifications and has gone beyond being original research or just a theory. All you have to do is contact the TLC Network and/or the larger Discovery channel company. You could even contact the hospitals and other sources that are mentioned on the show. How hard is that to understand? Why is this site run by teens who live in isolated locations? That is scary. Can your qualifications be 'verified'? lol<small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 24.17.20.143 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.17.20.143_aaa6.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.17.20.143">contribs</a>) 21:55, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>"Keep It"</b> - In "Calculated Risk: How to Know When Numbers Deceive You", by Gerd Gigerenzer, DNA testing offers the illusion of certainty. If you have a brother, your brother has a 1 in 16 chance of matching your DNA. I love science, but science is constantly changing. DNA testing will eventually be a footnote in history, like everything else mortals come up with.<small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 160.254.20.253 (<a href="../../../1/6/0/User_talk%7E160.254.20.253.html" title="User talk:160.254.20.253">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_160.254.20.253_9afc.html" title="Special:Contributions/160.254.20.253">contribs</a>) 17:07, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>"Keep It"</b> by EMAnthon - I too just watched the TLC show "I Am My Own Twin" While some of the information in the article is off (Lydia's lawyer didn't find the article on Karen Keegan, the prosecutors did) and if you have more of the information as to how she came to end up in court (Accusations of Welfare Fraud) it makes the information more credible. The TLC/Discovery Health Channel will air it again on JAN 22 2006 @ 08:00 PM, JAN 22 2006 @ 11:00 PM, JAN 29 2006 @ 07:00 PM - This website Everything2.com <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=chimera" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=chimera" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>has an entry dated Thu Jul 21 2005 at 21:15:26 That gives further information and sources from medical journals and doctors that so many of you who want to delete it requested. Also my google searches came up with several other links to Lydia's case and when you add Chimera to her name a more specific list is produced. - 28 December 2005<small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 204.128.192.5 (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.128.192.5.html" title="User talk:204.128.192.5">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.128.192.5_a209.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.128.192.5">contribs</a>) 23:18, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>"Keep It"</b> – Further in the book "Calculated Risk”"</li>
</ul>
<p>On page 167 in a section titled “The Fabrication of Certainty”: (a) 1 in 100 DNA test is a false positive. (b) The FBI has fought hard to prevent outsiders from seeing the results of there own internal tests on DNA accuracy. On page 180: “subjective judgements are an integral part of” DNA testing (matching up lines of a two DNA profiles). On page 181: DNA is effected by sunlight, poor laboratory practices, or inadequate analysis.</p>
<p>My point is a follows: The mainstream notion of DNA’S infallibility is a hoax. DNA is not the end game. There is much yet to be discovered and cataloged for future reference. To delete the ”Lydia Fairchild” story would censor a probable truth. Nothing good will come of such censorship.</p>
<p>Note: FEMA is funding the Katrina DNA testing. Not sure if FEMA has opted to fund the expensive DNA test (more accurate) or the cheap DNA test (not as accurate). When you think DNA testing, think FEMA, perhaps you'll have more empathy for ”Lydia Fairchild”'s nightmare. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 68.193.211.21 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.193.211.21_f31b.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.193.211.21">contribs</a>) 00:23, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
