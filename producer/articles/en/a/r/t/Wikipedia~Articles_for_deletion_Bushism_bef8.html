<p>"Bushism" is indeed exactly a neologism. Where did it come from? Who uses this term? Anyone notable? This article does not specify. The article indeed makes no claims to the notability of this term, whatsoever. It cites no credible references. It is speculative. It does contain a ton of quotes. And a poem. Thus, it's totally unencyclopedic. I suggest we move the quotes not already in Wikiquote to Wikiquote and bag the rest of it. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 05:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> the term Bushism is well know in the United States, regardless of how one feels about it, these things did happen and are a part of U.S. history (such as it is). 64North 07:11, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as well-known term. The word was used as the title of at least five books (<i>More George W. Bushisms</i>, <i>Still More George W. Bushisms</i>, <i>George W. Bushisms V</i>, etc). Over 800,000 google hits, and numerous google news hits. The good folks at the <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog" class="external text" title="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog" rel="nofollow">Language Log</a> have referred to the word 37 times. It has entered the lexicon. That said, the quotes in this article could be pared down a lot. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 05:50, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Bikeable (the books have even spawned desktop calendars). The term is well-defined and commonly used. I'd be behind a move to transfer all the "example" quotes after the first section to Wikiquote, leaving the ones in the "background" section there. Not totally sure about the poem. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 06:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it's passed the point where it has notablity that it's not just another neoligism.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think 6 years of very <i>active</i> use in a variety of mediums (the books, the calendars, there is even a couple audio CDs) as well as the press mentions has moved "Bushisms" beyond the realm of being a neologism. And as someone who has voted for him, I don't think this is a matter of Bush-hating. It a matter of a very notable phrase.<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's unwarranted to infer from Bush's misspeakings that he's an idiot. Clumsy speakers aren't necessarily dumb. Personally, I think it's just the folksy way he talks. (But maybe I think that because I'm not a Bush detractor.) Or, maybe because it's actually kind of endearing, he does it on purpose (part of his political strategery). The point is that Bushisms are notable because they have engendered chatter from humorists and speculation from analysts. A balanced article should include comments both from Bush's detractors (like Molly Ivins who is already cited) and his defenders. And of course you're right that sentences like what you quoted are not appropriate. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 18:20, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So let's just take the legal question out of consideration. Second, the article is, for the most part, sourced.

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> As mentioned above, if there's a larger article for gaffes of politicians, maybe this could be moved there. It's certainly not a stand-alone article, though, no matter how funny or politically advantageous it may be for those who created the article in the first place. <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubc0724_51dd.html" title="User:Dubc0724">Dubc0724</a> 17:26, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether or not politics played a role in the creation of this term or article is simply not relevant.

The political origins and motivations behind the creation of those two terms is much more clear cut. Again, the fact is that Bushism is a notable neologism used throughout the English-speaking world. In at least one Canadian school Bushisms are used as a tool in teaching English to foreign language students. <a href="http://www.vec.ca/english/11/bushisms.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vec.ca/english/11/bushisms.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 19:16, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
