<li>I'd like to know why it was put up for deletion, the fact that they have 3 full releases can be seen simply by clicking on their official site link from the article, I sourced the fact that ther song "hunger" has been mistaken for <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">metallica</a>, see the talk page for the article <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Anger_3a44.html" title="Saint Anger">Saint Anger</a> where will you see one user has commented questiong where the song is from, or look on <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Megadeth+%2526+Metallica" class="external text" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Megadeth+%2526+Metallica" rel="nofollow">here</a> where it appears people think its a secret metallica/<a href="../../../m/e/g/Megadeth.html" title="Megadeth">megadeth</a> collaberation.

<li>Well, the information about their releases on the band's own website, while probably true, does not in itself satisfy Wikipedia's criteria for verifiable information from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The source cited must be independent; anyone can conceivably publish any information about themselves.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Nobody is claiming that that the band or albums don't exist. What is at question is whether or not the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> are being met.

<li><b>Delete</b> No sources indicating that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> has been met. We can argue around in circles about "what else is their on the internet," but Wikipedia has clear guidelines about what constitutes notability. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 09:54, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> After careful consideration, I must agree with the nominator. They exist, sure, but the issue is the notability criteria listed in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>. They have released three albums, but none of those on a major label or recognized large indie label; Godfather records is described as a label they founded themselves. As far as directories, these are considered to be works that provide only trivial coverage: release dates, titles, and so forth. If the albums were released on a major label, or they had won a major award, or really any of the other criteria, that would be one thing, but the absence of any major coverage by a non-trivial published work trumps all other concerns in the meantime. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 09:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Come on, now you're arguing they deserve an encyclopedia article based on a resemblance to somebody who deserves one? And while we are voting in a sense, we really aren't; we're trying to establish consensus based on the most compelling argument, which at this point seems to be "delete" on the grounds that there are no reliable sources indicating this band meets our notability criteria.

<p>Meh I didnt say keep them just because they sound like them, but the fact there mp3s were being disguised on filesharing programs as their songs and people were believing it, just like james labries solo album was mistaken for the new dream theater and that ayreon song with bruce dickinson was labled as new iron maiden. I am sure both those instances are probably mentioned somewhere on wikipedia. I didn't even say that was the only reason. They have 3 albums, also when adding bands to a list, most lists require the band to have a page, so for example the list of christian metal bands page would not be allowed to have eternal decision on it since they do not have a page, even though they are a very notable band for that genre. --<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 10:18, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><strike><b>Delete</b>:</strike> The policy is not a fancy way of saying 'popularity', at all. This band does not have multiple, verifiable sources. If they are notable within the Christian Metal genre, then why has nobody ever written about them? This isn't a vote, if thirty people suddenly said 'keep', then the article would not be kept. This is a discussion. We discuss the Wikipedia policies and guidelines, and try to come to a conclusion as to whether the article deserves to be kept. No decent reason has been given as to why this should be kept. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 12:41, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

There are plenty band articles in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">black metal</a> genre that have no more or even less verifiability than this simply because like christian metal it is a more underground scene and yet noone contests those, this is why wikipedias policy is a joke.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: E tac, what you are saying is a joke. The music I like isn't exactly commercial- check out <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire_%28musician%29.html" title="Voltaire (musician)">Voltaire</a> for instance. He is my favourite artist, and no, he is certainly not on MTV and selling millions of records, but look, he is very much notable, and I am able to write a well sourced article on him. There is a difference between obscure and unusual, and non notable. Voltaire is obscure and unusual, my friends' band (which performs in the village hall, our school hall and the local clubs) is non-notable. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 22:33, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As well as three independent interviews and an independent biography. Anyways, if you had actually checked the links, you would see that, despite the fact that they were hosted on the Projekt Records website, a lot of the time I was referencing the comments in the reviews that had been placed below the information. Projekt Records post hard, fast information (which is fine to source) and then they take independent reviews, from palces like allmusic.com and numerous magazines, and place them below. Admittedly, they will no doubt take only the best reviews, but I am still quoting independent reviews, whether or not they have been placed on the site. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 11:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

(Don't take that as an attack, <a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a>, I know you're trying). Sometimes a deletion debate carries an article to the next step in terms of quality, by forcing editors to provide verifiable sources for things like notability or risk losing the article. Simply calling the idea of deleting the article ridiculous though, doesn't really help much. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 02:47, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Point taken. In this case, though, I think the claim according to the nominator -- and I don't think this claim has been proven false as of yet, hence my vote -- is that no acceptable sources exist, and that therefore the article's central claim of notability cannot be validated. So putting the unreferenced tag on the article wouldn't have solved anything. The article is up for deletion on the grounds that there are no reliable sources to reference. At least that's my understanding. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 08:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> From <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>, a band is notable if:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, magazine articles, and television documentaries except for the following: Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the musician/ensemble talks about themselves, and advertising for the musician/ensemble." One entry in Allmusic, which Wikipedia does certify as a reliable guide or source, does not constitute multiple non-trivial published works. Now, if that entry certified that the band hit any of the other criteria, such as two albums on a major or large independent label, or a charted hit in any country, or had won a major music award, or had a record certified gold or higher in any country, then, once again, that would be another matter. Furthermore, the biographical entry you cite is so blatantly laudatory that it reads exactly like a press release, which is clearly disallowed by the direct quotation above. So far, the fact still remains clear that this band has not been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, and the one work you have cited does not confirm <i>any</i> of the notability criteria being satisfied. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 09:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable." Like, say, Jon Spencer of <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Spencer_Blues_Explosion_112c.html" title="Jon Spencer Blues Explosion">Jon Spencer Blues Explosion</a>. The difference between the two articles you cite is that, in the case of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_Trash_3bd0.html" title="Heavy Trash">Heavy Trash</a>, the Allmusic entry confirms notability according to the criteria established for bands on Wikipedia. In this case, the Allmusic source is enough, because notability is confirmed. On the other hand, the allmusic entry on <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal_Decision_fc9f.html" title="Eternal Decision">Eternal Decision</a> confirms none of the criteria. So the absence of <i>multiple</i> works makes it obviously deletable. A careful reading of my comment above should have made this clear. However, it seems you feel the need to be sarcastic and personal about this situation, which I don't appreciate.

<li><b>Delete</b> The band's existence on the internet consists of media promotion. The same press release is seen over and over again. They are listed on various websites - usually with the comment that there is no further information. This looks like a band and their fans using the internet to promote their name - nothing wrong with that, but the guidelines on music notability are worded to exclude such bands from being on Wikipedia. After some considerable time researching this band on the internet, I have yet to see any comment on the band that could be identified as having been written by someone other than the band promoting themselves. There is nothing significant at stake here. At the moment it appears this band is fairly clearly of little interest to the average music reader, so there would be no loss if the article were deleted; however, when the band manage to secure a name for themselves a Wiki article can be written at that time. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 23:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> is my vote I guess for reasons I have stated above and on the article itself. No they might not be of interest ot the "average music reader" if there is such a thing, but for somone who is interested in their style of metal and more specifically <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Metal_35a0.html" title="Christian Metal">Christian Metal</a> they are noteable and are worth reading about. Noone seems to get that though, and just say my sources are a joke, but it is beyond the point of me really caring anymore. So I will refrain from discussing the article on this page and let the people who know what they are talking about sort it out. I hope you all have a nice day and I apologize to those who I apparently have offended. --<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 23:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I don't believe there are sure fire rules for situations like this, and that is why we have these debates. I personally still don't think that it is quite enough.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: "It was in 1997 that Eternal Decision's first album hit the record stores in the U.S. and 16 other countries, achieving considerable acclaim and providing the band with even more notice" from a neutral source (AMG) seems pretty notable to me. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Long_a032.html" title="User:Tim Long">Tim Long</a> 00:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The sources seem to be within the guidelines from what I can tell. The band is certainly notable to anyone who listens to the genre, I've heard a lot of their music before, so they're not entire obscure or irrelevant; they really are relevant in the Christian metal scene. The information is valid, and the sources that the information is coming from are also valid and reliable. I don't see any reason why this band should be considered irrelevant in regards to some of the other bands here on Wikipedia. A band doesn't need ten million record sales on a huge label to have an impact on a music genre. They've got the longetivity, the impact on a genre, the international release, the multiple albums, and everything else that you could possibly want a band to have in order to be notable. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralTreyDavid_08ae.html" title="User:AdmiralTreyDavid">AdmiralTreyDavid</a> 03:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
