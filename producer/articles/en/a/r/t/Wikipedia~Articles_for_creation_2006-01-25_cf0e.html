<p>The Beast Toast campaign can be explained as an experiment in Phenomenology. The first aim of Phenomenology is to reawaken a sense of wonder about one's environment. The Beast Toast campaign attempts to stimulate curiousity and bring people to question both the campaign and their relationship with their surroundings. Because people are not used to seeing advertisements or propaganda for which the motive is not obvious, frquent and novel encounters with Beast Toast propaganda provoke thought and possible frustration, nevertheless revitalizing the viewer's perception and attention to detail.</p>
<p>In a school in Southern California (Culver City High School), the "Beast Toast Movement" has sparked an interest in many sudents. Why? Beast Toast can best be described as an experiment in Phenomenology. There is no absolute purpose to this, other than to cause confusion. And with confusion comes curiosity. From that, comes the harsh reality that people are stupid. From stupidity, comes anger. Yes, we plan to actually stimulate any brain activity in a public high school by posting stickers of a poorly drawn piece of angry bread among all corners of a school. There is literally no corner of the school where you're not under the watchful pupils of Beast Toast. You're not even safe when your out of school , because Beast Toast also has a Myspace (myspace.com/beasttoast)</p>
<p>So get out there and help spread the fun of Beast Toast.</p>

<p>John Harold Sherf (Johnny) was born in 1914 in Calumet, Michigan, a small town in the Keewenaw Peninsula area of Michigan's upper peninsula. He attended public schools in the area and developed considerable skills as a hockey player, starring on the Calumet High School team as a teen-ager. Coming from a working-class family, he was probably headed for work in the local copper mines until he was befriended by a local physician who paid his tuition to attend the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>Sherf played hockey during all four years of his matriculation as a student at Michigan. As a senior he was the captain of the team and was "tapped" for the prestigious senior men's honarary society, Michigauma. Anecdotally, another member of this class of Michigauma was the captain of the football team, Gerald R. Ford, who later became President of the United States. An American Indian-based organization, new members were assigned pseudo-Indian names. Sherf's Michigauma name was "Flashing Feet Sherf". Coincidentally, Gerald Ford's assigned name, relating to his role as an All-American center and captain of the Michigan football team, was "Flippum' Back" Ford".</p>
<p>Sherf graduated from Michigan in June, 1936 with a BA in History. But before the actual commencement ceremonies in Ann Arbor, Sherf was contracted to play the remaining games in the 1935-36 season with the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League. The Red Wings won the Stanley Cup that season, beating the Toronto Maple Leafs in the championship series, three games to one. Being on the official roster, Sherf's name was engraved on the Stanley Cup trophy, making him the first United States citizen whose name is engraved on the Cup as a member of an NHL championship team.</p>
<p>Sherf played professional hockey for nine years, from 1936 until his retirement in 1944. Until his last season of professional play he was the property of the Detroit Red Wings. Following the 1936 Stanley Cup series, he was assigned to the Wings' top farm team, the Detroit Olympics. In 1937, the Olympics were moved to Pittsburgh, PA, renamed the Pittsburgh Hornets and made an initial member of the American Hockey League. Sherf played most of his career with the Hornets, being called up by the Red Wings for short stints many times. Sherf played his last professional season with the New York Rangers.</p>
<p>Because of his physical skills Sherf was often called up to the Red Wings to participate in the annual NHL skills competitions. During one year he won the prize as thr fastest skater in the National Hockey League. He was a prominent player for the Hornets and was selected for the American Hockey League All-Star team on at least one occasion.</p>
<p>Beginning during his professional hockey career, Sherf was employed by the Ford Motor Company. His first job was as a driver in the Ford exhibit at the 1933 "Century of Progress" World's Fair in Chicago. During his full-time employment with Ford, he earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Wayne State University in Detroit. Before his retirement from Ford, he was a senior executive in the Manufacturing Division. He also served as the President of the Red Wings Alumni Association and the University of Michigan M Club (alumni letter winners). He was only the second Michigan hockey player elected to the prestigious University of Michigan Hall of Honor, which recognized the most prominent athletes in the University's history. Sherf was also elected to the Upper Peninsula (Michigan) Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>John Harold Sherf was married to Mary Gaecke in 1937. They had one son, John Paul Sherf. Sherf died in 1993 in Dearborn, Michigan.</p>

Over 100 great bands from northern California that included Minimal Man, the Zeros, Crime, Dils, Flipper and from southern California, the Bags, Alleycats, Germs, X and Dinettes who would play this small underground club that was at the top of two long flights of stairs. The house DJs were Enrico Chandoha who worked on the early Thrasher Magazine; Jack Fan an Offs road manager and chef at the Zuni; Johnnie Walker the BBC celebrity and Robert Hanrahan. Given the unique nature of the venue and its location in the Mission District near 16th Street and the Roxie Theater it was enthusiastically supported by the punk and arts community, visited by film greats like John Waters and occasionally challenged by the officials of the San Francisco noise abatement patrol, the police, fire department, health department and the alcohol and beverage control until it closed.</p>
<p>About such venues, Brendan Earley of the Mutants comments, "The earthiness, I guess, of playing places like the Deaf Club seemed to have a lot more energy to them. You know the crowd that started coming to this music in '77, it was maybe a peak of their scene, or the scene at that time. They were not normal kinds of clubs, they weren't places like the Stone, -or even the Mabuhay, really. They were neat places to play; often good audiences, and good energy going on." Quote cited from White Noise Records.</p>
<p>The four partners in Walking Dead Records developed a live compilation project that resulted in an album "Can You Hear Me? Music From the Deaf Club" It was recorded on a mobile 8 track by Jim Keylor (also of Army Street Studios), DJ'ed by Johnnie Walker <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/walker/" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/walker/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/walker/</a> produced by Robert Hanrahan who also managed and booked the Club and coordinated by Peter Worrall. The photos selected for the album were taken by Sue Brisk, the album art was by Diana Miami (aka Diana Stumbo) and the liner notes were written by V. Vale of RE/Search/Search &amp; Destroy. It was recorded live at the club during early 1979 and is a testament to the authentic underground punk and "new wave" scene during that period in San Francisco's music history. The album featured the Mutants' "Tribute to Russ Meyer" and "Monster of Love" and provides a rare listen to the band during Albert Reda's tenure. It featured performances from other first and second generation San Francisco Punk bands like the Offs - "Hundred Dollar Limo", "Die Babylon", "I've Got the Handle" (Offs were: Don Vinyl, Billy Hawk, Bob Roberts now of Spotlight Tattoo in Los Angeles; Bob Steeler and Denny Boredom who also played with Hot Tuna); Pink Section - "Jane Blank", Francine's List" &amp; "Been In The Basement 30 Years"; Tuxedo Moon - "19th Nervous Brakdown" - courtesy of the Rolling Stones and "Heaven" from the film "Eraserhead"; KGB- "Dying in the USA" &amp; "Picture Frame Seduction" and the Dead Kennedys with "Police Truck", "Short Songs" &amp; "Straight A's". Raymond Pepperell, Jr., better known as East Bay Ray of the Dead Kennedy's used the original safety masters from that live recording to release their recent 2004 "live at the Deaf Club" CD.</p>
<p>From the Deaf Club, Walking Dead also produced, with William Passerelli, Dirk Dirksen (Mabuhay Gardens), Paul Rat Bachavich (Temple Beautiful)&amp; Goody Thompson, the Western Front Festival. The festival engaged the Deaf Club and every venue in the San Francisco Bay Area that embraced punk culture and music for a week long event. In a conversation at the Deaf Club, Joel Selvin, the music critic for the SF Chronicle who was attracted by the energy surrounding the punk scene promised to "put the scene on the map." Selvin authored an extensive article published in the SF Chronicle, October 22, 1979 on page 6 entitled "S.F. Goes Punk" It documented the scene during that time and included interviews with Dirk Dirksen, Joe Rees, Robert Hanrahan, Johnnie Walker and Paul Rat Bachavich. He also mentioned the Deaf Club in a subsequent publication: "San Francisco: The Musical History Tour&#160;: A Guide to over 200 of the Bay Area's Most Memorable Music Sites" where he disparages the Club as "one of the stranger scenes on the punk rock scene."</p>

<p>Product Information Management or PIM refers to the providing of product information for use in one or more output media and/or distribution channels, potentially involving multiple geographic locations. PIM relies on media-independent administration, maintenance and modification of product information within a centralised system to provide consistently accurate information via any channel without prohibitive cost in terms of resources.</p>
<p>The now common practice of maintaining and utilising data creates the need for product information management, as information kept by businesses is frequently scattered throughout disparate departments and held by certain employees instead of being bundled centrally â such as within R&amp;D or Sales departments and inventory management systems. Data are saved in various different formats or are only available in hardcopy form. Information is utilised in varying environments and contexts such as for detailed product descriptions with pricing info in product catalogues or for size and weight data for calculating freight costs in a logistics department. PIM in this example represents a solution for centralised, media-independent data maintenance for providing purchasing, production and communications data for repeated use on/in multiple IT systems, languages, output media and publications. It also provides a solution for efficient data collection, management, refinement and output.</p>

<p>The term PIM has only just recently come into currency, thus one finds a number of other terms that are similar or synonymous in meaning, usually deriving from other fields. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDM â Product Data Management derives from the concept of Engineering Data Management (EDM), denoting systems for the effective management of product development data and the coordination of manufacturing-related processes. The term is used primarily in the field of Computer-Aided Design (CAD).</li>
<li>PRM â Product Resource Management is used by some software providers as a synonym for PIM (Product Information Management), as well as Product Content Management (PCM), mainly popular as a term in England and France.</li>
<li>Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) refers more to a management strategy than to a specific IT technology, the goal of which is to optimise product life cycles through the gathering and analysis of product data generated over time.</li>
<li>Media Asset Management (MAM) refers to the management of unstructured multimedia objects such as images, graphics and presentations as well as âmeta-informationâ (data about data). The term is used primarily in the media business.</li>
<li>Cross Media Publishing (CMP) comes from the print and advertising industries, referring to the coordinated use of multiple media in complementary fashion. It also denotes the repeat usage of individual structural elements such as text, images or graphics within different media.</li>

<p>Enterprise Content Management is a term encompassing technologies, methods and tools used for gathering, imaging, storing, archiving and providing electronic content. Distinction can be made between four separate sub-areas. Document Management Systems (DMS) are deployed for archiving, and PDM involves the management of structured, technical data for such applications as parts diagrams and lists. Content Management Systems (CMS) are more commercially-oriented and provide a framework for knowledge management or informational service offerings through the management of unstructured, document-type content. PIM systems are used to manage structured data in a business context for feeding into any kind of distribution channel, from electronic catalogues to online shops to print catalogues.</p>

In terms of company IT infrastructure, this means having a PIM platform running over alongside a classic Oracle or open-source database such as MySQL with a J2EE application server. This forms a foundation upon which to build sales and procurement business processes. With PIM solutions, access and user authorisations for all database information, ordering processes linked with such inventory management systems as SAP and the mechanisms for modular expansions are managed via a web-based administration interface. These components each cover one particular channel and can be combined freely in line with strategic profitability considerations. For example, operating a configurator only makes sense for a company if there are a large number of different product versions; nor is it practical to set up a web shop for complicated products requiring a large amount of customer care. Catalogue solutions, e-procurement applications, e-commerce systems and industry-specific e-business functionalities are some of the classic expansions.</p>

<p>Procurement systems and platforms such as online marketplaces are based upon electronic catalogues. PIM systems can load descriptive product information as content into a catalogue management solution, where products are grouped and managed for specific target markets. Standards and classification systems such as BMEcat and OCI allows seamless interchange of electronic catalogues between vendors on the one hand and purchasing firms and marketplace operators on the other. Procurement solutions are closely related, which automate the procurement process for purchasing goods and services. These create transparency for the product data of multiple vendors to support the centralised management of multi-supplier catalogues and facilitate price and quality research.</p>

<p>Centralised data management is particularly well-suited for company websites, as documents, content and media objects such as product images can be linked with other business objects such as customers or products. An e-commerce component manages the ordering process and the online presentation of dynamic content. The solution has to integrate seamlessly into inventory management and logistics systems in order to provide real cost savings.</p>

<p>Centrally maintained data can also be accessed for print or CD catalogues and websites. The publishing component of an e-business solution creates pooled data, making it possible to save and manage catalogue content in a media-independent manner. The better the layout and output capabilities of the associated desktop publishing program, the more catalogue production can be automated.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-25_cf0e.html" title="Edit section: The market for PIM solutions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The market for PIM solutions</span></h3>
<p>PIM is still a young market segment. It only started gaining broader attention among customers in the second half of 2004, as market analysts and the media began taking a closer look at this type of solution.</p>
<p>PIM solutions are most relevant for use by medium to large-sized firms in retailing, consumer goods and manufacturing. The following are the primary considerations in opting for a PIM solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>wide array of products</li>
<li>frequently changing product characteristics</li>
<li>non-uniform IT infrastructure (potentially resulting from merger activity)</li>
<li>successful online business</li>
<li>customer pressure to offer electronic ordering</li>
</ul>
<p>PIM becomes strategically necessary when major customers start demanding that new data sharing standards (such as global data synchronisation) be supported, in conjunction with an international expansion strategy. The effective consolidation of product information and reconfiguration of processes built thereupon is however critical for a successful strategic business outcome. A distributor of catalogues, for example, looking to expand into five new countries without having to realign its catalogue production processes will probably be unable to execute on such a strategy.</p>

<p>"When I was young, like most children, I loved to hear and read stories from the Bible. Certain passages and sentences also became very precious to me. But as I grew older I became more and more puzzled about how these rich gems were held together. What is the overall picture? What is the Bible all about?"</p>
<p>As a child, John McKay loved the Bible, but its central theme eluded him. In his search for understanding of Godâs Word, he studied at Aberdeen, Oxford and Cambridge before taking up a post in the Department of Theology at Hull University in 1969.</p>
<p>It was there that he was baptised in the Holy Spirit, and this radically changed his understanding of the Scriptures. Having made it his lifeâs ambition to solve what he called "the riddle of the Bible", he now found that for the first time, the Scriptures all made sense to him.</p>
<p>After leaving Hull, he served for two years as Rector of St Ninianâs Episcopal Church, Prestwick, before taking up the post of Director of Studies at Kingdom Faithâs newly opened Bible College at Roffey Place in Horsham, West Sussex, where he wrote and developed The Way of the Spirit Bible Reading Course and the related teaching courses and programmes.</p>
<p>For the last six years of his life, the main thrust of his work was to train Bible teachers who would carry on the work that he had started, and to date over three hundred people have been trained and sent out, some into very fruitful ministries. This training programme continues today, carried on by some of those whom he had trained.</p>
<p>He received his call home to be with the Lord in February 2001.</p>
<p>"14But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. 15Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. 16But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away." (2 Corinthians 3:14-16). --&gt;</p>

<p>Mystickies created by&#160;?? and released to the public in January 2006. Mystickies allows signed up users to post little yellow sticky notes onto web pages and adding their own text to it. These sticky notes are recorded in the user's account and can be reviewed at a later date.</p>
<p>Mystickies.com has become one of the hottest new technologies on the Internet with bloggers around the world heralding another Web 2.0 application. It currently uses an extension to Mozilla Firefox as primary means of 'drawing' the notes but other methods are available and planned.</p>
<p>Mystickies may prove useful to researchers where simple bookmarking does not provide the level of detail sometimes required.</p>
<p>Concerns over privacy and disappointment that the first release does not enable sharing of notes are some negative thoughts from new users.</p>

<p>Irish Actor famous for his performances in films such as âThe Missionâ âMy Left Footâ, and âA Very British Coupâ. Ray McAnally was born in the Donegal seaside town of Buncrana March 30th 1926. The son of a bank manager, he was educated at St. Eunan's Catholic College in Letterkenny, after which he entered a seminary at the age of 18. However, he left the seminary after a short time having decided that the priesthood was not his vocation. He joined the Abbey Theatre in 1947 where he met and married actress Ronnie Masterson. He made his theatre debut in 1962 with "A Nice Bunch of Cheap Flowers" and gave a well-received performance as George in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" opposite actress, Constance Cummings, at the Piccadilly Theatre. He regularly acted in the Abbey Theatre and Irish festivals, but then, in the last decade of life, achieved award-winning notice on TV and films. His impressive performance as Cardinal Altamirano in the film The Mission (1986) earned him Evening Standard and BAFTA awards.

<p>Taking Arms is a Christian ska/alternative/rock band was formed in August 2005. The band started with Thomas Grass, Nathan Dalton, Chris Rideout and Nathan Carell. The band soon realized that Chris could not sing so they asked long time friend Joel Wallman to assist them. The band came to realize that they no longer needed Nathan or Chris. So the band now consists of Joel Wallman (bass/vocals), Thomas Grass (guitar/vocals) and Nathan Dalton (drummer). The band is scheduled to play at many locations in the future. The band will start putting out videos of stupid stunts and a small cd</p>

They are made of lime and help support the Grantia. The Grantia is also supported by <b>mesynchyme</b>,a jelly-like substance which provides fullness. The Grantia eats algae, bacteria, and organic debris which it sweeps into it's <b>incurrent pores</b> buy using it's <b>collar cells</b>. The cells have a swift, flagellate movement which creates a current into the incurrent pores. They also digest the food. Non digsestible food is egested through the occulus, or excurrent pore. The Grantia has no organ for respiration, but there is an exchange of gases between the outer cells and the water surrounding it by diffusion. The Grantia have <b>Amebocytes</b>, which help with circulation. They transport food throughout the sponge and carry waste to the surface of the sponge. They are found in the mesenchyme. The waste in a grantia is excreted through diffusion. The Grantia reproduces using Budding and Gemules.It can also carry on sexual reproduction. The Grantia can be small or large. They are classified by they're structure.</p>

<p>The Chincoteague Pony does not live on Chincoteague Island, but the outer island called Assateague. There are two theories of how they got there. The first theory is exciting, and possible. According to it, a Spanish Galleon was bringing Spanish ponies (or horses; different people tell it different ways) to work in mines and such. Because of a storm, the ship was thrown off course. The crashing waves broke the ship as it hit a rocky sand bar. Below the deck, the horses fought to get out of stalls. With the help of mother nature, they did. They swam towards land, which happened to be Assateague Island. The other story is simple: ponies and horses escaped from the mainland or were let loose and swam across. Either way, the ponies are there, and people come from across the country to see them.</p>
<p>Assateague is home to the wild things. People have tried to live there, but in the end moved back to Assateague's sister island, Chincoteague. Assateague is the outer and larger island of the two, and protects Chincoteague from storms from the sea. The ponies are, in turn, very hardy and strong for their size. They can be any color, but most common are paint, buckskin and dun, sorrel, and chesnut. They range in size from 14 to 15 hands high, though some have been known to be smaller. The ponies are taken care of by the Chincoteague volunteer fire department, and every July these fire fighters get to play cowboy at Pony Penning Day, when the ponies are rounded up and swam across the channel. They are then paraded down the street to the sight of the auction that will be held the next day. There is lots of fun going on, from horse races to wild horse rides, which are like bucking bronco rides at rodeos. Young horses are auctioned off to keep down the population, because Assateague is small and can't support too many ponies.</p>
<p>If you would like to see the ponies, you can take a trip to Assateague and take a walk. You'll probably spot all kinds of wildlife, and if your lucky, you'll spot the ponies. But if you can't take a trip, and even if you can, you can read Margaret Henry's books: "Misty of Chincoteague", "Stormy, Misty's foal", "Sea Star, Orphan of Chincoteague", and "Misty's Twilight".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-25_cf0e.html" title="Edit section: Damien Top">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../d/a/m/Damien_Top_2d93.html" title="Damien Top">Damien Top</a></span></h2>
<p>After studying Literature and Philosophy in Lille and graduating in Germanic Studies at the University of Paris, Damien Top studied Singing and Dramatic Art at the Conservatoire in Lille. Later, at the Conservatoire National SupÃ©rieur de Musique de Paris, he joined the classes of Nicole Broissin (Atelier Lyrique-OpÃ©rette) and Corazza (Vocal Technique), Isabelle Aboulker (Musical Theory), and studied with Galina Vischnievskaya, Jean-Christophe Benoit, and Jacques Pottier (Melbourne University).</p>
<p>His dual training as a singer and an actor enables him to appear in opera, operetta, and sacred works, as well as perform the difficult repertoire of French mÃ©lodie - his favorite genre. He has given recitals at Flaneries Musicales de Reims for the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation, Musicales en Valois, Festival des Grands Crus de Bourgogne, etc. As a renowned interpreter of French song, Damien Top frequently gives recitals abroad, including performances in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Macedonia, New Zealand, and the United States. In Diapason, critic Jean Roy wrote of Top, "one will not reproach him error of taste."</p>
<p>In 1993, he was engaged by the Opera de Paris-Bastille to sing in a new production of Benvenuto Cellini by Berlioz. In 2000, he performed in Heloise and Abelard by Australian composer Peter Tahourdin, toured France and Poland with Mozart's Requiem, sung at the Bitola International Festival and gave a recital of operatic arias with the Hawaii Youth Symphony Orchestra. In 2002, Damien Top took part at "Musica in Mostre" a festival of contemporary music in Torino, sang and conducted the cantata L'oiseau a vu tout cela by Sauguet at the Institut de France-AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise for the celebration of the Centenary of Vercors.</p>
<p>Damien Top has studied Analysis, Harmony and the History of Music at the Paris Conservatoire with Michel QuÃ©val. Under the guidance of Sergiu Celibidache, he began research into musical aesthetics and attended seminars in the phenomenology of music. With these two master teachers, he was introduced to orchestral conducting. In his programs, he particularly focuses on the music of our time (Roussel, d'Indy, Delvincourt, Martinet, Sandagerdi, Martinu, Looten, Macha, Ratovondrahety, Tahourdin, etc.).</p>
<p>Son of the poet AndrÃ©e Brunin, Damien Top has given poetry recitals (Alliance FranÃ§aise de Sydney, UniversitÃ© de Melbourne, SociÃ©tÃ© d'Honneur Pi-Delta-Phi d'Hawaii, etc.) He explores a wide range of the repertoire and introduces the audience to the poetry of our time (Anthologie de la poesie franÃ§, Poetes fÃ©minins contemporains, Centenaire Verlaine,etc.)</p>
<p>Biographical and musicological work on Albert Roussel has been a particular feature of Damien Top's research and in 1989, in the composer's birthplace, he devoted an entire recital to Roussel's mÃ©lodies. His biography of Albert Roussel was published in 2000 by Editions Saguier and he has also written a book on Sergei Rachmaninov. Consequently, he is frequently invited to speak at the radio (France Musiques, France Culture, Hawaii Public Radio, Radio Suisse Romande); to present papers on French music at international conferences and to give classes at universities of the Pacific Basin, including Melbourne, Monash, La Trobe, Wollongong, and Wellington.</p>
<p>In response to his fine talents as a singer, several composers have written music especially for him: Aboulker, Carr, Choveaux, Cox, Dunleavy, FÃ¤ron, Joly, Pinchard, Surianu, Tahourdin, Trumble, Werder, and Jacques Chailley who considers "l'art de Damien Top est exemplaire." Among others, Top recorded Massenet song's cycles (BNL) and De Coussemaker's romances (R.C.P.)</p>
<p>Damien Top writes the musical chronic in the monthly "Politique Magazine." Member of the SACEM, his compositions have been played in France, Belgium, Italy, United States. Involved in many organizations, he is at the head of the "Centre International Albert-Roussel" which he founded in 1992 and the director of the "Albert-Roussel International Festival."</p>
<p>In 2002 Damien Top was awarded with the "Prix Charles Oulmont - Fondation de France" for his outstanding career.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-25_cf0e.html" title="Edit section: Jupp, Roger">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jupp, Roger</span></h2>
<p>Fr Roger Jupp was born in London in 1956 and was brought up in Blackheath. He was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys' Grammar School 1968-1974 and then read Theology at St Edmund Hall, Oxford 1975-1978. The following year he worked as a Nursing Auxiliary at St Christopher's Hospice for the terminally ill in SE London before going to train for the priesthood at Chichester Theological College. It was there that he first became aware of the life of the Anglican Church in Papua New Guinea through the annual commemoration of Father Vivian Redlich, one of the New Guinera Martyrs, who was trained at the seminary in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Ordained deacon in 1980 and priest in 1981, Fr Roger served curacies in Chesterfield in Derbyshire, Oxford and London. His association with the diocese of Chichester began in 1986 when he was appointed Chaplain to the Area Bishop of Horsham, Bishop Colin Docker. He also held a number of parochial appointments in the diocese. It was whilst he was Vicar of St John's, Burgess Hill that he first met Archbishop James Ayong who, as Principal of Newton College, was beginning a year's sabbatical study at Chichester Theological College, and had a taste of English parochial life when he did a three-week locum in the mid-Sussex parish for Fr Roger. The parish had also recently formed a link with the PNG Church Partnership and this was further cemented by Fr James' visit with Mother Gawali and their granddaughter, Clare. It was this first contact with Fr Roger that brought about his appointment some years later as Principal of Newton College in November 2000.</p>
<p>Fr Roger had left parish life and trained to be a teacher at St Mary's, Strawberry Hill 1995-1996. Although he did return to the pastoral ministry as curate of Aldwick, his appointment to Newton College meant that his experience of teacher training had not been wasted. In fact, teaching at a theological college and involvement in priestly formation had always been an aspiration for him, so Archbishop James' offer meant the fulfilment of a vocation as far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>Father Roger has had a continuing interest in ecumenism throughout his ministry and has been a member of the Ecumenical Society of the Blessed Virgin Mary since the early 1980s. For a number of years he served on its Council. He is a priest of the Society of the Holy Cross (SSC) and a member of the Church Union and of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. Ever since his days at Oxford, he has pursued an interest in 19th century Church History. Unlike most members of his family, he is definitely not a sportsman and prefers to exercise his mind through reading and listening to music. As both his parents are dead, Fr Roger considers himself an orphan and is grateful that a number of loving families in England have adopted him! He has an older sister, Catherine, who is married and lives in Hertfordshire. His surviving grandmother is 98!</p>
<p>His reaction on hearing the news that he had been elected Bishop of Popondota on 31st December? "I wept," he said.</p>

<p>A prorgasm is what particularly keen programmers get when they have finally completed a program that has been giving them grief for some time. A prorgasm usually results in shouting, punching the air, and spilling coffee over one's Sweex keyboard (which was a shame, because it was a nice one).</p>
