<li>I am not sure what the policy is on articles on individual books, but I think reference works of potentially wide interest should be allowed, as opposed to most monographs (which can rather be treated with their subject if they are important but not yet classics). The existence and publication details of the book are very easy to verify, c/o the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Library_1c04.html" title="British Library">British Library</a><a href="http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-list" class="external autonumber" title="http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-list" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, for instance. A second edition was published in 2003. The ISBN is actually quite valid (for the first edition), but there is something wrong with the Wikipedia ISBN search function. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 05:53, 16 August 2005 (UTC) 0715374893&#160;: Â£10.00</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'd gently question <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a>'s logic. Monographs, whilst often not widely read, may have an important impact within a field {e.g. obviosly <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Species_3432.html" title="Origin of Species">Origin of Species</a>, and in my own field Quest of the Historical Jesus or Paul and Palestinian Judaism are good examples (I can't believe they just went red!)- but there are plenty of less well known ones). Reference works may be more widely read, but their contents are derivative and their intellectual impact usually negligible (and there are dozens of 'Dictionary of ....' 'encyclopaedia of ...' and 'introduction to...' in every field). Whilst obviously some have cultural impact (e.g. <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> many could have nothing more said about them than 'contains lots of info on the subject - and sold a lot of copies'. My own test for any non-fiction work would be: is it possible to write a paragraph on the 'influence and impact' of this work - if not, list it under 'references' in the relevant article (which is what I think <a href="../../../a/p/w/User%7EApwoolrich_41a8.html" title="User:Apwoolrich">Apwoolrich</a> should do here). --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 08:49, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I may not have been clear enough. I wrote "important but not yet classics", and was actually thinking of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Species_3432.html" title="Origin of Species">Origin of Species</a> as one of the works definitely belonging to the "classics" category. Normally, even a fairly significant monograph on some smaller topic would not be important enough to be treated as a subject of its own but is better treated in an article on its topic as well as mentioned briefly in an article characterizing its author (if s/he has done enough other things to deserve an article). A reference work such as this could possibly be mentioned in an article on the profession of railway engineering, but it is much more likely to be used around here the way <a href="../../../a/p/w/User%7EApwoolrich_41a8.html" title="User:Apwoolrich">Apwoolrich</a> is apparently using it, as a good reference source for articles on individual engineers. as such I think an article describing the work is useful. In either case, standards for including articles on books seem <i>de facto</i> to be quite inclusive. Just look at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Category%7EBook_stubs_1cd1.html" title="Category:Book stubs">Category:Book stubs</a>, and its subcategories, such as <a href="../../../n/o/n/Category%7ENon-fiction_book_stubs_f29c.html" title="Category:Non-fiction book stubs">Category:Non-fiction book stubs</a>. I occasionally get the impression that it is easier to get an article on a single book pass VfD than an article on a scholar who has published fifteen books ("just another nn college prof - publishing is what they do"). In either case, I think this is more useful than many other books for which we have articles and would like to see a policy discussion before I am willing to vote to delete this particular one. â A reasonable compromise, especially considering the size of this article, may however be to merge this with similar minor and specialized biographical dictionaries in a list in the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biographical_dictionary.html" title="Biographical dictionary">Biographical dictionary</a> article. Perhaps only the large multi-volume works with a long history (like <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_National_Biography_5c24.html" title="Dictionary of National Biography">DNB</a>) need to have articles of their own. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 09:48, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's a specialised reference book - sales figures would be expected to be low. It's not much of a basis to rule on.

<li><b>Comment</b> Firstly, apologies for the typo on the ISBN. I would be happy, if pushed, for the compromise of <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a>, if the alternative was deletion. In the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">Encyclopaedia</a> article is a listing of many historical ones, including several specialist titles, which might, I am sure, be argued for VfD on the grounds of non-notability. They are there as an historical record, and, more importantly, as a resource for readers and editors who might otherwise never get to learn of them - and use them in their writing. The internet is very weak indeed on information of this kind, and Wikipedia enables a record to be maintained, - hopefully in perpetuity.<a href="../../../a/p/w/User%7EApwoolrich_41a8.html" title="User:Apwoolrich">Apwoolrich</a> 18:23, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest that if it's used as a reference in a wide range of articles, which I gather from context it is, then it's probably worthwhile <b>keep</b>ing - I mean, we think it's notable enough to use as a reputable source! Perhaps it'd be useful to link to it when you reference it on those pages, though? It means you can keep all the bibliographic information centralised; I've expanded it a little from catalogue research to cover both editions. Some notes on scope of the entries would be helpful, and make it a bit more than a simple catalogue entry - how summary is summary? is it good, accurate, well-written? - but I can't add those without reading a copy. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 02:11, 17 August 2005 (UTC) (Also, can you check if there are any illus.? Cataloguers tend to notice, but you never know.)</li>
