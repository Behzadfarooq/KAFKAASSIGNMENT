<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Many "keep" opinions were not conducive to establishing consensus. Remember, AfD is not a vote, and just saying "keep, he's notable" is not very persuasive (see also the essay <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>).

<dd>I'd have to disagree. <i>Modern Pagans</i> is representative of "pop-paganism" and the commercialization and co-opting of neopaganism by profiteers and people with political agendas. Comparing Rosenbaum along side the lives and works of other personalities in the book like <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Bonewits_3bc9.html" title="Isaac Bonewits">Isaac Bonewits</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Hutton_ab1b.html" title="Ronald Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margot_Adler_fcc3.html" title="Margot Adler">Margot Adler</a>, I'd still have to conclude that he is not notable. He holds a BA and his claim to fame is being a venue promoter - as per his own autobiographical entry. - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 18:14, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - I've been involved in the Pagan community since the early '80s, and know many of the people in the Re/Search book (ironically enough, I'm also in it), as well as some of the folks involved in its production. However, I have *never* heard *anyone* refer to the book as any sort of "litmus test for notability". Vale and John interviewed a number of people they met at Starwood, and those they knew through friends in California. It is very focused on the West Coast and a particular subset of the Neopagan community, and while interesting for what it is, I never heard anyone involved in the project refer to it as an attempt to focus on those who are "notable". Some in the book are quite notable, others are simply people they thought were interesting or who were friends of theirs. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a> 19:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Jeff Rosenbaum is a MAJOR part of the neopagan scene in the Northeast (and, because of the size of Starwood, nationally); his work for the last 3 decades holding Starwood together is a huge contribution to that scene. He is responsible for putting together MANY notables who would not otherwise be working together. As a regular Starwood and WInterstar speaker, I write from experience. Rosenbaum's work is one of the main reasons the Church of the SUbGenius relocated from Texas to Cleveland, and (just as one example of hundreds) my current work as an instructor with Robert Anton Wilson's Maybe Logic University would not have happened had Rosenbaum not invited both RAW and myself to events in the past. Although Jeff is not known as a writer, especially, he is most certainly known very widely as an organizer -- not just a promoter. He is as important to the neopagan community as any of the (hundreds of) speakers and writers he has brought to the ACE events. If Larry Harvey is notable for Burning Man then Jeff Rosenbaum is certainly notable for Starwood! I do not understand why there is so much resistance to listing a person who is definitely one of the primary movers in the East Coast neopagan movement. RevStang 09:39, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Saying something that is true about another editor is not some sort of insult to you. Nobody has attacked your as a person, BostonMA has simple made a note to help the closing admin.

<dd>Well, this is not a technique one uses in a "discussion", not was it relevant regardless of it's technical "truth". There are PLENTY of "true" irrelevant things you could refer to about someone to discredit him/her: "The person making this statement is a Jew", or "a woman" or "has no college degree". Just because the statement is true doesn't mean it wasn't designed to denegrate the subject. This was an obvious attempt to trivialize Jefferson Anderson's input by IMPLYING that it should be given less note. I do not have any contact with this individual, nor do I know who he is. He may have a great deal of knowledge to apply to this issue, regardless of when his account was opened. I see he has been complimented by Pigman for his input elsewhere, but I don't see him saying anything now.

<dd>That is a valid opinion, however, the community has reached a consensus that admin's should take into account a variety of factors when closing and AfD. The religion, gender, level of education etc should not be taken into account. The level of experience the user has in Wikipedia and the level in which the argument takes into account our policies are valid things for the admin to consider.

<dd>I don't understand your point. What policy says that the Wikipedia article on a subject can't be more complete than other articles?

<dd>Yes. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia is not for original research</a>, and articles must be based on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable external sources</a>. An article based on someone's own perceptions rather than external sources violates Wikipedia's official policy (no original research), and one of its most central guidelines (use of reliable sources). So the answer to your question is, yes, that's precisely what I'm saying - articles must be derivative of external sources and not be original research. I think this article fails that test. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 22:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we disagree on this in several ways. First, a Wiki article can combine several sources and thereby become a more complete bio than any other single one that you might come across, partly because the others might have been created to fulfill a specific purpose rather than be a general article abut the person. Second, most bios DON'T require references and sources, which is why I originally said (as you can read) that this one goes beyond others. It is not just a bio, which has been done before, but an ARTICLE with references to interviews, written works, and a discography which has not been assembled in such a form before. I expect this is true of many Wiki articles. There is a difference between original research and the results one can get by gathering existing information and assembling a more complete profile than anyone has done before, and linking it with relevant other pages. I think the subject is notable and the article is worth keeping, and I'd appreciate help improving it rather than shooting it down. Perhaps some of the material is not sufficiently important, and/or the copy can sound more encyclopedic. Fine, please advise. But the tone of this discussion has not been one of an attempt to be helpful. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 22:39, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not going to address the last four sentences of your response, which I think are off-topic. (Sorry, that's how they look to me.) As to the rest, articles require references and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>. If this were, as you say, an article that was pieced together from many different reliable sources, it would be fine. But I've seen no evidence that this was pieced together from external reliable sources. It seems instead to be an autobiography that goes far beyond any sources, and that therefore violates WP:OR and WP:RS (and WP:COI, WP:AUTO, and WP:Bio). That's why I think it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 23:57, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>On the fence</b> I also think the media coverage is sufficient to establish notability. Note that the media coverage does not merely mention the subject in passing, but mentions him as being notably related to the main topics of that coverage, such as the Starwood festival. With regard to the arguments about original research: yes, there is certainly a problem with original research in this article. These problems would need to be cleaned up if the article is kept. My big concern is that if all of the unpublished material is removed, would there really be much left to say, other than that Rosenbaum is a moving force behind ACE, Starwood etc? --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 01:29, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
