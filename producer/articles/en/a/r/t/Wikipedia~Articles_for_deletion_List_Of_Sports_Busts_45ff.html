<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Grutness is presumably a rename, which is a form of keep. There is a clear leaning towards deletion, but not clear enough for a consensus. It very much does need its name improving (and capitalising properly) however. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:50, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I never been certain about this article that I created It might have reached POV for a few people even though its mostly accuarate. <b>No Vote</b> as I want other users to voice their opinion in this article. I going to try to expand it also if u guys say so. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">Aranda56</a> 03:05, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> and move to a better title, such as List of famous sports busts. Like our entire lists of flops series, it is subjective, but with citation from respected sources (and they're not hard to find for this subject) it can be fun reading. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 03:59, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename or delete</b>. At present it could mean three things - 1) people who have been arrested while playing sport; 2) head-and-shoulders sculpture of sportspeople; 3) Anna Kournikova. Yet this seems to be a list of sports people - most of them men, and therefore not really having busts as such. Can someone explain what it's meant to be? At least Anna is on the list... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 06:43, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Too subjective and ill-defined. If retitled, "busts" is slang (and ambiguous); better something like List of athletic failures or List of failed athletes or List of athletes that didn't live up to expectations. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 06:48, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah. "Sports Busts" (all caps) is a term for sporting failures? is it a U.S.-only term, by any chance, because I've never heard it here... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 06:55, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>
<ul>
<li>Not necessarily with caps. "bust" is U.S. slang for failure/flop/what-have-you. — <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a> | <small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_RfC_1736.html" title="User:Lomn/RfC">RfC</a></small> 13:03, 15 September 2005 (UTC)pand
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bust.html" title="Bust">Bust</a> also gives the meaning <i>A sports athlete who was projected to be a great player and failed to live up to that potential</i>. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bust" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:bust">Wiktionary</a> doesn't know about that meaning yet, and neither does my "Random House" dictionary. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleph4_0f7d.html" title="User:Aleph4">Aleph4</a> 13:42, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/Rename/Cleanup</b>. As noted, subjective lists like this have a precedent. I like Niteowl's suggestion to avoid "busts" in the title. — <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a> | <small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_RfC_1736.html" title="User:Lomn/RfC">RfC</a></small> 13:03, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak delete</b>. The name has to be changed, because "bust" is too ambiguous. The contents have to be changed -- the article should start with a definition, or we will have a "list of people in sports that failed at least once". All entries need a comment explaining why they got on this list. So, better to start over. Also, we should consider whether a category might not be more suitable. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleph4_0f7d.html" title="User:Aleph4">Aleph4</a> 13:42, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Far too subjective - was Ankiel a bust when he had one outstanding year? should we equate players who got hurt with players who just plain stank? And I'm not comfortable with the schadenfreude/POV aspect of it either. Let the individual players' pages here tell their stories without a POV and leave it at that. | Keithlaw 15:00, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>So disappointed that this isn't a list of Great Sportwomen's Chests Of Our Times. Inherently POV, <b>delete</b> <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 15:21, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I may rename it into List of athletes that didn't live up to expectations and expand into why the player was a bust if the page surives VFD which so far looks like a no consuesus. But to do that I need fellow wiki users to help me in that page and help me expand it to include players from sports like <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby.html" title="Rugby">rugby</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a> in which i dont know nothing about and explain why the player was really a flop - not add into the list for bad faith like ex: <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Marino_2b9a.html" title="Dan Marino">Dan Marino</a> because i dont like him or <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pele.html" title="Pele">Pele</a> because he just was and of course that whould be HEAVY <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> and a page like this whould be a target of vandalism and hoax of course and I want to avoid that. What You say about that --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">Aranda56</a> 22:30, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Aranda, I don't see how that revision solves the core problem that most of the Delete voters have identified: The subject, regardless of name is <b>inherently</b> POV. It's a commentary, not an article. That's why I think we're better off deleting the page. If you believe Player X failed to live up to expectations, then I would suggest going to Player X's article, documenting the high expectations (e.g., he was named the best prospect in his sport in 1995 by Some Sports Publication), and then documenting his performance subsequent to those expectations, thus letting the reader decide for him/herself whether those expectations were met. | Keithlaw 23:47, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I cant Vote Keep or Delete cause im the author but I looked in the list of flops series and i didn't notice a list of sports flops around maybe merge or create because i found Plenty of articles via google and that name them. You dont what the whole list of flops series in VFD right because this could be part of it easily --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">Aranda56</a> 23:40, 17 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If someone put any of the flops articles up for VfD, I'd probably vote Delete there as well. Subjective articles don't fit Wikipedia's mission, esp. not the NPOV policy. As for this article, better to delete it now before it gets developed and established. | Keithlaw 02:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Yet another ill-defined list with completely subjective inclusion criteria and no sources provided. Wikipedia needs a lot fewer of these, not more. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 20:36, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, rename, and clean up</b>, per Lord Bob.

<li><b>Delete</b> it is a matter of opinion, and unless there is a common definition for sports bust that is equal to all sports (and I doubt there is) this page cannot work. Also if this page for some reason doesn't get deleted, it should at the very least provide some evidence as to why an individual player is a bust (draft position, stats, etc.). <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> 22:51, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
