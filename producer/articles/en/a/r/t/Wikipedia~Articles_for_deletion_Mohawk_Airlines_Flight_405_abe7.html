<li><b>Keep</b> <i>Since there is a common theme to this set of airplane crash AfD, there will be an equally common theme to my replies</i> I think it's bad precedence to start putting a "death threashold" for the notability of a plane crash. I would say a crash with <i>any fatality</i> is notable. Ideally entries are written because they will be of encyclopedic interest and value to others to read. A plane crash with fatalities (even a small number) affects alot of a people--the community where the crash took place, people actually involved in the crash as well as friends/families, anyone who is interested in the aviation crash history of a particular airline, and those people who like reading about crashes anyways. Someone was originally interested in the topic enough to write the article in the first place. I can easily see many others who will have continual interest in reading it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:51, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It should be noted that there is currently <i>no notability standards</i> for airline crashes (not even an essay). What we have is a substantial event involving a commercial airline crash that resulted in loss of life and triggered mandatory investigations and resulting media coverage. In the absence of a current guideline, I do think the above plays a large consideration in the notability and merit of inclusion. I do encourage the development of such an essay but I think the one precedence that no one wants to see come out of this is some sort of "body count threshold" (i.e. so many people have to die to be considered notable) being connected. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 09:28, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>True, there is no specific standard for air crashes, but that's like saying there's no specific standard for a specific company, book, or person, when the general WP policies and guidelines still apply. To act like we need to reinvent the wheel for every pet issue misses the points that we're still bound by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, or simple extension of other policies and guidelines. One point that looks very applicable is from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which asks whether there has been any lasting contribution to the field. It's clear in this case there has not. Also, if you don't want to reduce this to a body count, then don't. I haven't, and I don't see why you keep waving the dead about when you say you don't want to. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 14:44, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a difference between inferring that there is notability because a fatality is involved in a signifigant event and a "death threshold". One is acknowledging a <i>facet</i> of an event that adds to the signifigance and the other is setting up a measuring bar like a carnvival ride that says <i>"You must have X number of people die before you can be included in this encyclopedia."</i>. Far from "waving the dead about", I'm contending for the former and strongly advocating against the later. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:54, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - important crash on several fronts. First, notability: it had NTSB investigation with a full hearing and an extensive report. Most minor aviation accidents, even with fatalities involved, don't get federal NTSB investigation (local FAA district office alone investigates many/most) and then many of those with NTSB investigation don't get a public hearing. So this one ranks near the top in that department, which relates to notability, since NTSB is a political body that invests its limited investigative resources (to some extent) according to the perceived public importance of the case (e.g. number of casualties, public figures or celebrities involved, etc.). Also, there were several important considerations in the accident itself that make it notable technically. First, the real causes of the 2 separate technical malfunctions that led to the crash are both unknown, which is fairly rare. Also, the crash worthiness aspects led to recommended improvements in that area. In addition, the actual proximate cause of the accident, i.e. lack of crew coordination and division of labor, led to a general recommendation in that area (which unfortunately didn't help much until some other accidents re-inforced the modern concept of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew_Resource_Management_d63c.html" title="Crew Resource Management">CRM</a>). In all, this is an important crash with unusual (undetermined) causes as well as important safety recommendations. The article does require work, however. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:20, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
