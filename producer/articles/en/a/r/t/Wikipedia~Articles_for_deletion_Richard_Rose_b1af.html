<li><s><b>Delete</b> for lack of notability.</s> <b>Comment</b>: FWIW, I searched Amazon for "Richard Rose", and I believe there's more than one author by that name. However the first two books listed were by this guy, so it's entirely possible he's notable as an author. Current article content is bad, yes, but if the subject is notable I'd rather see it fixed than deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:55, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>After being contacted via e-mail by someone urging me to change my vote, I looked into Richard Rose a little more. The evidence I dug up indicates that he was a legitimate philosopher, spiritual leader and author who managed to attract a significant group of followers and admirers. So from that standpoint, he does seem notable. However, the article is written more like a tribute from one of his disciples than a non-biased statement of simple, straight-forward fact. I'd suggest that someone with an objective viewpoint rewrite and condense the text into something more suitable for a non-biased encyclopedia. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">C Maylett</a> 16:36, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>No. In fact, you should wait to make any major changes until after the voting process is finished so that we are all voting on the same thing. --<a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <big>ॐ</big> 18:19, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Oh wait, you're just making sure that you're not taken down in the "bad image" of having a lot of people come to the defense of this article. Yep that image does indeed look bad. Hopefully the peple in charge can ignore perceptions and decide whether or not it would be beneficial to the public at large to have a wikipedia article on the man.

Remember, our goal here is to make an encyclopedia, not to rigidly follow some exact process.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He seems like an interesting guy, the article is informative (if a tad hagiographic in style, but that can be fixed) and in view of his having a number of published essays and several books, and the fact that he has a small but loyal following, he is certainly notable.</li>

<dd><b>Request:</b> Would someone from the TAT Foundation be willing to provide the publication dates? Thanks. The quotations would be difficult to footnote, as they are mostly often-repeated phrases from Rose's personal vocabulary. All the material was originally self-published via the TAT Foundation. By the way, there remain many unpublished works and transcriptions of lectures, transcribed by volunteers (as usual). "Hagiographic" - what a great word! <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharnish_cf92.html" title="User:Sharnish">Steve Harnish</a> 05:18, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ok, I'm officially changing my opinion to <b>keep</b>, after the rewrite. I'm not saying the article is perfect, but to me the subject looks significant. Yeah, it's hagiographic here and there (I had to look that one up, thanks), but as pointed out, this can be fixed. While not very famous, as authors go, to me the intro paragraph gives me sufficient info about this guy to consider him significant. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:10, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
