<li><b>Comment</b>. Since the 23rd of September, 2004, Da Cunha has been listed as upkeeping Capitalism magazine. His name does not appear on the website [www.capmag.com], but one and a quarter years is a long time between two supposed pieces of vanity. I think that Cunha is the editor, although there is no evidence to prove that he is or that he is not. My inkling is that it was written by someone filling in the url gap on the capmag article. However, this article, in its current state, does not show much evidence of notability, despite the magazine's being notable. I would say delete, unless someone can pull something out of the hat showing that da Cunha is more than some editor, or at least, facts about the guy's life and thought. --<a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">It's-is-not-a-genitive</a> 00:42, 8 January 2006 (UTC)]]</li>

Moving an article to Limbo would remove it from the article namespace and prevent search engines from delivering suspicious content while the community decides whether to keep or delete it.

<dd>Guess I was a bit too hasty. Having now actually read through it I have to say that I'm not convinced that it's quite correct&#160;:) The point of the example is that the scam artist can always offer you the same bet regardless of the colour of the card he flips up. But he'll offer you a win in the cases where the two-coloured card is the one selected. Since the odds are 2/3 that the card is actually single-coloured you only have a 1/3 chance of winning.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. It's a nice example, but I'm afraid it's not encyclopaedic enough. I'm all in favour of short examples to explain key concepts, but this is a bit too long and more text book material. By the way, I didn't read and think it over carefully but it seems to me the conclusion is wrong. I think that if a card is chosen at random, and then either side is also chosen at random, and this side turns out to be green, then the probability of the chosen card to be the doubly-green one is 2/3, but the article says it's 1/2. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> as original research (not to mention wrong).

<dd>I would agree with fixing the article, except that we are not in the business of <i>doing</i> our own mathematics around here. Ideally someone would come up with a reference, but pending that, it's all just original research. I feel justified in beating this dead horse not just because it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a>, but because the current article is a cautionary example of what can happen when even well-meaning, intelligent, and thoughtful contributors ignore that policy. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 04:09, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You all make valid points. When writing, I was afraid it was lengthy and a bit too "text book", and I didn't include any refs. because, at the time of writing, I wasn't using any. This is all learnt material and <b>not</b> original in any way, but I couldn't produce any references pertaining to the exact question. Any first-year text would do as reference for the rest. I thought this to be a good example because it illustrates so many fundamental and often overlooked points. Incidentally, I have attached a short paragraph at the bottom of the article for those who still have questions about the answer. I will try to dig up some references soon, but understand if it must be deleted. Thank you for your patience as this is my first effort at contributing to this valuable resource.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's been stated the article is wrong, but it's better to say it's ambiguous. No mention is made of whether the person will offer the same bet if another color shows. If the same bet is made irregardless of color (then modulo other possible ambiguities), then obviously the bet is not 50/50 as stated, since 2/3 of the time you will get a card with both sides the same color. This is similar to the "What are the odds that the other child is also a boy" question (or whatever that is called). That one is much more famous by the way, having been popularized by Martin Gardner, Marilyn Vos Savant, etc, with plenty of literature and references. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 17:13, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What the host would have done if the other color had shown is an interesting thought experiment, but it doesn't affect the answer to the question, which is quite unambiguous. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 19:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure it does. If the host offers the bet only when one color shows, then it's 50/50, but if the host offers the bet always, then you should bet the other side is the same color. The situation is ambiguous precisely because we are not told the host's intentions. And the intentions <i>do</i> make a big difference. If for some reason, you don't believe me, you can try repeated trials yourself and see: draw a card out and then guess the opposite color shown. Do this, say, 25 times. Now try this again (same number of times) but always guess the same color as shown. Now finally, start over again but every time you draw a card and see purple, put it back in the hat, shake it up, and try it again until you see green. Then guess your color (it doesn't matter, since now it is even odds). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 21:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you weren't a mathematician I would just give up right now, but perhaps there is hope. Forget about the host. We draw from the hat a large number of times.

<dd>Ah, I think I see what you're saying now. In my previous response, I somehow assumed that when drawing a green/purple card, you would draaw it showing green.

<li>First off this AfD does not care if it reads like and AD or not. Secondly user Stargate007 is a possibly sockpuppet of user:Remagine. Note how they misspell "AD" as "ADD": From REMAGINE's Talk Page: "Note This article was updated to avoid conflict with it looking to much like an add. It should now correspond with wikipedias rules and regulations.

</li>
<li>I am a developer at Remagine, certaintly not a sock puppet of user Remagine, although he is my good friend Ian. We would like to list our company history and clients here.

<ul>
<li>Thank you, that was very helpful. I see your concerns, but I believe that Remagine meets the requirements of WP:CORP specifically because articles have been written about Remagine authored by entities other then Remagine itself. For example, the westner new england college wrote an article about the enterpreneurialship of the founders, and can be viewed here: <a href="http://www.wnec.edu/communicator/snapshots/2004_grinspoon/B7EB2838.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wnec.edu/communicator/snapshots/2004_grinspoon/B7EB2838.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I can also assure you that I am a completely different person then user Remagine, as you can tell by my other wikipedia entries. I'm not sure who Stargate007 is.

<li>There was also an article in the Springfield Republican which is not available online, unfortunately. I believe the above is a subjective call on Onthost's part. Can anyone explain exactly how WP:CORP is not satisfied by multiple articles written about Remagine?
<ul>
<li>This was not taking from a university paper. It came from the Springfield Republican, the hard copy resides at that link. As I stated in the discussion page, the site has under gone a face lift as of Friday, it will take the next 3 days to complete at the same time I figured to make a wiki entry. If you want figures, I will post all of the data. Please read the discussion page, this has been going on all day.Remagine 03:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First off you have shown no proof of these articles existing, and the only article you posted was from a university and was 3 pictures. You need to show that your company"has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." and as of yet you've not shown this. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> 03:09, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would like you to stop making edits to Wikipedia until you have nominated for deletion every article about a company or organization with a misspelled word, since that is obviously one of your criteria for notability.

The nomination by <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> is, IMO, highly incivil. The fact that the nominator felt it necessary to back up the nomination with personal attacks on the article's creator for a typo makes me think that it was in bad faith, however much I agree that the article doesn't currently meet the requirements. The continued attacks regarding the state of their website disgust me. It has been explained in multiple places on site and to various concerned editors through email. What part of "working on it" don't you understand. It has no bearing on their notability. The fact that you all continue to harangue it shows me that you feel that the other arguments aren't strong enough. Argue the nomination on its own merits, not on totally unrelated facts. I currently agree with the words of the nomination if not the spirit. This article doesn't currently meet the requirements. However, I'm abstaining currently to give the article's creator time to add that which is missing. The conduct of some parties led the article's creator to email me, saying, "Everyone is ganging up on me." Remagine felt attacked and I believe that he was.

<li>Comment: Exactly what personal attacks did I leave for him? All Ive ever said is his article is still an advertisement and quoted the sections I felt were advertisement material, said it was still not NPOV since a company insider is the one writing the article, and said that the company does not meet the nobility requirements stated in WP:CORP. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> 18:27, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, I misread your comment regarding add. I found the capitalization choices in your nomination to be questionable. I will also note that not being NPOV is not a criterion for deletion. Nor do I feel that it is impossible for someone to write an article which is NPOV on a subject they are deeply familiar with. You also seem to be on a personal crusade against this article given your high level of involvement. Not that I find anything wrong with sticking to your beliefs and continued watching of articles you have nominated for AFD, but fully 25% of your edits, at the time of my writing, are about the article in question, starting with it's nomination, or to related articles. You also placed a sock tag on <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStargate007_1086.html" title="User:Stargate007">User:Stargate007</a>. I removed this as you provided no evidence. Please replace it using the EVIDENCE link (emphasis <b>not</b> mine) to link to your evidence. You have just over 100 edits, so I expect that this was an honest mistake. I will take OwenX's advice, as you have done, and chill out.

<li><b>Comment</b> My comments about the content and quality of the company's web site are important, I think, because the web site is presented as evidence for the significance of the company. If there is no substance on the site, it's difficult to judge whether the company is notable. Regarding the poor quality of the article, I think that's also relevant, because if it is indeed a notable company based in Massachusetts, I would expect they would be able to spell the name of the state corrrectly. Particularly since they claim to be in the communications field. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 15:53, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

From <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles..." The article includes multiple citations from mulitple newspapers. "Non-trivial published work" refers to the article, not the newspaper, as noted by the sentence quoted above. That means that this company meets the minimum criterion established in WP:CORP. Any delete nominations that do not address this, or simply reference the nom, must be called into question as they do not take into account that information meeting the criteria of WP:CORP has been added. There are only two ways around this: claim that WP:CORP is merelly proposed and therefore not worthy of citation (in which case the nomination is invalid), or that WP:CORP should be changed to keep what are non-notable companies (I feel that this is one) from getting in.

The Grinspoon award was/is an award given to high school and undergrad college students across Western Massachusetts participating in business classes and/or undertaking entrepreneurial ventures. Wikipedia is not a place where we show off about our college extra-curriculur accomplishments, even if they do make a profit, and Remagine has yet to show financials, another way to meet the criteria of WP:CORP. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 19:43, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please, to all, give me a break with the whole spelling of Massachusetts. Are you telling me you never overlooked typos when typing an article really quickly? I also had to spend all my time defending myself in the discussion which caused me overlook items in the article. As you can see, Mass is in more than one location on the page. As for the website, I explained its situation numerous times in other posts, can you drop it?! If you want to see the web site prior to Friday’s new upgrade use a cache system or web archive site. Thanks Remagine 19:53, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> That misspelling was just one indication of the lack of viability of the article. Yes, everyone makes typos, of course (the article was, and still is, full of them). The point was that the combination of a poorly-written article, lack of evidence of anything particularly notable and nothing to meet the demands of WP:CORP were clear indications for my Delete vote. The point of this discussion is to determine whether to keep or delete the Remagine article and it's the article that's in question. I did not intend to make it personal. I was commenting solely on my viewing of the article, its substance and the claims it makes and trying to compare those to WP policy. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 20:09, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Exactly</b>. As I pointed out above, they received an award along with a bunch of other students for entrepreneurship. It went in the newspaper. Many things are printed in newspapers.

<p><b>User:Remagine and User:Kenpo0110 have just left the project. One more newbie chased away. Kenpo was even a CVU member. Nice job.</b> While it is possible that no one here violated policy or guidelines in their dealings with this issue, the combined effect was one that created a "hostile environment" so strong as to make him leave. He was excited about how Wikipedia worked. He had wanted to understand more about the project but got pulled into this ugly business about his adverticle. (Huh, I kinda like that neologism.) Back on point, it is instances like this where we need to step back and think about the public perception that we are giving. I was told a number of times to chill out, that no abuse or biting was occurring, and that I was overreacting. I guess I shouldn't have backed down so easily. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 10:05, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a constant problem. A lot of people start by creating articles on themselves or their companies; AfDing them is the correct thing to do in terms of policy, but still looks like biting the newbies. This is sad. I have recently started to userfy such things and leave a nice note ont he user page, but even this is taken amiss by some. You can't win. In the end, my delete vote stands, and I support the statements of others even if they could have been more tactfully put. Lesson to learn: explain <b>in detail</b> on the Userpage of a new user who creates an article on themselevs, their firm, their club, whatever, why this is a bad idea. All of which takes time.

<dd>Please note "One more newbie..." Also note that said person was busy trying to defend himself and this article and didn't really have a bunch of time to work on other things. The inlcusion of that on his userpage shows an interest in the project. I feel that the particulars of this case are not really the issue here anyway. I think that we should stop discussing this article or its contributors as it is going to be deleted and the user has left. What's more important is looking more broadly at what first impressions we give to new users.

<p>I believe this is a neologism based on the lack of Google hits it gets. The society which is mentioned in the article gets even fewer Google hits, many of which are from Wikipedia mirrors.

<li>Comment: Are there any stories of this person, before the "marriage". I'm somewhat concerned, that while there are ample news stories, the info on this person doesn't seem that reliable. She's repeatedly referred to as a millionaire, and as a rock concert promoter in various stories. But, I haven't found any pre-dolphin verification of this. It seems what we know about this, is only what she told tabloid reporters, who then got picked up by other reporters, but there may not be truly reliable facts on this person. I'm happy to be proven wrong on this. But, I just don't think reporters covering dolphin marriages worry to much about fact checking. I think, any decent bio seems to require one know reliablely what the occupation of the subject is, or was. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:34, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So there's no reason that someone interested in unusual marriages or human-dolphin relations should be able to read about this? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:24, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Kappa, the catch here is that it's not real. Saying you're marrying a dolphin, is like saying you're married to your job. Neither are legal marriages. The dolphin relationship has even less legal signficance. She loves the dolphin, how nice. Good for her. There are *huge* numbers of people who make expressions of love for animals (usually, but not only their pets), that, tooken out of context, sound rather bizarre, and amazing. I know somebody who calls her cats her "fury babies". Now, if the <i><a href="../../../w/e/e/Weekly_World_News_8c7a.html" title="Weekly World News">Weekly World News</a></i> runs the story "<i>Woman from Canada has cats as babies!</i>", shall we make an article for her? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:59, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This story has been reported more far more widely than a single tabloid, enough to make it signficant in fields of interspecies relationships or unusual marriage. Anyone writing an essay or thesis on either of these topics would be likely to mention this event. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's *printed* widely, but there's actually little reporting that's been done. It seems a local paper covered a human interest story, the tabloids caught wind, and a single AP story got picked up (one AP story counts as scores or hundreds in Google News). But almost nothing is reliable known about Tendler, beyond unverified statements she made after the ceremony. I find claims of her being a rock concert promoter, clothing maker, and millionaire, rather dubious (but a bio article is void without such details). Also, how could this be used for researching "<i>interspecies relationships</i>". This woman lives in London, and visits Israel 2 or 3 times a year. She doesn't live with the Dolphin, and won't live with the Dolphin. Despite some puriant speculation, there's no likely "marital relations" (at least not in the "biblical" sense). She concedes there's no legal signficance to this. A basic problem here is that the same news agencies (like AP) that would srutinize bio facts for an election candidate, don't much care for fact-checking on a Dolphin story. The fact people think any knowledge of "interspecies" relationships can be gained, shows the potential harm of this article. Gossip always has many sources, but few good ones. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 19:30, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would agree with you if she had a legal marriage. As that would be the first in world in history (that I know of). But, this is as "real" as two five year olds playing marriage. Also, as a bio article (not an event article) we need verifiable biographical information on this person. I suggest, despite the huge number of stories, we don't reliably know if she's a milliionaire, rock promoter, or what she is.

<li>In the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cindy_the_Dolphin_44c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cindy the Dolphin">other AFD</a> you argued:

<dd><i>It’s irrelevant whether the dolphin agreed to the marriage because the marriage is legal in Israel.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Well, it's now verifiably proven that the marriage is not legal. The so-called "bride" herself conceded that point. She doesn't live with Dolphin, and simply visits as a tourist 2-3 times a year, and that won't change. There's no official marriage. There's a source confirming the legal issue in the article (and *many* more available).

<li>I'm basing it on what my original argument was, which was it gained loads of media attention blah blah which makes it notable.

<li>Hi Kappa - in terms of your question I'll say that it goes in the same vain as other stuff here - for example we don't insert the insane speculation about the hollywood divorces in the pop star articles here every time it happens or every boyfriend they ever had. Some of those events might be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> but they are crufty in that they don't really have any real impact on anything. This is the same thing - yet another person who "married" an animal... it would have an actual claim to notability here if the marriage had actually taken place - but it didn't and it's variafiable that it did NOT take place and/or was not legal so the only other claim to notability is the reach of the event rather then the event itself, which as other people mentioned didn't even last for long at all since it was disproven early so it hardly had a lasting effect on society and isn't really historical in any concievable way. The reason "Sharon Tendler" doesn't need an article is precisely because there's really nothing to write about other then this minor dolphin blurb. If there was a list like "People who have claimed to marry animals" it might go there, for example. If and when she has something else to write about to write a real article THEN someone should start an article about her, but not at the moment. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">WhiteNight</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 23:32, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

If this article gets deleted, then Cindy is going to redirect to nowhere. I'd suggest restoring it and putting this article in as a "See Also", then if this article survives AfD, merging the two.

<li>People seeking the Dolphin should see this article, so they know there is an AFD, and can participate. If this is deleted, the dolphin article (unfortunately) would survive, but would be subject to yet another AFD if somebody wishes (due to lack of prior consensus and new information coming to light). But, I do agree, no backdoor deletion should occur. Without a dolphin-specific AFD consensus delete, the dolphin lives, even if his bride perishes here. Anyway, it's all moot if this article is kept. Also note, there's really no more merging left to do.

Once again, nearly all of the above votes are party-line bloc voting as part of Timecop's war on blogs. A number of these bloc voters including Timecop himself are self-proclaimed GNAA members, so this smells like mischief. Closing admin please take note. 15K google hits is actually quite a lot, and since the whole phenomenon of podcasting is fairly new (the term only came into widespread use last year), it is hardly surprising that Alexa numbers don't yet match those for text blogs or other genres that have been around longer. An apples-to-apples comparison would involve comparing its traffic with other podcasts. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Curps, I think that axe you have to grid is getting in the way of your better judgement here. The first afd was basically uncited opinion - here we have variafiable information that it is not notable. Your arguments seems to be is that it gets a fair amount of google hits, which is open to manipulation and does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">WhiteNight</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 21:15, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't have an axe to grind. I'm just very suspicious of GNAA members with an openly advertised agenda, systematically voting as a bloc on every single article listed in a "war on blogs" hitlist. Some of their nominated targets do seem to be suitably obscure; I just wonder if they're not trying to sneak some more notable targets past the rest of us, mixed in along with the junk. For instance, until as recently as five days ago they had <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Volokh_Conspiracy_fe74.html" title="The Volokh Conspiracy">The Volokh Conspiracy</a> in their "war on blogs" hitlist queue, until some anon IP removed it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Timecop/The_war_on_blogs&amp;diff=34052194&amp;oldid=33952499" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Timecop/The_war_on_blogs&amp;diff=34052194&amp;oldid=33952499" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. That raised a huge red flag because The Volokh Conspiracy is an A-list legal blog (blawg), blogrolled from Instapundit and many other A-list blogs, and the idea of merging it into <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Volokh_4e53.html" title="Eugene Volokh">Eugene Volokh</a> makes about as much sense as merging <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> into <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Seinfeld_0ee4.html" title="Jerry Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>. Nominating it for AfD would be <i>prima facie</i> bad faith. They've cleaned up their "war on blogs" page somewhat... they've removed the "terminated" list of successful kills, and they've switched from using external links (which don't show under "what links here") to regular internal links. But still I think we're entitled to ask whether improving Wikipedia is actually their objective. Historically very few websites have been left in an improved state after a GNAA campaign that targeted them. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 22:46, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Kindly shut up and stop polluting the afd thanks, save the rant for your blog. Wikipedia is not about your opinions and this fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and therefore should be deleted due to the policy.

<li><b>Strong Keep but cleanup</b>. This stub desperately needs some TLC, but the basic article is correct: Jam is one of the two biggest jingle creators in the world, and is a household name to anyone in the radio industry.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> This company is a part of American pop culture. Probably every person in the Western world has heard their radio jingles at some time. I orginally posted this article and I was really surprised that no one had written about JAM prior to this. They are an icon in the radio industry. I would request that this be taken off the Deletion list. I am interest as to why it was put on it in the first place.Bkirby 00:46, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Once an article has been nominated for deletion, I don't think there's any procedure to just de-nominate it. If there's an overwhelming consensus in one way or the other, the discussion can be declared over, but we don't have a clear consensus here, if for no other reason than not that many people have voted at all. Hopefully once the latest five-day voting period is up, an admin will declare the vote as "keep but cleanup" and I and others can work on rewriting it. I'd start rewriting it now, but I'm not going to waste my time as long as there's even a 1% chance that it's going to get deleted. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 00:56, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm okay with mods having articles. Unreleased mods, however, are not very article-worthy (but may be footnote-worthy in some other article). Welcome back when there's an actual playable release and people went a-playing screamingly! Too many mods die in an eternal development limbo. (Just noted today that Ultima VIII: Exile has died.

<li><b>Delete</b> mainly because the link to the site doesn't work correctly. But I should point out that there are other mods (a Apocolypse Mod for BattleField 2 for example) that are on Wiki, but not slated for deletion. If there was evidence that this mod was further along, perhaps in some sort of beta release, I would be against deletion. However, there is really no available evidence that it is anywhere. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadrattle_29ee.html" title="User:Headrattle">Headrattle</a> 23:50, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>the site is currently down but the mod is moving along quite nicly....they wont be releasing a beta because it would be crappy and unfinished so....there you go.</p>

<dd>This list is not POV. It might have systemic bias; if so, please encourage readers with knowledge of other cultures to add information about fads in those cultures.

<li><b>KEEP</b>: Technically all fads are POVs, but the list is very resourceful, where else could you find a list of fads from the 1960s to today. The problem is that people see things they don't like in this article, then they believe that it is inaccurate, which is intirelly false (All fads are POVs). I personally didn't like the Furby or Snap Bracelet fad, but I cannot deny that it was a fad. The list for me also makes me feel nostalgic and brings back personal memories too. I would bet the person that posted the deletion saw the 2000s fads only and said "Oh My God! This must be deleted!!!" he or she probrably also didn't like the fads because they are to loyal to their own, so the deletion for this article is also a POV miss conseption.

<li>Aye, that could have been phrased better, so how about this: We require that items in this encyclopedia meet certain requirements, chief among them being <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> which has its foundation in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. The very nature of lists means that it is frightfully easy to add items, the sheer number of which makes it difficult to ensure that they are all correct. Additionally, systemic bias means that, for a given population, we'll have a number of entries proportional to that population, making a list violate NPOV. Thus, if we moved this list to List of fads in the United States and were <i>scrupulous</i> about our definition of "fad" and removing things that could not be verifired as fad per <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> than there would be no problem. But let us make some small concession to pragmatism, that is not going to happen. Thus I re-iterate: why is it much more difficult to delete an NPOV, uncited list than it would be a prose article with the same problem? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 05:49, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>: There have long been speculations and rumours that there may have been a pre-Maori colonisation of New Zealand, but the evidence ranks close to the Von Däniken levels for believability. An article on these theories should probably exist, as long as it is made clear that it is a theory viewed with extreme scepticism by the scientific community. I don't believe this article, as it currently stands, could easily be turned into an article that would fulfl that requirement. As it currently stands, it is heavily POV, and deals with just one of the people who has raised this theory (and not one of the main ones). I'd suggest <b>deleting</b> this one, and hopefully someone more in the know could write something better at a later date. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 12:02, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep, Edit</b> This article is not anti-Maori, it is simply trying to inform people of the previous history of New Zealand before the Maori arrived. It is unfair to suppress NZ's Pre-Maori history, labeling it racism. The New Zealand government has banned carbon dating on any artefacts found, and I thought that wikipedia would be a safe haven away from any cover ups or embargo's for all to find the truth. Although I am not the author of the site, I have contacted the author for help editing the wiki - though have had no reply. I agree that my grammar and wording is not so good - I should have planned it better, and will re-write asap, although I am not sure which parts are POV. Is there any <b>external</b> archaeologists that could comment on this? IE, scientists that have not studied the history of NZ? Because half the problem is that the scientists of NZ are set in such a deep mindset that they have tunnel vision and simple cannot accept any different theories.

<li>How come, after I left an incorrect piece of information on an automotive article for a while, no one complained at all. Suddenly when article that could imply racism everyone is all over it. I don't think this is very fair. Other articles have websites as their proof, why can't this one? There is hard evidence of pre-maori civilisation why are you trying to hide this from society? What is realy going on here? I believe the reason this article is being kept down because if it gets into mainstream, it will make the Maori activists, and stereotypically the race look hypocritical. However this is not fair, and should not even be a factor in keeping this down if we get to know more about the history of New Zealand. --<a href="../../../n/z/h/User%7ENzhamstar_14d3.html" title="User:Nzhamstar">Nzhamstar</a> 21:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Nzhamstar, I visited the celticnz website and couldn't find any convincing evidence for its claims. Martin Doutré has found some stones and thinks that they represented pre-Maori activity but he didn't have any finds or scientific dates from excavations to tell us about. How does he know these sites aren't from the post-Maori era? Some of them look natural rather than manmade, has he carried out excavation work to demonstrate his ideas? The saga of the embargoed documents from the Waipoua Forest which don't seem to actually contain any useful information and are freely-available for inspection anyway don't help his case nor do quotations from speculative nineteenth century antiquarians who had a lot of ideas about mass population movements that are now discounted. Mr Doutré appears to looking for evidence that supports his theory and ignoring other explanations- this technique is the hallmark of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoarchaeology.html" title="Pseudoarchaeology">pseudoarchaeology</a> and it is why the article being criticised. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 22:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is not fair to suppress this information. The only reason it hasn't been proved true is because reknowned scientists and archaeologists ignore the evidence because they are too busy believing in the fact that there is no Pre-Maori history, and/or are too scared (or complacent) for being labeled culturally insensitive or racist for studying such things. It hasn't been proved wrong. Why is the government banning open archaeological investigation and carbon dating on these artefacts? --<a href="../../../n/z/h/User%7ENzhamstar_14d3.html" title="User:Nzhamstar">Nzhamstar</a> 23:43, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is certainly some evidence that there was human contact with New Zealand before the permanent settlement by Maori. The kiore (rat) appears to have been here longer than permanant settlement, and could only have arrived with humans. This indicates that Polynesians arrived at New Zealand earlier than the accepted dates for Maori settlement, but did not stay (or did not survive). This is a very different hypothesis from suggesting Celtic peoples settled New Zealand.</dd>
<dd>By the way, you fail to quote any evidence of said "Maori tradition". You need to quote peer reviewed journals, not wild speculation. You say that scientists suppress the evidence, but scientists have no motive to suppress such items, and every motive to publish any evidence that would show such a radically different version of prehistory. If you could provide proof, you'd win the archeological equivalent of the Nobel Prize. In practice, archeologists don't pursue such theories for the same reasons as physicists don't pursue perpetual motion machines.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 04:09, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Governments suppress the findings - not scientists! Scientists and archaeologists want these restricted sites out in the open, rather than censored because of Maori superstition. The only way this can happen is to inform the public of what they are missing out on. And the way to do that is Wikipedia which is supposed to be a "big open encyclopedia" for everyone to access and add stuff to and now I'm being kicked to the curb for offering proof and evidence of an alternative, censored history of New Zealand. This is absolute BS, you people are the bullies of wikipedia! --<a href="../../../n/z/h/User%7ENzhamstar_14d3.html" title="User:Nzhamstar">Nzhamstar</a> 22:56, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This one's a little odd - I was notified about it by <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">User:Kahuroa</a>, who (as his username suggests) knows a few details about Māori culture. There seems to be no such god as Nganga, and no Māori god of sleet... googling on nganga + Māori leads to about 350 hits. take out Bible translations (in which it means "hailstorm"), and you're left with about 175. Only about 1/3 of these refer to Maori mythology, so we're down to only about 60 hits. Several - all identical to a stub on Encyclopedia Mythica - refer to Nganga being the Māori god of sleet. The rest all talk about Ua, the Māori god of rain, who is known by variants of that name depending on what type of rain is involved: Ua-Roa for long rain, Uanui for heavy rain, and Ua-Nganga for rainstorms. It looks like somewhere along the line some lines of communication have got crossed, and a new, fictional god may have been created... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 12:37, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Per nom, nice bit of research. I wonder, now that you have learned some, if you should add the Maori gods you have identified as a list, perhaps to the Polynesian mythology page?

<dd><b>Ua</b> is just the word for rain. These 'gods' (seems to me) reflect the kind of expansions on a theme that you get in chants or songs in oral cultures - such repetitions are part of the structure of almost any oral traditional composition. Rhythm helps recall and transmission, and so a word in a chant, like <i>ua</i>, rain, might be followed by expanded variants, <i>ua, ua roa, ua nui, ua nganga</i> (rain, long rain, heavy rain, storming rain) etc. - it's a bit like deciding that <i>la la la</i> is the European god of rhythm and song. Please no list unless evidence of actual worship/ritual exists, not just a line in a song somewhere that has been misinterpreted. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 19:12, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>me again...Delete</b> On further thought there seem to be several related articles that are of dubious origin. Nganga and Ua are not genuine Maori gods - same prob goes for Polynesian. <a href="../../../u/a/_/Ua.html" title="Ua">Ua</a> and therefore also Nganga and <a href="../../../h/a/u/Hau_Marangi_379e.html" title="Hau Marangi">Hau Marangi</a> (Wind from the Sky) seem to be someone's attempt to combine the <i>Biblical Flood</i> story with Maori/Polynesian mythology. This combining could have happened in the 19th century - like the Great Fleet idea started by 19th century Europeans with a romantic view of us Polynesians. There must be some obscure source for Nganga and co, since I haven't come across them before. Maybe someone's found some old mouldy 19th century tome and is quoting from it to make these articles. The article <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papa_%28mythology%29.html" title="Papa (mythology)">Papa (mythology)</a> is genuine - the earth mother was Papatuanuku, but the article has a detail about a flood that seems strange to me and may also be Biblical Flood-derived (It kinda conflicts with the Ruaumoko part of the story anyway). Anyhoo, if it is decided to list, <i>they should not be described as gods without some pretty heavy qualification</i>. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 11:41, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Because the events regarding the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ongoing_List_of_Accidents_04de.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ongoing List of Accidents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ongoing List of Accidents</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_disasters_e7bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of disasters">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of disasters</a> deletion debates are seriously looking to be intertwined. I will be depositing this serious chunk of text in <i>both</i> deletion debates.</b></p>
<p>I have struck all my previous comments and opinions from both debates, and have attempted to reconsider the two nominations (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disasters.html" title="List of disasters">List of disasters</a> - referred to as <i><b>Disasters</b></i>, and Ongoing List of Accidents - referred to as <i><b>Accidents</b></i>) and my reasons for deletion, in as unbiased a way as possible. Having attempted to do so, I have come to the following conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ongoing List of Accidents is an almost complete duplicate of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disasters.html" title="List of disasters">List of disasters</a>, and as such, warrants either a merger or deletion per the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia Deletion Policy</a>.
<ul>
<li>However, while the two articles have very similar content, the definitions for inclusion are different. The Disasters article gives its definition (and inclusion criteria) as <i>"a natural or man-made event that negatively affects life, property, livelihood or industry, often resulting in permanent changes to human societies, ecosystems and environment."</i> Therfore, in my personal opinion, you need a lot of bang to get your disaster-rated buck.</li>
<li>The Accidents article gives it's definition (and inclusion criteria) as <i>"is a mishap that happens unexpectedly, that results in damage or injury, up to and including death."</i> I believe the point made by <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrian_4bb8.html" title="User:Atrian">User:Atrian</a> in the Accidents debate applies here - <i>"I stubbed my toe this morning, can I get listed here too?"</i>. While defining an event as a disaster is 'structured' by the scope necessary to be considered by the media and public opinion as a <i>disaster</i>, any "undesirable or unfortunate happening" (the definition of accident I pulled from my hardcopy dictionary) could technically be included on this list; billions of entries per calender day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, looking at detail at the two lists, I would like to offer the following recommendations.</p>
<ol>
<li>The list of aviation disasters/accidents doesn't belong in either article. These should be split off into a List of aviation accidents, where the criteria for inclusion is set at a certain amount of fatalities, per the introduction for the sublist in the Disasters
<ul>
<li>As a subset of this suggestion , the lists of "accidents/disasters involving <b>foo</b>-vehicle" should also be split out into "Lists of <b>foo</b>-vehicle accidents", again, with a set fatality criteria, or at least some kind of inclusion criteria.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mining accidents/disasters, now thats a section in serious need of overhaul. Mining is a dangerous industry, and while every fatality may not be a 'disaster', there would be too many events to comprehensively list in an 'accidents' list/article. A criteria for remaining within the Disasters article would have to be developed and enforced - my personal suggestion would be to set a casualty limit, but also include those that caused significant rethinks in the mining industry.</li>
<li>Fire accidents/disasters appears to be better served by the already-existing <i><b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_historic_fires.html" title="List of historic fires">List of historic fires</a></b></i>. Some merging to this article from these two articles would be appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disasters.html" title="List of disasters">List of disasters</a> article is suitable (in my personal opinion), and as such should be <b>kept</b>.</p>
<p>However, if my suggested changes go ahead or don't, it appears to me that the Accidents article is always going to be the poor little brother to the Disasters article. Points to the creator for his/her effort, and if there is consensus towards my suggestions, I believe the user could best assist Wikipedia by helping to implement those. Unfortunately, the Accidents article should still be <b>deleted</b>, as there is no way (in my personal opinion) to produce a meaningful list/article under the current article name and definition of inclusion, without it spiralling out of control.</p>

</ul>
<p>WHY IS THIS PAGE NOT DELETED YET? Why is a page in such dispute allowed to exist. The idea of linking an offensive page with opinions masquerading as facts ... this list of controversial opinions (unproven, unsubstantiated, not referenced, and not verifiable), it would seem that some have a sheer glee in paralysis through analysis, they want this debate to drag on as long as they can hang their dirty laundry out each day to dry! Well I for one think integrity is not up for debate and think that this so-called debate is a strategy to let cheap shots masquerade as fact. It seems this page violates the basic tenant of posting in wikopedia, in that most of the controversy are opinions and not verifiable or certainly not unobjective view point. (RS)</p>
<p>I think that the controversy article is worth keeping as a subset of the main article, the Lord's Recovery, as there is information included in it that is not found in the main article. It might get pretty cumbersome to try to integrate it into the main article so keeping it separate is useful. However, there may be a few places where a NPOV approach is needed to clean it up, although I thought most sections did aim for a NPOV.</p>

<p>For my two cents, please note that the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Church_3cc6.html" title="Local Church">Local_Church</a> article has had a <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheLocalChurch_341d.html" title="User:TheLocalChurch">long history</a> of being blanked, vandalized, and contested in attempts to - in the words of sysop <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> - canonize the movement. The forked article, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Church_controversy_1cee.html" title="Local Church controversy">Local Church controversy</a>, was originally created by ongoing efforts to present the article on the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Church_3cc6.html" title="Local Church">Local_Church</a> in the most positive possible light while only grudgingly admitting that concerns existed by people outside the movement - the same sorts of concerns that have arisen with articles on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> or the <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> for instance.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that this fork was created under false pretenses and against the spirit of Wikipedia, and didn't want to put too much effort into editing a page that I had hoped would simply be deleted. If this article is to be deleted, I wouldn't mind taking the effort to clean up the mess in the controversy article so that it can be folded into another article that meets the standards desired by the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>I propose that the existing article be significantly revised and folded back into the article on the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Church_3cc6.html" title="Local Church">Local_Church</a> as a section of the article. I also propose that this discussion be posted in the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Talk%7ELocal_Church_a602.html" title="Talk:Local Church">Talk:Local_Church</a> article, with a notice that this section was intentionally folded back into the original article and should remain there rather than being forked again into a new article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheLocalChurch_341d.html" title="User:TheLocalChurch">TheLocalChurch</a> 21:26, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>merge</b> Let us try it. I know that articles dealing with cults and controversial sects and new religious movements are problematic on Wikipedia, because they tend to degenerate into ugly and unencyclopedic battles between well-informed critics (mainly former members) and well-informed adherents, see e.g. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>.

<dd>It may or may not be an actual genre, but many people will instantly know what is meant by 'cheesy music' and indeed many nightclubs, pubs and bars market themselves using the phrase to describe their music policy. Also, many articles refer to cheesy music, and so an article to explain what it is is entirely appropriate. eg Klute (Nightclub), <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Banana_6cf4.html" title="Top Banana">Top Banana</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/_/Un_Ping%C3%BCino_en_mi_Ascensor_f903.html" title="Un Pingüino en mi Ascensor">Un Pingüino en mi Ascensor</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/4/1449AM_URB_f09f.html" title="1449AM URB">1449AM URB</a></dd>
<dd>Also, before being deleted, at least give someone the chance to expand the article - hence the stub tag.DMB 16:54, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Having done some digging, I'm not at all confident that the definition given here is accurate.

<p><b>Reasons to Keep This Page</b></p>
<p>Addressing the comments above, one at a time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Per the wikipedia defintion, an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is a written compendium of knowledge. This page is an attempt to give people knowledge, including the existance of the site, how it fits in with Freecycle (during its conflicts), etc. In this case, it is the same as linking to other commercial sources that serve the local areas, such as the television stations, radio stations and newspapers; they have the same local purpose.</li>
<li>"... a Freecycle-like project...". As we wrote, Freecycle is a collection of Yahoo Groups. We have many important differentiators, which are listed on our own site. We specifically didn't list them on the wiki page so that it wouldn't look like an ad.</li>
<li>"use wikipedia to create a homepage". We already have a homepage. We're attempting to tell people about a resource that other people in their communities are using.</li>
<li>"just trying to advertise". Look at the links on the page for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina_1d79.html" title="Charlotte, North Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>. I see links to companies, which certainly help to reinforce their brand. I see links to other community services, like churches, newspapers, television and radio stations. Please explain why it's ok for someone interested in Charlotte to know about only one of the town's newspapers, but not to know about another place where they can interact with other locals?</li>
<li>"...there's no external link..." The introduction gives the URL, which has now been made into a link.</li>
<li>"...certainly isn't notable..." To try and keep the page from looking like an advertisement, we didn't list all the things that make the site different from other sites; these are listed on our home page(s). The <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html" title="Vanity page">vanity page</a> lists several reasons why this page could exist, including: 'An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.' Please explain how we can show the importance without coming across as an advertisement in your minds. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalDataPlace_b8f6.html" title="User:LocalDataPlace">LocalDataPlace</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalDataPlace_217e.html" title="User talk:LocalDataPlace">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LocalDataPlace_6ea6.html" title="Special:Contributions/LocalDataPlace">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I wouldn't have a problem with the page if it was converted into a proper, nuetral, reasonably written encyclopedic article on the subject, even just a stub. At the moment its not, and needs a total overhaul. If you require a wiki for discussion and development of your project these can be downloaded or obtained free of charge very easily nowadays, its just that wikipedia isn't the appropriate place <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a> 19:04, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for your comment and time taken to consider. I'm really looking for advice from more experienced folk than me. Without the scandal, he's not notable enough IMO. If we delete then I think it is quite likely that the (mis)information will reappear, given Prasad's history.

<p>I think it is a different person.There are several people with this name.I think we should clarify.I looked up the scholar google and fouund him having conducted the research.(A.J.Prasad).There are several people with this name.The one you hav in mind is a psychiatrist from Ranchi.who is different from A.J.Prasad.Kedar Agarawal.(Psychiatrist,Delhi)</p>
<p>Indeed it is a different person.The one in Ranchi is Ashoka Prasad practicing in Bariatu Colony.This man A.J.Prasad has been in UP for over 15 years..Kedar Agarwal</p>
<p>I have been able to look up.The book is there in the NIMHANS,Bangalore Libraray(Boloical Basis of Neuroses0.I think it is a case of mistaken identity. Kedar Agarwal I deed AJ Prasad is am member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences. it appears. Kedar Agarwal</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for trying to clarify things but I'm pretty certain that the two are the same. However, I can't read the deleted Johnubiprasad article so don't know what it says. The AfD page contains a plea from a John Connolly that links Johnubi Prasad with Sodium Valproate, Biological Basis and TOP 1000 SCIENTISTS. The same link to all these was made by user 202.138.112.252 with <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashoka_Jahnavi-Prasad_d046.html" title="Ashoka Jahnavi-Prasad">Ashoka Jahnavi-Prasad</a>. Please see <a href="../../../a/s/h/Talk%7EAshoka_Jahnavi-Prasad_e314.html" title="Talk:Ashoka Jahnavi-Prasad">Talk:Ashoka Jahnavi-Prasad</a> for more details, where I've been careful not to assume all the AJ Prasads are the same person (though I suspect they are). What we do know is that 202.138.112.252 stated that Ashoka Jahnavi-Prasad is the great granson of Rajendra Prasad (1st president of India). The ABC radio program mentioned on the AJP talk page also says AJP is the great grandson of India's first president.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Reading the ABC program transcript and the BMJ news report, you get a picture of someone who likes to have others think he is more important than he really is (Anna Monika Medal, Nobel Prize) and this fits with the exaggerated importance given to him re: sodium valproate and the biological basis of neuroses. Correcting this misinformation is one reason why I think it might be useful to keep this article but totally rewritten with the (unpleasant) facts.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it may be worthwhile contacting Dr.V.Radharishnan of the Indian Psychiatric Association(Deputy Secretary).He seems to believe that there are two psychiatrists with this name.One is in Ranchi who has just returned from abroad and the other in Maharajganj.The Indian Medical Association also states that there are 8 people with this name on their membership rolls.I am trying to ascertain from them the wherabouts.Dr Rajendra Prasad was from Bihar which is where Ranchi used to be until rcently(now capital of Jharkhand).By the way on googling I came across. another doctor with this name in Farmington Michigan but I do not think he is a psychiatrist.I am the charman of psychiatry at Sfdarjung Delhi, the largest hospital here and I seem to remember a lecture by Dr.Jahnavi-Prasad( not Jonnubirprasad) as you mention on valproate a few years ago at teh Delhi Medical Association a few years ago but I do get the feeling that he was well settled in Maharajganj and remains there.Kedar Mal Agarwal.11th Jan.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have some information.The Indian Medical Association provided it.Ashoka Prasad is a graduate from Kanpur,1977.He trained in England.Ashok Jahnavi Kumar Prasad is a 1975 graduate from Patna.He spent some time in England then under Arvid Carlsson in Gothenberg and then some time at the NIH in Bethesda,MD USA before returning to India.There are therefore two psychiatrists with the same name.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>My colleaugu looked at your comments and was interested to note the term Johnubiprasad.He pointed out that anyone ith any understanding of the Indian names would recognise this name to be phony.Jahnavi is a Sanskrit term meaning the Holy Ganges.It amy be spelt Janhavi but is never spelt Johnubi.On using the scholar google,I noticed a few articles by Ashoka Jahanavi Prasad but none by Johnubiprasad.The book(Biological Basis) is incidentally also in the All India Institute oif Medical Sciences Library just across the road and it is by Ashok Jahanavi Prasad and is dated 1988,much before the article on the ABC..The American Academy of Arts and Sciences also has a Foreign Honorary Member Ashoka Jahnavi Prasad.The article on the valproate appeared in Pharmatherepeutica as scholar google suggests and was by A.J.Prasad.I would tend to agree that it is an advance.All of us clinical psychiatrists had nothinmg but lithium for manic depression before that and it is toxic.We all use valproate now as a first choice.It may be worthwhile ascertaining from the Medical Council of England whteher there are two doctors with this name with these qualifications as they both worked in England.Also I have serious doubts about the charlaton's links with Dr.Rajendra.He in India is known as a thorough gentleman universally respected and next to Mahtma's family his is the family which has never to my knowledge abused their position,rare in India.It may be that someone is misusing the name. -- KMA -- 59.94.112.34 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.94.112.34_5625.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.94.112.34">contribs</a>) 12th January 2006.</dd>

<li>I've made my mind up and my vote is now: <b>Delete</b>. There may be a name confusion here. However an anonymous user who signs as John Connolly linked these names: "Ashoka Prasad (also known as Ashoka JOHNUBIPRASAD)". Perhaps Johnubiprasad is some kind of pet-name. Regardless, I think all the A J Prasads in this world would appear to be not notable enough for Wikipedia. Whilst sodium valproate may well be "a major advance", the role of A.J. Prasad in this advance (with the evidence available) would appear to be extremely minor. I repeat from the (soon to be deleted?) talk page:</li>

<dd>Prasad's article discusses just seven patients who were treated with sodium valproate and notes that five got better. This is not some large scale study, double-blind trial or even highly-cited paper. It is merely one of many small studies perfomed in the early 1980s (see "Psychiatry Update: Annual Review" by the American Psychiatric Association (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0880482427</a>) page 138. This lists five other studies including another by Lambert in 1984 of 108 patients) Similarly, the comments regarding biological basis of neuroses are unsubstantiated. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a> 09:43, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed you are right.This was not the first study.But let me take you back to lithium.JohnCade is credited with the discovery and it is known that he got himself unsuccessfully nominated for a knighthood(once by himself!).He did the study on the flimsiest of evidence and the inferences he drew were not supported by his results(frogs not dying on consuming urine of manics having taken lithium!).The adulation showered on him obscures the important fact-that it was Mogens Schou who conducted the first real trial using tested psychometric scales.Schou was a very unassuming man (he does not even have an article in the Wikipedia-I could not find enough details on the google as I did for all others including this)who was not given his due- and he never complained.I would advise you to look at the Emrich and lambert studies and note the psychometric tests employed.While Ashok Sir(he was with our medical college until his retirement in June 2005) has fully acknowledged in his paper that lambert and Emrich should be credited with the discovery(in the paper itself),all of this medical school believed he underplayed his role given that his was the first supported and sponsored clinical trial(by Sanofi).As far as the book goes,one has to read the preface by Professor Merton ,the then President of British Association of Psychopharmacology-"This is the first known effort to weave all the existing evidence of biological origins of neuroses and draw a meningful conclusion."As I have written the article,my vote would naturally be to retain it.<b>Retain</b>Anilkumar</p>

<li>keep: by my reckoning 9 of the 31 google hits belong to this Andrew Hewish. This entry was provided as background to the work of the Centre; if it is contrary to a Wikipedia fashion then of course it should be removed. C4RD hopes to provide a larger registry of those artists and 'creatives' whose core practice is drawing. It has a regular 'Time-Out' listing and a solid relationship with the drawing community not just in London but in Britain generally. I refer anyone with doubts to Phil Sawdon of the drawing journal 'Tracey'. [[Controller 21:39, 8 January 2006 (UTC)]]</li>

<p>A special thank you to --Bachrach44 for sharing with me the guidelines found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">[WP:WEB</a>]</p>
<p>Given these guidelines it would seem that any webpage that has not already achieved fame would not meet the criteria for inclusion.</p>
<p>My only problem with this, and I understand its about keeping the Wiki up to quality standards, is that in fact the mylovingmemory.com website is the first to allow the general public to upload photos to create a digital collage. Although it does share a similarity to the milliondollarhomepage in the way it offers pixels for photos - the two sites are nothing alike. The milliondollarhomepage does not offer any content, only links. The Mylovingmemory website is the first to approach digital art collages in this manner and in fact their efforts are a historic moment and should be recognized.</p>
<p>Addditionally, the guidelines do not speak to uniqueness of content or public interactivity. Most "collage art" is done by a single artist on a static canvas. This site is creating digital collages by allowing public interaction on a changing canvas.</p>
<p>In short, I did not come here to post about "yet another nuke site" and attempt to include something as common as that. This website is unique. It is the only one I know of that does it and it is doing it as a project in philanthrophy. Exceptions should be made. Xanthor 00:41, 9 January 2006 (UTC)Xanthor</p>

<dl>
<dd>It's not "The internets version of a time capsule". It's <i>your</i> version of a time capsule. It would have to be pretty noteworthy indeed to be the internet's version of anything. May sites over the years have offered people a place to put images, reflections, confessions...all kinds of things. I think you overestimate the uniqueness and the novelty of your project, but even if you are right, it has to make some kind of impact before it is notable enough to be treated here. Your site hasn't even <i>launched</i> yet. There are thousands and thousands of projects out there that are just getting started and looking for recognition. Wikipedia is not here to help you promote your project. People have tried to explain this to you and point you toward Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion of websites, but for some reason you don't want to listen. This isn't personal--several people have gone out of their way to wish you and your project well--but the fact is, you're trying to use this place as something it's not. There are all kinds of ways to promote a new site; Wikipedia is something else. Best of luck with your project; may it prosper and evolve into something worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 23:28, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you Rodii for taking the time to do more than vote. I do understand what people are saying and I freely admit that I dont like it&#160;:-) On that note I do want to say that _I HAVE_ noticed all the well wishes that I have recieved and I thank you all very much for them. I don't want to appear ungrateful. They were noticed.. and even encouraging!&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I do want to say that I have scoured the net to purposly try and find someone who is taking photos from real lives and making collages and neo-impressionistic art out of them ... and they're just arent any sites that I have found. Yes there are memorial sites and yes there are many many photo galleries... but they arent "creating" any new works from the photos that are shared. This is the uniqueness that I think I have with the site. I would love for anyone to show me a site that is already doing something similar... but only because I have spent a good amount of time trying to find one myself. It's a true internet first... and .... as time progresses it is getting harder and harder to be able to make that claim.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all my well wishers. Truth be told I realized yesterday after reading the guidelines that I probably wouldent change your policy and I accepted it then... but I had to try. I too wish everyone well even though I did not get the reception I had hoped for. Xanthor 23:42, 9 January 2006 (UTC)Xanthor</p>

<li>This is a technical error, and a very common one.

<li>Not sure about the specifics of Google and its search results, but even if there are however many thousand results, if the writer of the blog is notable then there should be a page on him with mention of climateaudit (not a page on climateaudit with a mention of him).

<li>Hmmmm, well google has the answer to that too, one can search with "-site:climateaudit.org" to exclude self references. Doing so puts the results under 1000 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22climateaudit%22+%2Dsite%3Aclimateaudit%2Eorg+%2Dsite%3Aclimateaudit%2Ecom" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22climateaudit%22+%2Dsite%3Aclimateaudit%2Eorg+%2Dsite%3Aclimateaudit%2Ecom" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> (can CA really have 19000 references to itself?

<p>This page is not encyclopedic, just a bunch of people from a group trying to make a name for themselves.

<li><b>Save</b>This group is in fact noteworthy, and is currently on the YTMND and 4chan boards. Rich not only lied about him now knowing before he saw the page (he was in the mIRC chat hours before it was made, and was told about it even beforehand by a friend who was in it, which he deleted in the above post of mine in a rather uncerimoniously way). This has been proven, both of them, to be true, and this completely makes him rather untrustworthy. And if you want to talk about trolls, Gaz, may I remind you that there's still the Gay Niggers Association of America.--ChrisDark 22:24, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The reference I cite is for sure not Dr. Chang's website, Dr. Chang's website is only the source where you can find the link to proven third party evidence. Dr. Chang is known as a web historian. It is one of his foremost goals to give evidence. Look up the weblinks too for third party evidence. One more thing: if you refer e. g. to a press article you have to scan this article, right? And for sure you show this scanned article on your website. How else should it work? Of course this article then is shown on your website but nevertheless <i>is proven third-party evdidence</i>. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 14:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Pygoya and myself founded the Webism Group of Worldwide Artists after our 1st real life European art tour in 2003. Of course we work together. We work together for global culture, peace and understanding. We have reached quite notable results as you surely found out. We are more than 50 worldwide artists, some of them at Wikipedia already. I put the article "Pygoya" to Wikipedia because he simply should be in with his 10 degrees, including 2 doctorates, honorary professor, NBC Real People Show, inclusion in Ripley's, Who's Who, his art on show around the globe in museums and galleries, etc. etc. He's also a digital art pioneer, ask <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Gartel_78cc.html" title="Laurence Gartel">Laurence Gartel</a> who's in Wikipedia. Everybody could have put him in with his acknowledged merits. So why not me. I just point to the facts. What about a broader audience for this entry so I do not need to give further explanations. To me it would be in no way understandable if you wouldn't let him in. And this not because we work together but because the facts speak its own language.<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 17:38, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. <s>Suspicious keep</s> This definitely seems to have started out as a vanity puff piece; and it still needs substantial cleanup to reach encyclopedic tone. It's pretty clear that Artingrid is closely associated IRL. And the number of anonymous votes here sure suggest sockpuppetry (poorly executed, since anon votes should/will not be counted here). However, there appears to be at least a claim of genuine notability in having displayed at a number of museums of worldwide reputation. Seems to get some mention in indexes of artists online, e.g. <a href="http://www.americanartists.org/art/artist_detail_321.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americanartists.org/art/artist_detail_321.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, <a href="http://www.artmajeur.com/pygoya/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.artmajeur.com/pygoya/" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, both of which appear to be independent sources rather than ones controlled by Chang or direct friends. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:53, 13 January 2006 (UTC) <i>Followup: Unless or until someone else provides verifiable links to the museum exhibitions claimed, I'll trust Jossi's below judgement about the non-verifiability of theses shows.

<dd>Well, Like I say, it's a pretty weak keep. But the several stated showings at known brick-and-morter museums and galleries seem to give Chang the nudge. Not to slam-dunk notability (a group show isn't <i>that</i> hard to get), but to the minimual standards I have in mind. But if his works really did appear at "Bronx Museum of Arts in New York (1987), Shanghai Art Museum (1988), Holter Museum of Art (1990), Tartu Art Museum in Estonia (1990), the Las Vegas Art Museum (1990), and the Vienna Museum Complex (2003)." that seems notable to me. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 22:07, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - If 10 degrees including 2 doctorates besides many other worthy proven achievements are regarded as not notable what else is notable! For sure Pygoya is a computer art pioneer and distributor on the internet. His art is logically developed from the classical board image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enormously risen prices for participation in art fairs and exhibitions is doubtlessly one aspect of Pygoya's efforts to establish art soleyly created by changing pixels to art. This way global culture and exchange is made possible for any artist around the globe at low cost. Press reports give evidence of high interest in digital art. Pygoya on his website presents a great resource of third-party confirmation of his achievements and activities. Digital art is a medium which without the internet wouldn't have come true. And it might be destiny that this is a fact also with Wikipedia. arno signarowski 13.01.2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 217.253.170.158 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.253.170.158_2d2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.253.170.158">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Rodney Chang "Pygoya" has been displaying his artwork on absolutearts.com since 2002. Pygoya has been a regular contributor to the absolutearts.com blog forum since 2004.

<dd>With all due respect to the above anons, obviously friends and/or associates of Mr. Chang, and non-withstanding the fact that Mr. Chang is an artist, please note that the criteria for notability of a person for their inclusion in Wikipedia is quite specific. Please read Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. Concerning absoluteart.com, that in itself is not a mark of notability, as there are hundreds of artists in this and many other art websites.

<p>So - if one of the largest, oldest online portals for fine art is not a creditable source to vouch for a computer artists notibility, who is? "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field". Rodney Chang "Pygoya" falls in this catagory, in my opinion. ALSO - I think you may find that he also could be considered as one who has "A large fan base, fan listing or 'cult' following".

<p>According to Wikipedia guidelines the admin who votes for deletion of an entry should not be the same who decides.

<dd>Fear no more ... as the nominator of the AfD, I will not close it. Another admin will. And BTW, I am as neutral as it can be... I never heard of Mr. Chang until a few days ago when came across this article while doing RC patrol (recent changes patrol against vandalism of Wikipedia). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a> 23:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, just for clarification of the above said: it gives a false impression. Of course unintentionally, right? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 00:23, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The admin who closes this AfD will be someone uninvolved with the voting. That's how these things are done. Some neutral admin will look through AfD votes that are a week or so old, count up the votes (including discounting anons or brand new accounts), and decide what action is appropriate. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 23:07, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Thank you both, Jossi and Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters for your explanations. I am totally sure that nobody who does research work on the internet as you surely do and moreover somebody who calls himself a digital artist who comes across digital artists and art sites all the time can "avoid" to know Dr. Rodney Chang (Pygoya) because he is everywhere on the web. There are also links to his website from the articles Jossi initiated at Wikipedia and carefully watches. Just some thoughts... I have many more...<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 00:23, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you accusing me of something? That is indeed preposterous. I have never heard of Mr Chang, Webism or Artingrid until a few days ago when someone added a long piece of material to this article and it lit up on my RC patrol console as possible giberish addition by an anon IP. Now, you can believe that or, not. That is your prerrogative, of course. In Wikipedia we ask contributors to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 01:15, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
