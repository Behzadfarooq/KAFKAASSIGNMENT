<p><br />
The Ghosts of Varner Creek is a paranormal mystery novel published in July of 2007. It was done by a new author named Michael Lee Weems. The story is narrated in the first person by a character named Sol who tells of his life in the small town of Varner Creek, Texas. Specifically, Sol lived his life believing his father murdered both his mother and sister, but when Sol dies as an old man, the book reflects back upon the past and he learns that there were secrets within his family he never knew in life and slowly reveals what really happened to his mother and sister. I got a chance to read it and was really surprised. The story builds up to a twist ending that was done really well and afterward you see the whole story completely differently. I'm normally pretty good at guessing the ending of a mystery novel, but this one got me. The story moves a little slow at first, but when you hit the ending you realize it's been one big buildup, and there's lots of little humor points and small dramas during the buildup that keep it entertaining. It's kind of a book about morality, spirituality, forgiveness, and consequence. The plot was good and the way the ending unfolds will really make you think.</p>

Ancrum Road Primary School, is located in Dundee, Scotland and was opened in 1876 as a single storey building. Sometime later, around the 1920's the school was later graced with another storey. The current building, located on Ancrum Road, is a listed building and still retains many of its original features.</p>
<p>The School is proud of its heritage and preserves, what is referred to as 'The Victorian Classroom', which houses desks, slates and even a dunces hat (which is perhaps for effect in the pictures on the pupils website!).</p>
<p>The School has a carpeted upper hall, which is used for assemblies and plays, and a lower, sports marked hall used for gym and Physical Education (PE).</p>
<p>Ancrum Road Primary School also encourages pupils to participate in sports, with the school football team winning many trophies in its time, with even the girls getting in on the action with the Girls Team playing in the Lynch Centre in 2006.</p>
<p>The pupils also run a 'fun run', a 1 mile run around the perimeter of Lochee Park, across the road from the School.</p>

The Mellomen were a popular singing quartet active from the late 1940s through the mid-1970s. The group was founded by <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurl_Ravenscroft_6f7d.html" title="Thurl Ravenscroft">Thurl Ravenscroft</a> and Max Smith in 1948. The Mellomen recorded under a variety of names, including Big John &amp; The Buzzards, The Crackerjacks, The Lee Brothers, and The Ravenscroft Quartet. They were sometimes credited as The Mellowmen, The Mello Men, or The Mellow Men. They sang backup to some of the best-known artists of the day, including <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosemary_Clooney_38f3.html" title="Rosemary Clooney">Rosemary Clooney</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Crosby_1db0.html" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Day_e56f.html" title="Doris Day">Doris Day</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlo_Guthrie_8856.html" title="Arlo Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_Laine_eb0c.html" title="Frankie Laine">Frankie Laine</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/g/Peggy_Lee_ce42.html" title="Peggy Lee">Peggy Lee</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/_/Jo_Stafford_3e48.html" title="Jo Stafford">Jo Stafford</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to backing up popular singers, their solo work is part of many Disney films such as <i><a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_in_Wonderland_%281951_film%29_089a.html" title="Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)">Alice in Wonderland</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_and_the_Tramp_afb2.html" title="Lady and the Tramp">Lady and the Tramp</a></i> as well as numerous animated shorts, including <i>Trick or Treat</i> (1952), <i>Pigs is Pigs</i> (1954), <i>Paul Bunyan</i> (1958), and <i>Noah's Ark</i> (1959). Their work for Disney also led to numerous television appearances, beginning with the <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_anthology_television_series.html" title="Disney anthology television series">Disneyland</a></i> television show episode <i>Cavalcade of Songs</i>, originally broadcast February 16, 1955. The Mellomen were also featured frequently on Disneyland Records, which released their 1958 album <i>Meet Me Down on Main Street</i>.</p>
<p>The quartet sang on several films with <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, beginning with <i><a href="../../../i/t/_/It_Happened_at_the_World%27s_Fair_59f9.html" title="It Happened at the World's Fair">It Happened at the World's Fair</a></i>. Elvis wanted the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordanaires.html" title="Jordanaires">Jordanaires</a> to perform for the film but they were unavailable, so The Mellomen were called in to sing <i>One Broken Heart For Sale</i> and <i>Cotton Candy Land</i>. The Mellomen later backed up Elvis on the title song for the film <i><a href="../../../r/o/u/Roustabout_%28film%29.html" title="Roustabout (film)">Roustabout</a></i> as well as on most of the sound track for <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise%2C_Hawaiian_Style_f948.html" title="Paradise, Hawaiian Style">Paradise, Hawaiian Style</a></i>. In 1969, The Mellomen appeared with Elvis in the film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Trouble_with_Girls_0314.html" title="The Trouble with Girls">The Trouble with Girls</a></i>, as a gospel group called The Bible Singers.</p>

The South Florida Bulls won their first bowl game in the program's brief history in style, sinking the East Carolina Pirates 24-7.</p>
<p>In a defensive battle where no points were scored in the second half, quarterback Matt Grothe led the Bulls (9-4) to victory despite leaving in the second quarter due to an injured knee. Grothe passed for 81 yards and a touchdown, a 37-yard toss to Amarri Jackson, before leaving the game and putting the responsibility on backup Pat Julmiste's shoulders. Julmiste easily kept going from where Grothe left off, passing for 49 yards on six completions. Also injured was ECU (7-6) quarterback James Pinkney, with whom backup Robert Kass combined with for 263 and a touchdown.</p>
<p>But the game's MVP didn't go to Grothe, Julmiste, or even Jackson, who led The Bulls in receiving yardage. The recipient was USF tailback Benjamin Williams, who ran for 67 yards and two first-quarter touchdowns, forming a lead which East Carolina never overcame.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the whole South Florida defense probably deserved the MVP award after they stepped it up a notch with Grothe gone, not allowing a single point once Julmiste came into the came, providing a cushion for the former Bulls starter.</p>
<p>For the Pirates, Dominique Lindsay rushed for 85 yards and Bobby Good caught five passes for 116 yards, but their efforts were outshined by a South Florida defense that forced three turnovers and had six sacks. It was the Pirates' eighth bowl appearance and the Bulls' second.</p>

<b>Shervin Sharifi</b> is one the most knowledgeable men of our time. We should thrive to know more about this magnificent creature. That’s why I am taking the first step in order to reveal just a small part of his life.</p>
<p>Shervin is about 6 feet tall with a masculine build. He does not believe in any sort of diet. His passion toward eating is unbelievable. He does not exercise much except when he is down.</p>
<p>He is the dead-end of kindness (maraam). He is a peace loving guy with great admiration for humanity. He always volunteers for fi-sabilellah type of jobs.</p>
<p>Shervin, currently is in a stage where he is fighting with his inner evil.</p>
<p>Stay tuned more to come …</p>

During these few months the police launched 36 related invetsigations including a full bloodied street battle where bullets were fired.</p>
<p>At this time the streets were under the control of the "bottomenders", gangmembers who resided in the lawkholome lane area which is in the bottom echeleon of Keighley lead by Showfield kingpin "Baldy". Their rivals the "topenders", gangmembers who reside in the top echeleon of Keighley lead by Highfield kingpin "Gilly".there were minor skirmishes between the gangs all year but it all exploded in the keighley Mela an asian festival held in bottom end territory Victoria Park. A group of bottomenders got involved in a fight which lead to the violent beating of Gilly and another associcate.</p>
<p>After the mela the topenders turned up the heat on their rivals carrying out several beatings and shootings in retaliation. In return the bottomenders ending up beating down a fellow bottomender as they believed he had set them up. On the sae night all hell broke loose on the streets of Lawkholme.</p>
<p>A heavily armed gang from nearby Bradford apparently backers of the topenders and whose leader known only as Chokey was a cousin of the bottomender beaten up by bottomenders. Several expensive cars such as Subarus showed up at night in parson street to take revenge for the earlier beating this lead to an almighty street brawl between a hundered young men on parson street which left bullets, boulders, glass, smashed cars and badly beaten, stabbed and shot gang members all over the area. The outcome wasn't pleasing for no side as both sides had casualties.</p>
<p>In the coming days the bottomenders beat many topenders and carved lucrative deals on the streets which meant they made a lot more dirty money than the topenders. This made various topend gangmembers switch sides and join ranks with the bottomenders who they saw as more powerful and as the people who were making money.</p>
<p>In 1 incident a former topender turned bottomender picked up an old topend aquaintance who had no idea of his switch and took him for a ride where he stopped at a bottomend base his passenger was pulled out and given a brutal beating which meant the victim spent several weeks in a coma and to this day has not fully recovered. The bottomenders carried out several beatings like this but one in particular was different.</p>
<p>A topender was beat up in a simlar way but this was one who had left the "gangster" ways and after the beating he did something which is seen as bad for your "street cred", he went to the police. Which led to a identity parade held at a Bradford Station.</p>
<p>3 bottomenders were made to attend but didn't take part. On their way back they stopped at a Heaton Petrol station, in the drivers seat was 16 year old Yasser Hussain. As he sat parked in the forecourt of the shell petrol station a car puled up at the passengers side and a man calmly fired 2 rounds from a sawn of shotgun, leaving 2 bullets in the head of Yasser Hussain. The 16 year old managed to drive a hundered yards before slumping dead at the wheel.</p>
<p>In coming weeks the police stepped up efforts to calm the situation but it failed his was just the start. In comin weeks gangmembers were shot at, chased, kidnapped, beaten and maimed. And soon things took a turn for the worse as gangmembers started thinking they were untouchables.</p>
<p>A former topender turned bottom ender Zubair Hussain took a ride up to his old hangout spots picked up a few fellow gangmembers and spotted Yasser Khan who wasn't known for gang acitivites but was in fact a law graduate. He was chasen through alleyways by Zubair Hussain and his associated and eventually caught where he was beaten down and then with a piece of Yorkshire slab had his head caved in this brutality cost him his life but this was a killing of someone who lived in top end territory by a bottom ender and this meant he had to be careful but as Zubair Hussain ran towards home after the Killing of Yasser Khan he was met with immediate retribuiton by a topender. Zubair Hussain was stabbed to death only minutes after putting Yasser Khan on his death bed. A man accused and later cleared of kiling Zubair was seen being driven away from the scene by a certain Qadir "kaddy" Ahmed. No one has been conviceted for any of the three killings.</p>
<p>After the murders many elder local people hoped that the killings would be a warning to gangmembers and they would put their weapons down to call a truce but they were wrong yet again.</p>
<p>On July 12 2001 feared bottom end leaders Monkey, Zulfi and Taff purchased a hammer and an axe each.</p>
<p>Other bottomenders under the command of Zulfi had bought 7 balaclavas and 4 pairs of golfing gloves.</p>
<p>Other gangmembers bought a shabby looking Volvo 840 and a Rover 820. The list of items showed that the bottomenders were playing this deadly game in its most deadly way. At 11pm on the 13th - the time Qadir "kaddy" Ahmed the man who drove away the man cleared of Zubair Hussain's killing usually finished playing football at the Keighley Leisure Centre which is situated in the heart of Bottom end territory and at the same place where the 1st beating of Topend leader Gilly had happened. Kaddy and an associate pulled on to the road driving on a busy route and the bottomenders began tailing him heavily armed. Before anything could be done Kaddys car was rammed of the road. Kaddy and his friend made a run for it his friend escaped but Kaddys wasn't as fortunate. After a 300 yard chase KAddy was caught and was murdered in devastating fashion. In just a few seconds his killers had caused 28 seperate wounds including the killer blow - an axe to the head.</p>
<p>The bottomenders headquarters was raided and found stashed were drungs, many weapons and hung on the wall was a poster of their idol, Al Capone who was an influence in the killing of kaddy as it happened on valentines day parallel to Capone's valentines day massacre.</p>
<p>This killing was different in another way as the killers were bought to justice by the police and what was first seen asa good sign for the town of Keighley things emerged differently. The killers of Kaddy were the leader and the backbone of the bottomenders most were given life sentances. Police had thought this was good news for the community but in reality it was only good news for the topenders who within a few years took full advantage.</p>
<p>For 5 or 6 years the situation was left to just few skirmishes between the gangs but nothing major as the bottomenders no longer had their leaders for intuition and to the ganeral fear some topenders had vanished when they were put behind bars.</p>
<p>Now in 2007 the streets are ruled "og kingpin" Gilly and his fellow topenders but ruunning on the streets are 2001's younger teenagers who aftera few years have stepped into the shoes of deceased gangmembers and incacerated gangmembers. As both gangs especially the bottomenders are now full of young hard-headed adults. The end of 2006 showed signs of 2001 and it has become more revealing in 2007.</p>
<p>Several incidents of bottomenders being hammered by top enders have occured which have resulted in bottomenders retaliating with bullets. The youngsters of Keighley see them selves as being failed by the police, schools and the government believing that not enough hs been done and learnt from 2001 to stop them from seeing Drug gealing as an only option to make money in the town as most graduates quikly move out of the town, keighley is being overrun again by gangmembers.</p>
<p>In between the 2 gang territories lies the "middle end" another poverty stricken area mainly home to asians, Showfield. Showfield (car road area)was once home to norious bottomend kingpin Baldy and like 2001 gangmembers from the showfield area have made an alliance with neighbouring bottomenders. Next to Showfield are 5 rows of houses home to mainly 4 families 1 which is split into another sector. 1 half of the split family have had many altercations with another family who have had a brutal feud with a 2nd of the 4 families but these families are seen as hard working and honest livers by most but still because of the society they live in do have their share of "beef". The 2nd half of the split family are protected by the much feared "Skellyz" from Bradford.</p>
<p>Al in all nothing has changed Keighley remains a place that you would expect to see in the "ghettoes of keighley" with communites becoming more and more segregated and the racist BNP campaigning for election on the towns council. The quality of life is still poor. Being a drug dealer is 1 of the most common jobs amongst Asian youth. No go areas have been created in Asian areas as the police fail to protect people of the locality.</p>
<p>Many have predicted a repeat of 2001 to come sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><b>Tales From The Legend</b><br />
Excalibah kick started the hip-hop show “Tales from the Legend” on London pirate station Juice 102.5fm in 1999. Before that, Excalibah had a brief stint on Destiny fm in South London. The radio show “Tales from the Legend” had a format that included Underground / Independent and British Hip-Hop and encompassed both MC'ing and DJ’ing with freestyles, mixes and of course Excalibah’s dry sense of humour. Excalibah presented TFTL for over six years and the show was nominated in the “Best Underground UK Hip-Hop Radio Presenter” category at the UK Hip-Hop Awards 2001 and 2002. In the last two years the show has been nominated as "Best Radio Show". At 18 Excalibah was the first signing to the BBC’s nationwide digital Black music station 1Xtra. During his time at the station he helped kick start the careers of many hip-hop artists in the UK: Estelle, Sway, Plan B, Dirty Diggers, Shameless, Swiss and Yungun to name a few. The show since joining 1Xtra was voted Best Hip-Hop Show in Undercover magazine for 2003, it also came 3rd in HHC for the same year. In 2004 and 2005 Excalibah won Best Radio Show and Best Radio Presenter in most of the top hip-hop press. Excalibah has also presented three shows and one documentary on BBC Radio One as well as filling in for other shows on 1Xtra, hip-hop or not. In August 2005 Excalibah left 1Xtra. See www.ukhh.com, www.hiphopgame.co.uk and www.rapnews.co.uk for the exclusive interviews on the reasons for his departure and the future of TFTL. Last February he presented a one off show on BBC 6 Music. Excalibah is now presenting a half hour slot every month on the Nationwide Galaxy Network alongside DJ Diggz.<br /></p>
<p><b>Releases</b> Excalibah has been producing for about six years now and as well as personal projects he has previously had his own production released on Ottomanelf Music (“£2” with vocals by Willo from the Colony), worked with Troy Scalpels (the National U.K. Hip-Hop Freestyle Champion 2001), Shameless and Out Da Ville and contributed a remix to the latest LP from the Colony alongside Ghost and Evil Ed. Excalibah has also been asked to contribute new music for the new Shameless EP, DJ Mentat's Remix LP, MC Trips solo projects and Dom G's solo album as well as putting together his own EP. Excalibah has compiled 5 previous mix CD’s, all commercially available. The first CD was released with the September 2001 issue of HHC (which rapidly sold out, and is now highly sought after), the second was the Big Dada compilation "Extra Yard" released Oct 21st 2002. Following the success of these Excalibah was asked to do another mix for HHC called "We Got Next" focusing on the new wave of UK artists. This came free with the August edition in 2004. In May 2004 Excalibah released his first official mix album through Dat Sound. "The Ex Files (Doc. 1)" was a landmark on Excalibah’s journey to expose and promote everything that really is Hip Hop. "The Ex Files (Doc 1)" garnered the respect of magazines such as Undercover and Touch (who voted it album of the month). Last year Excalibah released his second mix cd on the Dat Sound label “UK Dubstate the Mixtape” which features the cream of the UK’s Hip Hop scene; Sway, Plan B, Doc Brown, Lowkey, TaskForce, Lethal, Broke N English, C-Mone, Braintax, Kyza, Swiss and more all make an appearance dropping 100% exclusive rhymes on some of the biggest stateside beats. Excalibah has just released another free cd in conjunction with Alize and HHC.<br />
Publications During his career DJ Excalibah has appeared in numerous publications including; Hip-Hop Connection (front cover twice), Rago, Untold, Rewind, Variety (USA) The Voice, Mugshot (USA), The Sunday Times, Big Smoke, Undercover, Manchester Evening Post, The Guardian, MORE, 19, The New York Times and the international music publication Vibrations. Excalibah currently writes for HHC and Big Smoke. He has also had his own writing published in the Sunday Telegraph, Knowledge and IDJ.<br /></p>
<p><b>Excalibah Presents</b> 7 years ago DJ Excalibah set up the aforementioned entertainment company. The first event held was “Live from the Legend” at (the old) Deal Real Records, London on the 11th of November ‘99. It was essentially a showcase held every other month. The show was a combination of PA’s, Music and Freestyles. Excalibah himself has hosted these events as well as numerous guests such as General (Homegrown). The 4th event was part of the London Hip-Hop festival which took place during May 2000 and also included Choice FM’s 279 and Kiss FM’s Shortee Blitz (the Chubby Kids). More recently "Excalibah Presents" has moved into new territory, weird eclectic events in bars like The Pleasure Unit where Excalibah showcases the best in psychedelic beats and psychological entertainment (ala Derren Brown) at a night called "Mystic Rhythms". The most recent additions to ‘Excalibah Presents’ is ‘Tales from the Legend – Live Lounge’ (this is a monthly event showcasing up and coming talent in the UK) and the ‘Sunday Selection’ (an old skool Variety Night with modern performers).<br />
Musical Theatre As well as musically directing small workshops and projects with companies such as Cardboard Citizens and the NAYT, Excalibah has been involved with two Contemporary Musical Theatre productions with the Theatre Royal (Stratford East). Excalibah was Musical Director for both, the first of which took place early July 2000 called "Ask the Mayor". The director of this piece was Jonzi-D who you may know from the Apricot Jam sessions with DJ Pogo or Aeroplane Man (which Excalibah also starred in). The second was a much larger project called “Da Boyz…” Directed by jet setting designer/director Ultz, The project began in the summer of 2000 and hit the stage in 2003. “Da Boyz…” is a hip-hop interpretation of Roger and Harts “The Boys from Syracuse”. This was the first time in history that the rights to a Richard Rogers play had been given over for adaptation. “Da Boyz…” included an all-star cast with artists such as Rodney P, Mystro, Black Twang, Demolition Man and Kyza treading the boards. The play was quite possibly the first of its kind, combining all the elements of a concert with the narrative and plot of the original story. "Da Boyz..." was widely recognized as a groundbreaking play and received coverage in publications including The New York Times (USA), The Guardian, Variety (USA), BBC Radio 5 BBCLDN News and The Times. As well as currently being the youngest member on the board of directors at the Theatre Royal, in 2001 Excalibah completed the only course in the U.K that teaches musical direction and musical writing.

<p>The trio that is W.A.S.T.E. was formed early<a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> when Ivan Simeon and dorm-mate Ira Cordero started taking about making a different kind of hip-hop music. They added Rafael Eng from the band Junglebuko because he had the same interests. W.A.S.T.E. started out as all rappers, but then the decision to add instruments came when one of the fans said they were typical rap.</p>
<p>Ivan "Sez" Simeon took the role of <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">Drums</a> as he already had knowledge of the instrument, Rafael "Tudelu" Eng took the role of Bassist becuase that was the instrument he plays in Junglebuko, Ira Cordero "DJ Lan" or Like A Ninja then took lessons in turntablism from one of the most prestigous music center in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>.</p>
<p>After a few successful gigs, they decided to create thier own record label called Wasted and Trashed to release their new album called 99 W.A.S.T.E. to Fame.</p>
<p>W.A.S.T.E. or When Angered Skies Turn Electric is currently reworking thier first album adding 3 new tracks, making it 12 all in all.

<p>In 1937, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opel.html" title="Opel">Opel</a>, the German subsidiary of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_28d2.html" title="General Motors">General Motors</a>, introduced a new engine for its <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opel_Olympia_a8eb.html" title="Opel Olympia">Olympia</a> model. It was far more powerful than the engine used before. The old engine was a <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidevalve.html" title="Sidevalve">sidevalve</a> engine with a displacement of 1300 cc producing 26 hp, while the new engine had <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overhead_valve.html" title="Overhead valve">overhead valves</a>. With a displacement of 1500 cc, it produced 37 hp so the car could run at 112 km/h (70 mph).</p>
<p>The new engine was a very successful design so it was the standard Opel four cylinder engine for the next 25 years. It was used in all versions of the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opel_Olympia_a8eb.html" title="Opel Olympia">Opel Olympia</a>, the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opel_Rekord_c030.html" title="Opel Rekord">Opel Olympia Rekord</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opel_Rekord_c030.html" title="Opel Rekord">Opel Rekord</a> from 1937 to 1965. In this time, power grew from 37 hp initially to 55 hp in its final stage in 1963. Also, in 1959 a bigger version of the engine was added with a displacement of 1700 cc. This engine started at 55 hp and finally produced 67 hp.</p>

<p>Jorgensen's research interests are broad and include the calculation of free-energies in reactions usin quantum mechanical, molecular mechanical, in addition to Monte Carlo methods, the calculation of protein-ligand bindings affinities, all of which are relevent to both academic research and the pharmaceutical industry. Most simply put his research for the past 30 years has mostly been on the development of theoretical and computational methods in an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the structure and reactivity for organic and biomolecular systems. Another relevant research topic of his is in the development of improved NNRTI's, which are used for the treatment of HIV. Much more can be learned about his research at the <a href="http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/index.html" class="external text" title="http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/index.html" rel="nofollow">Jorgensen Research Group</a> webpage.</p>

<p>The word "sheepwalking" is derived from the word "sleepwalking" and is used to represent employees that are hired just to be obedient. They just do what their boss (and the company) tells them to do. They are not expected to think for themselves, or give input or feedback to their superiors. They are told to always order the month's supply of paper from a certain company, but even though the know it is overpriced and inferior, they do so anyway.</p>

<p>The Void is mentioned many times in "The Banned and the Banished" book series, by James Patterson. The main character of this series is Elena Morin'stal, a wit'ch gifted with blood magicks. The source of her powers is the elemental spirit Cho. Cho and her twin, Chi, live in the Void, and can only be contacted through the Blood Diary, a book with a spell cast on it that makes it a link to the Void when opened under the full moon. The Void has the appearance of outer space, but Elena comments that as she looks through the window in the Blood Diary to the Void, she sees strange, ice-ringed moons floating past clouds of gases and sparkling rainbows, and that it is like no sky she's ever seen in Alasea.</p>

Tim Baumann was born in Analingus, South Carolina to parents Gina and Ray in the year 1934. He lived in South Carolina until the age of twelve, when he set off to fulfill his life's dream of inventing a more practical lubricant for farm equipment. He first travelled with a family of travelling musicians to the town of Arotic, Iowa where he had read about a group of independent scientists who developed oils, petrolium based products, and various lubricants. He signed up to work for the company for very low pay as assistant to the mail clerk. Tim hoped to apprentice himself to one of the scientists in order to gain more knowledge in the field of lubricants. Tim found a very kind and helpful scientist, Peter Straasburg, who he befriended and learned from for over five years. Tim lived with Straasburg for the latter three of those five years, but in the end they had a falling out over the use of a lubricant they had developed together. After several weeks of development, Tim and Peter had created a lubricant that was both nontoxic and had the ability to allow for smooth movements while at the same time allowing machines to create the warmth of friction for increased efficiency of its moving parts. Straasburg and Tim both agreed that the product's cost was not worth the added efficiency it created, but they disagreed over whether or not to scrap the project entirely. Tim contended that while the product may not be benificial in manufacturing plants, its nontoxicity and creation of warmth would be perfect in assisting couples in intimate situations. Tim cited specifically to Staasburg the many nights they had spent together and the difficulty they had had and the blisters that were created. Straasberg demanded that those incidents not be spoken of and when Tim disagreed, Straasberg reacted violently, striking Tim across the face. Tim left in a rage, bringing the secret formula with him. Within the next year, Tim started his own company called 'Amazing Tim's Tantalizing Ultra Warming Anal Lubricant For Both Homo- and Heterosexual Intimacy, Co." Despite Tim's lack of business knowledge and the intitial monetary loss of his company, Tim's company was quickly bought up for $7M by the KY company. Tim now lives in San Marino, CA with his life partner and their three adopted Mulatto children.</p>
