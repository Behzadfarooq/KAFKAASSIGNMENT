<p>Despite my inclusionist tendencies, after much consideration I think submitting this article for AfD is the best route. This article is a clear essay in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. The uses of it sources amount to synthesis and (like most essays) is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Furthermore, the topic matter itself (and its POV issues) can be better addressed within the respective <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Wine_5b2e.html" title="French Wine">French Wine</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux_Wine_8edc.html" title="Bordeaux Wine">Bordeaux Wine</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization_of_wine.html" title="Globalization of wine">Globalization of wine</a> articles. After reviewing the article with other members of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINE_d58a.html" title="WP:WINE">Wikipedia Wine Project</a>, we have found little value worth salvaging and merging from this article that wouldn't already be tainted with POV or original research. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 20:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it is an essay, not an encyclopedia article. There's a fair bit of pure error and faulty logic, too. Admittedly, there is some potentially useful stuff in it. I don't think "chipping" in the sense used here is mentioned elsewhere in Wikipedia. <font face="Gill Sans"><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby"><font color="green">And</font></a><b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Dalby_2d43.html" title="User talk:Andrew Dalby">rew D</a></b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_Bibliography_d500.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby/Bibliography"><font color="green">alby</font></a></font> 21:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I know there are articles that do mention aging wine with Oak chips. They don't call it 'chipping' though. To be honest, other than this article, I don't know if I've ever heard the process called that before. --- <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethling_7cd1.html" title="User:Bethling"><font color="#BB45AA">The Bethling</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBethling_721d.html" title="User talk:Bethling"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 05:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> (with regrets).</s> <b>Move to new sub-page</b> Talk:French wine/Problems in the French wine industry for future reference, because parts are still useful. I found the lead section rather interesting, but the rest of it seemed like an essay written as a school assignment, with far too many irrelevant details. Definitely synthesis. The article <i>does</i> contain some useful and interesting information, which is why I'm not altogether happy about recommending deletion. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 23:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as essay-riffic. Could potentially form the basis of a new article e.g. History of wine-making in France which might be very interesting, but would require a lot of work. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 23:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

While this is a nicely researched opinion piece, it is an essay. Its contents still ought to be kept as potentially useful to other editors. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My concern with creating a sub page is that I don't think there is precedent for attaching essays to articles. Think of the sub page POV essays that could be written for the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> articles? An ideal situation would be to userfy the text, since it is an essay. But the user who created this page, didn't create the essay. Editors on the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux_Wine_8edc.html" title="Bordeaux Wine">Bordeaux Wine</a> page had concerns over the POV and Original Research issues and so it was removed as a splinter article. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bordeaux_wine&amp;diff=43500342&amp;oldid=43148165" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bordeaux_wine&amp;diff=43500342&amp;oldid=43148165" rel="nofollow">original author</a> seems to be <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyHouston_38bf.html" title="User:AshleyHouston">User:AshleyHouston</a> who has not edited since April 2006. I agree that there is some interesting tidbits but after looking at the sources and the POV overtones, I personally don't feel comfortable with using any of it in an encyclopedia article. I think the editors on the Wine Project can do a better job introduce the subject matter into the respective articles starting from scratch rather then starting from a POV essay. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 20:12, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If there is "no precedent for attaching essays to articles" (<i>There is no precedent for anything until it is done for the first time.</i> — <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._P._Herbert_bb3a.html" title="A. P. Herbert">A. P. Herbert</a>), then I would have to change my opinion to <b>keep</b> and <b>merge</b>, then. The mere presence of POV claims or original research in otherwise useful text is something to handle by editing, not by deleting. If I understand you correctly, this was broken out of an article on <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux_Wine_8edc.html" title="Bordeaux Wine">Bordeaux Wine</a>, then perhaps it ought to re-merge back into the article, where any original research or essayish wording could be edited out. Or, if the only concern is attaching a POV essay in <i>article</i> space, and the Wine Project has a page of its own, perhaps it could be moved out of article space and to a subpage of the <i>project</i> page. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 21:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've thought long and hard about this article, trying to see if there was anything worth salvaging. Unfortunately, to edit out the <i>original research or essayish wording</i> would leave you with nearly a blank page. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 09:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Agne, there is precedent for attaching essays to the <i>talk pages</i> of articles. I've seen it done. It would become a talk page archive. As a talk page archive, it's out of the main space, and anyone can still use the good bits. I doubt anyone would vote to keep the article where it is.</dd>
<dd>If you agree, then you as the nominator can withdraw this nomination, then go to the article and click on the "Move" tab to move it to a sub-page of a talk page; I suggest moving it under <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFrench_wine_c08e.html" title="Talk:French wine">Talk:French wine</a> per the comment of <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> above (the new article name would be Talk:French wine/Problems in the French wine industry). To withdraw the nom, just strike out the nomination (Using &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt;) and write "withdrawn" below it. I understand you can technically also close it yourself but I'm not sure how that's done. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 00:40, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't plan on withdrawing. Looking at the history of this patch of information, it has remained virtually unchanged since AshleyHouston left it. It is a personal essay-one person's opinion and synthesis. Its presence is simply "Wiki-publishing" of original research. If it has a place in Wikipedia, it is on a user's subpage. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 09:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My point was that there is no appropriate user subpage - unless someone volunteers. To the extent that some information in the article is useful, it belongs as a subpage archive to a related talk page. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 22:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Nom. This is an essay filled with OR.

<dd>Agreed. This is a non-encyclopedic essay entry. Aside from the poor sourcing, the synthesis is questionable at best. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonus_db9e.html" title="User:Simonus">Simonus</a> 19:13, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I created this page by moving the text out of 'Bordeaux wine'. Perhaps I should have just deleted it then. The text came from the 'French wine bashing' school of editors (French wine is rubbish, in terminal decline, we all want to drink Gallo...) whose influence has now mostly been removed from Wikipedia. The page breaks many of the wikipedia guidelines (especially OR, POV). Perhaps one or two bits of it could be extracted for use elsewhere. <a href="../../../p/o/u/User%7EPoujeaux_6f2b.html" title="User:Poujeaux">Poujeaux</a> 14:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: While the content is interesting (though the presentation cumbersome) I don't believe essays belong in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoulding_bdc0.html" title="User:Smoulding">Steve.Moulding</a> 21:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b>: find another wiki to put it in, it is a nice essay, but does not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 01:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
