Second, as it is now, this is not a worthwhile article and relies on contemporary critiques by bloggers for a significant portion of its content. I agree that there is room for criticism articles, but simply because one could exist (or one exists in a NPOV) doesn't mean that we should keep it.

<li><i>Comment</i>. Just out of curiosity, if votes are "keep" and "cleanup", how does that work. What if there isn't a cleanup? Even a cursory examination of this article suggests "clean up" would be a massive undertaking. What's more, a good clean up would seem to require significant duplication of the material that exists already within <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_controversies_2d65.html" title="BBC controversies">BBC controversies</a>. If this isn't what's meant by "cleanup", then it seems to otherwise be a collection of uotes about the "badness" of the BBC. Quotes standing alone aren't very encyclopedic. <span style="color:#996">mmm</span><span style="color:#963">beer</span><sup><a href="../../../m/m/m/User_talk%7EMmmbeer_edf0.html" title="User talk:Mmmbeer">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mmmbeer_1cdb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mmmbeer">C</a> / <a href="../../../m/m/m/User%7EMmmbeer_c9c3.html" title="User:Mmmbeer">?</a></sup> 19:44, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Is that really how it works? Or is that just a hope for how it works? Has this ever happened successfully this way? If so, I'd be willing to change my vote.

<li><b>Essetial delete</b> POV fork. There is next to no chance that if we allow articles of this sort of they will achieve neutrality. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhollenton_c06a.html" title="User:Rhollenton">Rhollenton</a> 00:28, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There is no consensus that "Criticism of X" articles are automatically POV forks, as some editors here have alleged. They of course <i>can be</i>, but it is no more inherently POV to write about criticisms of a particular person, place or thing than it is to write about any other aspect of that person, place or thing. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:12, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Presenting a discussion of a subject in such a way as to only include the negative views of it is non-neutral. The NPOV policy requires that Wikipedia not present debates in ways that implicitly advocate specific sides. Articles should be neutral in scope. The fact that almost all of our "Criticism of X" articles have sported chronic neutrality disputes should be evidence enough of the fact that that isn't the case for articles that are formulated with "this article contains only negative views" scopes. Ironically, in this particular case, we <i>already have</i> proper neutral-scope articles, pre-dating this article by the larger part of a year. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:17, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Presenting a discussion of a subject in such a way as to only include the negative views of it is non-neutral." Well, then, there's no problem, because that is not in any way, shape or form inherent in an article titled "Criticism of X". It is certainly <i>possible</i> to cover the subject of "Criticism of X" one-sidedly, but then that is also possible for the subject "X" to begin with. How many times does it have to be said? If an article covers a subject from only one point of view, <i>that</i> is the problem, not the fact that the subject is "Criticism of X". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:11, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i>. Feldspar, your analysis is clearly wrong. "Criticism" does suggest only one side of the issue. Nothing about that asks for the opposite, let's just call them "glowing reviews". By having a criticisms, especially in this case, you're asking for only those things that criticise the BBC's overage. I can't even imagine how that would constitute NPOV as it totally avoids the other side. Besides, is there a single topic that doesn't have its critics? On the other hand, "BBC controversies" sort of asks for the controvery to be explained; it BEGS for both sides. In addition, most of the legal topics I could do could also have an entire article devoted to legal criticisms, but I don't think that anyone would advocate such a thing. That's not to say, of course, that there isn't room for them, but rather there's no point and needlessly POV and lopsided. <span style="color:#996">mmm</span><span style="color:#963">beer</span><sup><a href="../../../m/m/m/User_talk%7EMmmbeer_edf0.html" title="User talk:Mmmbeer">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mmmbeer_1cdb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mmmbeer">C</a> / <a href="../../../m/m/m/User%7EMmmbeer_c9c3.html" title="User:Mmmbeer">?</a></sup> 16:14, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No valid reason for deletion has been put forward. POV is a reason to put a tag on the article asking for help in cleaning it up, not a reason to delete. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 01:22, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. We have plenty of "criticism of ..." articles (which to me are justified as a way to keep articles shorter more than anything else), and there's plenty on the BBC from all ends of the political spectrum. If "The original author hasn't touched it for months," I submit that the appropriate remedy for that is leaving a message on his/her Talk page, or (God forbid) working on it yourself, rather than a deletion vote. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 16:46, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Addendum</b> and <b>suggestion</b>: The "criticism" article should be about <i>general</i> themes in BBC criticism (like the license fee), whereas the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_controversies_2d65.html" title="BBC controversies">BBC controversies</a> article should be redone as a list to encourage the creation of separate articles about the individual incidents where warranted. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 16:52, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
