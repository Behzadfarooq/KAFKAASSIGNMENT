<li><b>Keep</b>, on a rather unique basis. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> is one of the cornerstones of Wikipedia, but also one of the most controversial and hardest to fulfill; it causes most of our really serious conflicts. Wikinfo is the best known attempt to try an alternate approach, "sympathetic point of view", and see if it can be equally useful to the public while easier to fulfill by the editors. Anyone who doesn't think NPOV can ever really be achieved is welcome to try to do a better job there. It's in every way a Wikipedia-friendly project, run by one of the longest serving members of our <a href="../../../a/r/b/WP%7EARBCOM_80fd.html" title="WP:ARBCOM">WP:ARBCOM</a>. Also note the fact that it was nominated by a twice-voting sockpupeteer, who may have his own reasons to want to get back at the arbcom. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 12:55, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transfer to Wikipediaspace</b> the nomination seems to be in bad faith, but there aren't actually any reliable sources for this that I could find, making it basically the same as a self-reference. It's a glimpse into the <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sausage_factory.html" title="Sausage factory">sausage factory</a>, and especially when this is the case it absolutely needs to follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requirements.

<li><b>Keep.</b> The fact that a Wikipedia article doesn't agree with policy isn't grounds for deleting it, but for improving it.

<li><b>Reply</b> I would say that a lack of sources is the most important grounds for deleting an article. I had a look around, incidentally, and could not find any externally reliable sources, so I don't think improvement to bring it in line with policy is possible.

<li>Another note, while I realise it may make things a bit harder for those that comment, if all of them were put up as a single item, the closing admin would really have his or her hands full closing it should the consensus be delete... there are a fair number of inbound links to clean, and by having each one separate, the work can be divided.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I guess I have to go against the flow here. A list such as this, <i>if the article is expanded</i>, offers a greater value than simply adding articles to a category for the following reasons: 1) Adding the redlinks is a nice engraved invitation to "add content". You can't do that with categories unless you just create a bunch of stub articles but it's not quite as inviting because you have to open each one to see if it's a stub. 2) These articles don't (yet) do it, but the list could include a simple elaboration giving more information than just the article title, such as "Mall 1- Alaska's largest mall, in Anchorage", "Mall 2- Some notable information about this mall, in Juneau" (sorry, I'm a pretty anti-mall person, so I'm not the best person to illustrate the potentials here, but I hope I'm making my point). Overall, I think the articles have <i>potential</i> as navigation and indexing tools, but that potential is yet to be demonstrated. I don't think it's a reason to delete. I don't find it much different from the articles I spend much more of my own time on, which involve the taxonomy of fish. A majority of the higher-level taxa articles (genus and above) end up merely being a list of sub-taxa, although in time, someone (like me) will eventually come along and add some really good information to those besides the list itself (just a random example: <a href="../../../s/u/c/Sucker_catfish.html" title="Sucker catfish">Sucker catfish</a>). This opinion applies to all the similar articles nominated below, but I won't copy and paste it down there yet until I see what other people have to say about what I've said here. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeil916_fb6c.html" title="User:Neil916">Neil916</a> 23:57, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Elonka Dunin is a Wikipedian who has gotten a friend to write an article about her and then edited it extensively. Working as a game developer does not make her notable, being mentioned in a few magazines does not make her notable. Being an amateur cryptographer (or amateur anything for that matter) does not make her notable. Working for a company that won an award for its product does not make her notable. Being thanked in a book does not make her notable. This is simply a case of someone abusing Wikipedia to gain publicity for themselves. There is way too much of that going on these days. Also note that a previous VfD was never closed. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 01:31, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not sure why the first AfD wasn't closed... to my eye, it looks like a <b>no consensus</b> close, the arguments advanced are not clearly one way or the other. I looked long and hard at this article. I don't like to see vanity articles here. But I'm not convinced this article isn't about a notable person. The number of different publications cited, the published authorhood, the number of hits, the tie to <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryptos.html" title="Kryptos">Kryptos</a> all seem to confer some notability. None is enough in my view all by itself, but together they seem to add up to just barely notable enough. <b>Keep</b> (with regret because I don't like to go against Danny, he's pretty sage). ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:15, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, not bad faith at all. This simply made me aware of the fact that there was an article about you. Whether it is in that article, your user page, or your talk page, you are using Wikipedia for self-promotion, and that is simply unacceptable. I sepnd many long hours every day on the phone at the Wikimedia office, dealing with people who insist that we include articles about them because they are "notable." I get it from wannabe actors, pizza parlors, inventors, bloggers, you name it. The same efforts to prove notability, the same complaints, the same personal attacks (and I see that comment as a personal attack). Sorry, but there are guidelines. Those guidelines may have been bent out of shape by process over the past year or so, but there are guidelines nonetheless. WP:AUTO is a guideline that was violated by the incredible amount of vapid information posted to this article, and by the fact that in the talk page Elonka goes on an on about where to find even more information about her. For everyone reading this I ask: Will we have an article for every person involved in the creation of video games--they are massive productions? Will we have every person involved in the creation of a film? Just look at the roller for any film to understand what this will entail. Where are the limits where we say "No, this is not worthy of inclusion. This is barely verifiable." Wikipedia is, and will remain to be, an encyclopedia, not a directory for anyone looking for attention. The fact that we are online must not be turned into a means of boosting someone's own website or ego. This is nothing more than spamming. Stating "Strong Keep" about one's self is nothing more than spamming either, and very tasteless spamming at that. oh, and I wonder whether Elonka is contacting other encyclopedias and reference works to ensure that she is included in future editions. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 14:50, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm getting confused with all the different versions. Are we now determining WHICH version is notable enough? Can't we work on the broader question of whether Elonka Dunin is notable enough to warrant an entry about her, and THEN wrestle with the specifics of format and content as one normally does with any Wikipedia entry?

<p><b>Wikipedia is not a Soapbox</b>:</p>
<p><br />
Wikipedia is not a soapbox or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:</p>
<p>1. <i>Propaganda or advocacy of any kind</i>. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a "sympathetic point of view" for every article. Wikipedia was not made for opinion, it was made for fact.</p>
<p>2. <i>Self-promotion</i>. You are free to write about yourself or projects you have a strong personal involvement in. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Vanity, and</p>
<p>3. <i>Advertising</i>. Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" or local companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for guidelines on corporate notability. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfacets_25b2.html" title="User:Sfacets">Sfacets</a> 01:20, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Dear Wikians</b>: Whatever you say, it is your world, though I do suggest investigating before shooting from the hip. You may be missing innovations happening under your nose. Yes, you have rules for all of this, but when you do not prudently investigate, you are driving this service toward contentious irrelevance. Wiki has been called a "fools paradise," and it is easy to see why. There is no new knowledge here, and perhaps never intended -- like the dusty old encyclopedia we have on the shelf here. Even this year's update is out of date. I am wishing you all the best on your quest for truth. Please remember, the guru (all knowledge) is in you, alive in this moment. Revealing it in efficient ways is the whole issue, at least as far as yoga is concerned. That is 35 years of hard-won experience speaking to you. <a href="../../../y/o/g/User%7EYogani_e927.html" title="User:Yogani">Yogani</a> 10:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks to Hanuman Das, I am learning. See my talk page for details. Apologies for the lecture, but you must admit you all have not been very helpful so far, acting more like gunslingers at a penny arcade than editors. The only purpose of AYP is to bring powerful easy-to-use yoga practices into the public domain (for free), and it seems there can be some overlap between that objective and Wiki. In fact, very little exists on Wiki on the particulars of individual yoga practices, and many new verifiable articles in this area are needed. Hanuman agrees. In any case, I understand what you are doing better now and will do my best to help out.</li>

<dd>I am a bit taken aback by the multiple statements above that there are no assertion of notability, and thus this is amenable to (and is currently tagged for) speedy delete. Is there some consensus on how specific assertions of notability must be to qualify?</dd>

<dd>Quoting from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_of_vanity_articles_63d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles">Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles</a> which is specifically incorporated by reference in the text accompanying A7 at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> "Only those articles where there is no remotely plausible assertion of notability should be considered for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletion_1a12.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Speedy deletion</a>." I think the following are assertions of notability, and are patently "remotely plausible" assertions of notability:
<dl>
<dd><i>"a revolutionary educationalist, who changed the way many people think about technology...best known for his views and idea...He's been credited and cited in many informational essays...</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Can you imagine a professor who is a revolutionary educationalist, very infuential in his field, cited and credited in many scholarly articles; someone who would meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> in spades, having this same article text written about him? I can. If that theoretical article was brought to afd, minor investigation would reveal that the same "assertions of notability" in this article, though vague and not very specific but nevertheless present, were true. We might have a call for speedy keep and expand. Here a little investigation shows that the professor is <i>not</i> notable enough for inclusion by our notability standards (I checked google and google scholar and found nothing) But do the <i>assertions of notability</i> themselves need to meet WP:BIO? I think not. Rather, the assertion of notability render the article unsuitable for speedy deletion, which is why we debate the merits more rigorously here. Please disabuse me of these notions. Until then I think speedy deletion of this article is out of process.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would also note that speedy deletion does not serve us well once we have already each taken the time to visit this deletion debate. If the article is deleted, and then recreated with a bit more text, it can be tagged with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}}. If it's speedily deleted, that tag is not proper because speedy deletion is by its terms not a deletion on the merits.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 20:53, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For me, the difference between a speedy candidate and an "assertion of notability" is all about specificness. "<i>Joe Schmoe is an awesome guy and everyone at school thinks he's great</i>" is not an assertation of notability for the purposes of A7 speedies. "<i>Joe Schmoe was awarded the Awesomeness Award in 1997 and 1999 by the International Awesomeness Society, and was named in Awesomeness Today magazine in August 2000 as Awesome Person of the Year</i>" is an assertation of notability, which would then be verified and weighed in AfD. Specific vs unspecific is what makes the difference. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 23:25, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I stated when someone tried to {prod} it, the reason it is separate is to keep the main article from getting longer and being defocused. It’s appropriate to mention there, but its not appropriate to try and put all of the content from the stub I made into the main article. Its not duplicate content – it is two separate articles where each covers a different aspect of a very general and expansive subject. The OnStar article is about how OnStar works and this stub is about someone’s site that points out flaws. If you all want to delete it, I dont care. I think its valueable information to the main article and I stand behind its creation. --<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShortfuse_4fcc.html" title="User:Shortfuse">Shortfuse</a> 04:33, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> while I appreciate the apparent insight, I think documentation of Jurvetson's notability in the article is more important than making the argument in the afd. I am especially annoyed with the comment he's looking for investments, which makes the article sound like an RFP, or advertisement. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 12:35, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>'an extremely well known businessman' is quite a statement, don't you think? That makes me think of Larry Ellison, Sandy Weill, Henry Paulson or Dean Kaman, not 'Steve Jurvetson'.

<dd>You said 'well known'. Well known is different that notable.

<dd>I find Jurvetson neither "amazing" or "brilliant". I was simply saying that I disagree with the idea that he is "not well-known in any way, shape or form". There is no need to be snarky. My point was, within the realm of business, he is rather well known. And it was 53 pages - not 53 single people. <a href="../../../e/x/r/User%7EExRat_dd16.html" title="User:ExRat">ExRat</a> 00:04, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your response. I understand what you are saying, but still disagree. Jurvetson has not merely been on two-bit magazines. He was recently honored as "The Valley's Sharpest VC" on the cover of <i><a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_2.0.html" title="Business 2.0">Business 2.0</a></i> and chosen by the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Examiner_bcd8.html" title="San Francisco Examiner">San Francisco Examiner</a></i> as one of "the ten people expected to have the greatest impact on the Bay Area in the early part of the 21st Century." He was profiled in the <i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USAToday_f82e.html" title="USAToday">USAToday</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_Magazine_0887.html" title="New York Times Magazine">New York Times Magazine</a></i> and featured on the cover of <i>Worth Magazine</i> and <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_Magazine_6069.html" title="Fortune Magazine">Fortune Magazine</a></i>s.

I don't doubt you but just want to see where I'd find this information in the future. --Headtale 05:16, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. An internal award within a university faculty most likely "is not suitable for Wikipedia" because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Furthermore, if the creator of this article is associated with the faculty which gives this award (as a student, professor or alumnus/alumna), the article might be a <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> page as well. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:42, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand the reasons people want to delete this article to a point but am curious how Wikipedia can claim to be the "sum of all knowledge" when everyone wants to delete an article about something that has legitimate purpose (or at least, as legitimate as stub articles about small villages in England that have less inhabitants than this award has had nominees over its existence or one line articles about reality TV show contestants. Something's out of whack here to me - am I off-base completely? --Headtale 07:57, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article was created by concensus after much work of the Wiki community. You even agree that it belongs on the Peel Region page. It is an important issue in its own right and other wikipages such Mississauga and Caledon can link to this page to cross reference issues relevant to them. Also as other Reegions such as Waterloo and Niagara start getting into similar controversy because of the ingrained Regional Structure in Ontario it may become necessary to refer to what's happening in Peel Region on their pages sicne that will certainly happen in some, if not all, of the other Regions at some point in their evolution as Urban Areas and the need of Cities to go Single-Tier in these other areas.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiWoo_a9f6.html" title="User:WikiWoo">WikiWoo</a> 05:20, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There's plenty of "non-notable" schools at WP, of which this is probably one of them. Either a lot more should be deleted or this one should stay.

<li><b>Keep</b> not a single, verifiable high school has been deleted in the past 2 years of precedent-setting consensus.

<li>It wasn't overturned; the article was re-created within the provisions of the close, an act which had my full and vocal support. Did you actually read the deletion review? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 18:32, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Obviously, the article in question was re-created following the AfD. The point of my statment above is not dealing with the technicalities of whether or not an article has been deleted, but whether or not the AfD process resulted in an article being expunged from WP. In the case cited, the article was effectively cleaned up as a result of what occurred at AfD and DRV, it wasn't deleted. This has happened before where admins have improperly closed school articles as delete (even in one case where there wasn't even a single delete vote) and the article was revived at DRV.

<dd>I singled out Massachusetts because of how they have structured the 2006 article on the general elections. By contrast, North Carolina has no article for the 2006 general elections, so for the same issue in NC, I would have suggested merging the information into an article on the lines of <i>North Carolina House District 42, 2006 election</i>. As a matter of feasability, I figured it is easier to keep the current structure for Mass. than to redo <b>all</b> the articles for challengers in <b>all</b> races in the state. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 04:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given that Encyclopædia Dramatica has been successfully AFD'ed, I think it would be worthwhile to review the original <b>KEEP</b> decision in the case of this page.

<li><s><b>Withdrawing nomination</b></s> - well, given the fact that it has been slashdotted, and ED hasn't, I think that could serve as a good reason to exclude ED and include Uncyclopedia.

<li>I hardly think being on Slashdot establishes notability. The Register may be a better source, but I don't knw. As far as a deletion review for ED, I'm pretty sure it's already happening. And just a note, I am not arguing for or against Uncyclopedia, just as I avoided the ED deletion mess. I'm just saying, I don't think being on Slashdot = automatic inclusion criterium.

<li>Although I opposed ED deletion, I'm not going to fight it any further -- I really don't care that much about (if someone else wants to DR it, that's their problem). However, I do care about consistency -- if ED is to be excluded, yet somewhat similar Wikipedia-offshoot sites included, then we need to come up with a good reason to include one and exclude the other. I agree that Slashdotting is not the best criteria -- but its better than none, and its not too bad a criteria. "uncyclopedia site:slashdot.org" ~ 568 ghits; "encyclopediadramatica site:slashdot.org" - 319 ghits. So both have been "slashdotted" -- albeit not in the sense of having a main article about them. 568 is bigger than 319, but I don't think its an order of magnitude difference. And note that neither has (as far as I am aware) been "slashdotted" in the sense of being featured on slashdot as an article; they've just been mentioned in the discussions.

In any case, the main difference would appear to be that Uncyclopedia is not just one single wiki; it's a community of related projects hosted as twenty-two individual language wikis across multiple sites in the US, Canada and Europe. There are currently six Uncyclopedia projects which are above a thousand pages each.

<li><b>Delete</b> When I re-wrote the ED article I used this article as a template specifically because it survived AfD. ED is/was more relevant, had more users, higher Alexa ranking, etc, when it was re-written. On AfD after the re-write, it was decided <i>both</i> articles should be kept.

As I've mentioned to Mr. Dlyons 493, I'm new to this Wiki business and I thought one could actually be allowed to begin an article before it's excoriated for lacking all the things I'm attempting to put into the article in the first place--including refs! What is significance in mail art? I ask. How does one prove that? Mr. Summers has been working in all of these fields--including mail art--since 1973 and I believe you're too quick on the draw, Mr. Dylons 493. Didn't I read someplace that it was common courtesy to notify a writer before one deletes text? Or did I just imagine that? White flag up here and please let me write this article before you delete it. Thanks, Jesse</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>- Consider the clock ticking. The stub, as it stands, does not meet WP standards as noted, but I'm willing to wait a couple of days to see how it improves. I think the tags on the article give plenty of explanation as to what needs to be done. I will further refer you to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article just got placed. Before nominating for deletion, at least give the article a chance for improvement, and to have the tags addressed. Without spending a lot time looking, it does appear that the artist may be notable enough for an article. But I'll reiterate, give the article a chance for improvement. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 15:08, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Sources are cited, the guy has been featured on CNN. He's notable enough under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and satisfies <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> -First, thanks to Mr. Diyons for his help in working with this text, and to both of the positive voters here. Next, some plans: I want to mark the Summers article clearly as a stub today, and to continue to add to the text. I'm trying to provide some context for Summers' art activities with my ref. to "first wave, second wave" intermedia artists and will try to expand on this. If you could please remove the screaming deletion notice, which is literally a dark cloud under which I must work--but keep the discussion--I'd really appreciate lessening the psychological tension here. This is a heck of a lot of work to do "under the gun" as it were! Your cooperation ferevently asked for. This article deserves to exist. Thanks! Jesse</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>-Thank you so very much! We'll continue to work at it. Jesse</li>

<p>Procedural nomination of article that I deprodded as not obviously non-notable but perhaps difficult to verify, at least in English. This is a supposedly major South Indian businessman who lived from 1919 to 1990. Article is POV and needs a cleanup and references if it is kept.</p>
<p>The article was prodded by <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">User:Eluchil404</a> with the argument that the subject was a <i>"Business man who does not clearly meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> reads like an obituary but wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a memorial</a>"</i>. Nevertheless there is enough claims to notability here that I think this should be brought to AFD: <i>"top business tycoon in the Seventies, with interest in Hotels, Hospitals, Tile Industries, Retail and Wholesale Textiles, Hardwares, Pharmacies, Real estate, Liqour etc."</i></p>
<p>Keep in mind that he died before the internet era and lived in a part of India that is probably not as well-connected as other parts of the world, and that googling and other searches may need to be done in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> or other languages of the region. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 09:02, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> As a talk show phenomenon, we have to discount the host and station as non-independent sources. The WSJ article mentions the organization, but they are not the subject of the article. Insufficient evidence of notability. In fact, with Wikipedia excluded from the google search there are 9 unique hits of about 30. This is about as close to unheard of as you can get. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>: With roughly three decades on the air, including two years in national syndication, the Church of the Holy Donut has long since established its notability.

<li><b>comment</b>: Among the significant contributions made by Holy Donut congregants has been their many gifts to the annual <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> food can drive for St. Anthony's Dining Hall. One year, when Ward's contract had not been renewed by <a href="../../../k/g/o/KGO_%28AM%29_ff2c.html" title="KGO (AM)">KGO (AM)</a>, the station was literally inundated with thousands upon thousands of cans; that clear show of support by congregants for one of the many causes advocated by Ward and the Holy Donuts had a direct impact on KGO's ultimate decision to continue broadcasting his talk show. With regard to the thousands who have claimed their membership on air by accepting an individual congregant number, surely KGO and its listeners would have raised hue and cry if the numbers were massaged in any way. Indeed, the numbers assigned to congregants represent a not-too-subtle poke at the sort of accounting deceptions and numbers manipulation that have contributed to the increasingly common phenomenon that statistics can be, and often are, misused, i.e. the "71 ghits" premise used above to misrepresent a subject that predates the Internet. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 21:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not entirely convinced that this term is in wide use and when it is used, that it is only because of the group listed in this article. The sources provided on the talk page include testimonials from Senators and Representatives (who will support anything generally) and documentary series. The series is funded by the FoR ENC group <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:vOD_J_W3jdEJ:www.venture-east.com/press/2004/5-28.htm+%22cruising+carolina%22+%22inner+banks%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;strip=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:vOD_J_W3jdEJ:www.venture-east.com/press/2004/5-28.htm+%22cruising+carolina%22+%22inner+banks%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;strip=1" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> (sorry its a cache) as well as the other documentary listed <a href="http://www.forenc.com/news/2006/1-4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forenc.com/news/2006/1-4.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

The user and an anonymous IP who appears to be the same person added "____ is located in North Carolina's <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Banks_9160.html" title="Inner Banks">Inner Banks</a> region" to many North Carolina articles, effectively spamming the article and term.

<li>Eh, I think this article should stay, but needs some cleanup and neutrality. It sounds like an advertisement. (I'll put tags to show as such) I personally have never heard of the Inner Banks, but I don't live on the coast; I'm in the Piedmont. I think it's a great term that should be used more often to refer to cities somewhat near the coast like Jacksonville and Lumberton. I wouldn't consider Fayetteville a part of it though... it seems too far west. According to this article, the term "inner banks" and the "outer banks" are just subdivisions of the Coastal Plain region of North Carolina, similar to how the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont_Triad_1bc2.html" title="Piedmont Triad">Piedmont Triad</a>, the Foothills, and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_Triangle_0b1f.html" title="Research Triangle">the Triangle</a> split up the Piedmont region. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooday.1_70f1.html" title="User:Gooday.1">TinMan</a> 03:10, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This project is actually funded by the <a href="http://www.goldenleaf.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.goldenleaf.org/" rel="nofollow">Golden LEAF</a> Foundation, which in turn is funded by the North Carolina tobacco settlement. FoR ENC is a non-profit, and does not benefit from "advertising" this brand. FoR ENC owns the trademark to ensure the brand is not misused. As far as "'Becoming a popular destination' --according to who?", the Inner banks has been featured in the Boston Globe, Business North Carolina Magazine, Impressions Magazine, as well as several newspapers (just look at <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/1233/" class="external text" title="http://www.newsobserver.com/1233/" rel="nofollow">News &amp; Observer summer series on the Inner Banks</a> to see many articles on the impact that development and tourism is having on the Inner Banks, they are doing an entire summer series on this issue because of the fact that it is becoming such a popular destination). As for "I wouldn't consider Fayetteville a part of it though", the Inner Banks refers to the many rivers and intracoastal waterways of eastern North Carolina, Fayetteville is on the Cape Fear River and has worked with FoR ENC to have an article placed in the IBX Newsletter that features Fayetteville <a href="http://www.venture-east.com/projects/IBXNewsletter.cfm/" class="external text" title="http://www.venture-east.com/projects/IBXNewsletter.cfm/" rel="nofollow">IBX Newsletter Winter 2005</a>. Fayetteville sent the article (page 2 of the Winter Issue for 2005) to FoR ENC because they want to be a part of IBX (by they I am referring to Fayettevilles Travel &amp; Tourism department). What I don't understand, maybe someone can explain it, is how this article can be viewed as advertising when Wikipedia has articles on the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_Banks_c310.html" title="Outer Banks">Outer Banks</a>, the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont_Triad_1bc2.html" title="Piedmont Triad">Piedmont Triad</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Triangle_3d06.html" title="The Triangle">the Triangle</a> when they are all nothing mor<b>Bold text</b>e than regional "brands" serving the travel and tourism sectors. I suppose the Inner Banks should be relegated to a blank hole on the map... I suppose the region is underserving of a "brand" since it is the home to many poor and minority people? I have provided more than enough outside sources to prove that this term is in use throughout the region and shown that it has been used outside of the region as well. --<a href="../../../k/m/i/User%7EKmills_ea55.html" title="User:Kmills">Kevin R Mills</a> 12:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, now that the trademark symbol and logo picture have been removed. I also did some searches on Google and it seems to be a term that is used with the approximate meaning the article gives (I'm not certain about the area covered, as I did not do an exhaustive search on it). Also, the usages were not associated with the foundation. It would be nice if the article had additional references, though. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:19, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Must stay</b>, this is what it is - the <i>inner banks</i>&#160;!</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Speaking as a North Carolinian, I can say with certaintly that there's is no such place as the "Inner Banks." It is a marketing concept invented fairly recently to lure tourists and retirees. I suspect that if you polled North Carolinians most wouldn't know what you're talking about. The term appears nowhere in any of the standard N.C. history or geography books or in the <i>N.C. Gazeteer</i>. Neither does it make any sense in geologically. It's ironic that Mr. Mills cites the recent stories in the Raleigh <i>News &amp; Observer</i> as evidence of the popularity and existence of this mythical place since those stories deal primarily with the social and environmental consequences that rapid development is having on rural waterfront communities in Eastern North Carolina. -- gen. ludd 08/02/06</li>

<p>These pages should probably be deleted. They are essentially copies of policy/regulations relating to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Nabad_ad16.html" title="Al Nabad">Al Nabad</a> (which itself seems like POV and advertising in my opinion). I thought of nominating these articles to be merged into the Al Nabad article, but their content is unencyclopedic. Transwiki'ing crossed my mind as well, but this material may be copyrighted and I don't know much about that sort of thing. I think these three articles should be deleted and minimal content from them mentioned in the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Nabad_ad16.html" title="Al Nabad">Al Nabad</a> article if possible and useful. Of course, I'm hoping more experienced editors can weigh in on the matter and come up with the proper solution. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BigNate37_2704.html" title="Special:Contributions/BigNate37">C</a></sub> 10:19, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's a category, not a list. This article is already in the upcominf films category. Plenty of films which haven't been released are ntoable for various reasons, even if cancelled. (See <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canceled_Superman_films_2aee.html" title="Canceled Superman films">Canceled Superman films</a> for an example.) I think a good general rule for upcoming films is they shoudl be notable even if they aren't completed.

<li>First: That's a category that has serious <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> problems, and doesn't form a strong basis for defence of any article. Second: Urban Dictionary, that you cite, is not a source, since its stated mission is in part to accept and to promote things that people have just made up. Third: It is Wiktionary where arguments that a word is in use are relevant. Here at Wikipedia, we are writing encyclopaedia articles, not dictionary articles. Fourth: You point to a Google search, but you <i>do not actually <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite any sources</a></i> on the subject of butterfaces. If you want to make an argument for keeping that is not full of holes, <b>please cite sources</b>. Cite sources that discuss the concept of a butterface.

<li>First: The fact that the category has had problems is not interesting, since it apparently was decided it should stay. Second: The fact that the category currently contains &gt;100 articles <i>is</i> interesting, since apparently we <i>do</i> have articles describing terms like these, which also makes it irrelevant that Wiktionary has an article on the subject.

<li>I don't know where you got the idea that "it was decided that it should stay". There has been no such discussion at all. And whether you find it interesting is irrelevant. The category still does not form a strong basis for the defence of any article, because of its <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> problems. That we have a lot of articles that flout the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy does not change that policy. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. Wiktionary is the dictionary.
<p>As for the purported sources that you've just cited, the first doesn't discuss butterfaces at all; the second tells us that in the real world they don't exist; and the third is <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Everything2</a>, which is as useless for verfiability purposes as <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dictionary_cc65.html" title="Urban Dictionary">Urban Dictionary</a> which you cited above, which gives a (pretty poor) dictionary article on a word, and which <i>doesn't discuss the concept at all</i> and thus provides no basis for writing <i>an encyclopaedia article about butterfaces</i>.

<li>Guess I should have said <i>allowed to stay</i> rather than <i>decided to stay</i> to make the point. In situations like this, the category should be up for deletion first, the individual articles after that. The presence of such a category at least <i>suggests</i> that such articles have a place in Wikipedia, regardless of any previous discussions. You've convinced me with your more thorough analysis of the references though, so I also vote <b>delete</b> now. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

There is no way that an <i>encyclopaedia</i> article can be written here that (sans original research) won't be anything other than a perpetual stub.

<li>Urban Dictionary is not a source, for the reasons outlined above. And your don't say what books that search on Amazon are "relevant references". I don't see <i>any</i> books there that are about butterfaces. Please actually cite some sources when claiming that sources exist, rather than giving a search link that turns up completely irrelevant books such as <i>The Art of the Playwright: Creating the Magic of Theatre</i> some random novels such as <i>Midnight Hour Encores</i>, and nothing about the subject at hand at all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Urban Dictionary's book certainly could be, actually. As for the Amazon link, it worked when I linked it last night, I don't know why it isn't working now. When I get home, I'll figure it out.

<li><b>Delete</b>: It's a single, albeit commonplace, joke. It has unofficial currency but needs no explanation. If someone wanted to have a "neologisms of the Howard Stern Show" section of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a>, that would be a fine place for this, but there is absolutely no way that a person who <i>hasn't already heard the joke and therefore knows it</i> will be typing that into the search box and looking for this. I.e. this is the same rationale as is used for deleting jokes in a movie: you have to have seen the movie to search for the joke, and when you see the movie, you know the joke.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. As taken <i>from the article</i>, this is a neologism. I am unimpressed by the arguments for documentation in the afd - those should be written into the article.

<li>Don't bash me because of it being my first contribution. I was looking for new Pokemon hacks, that's how I came here. Pokemon Brown is widely known hack - the reason of it being listed on few websites is that ROM hacks are considered illegal by many site/forum admins. The fact of this hack being full rehash(instead of few cosmetic/text changes) is enough to consider it as worth of Wiki-entry. Isn't Wikipedia a place to stop "What the **** is &lt;insert game name&gt;? Haven't heard anything about it."-like questions? If yes, no deletion is required.

<li>I decided to look into this by Googleling "pokemon brown;" over 2 million results came in, put obviously these are not all about this supposedly "famous" ROM hack. (when you put it in quotes, the number reduces to around 1.5k) The first result was <a href="http://www.zophar.net/hacks/gb.html" class="external text" title="http://www.zophar.net/hacks/gb.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, in which Pokemon Brown is on a list of ROM hacks. So, it exsists at least... but that was probably obvious anyway.</li>
<li>There are some fansites here and there that talk about it, so within the ROM hacking and [possibly] Pokemon communities, it is known... well-known? Known at least. Unfortunetly, notability within communitiesis difficult to research unless you're part of the group youself (in this case, the more advanced Pokemon/ROM hacking communities).</li>
<li><s>Meh. <b>Delete</b> as non-notable software. I'm still open to mind-changers, however. (not that it'll really matter; no one can be swayed when it comes to AFD)</s> I commend you for your efforts KBM, so you get a <b>weak keep</b> out of me, but a <i>keep nonetheless</i>. It's too bad though; there are too many delete votes in to really make a difference now. I think with some cleanup it could be better... short... but better. -- <a href="../../../g/a/k/User%7EGakon5_821a.html" title="User:Gakon5">gakon5</a> 00:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As a person that spent some of his life in ROM-hacking, I'd say that every finished and standalone hack is <i>notable</i>. Wikipedia <i>is</i> an encyclopedia meaning that we should have as much verifiable knowledge as possible. If I'm a new person to Pokemon ROM hacks and wish to find out more about them, then I don't have to know about Zophar's domain. All I need is to come here and search for it. That's why there should be a common page about all GB/GBC/GBA hacks (like this one for NES) but single <i>notable</i> hacks like Pokemon Brown also deserve to have its page. <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzman_59bf.html" title="User:Xyzman">xyzman</a> 11:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Hello, im the creator of this hack. Aparently your having problems with notability. Let me explain something, I had a website 2 years ago when I released this hack, and it had this hack on it. I kept track of the downloads and the downloads were high, because this wasnt any ordinary hack. This was a hack that I put almost 2 years work into, and I'm working on a sequal right now thats almost 3 years in development. This hack is HIGHLY notable in the Pokemon Rom hacking Community. Just ask anyone if they know of a Pokemon Brown, and most of them will say yes. Google hits mean nothing, especially since people have made jokes about different versions of Pokemon games like "Pokemon poo Brown" or some sort. Fan sites have listed this hack as downloadable, and if that isnt notible, I don't know what is. And if this gets deleted, I've lost all faith in this site, because aparently if this would have to be deleted, and all articles shared the same fate as this in which they had question of notability, the only 2 articles that would be up on this site would be Georg W. Bush and Paris Hilton, go figure. And honestly, have you all actually tried PLAYING the hack instead of judging it as another hack? Although I do agree this article needs to be spruced up a bit.

<li><b>Delete</b> with all the sympathies to the hack author. Even if it's "notable within ROM hacking community", and you could prove that it exists or something, I believe the threshold of inclusion for all kinds of mods or hacks is <i>very</i> high - in this case, just show that yes, tons and tons of people play Pokémon ROM hacks, and yes, everyone who does that has played this one. Where's the claims of bazillions of downloads? Where's the game mag article? In short, sorry, no Wikipedia article until I read about this thing from <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelit.html" title="Pelit">Pelit</a> or their website.

<li><b>Comment</b> Magazines dont really mention ROM hacks last time I checked. Anyways, like I said in the previous comment, search pokecommunity.com, and you need to register first. Pokecommunity has the highest ammount of Pokemon ROM hackers, and do a simple search and you'll find lots of results for Pokemon Brown. And ask around if you want, people will know about it. I'm not going on an internet scavenger hunt to find out every site that mentions my specific hack, because pokecommunity.com is enough proof alone. Unfortunetly the site I hosted in 2004 is down now so I dont have _proof_ that it was downloaded that much, but it was. Not everyone who downloads it is going to comment on it.

One of the three hits is a note written by Zanic to confirm a subscription. The other two go to an Australian agency called CSIRO, and it's here that I find factual problems. The article states Zanic implemented improvements to the Australian wine industry as a whole. The <a href="http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Manufacturing.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Manufacturing.htm" rel="nofollow">CSIRO website</a> indicates that agency provided algorithms and processes to Zanic, which he is very pleased by. Zanic's testimonial here also states that production improvements occurred for the Southcorp winery, identifies Zanic as a Southcorp employee, and shows no indication of any industry-wide improvements in wine production. In the article, Zanic takes credit for industry-wide implementation of the Toyota Production System/Lean Manufacturing System. I would be willing to entertain the notion that an industry-wide production improvement would be notable, but I would need far better sourcing and citations to credit this to Zanic. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 08:17, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did not check this thoroughly enough. I did a search for <i>FriendsReunited</i> without the space and wrongly assumed that as it wasn't forwarded to <i>friends reunited</i> that the articlke didn't exist. It's not anything I'm particularly interested in. Thought there was no article so I wrote it. There is differerent bits of info in both so I assume they need a merge... I am still a fairly new editor. Once I figure out how to create REDIRECTS and learn to be a bit more thorough with different spellings etc, I will be a bit more productuve! haha!! My article substance came from the ABOUT US page at friendsreunited.co.uk and also the Dec 2005 BBC article about the sale of the company. So... incorporate the missing facts? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheLedHead_e469.html" title="User:TheLedHead">TheLedHead</a> 12:40, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually the process form here to deletion takes enough time for a merge to happen. I should have been more specific.

<li>Hi TheFarix. I've done my best. I did not put the article up for deletion, but I havce merged the relevant info and the original article is much better than it was factually and gramatically.

<li><b>Comment</b> This nomination for deletion was not about the notability of the lighthouse; it was about the article having no text at all, even after it had been proposed for deletion and the PROD notice had been removed. As it has now been made into a sub-stub, it no longer qualifies for deletion as an empty article, but it still is a pitiful excuse of an article for a lighthouse. Extant lighthouses in the United States are very well documented in books and on-line, and deserve better coverage in Wikipedia than this one has gotten so far. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 10:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think we differ on the significance of these awards and nominations. Since the Milt Hinton award was recorded in Bass Player Magazine, my feeling is that it must be of some considerable significance, enough for it to be termed "major". Your mileage may vary.</li>
<li>I'm not one to insist on a very high bar for inclusion in Wikipedia because I think that this would result, to take the current example, in patchy coverage of professional jazz musicians who, like Moore, achieve a level of recognition without much commercial success. If people might read about someone and come to Wikipedia for informationm, then we should probably write about them. I'm inclined to the view that Wikipedia's purpose isn't to describe only those people a lot of us already know about; I know this isn't a universally held view. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:14, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see the evidence for Moore achieving a noteworthy level of non-commercial recognition. As for the scholarship, it is much smaller and less well known than many university scholarships/fellowships/best-of-class prizes. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a></li>
<li>I'm not concerned with "noteworthiness". We really aren't in the business of saying "this person is worthy, that person is not." As I suggest above, I think the criterion should be: is someone likely to read about this person somewhere and want to come to Wikipedia to learn more, and if they do can we tell them more than they already know?" --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a search engine; its an encyclopedia, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate collectionm of information. As a matter of policy, many useful categories of information are excluded - how-to's, recipes, quotation lists, the Yellow Pages etc, never mind more obscure terms that people might want to look up. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:19, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree completely with the policy that Wikipedia isn't "an indiscriminate collection of information." But here we're talking about an article about a professional musician. I just don't think the policy as stated means what you seem to think it means.

<li>Actually, I do know that notability is a guideline, not a policy while WP:V is etc. but notability is not something which is simply overriden by verifiability, reliable sources and NPOV. And thanks very much for being condescending but <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> discusses non-notability, noting that it is a controversial topic b ut is a frequently used argument for deletion on AFD, and that it is often associated with the formal policy, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:06, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't mean to be condescending, I'm sorry. But it seemed to me that you were trying to imply that notability concerns override all others. My view is that this is an interesting bass player who has been around for a decade as a recording artist. Not quite <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jaco_Pastorius_bac7.html" title="Jaco Pastorius">Jaco Pastorius</a>, but certainly someone whose name does tend to crop up in electric bass and double bass circles. There is enough material to make an interesting an useful article (though I don't think the article it quite <i>there</i> yet in terms of quality) and in my opinion that's really all we need. The "notability" concept is sometimes useful, for instance, in dealing with garage bands and high school bands, This fellow isn't one of those and, in my opinion, it would be inappropriate to exclude his article from Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 20:18, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Once, again, I argue that this article be <b>deleted</b>. The various records/CDs/albums that this artist has been published under are all homebrew studios or they were never published at all (Blue Canoe Records is a digital record label/he was published directly to the internet).

<ul>
<li>He hasn't charted a hit on any national music chart (unless one counts his eMusic rating among other artists that aren't included on Wikipedia).</li>
<li>He has no gold records.</li>
<li>He has not gone on an international or national tour.</li>
<li>None of his albums have been released on a major label, or one of the notable indie labels.</li>
<li>He was not part of any other band that passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.</li>
<li>He is not the prominent representative of the music scenes in Memphis, Knoxville, or Atlanta.</li>
<li>He has not won a major music award.</li>
<li>He has not placed in a major music competition.</li>
<li>He has not performed music for a work of media that is notable (the closest to this is the fact that his music has been used during the local weather segments on the Weather Channel).</li>
<li>He has not been placed in rotation at any national radio network.</li>
<li>And he has not been the subject of a half-hour or longer broadcast on a national radio network.</li>

<li>After some consideration, <b>Keep</b>. The subject is a borderline case--neither a slam-dunk keep, nor an obvious case of a non-performing garage band with delusions of grandeur. In such cases, I tend to lean keep; there is enough material for an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> article; Tony's proposal is a good start (though I'd remove any reference to the Grammys, the local NARAS chapter awards aren't referred to as such for a good reason). The attempt at sockpuppetry by the part of the folks at Blue Canoe (and <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> in general) can often swing my vote the other way (which is why I listed this in the first place); however, the apparent malfeasance by a Wikipedia editor in creating an {{imposter}} account I consider a far worse violation--Karen Frieske is doing what she's paid to do, promote her label and the label's artists. There is <b>no excuse whatsoever</b> for impersonating other users, or trying to frame them for sockpuppetry. Thus, holding my nose over all the BS which has gone on here, I'll vote keep. Further, I repeat my suggestion that folks from Blue Canoe refrain from editing the article directly, or linking to it elsewhere. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 21:55, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However, the imposter account actually did some help, by listing the article under <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_jazz_bassists.html" title="List of jazz bassists">List of jazz bassists</a> or whatever. There were more sockpuppets and sockpuppeteers pushing this artist than the single imposter account trying to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 22:14, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete and protect</b>. In borderline notability cases for dead or long-retired musicians, there's reason to lean keep, since Wikipedia is an important place to preserve historical info and pointers to the remaining documentation as they fade from memory and the easily-locatable info dries up. For borderline-notable still-active musicians supposedly on the rise, <b>delete</b> without hesitation, especially when the slightest whiff of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> attaches to the article. If they're really on the rise, their notability should be increasing and not decreasing, and they can be re-entered once they're no longer borderline. Notoriety for musicians being bankable and with every Wikipedia page contributing hugely to Google rank, there's relentless pressure to ram self-promoting music articles into the wiki, tilting the NPOV of the whole encyclopedia and worsening its spam problem. That should in no way be encouraged.
<p>The above is on general principle. In this particular instance, there was apparent egregious sockpuppetry from marketroids at the "label" that released this guy's recordings. The logic is "Hey, if this spamming works, I get valuable exposure. If it doesn't work, the article gets tossed and I'm no worse off than before. Plus, the deletion process might waste a lot of <i>their</i> time, but <i>I'm</i> getting paid for this, so there's no loss for <i>me</i>. There's no disincentive whatsoever, so go for it!". There has to be a "loss" branch and so if the socking is confirmed, not only should the article be deleted, but any music articles having to do with this "label" or its performers should be <b>banned</b> from Wikipedia for at least a year, regardless of notability. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 12:49, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That doesn't strike me as a sensible way to build an encyclopedia. If people put advertising material and promotional language into an article, remove it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is eminently sensible. The number of people and organisations that might want to use Wikipedia for self-promotion runs into tens or hundreds of millions, Wikipedia has a limited number of housekeeping editors, who have limited time, and any article can be seen by hundreds of people before anyone decides to clean it up as most readers never edit. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELandolitan_df6b.html" title="User:Landolitan">Landolitan</a> 18:08, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's an argument for deleting all articles on obscure subjects. I am happy that it has seldom prevailed as an argument for deletion on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:13, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As written, the general part about deleting semi-notables whose notability is supposedly increasing was specifically about musician articles. It can be generalized to articles about some other types of people, companies, and products, but certainly not to every subject. And it doesn't apply at all to borderline-notability subjects which are fading away in popular awareness (e.g. deceased subjects), for which documentation should be preserved before it is lost. I do lean towards keeping those types of articles. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 23:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It seems to me, that the proposal to block <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> violators and bar their pet subjects is, ahem, interesting--but entirely irrelevant to this AFD. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 18:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The suggestion is to ban blatant abusers who try to game Wikipedia for profit (in this case by attempted ballot stuffing using sockpuppets by management at the record label), just like we ban blatant vandals. It's way too drastic a remedy for run-of-the-mill vanity editing. I agree that an AfD isn't the right place for that discussion, maybe I can separate out that part of the comment. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 23:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Rationale for Inclusion of Articles</b> Hi, I appreciate your desire to keep Wikipedia free of spam. In writing these articles, I've tried to keep inline with Wikipedia guidelines by providing unbiased and objective information on the topics. We are not trying to push our warez; rather to explain the rationale for the brand new software tool (which is also free for personal use). There are links to the page from other articles in Wikipedia, although I noticed that the search engine does not yet reliably show them, perhaps it just needs some time to re-index new submissions. The same reasoning applies to the google search.</p>
<p>In any case, if the administrators feel that these articles violate Wikipedia guidelines, so be it. Our intent was to provide unbiased information about a new (and innovative) tool, and we tried to follow the rules.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Thanks for participating in this discussion and for making such a rational, informative response. The biggest single problem right now is that of "notability" (technically a guideline, not a policy) because the company and its products are indeed "brand new". Once they've been around for a while and have been mentioned by other sources, <i>then</i> it would be more reasonable to present the articles. One of our primary goals is to provide "encyclopedic content" which generally excludes "cutting edge" companies and products, at least until they are somewhat established and reported on. If , for example, a major newspaper were to do a story about your products, then we would certainly include an article at that point. Thanks again for participating&#160;:) --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 17:10, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><b>What to do with the Listings Then?</b> - Well, I understand this logic, although I somewhat disagree with it. What is the purpose of providing listing of software products in wikipedia? My understanding of a communal process that allows everyone to edit an article should take care of fradulent or incorrect articles, at least on average. I tried to provide as much clear and concise information. Then again, if the public decides to kill the articles, so be it. ---<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy.goryachev_3953.html" title="User:Andy.goryachev">Andy.goryachev</a> 17:22, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> - There isn't really any problem with the articles themselves; they certainly aren't fraudulent or incorrect. Compared to some of the utter crap that turns up at AFD they're actually well written (In fact, I'm hoping you'll stay on as a contributor here even if these articles don't make it this time). The real issue is with the <i>topic</i> of the articles, their newness and lack of current notability, as well as the inabiblty to offer references (ie, to a newspaper article, trade journal, etc). I hope this helps. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 17:33, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And just because someone claims that they read somewhere on Wikipedia that "all local anchors be included" is meaningless without sourcing it. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesehead_1980_d929.html" title="User:Cheesehead 1980">Cheesehead 1980</a> 14:02, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - this blanket nomination is fraught with problems. The biggest is that the blanket seems to cover minor reportes who have been with the station a mere few months, which really doesn't make a strong case for notability. And on the other hand, Jim Gardner is also covered which by the sounds of it, he is rather an iconic figure in the local broadcast area, who would pass the bar of notability for me. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 14:18, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jim Gardner does not meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards just like the rest of these people. Being allegedly well known in your hometown is meaningless unless you have a wider - read national or international - notablity. None, I repeat none of the people listed along with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tom_Jolls_af1f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tom Jolls">Tom Jolls</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Irv_Weinstein_a2c1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Irv Weinstein">Irv Weinstein</a> or the other copule hundred local tv news anchors in the US.

<li>Why must "widely" be interpreted as national or international? The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines specifically state that the criteria you are citing are <i>"not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted"</i>. The articles for each of the news anchors and reporters need to stand on their own merits. That's why I have a problem with this blanket deletion. It is a blind application of a guideline being interpreted as a rule without due consideration to a bolded admonition not to simply delete when the guidleines are not met. Achieving an iconic status within a locality works for me. For somebody like Jim Gardner, the information is verifiable, and will still be verifiable 10 years from now as he has been inducted as a broadcast pioneer. A keep for me. Applying the same sort of critical review to Angela Russell, there is a different outcome. She may become notable enough in the future, but for now, it's a delete or merge. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 19:06, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Added paragraph in intro:
<dl>
<dd>There have been the problems of their territorial rights(including their naming rights) and fishery rights around it since 1954. Koreans have been very nationalistic to have been plotting to rename "<a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Japan_4ec4.html" title="Sea of Japan">Sea of Japan</a>" to "East Sea". Also they have illegally controlled and administered "<a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeshima_Islands_fb76.html" title="Takeshima Islands">Takeshima Islands</a>" since 1954 and been plotting to rename them "Dokto" in spite of Japanese repeated fair demands that if Koreans have any complaints about the sovereignty of <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeshima_Islands_fb76.html" title="Takeshima Islands">Takeshima Islands</a>(while South-Koreans called them "Dokto"), Japan is ready to accept the innternational neutral judgements and Koreans should obey the decisions too. While Japan has been protesting against Korea more than 50 years that <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">south Korea</a> should stop their illegal behaviors and accept the international fair judgements, Koreans have been violating <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeshima_Islands_fb76.html" title="Takeshima Islands">Takeshima Islands</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Removed paragraph:
<dl>
<dd>South Korea currently controls the islets and claims it as Korean territory from records that date back to the sixth century. Japanese claims come from seventeenth century records.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Replaced with:
<dl>
<dd>South Koreans illegally have stayed on the islets and claims it as Korean territory from records that date back to the sixth century and would not admit the truth that there have been no Koreans permitted to live not only on the <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeshima_Islands_fb76.html" title="Takeshima Islands">Takeshima Islands</a> but also on the <a href="../../../u/l/l/Ulleung-do.html" title="Ulleung-do">Ulleung-do</a> from 1403 to 1876 by Korean authority. Besides Japanese territorial claims to <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeshima_Islands_fb76.html" title="Takeshima Islands">Takeshima Islands</a> come from the fact that Japan fairly gains the sovereignty of <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeshima_Islands_fb76.html" title="Takeshima Islands">Takeshima Islands</a> first in 1905. Furthermore Japan has the seventeenth century records concerning the territorial rights of <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeshima_Islands_fb76.html" title="Takeshima Islands">Takeshima Islands</a>. What is most important is that Japan gave only fishing rights around Ullueng-do to Korea but not the other anything in 1696.</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b>, of course.

This content dispute would never have happened if the neutral and mutually-acceptable name had been retained, instead of allowing one side to claim a "victory" for their POV. Suggest a new debate be opened on the naming, perhaps one held centrally rather than on the article's talk page to ensure wide visibility, and that those who participated in the previous debate both before <i>and</i> after the arbitrary deadline be given the chance to have their arguments properly considered. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:51, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I nominate this article for deletion on the grounds that it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>, contains a single source that violates our policy on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, is filled with <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a>, violates our policy on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, and smacks of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Ordinarily I believe in cleanup first, but the article as it stands is so full of original research and unverified statements that I believe it best to scrap it and start over. There is so much work to do in separating out fact from fancy that it is not worth it, in my opinion. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 18:42, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see this article as irredeemably bad. Needs sourcing definitely, cleanup for sure, but not deletion. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:26, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Firstly, I believe the nominator is mistaken about the article being "single source". I created this article by <i>merging</i> separate articles on each character. Perhaps he mistook that as a single-editor article creation. It was not. Secondly, in terms of its <i>existence</i>, this article satisfies the requirements of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>. The article on <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluedo.html" title="Cluedo">Cluedo</a> and this list are long enough to spin the list of characters off as a separate article, per the guidelines. Thirdly, I agree with much of the nominator's criticism of the <i>content</i> of the article. I didn't write any of it. There is a lot there that <i>sounds like</i> speculation and original research. This does not affect the merits of having an article on these characters, as long as material about the characters is verifiable in principle. I have no idea whether the information in this article is supported by materials published in the game, the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clue_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Clue (computer game)">computer game</a>, the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clue_%28film%29.html" title="Clue (film)">movie</a>, the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clue_%28musical%29.html" title="Clue (musical)">musical</a>, the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluedo_%28game_show%29.html" title="Cluedo (game show)">TV show</a>, the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clue_%28book_series%29.html" title="Clue (book series)">books</a>, and the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluedo.html#Spin-off_games" title="Cluedo">spinoff games</a>, but it seems ridiculous to claim that information about characters that have appeared in so many media cannot be verified. Finally, the appearance of these characters in so many media as well as references to them in <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluedo.html#Popular_culture_references" title="Cluedo">pop culture</a> probably qualifies them as notable in their own right. This article probably needs some heavy and critical editing, and contains much that should be removed, but deleting it altogether would not be in accord with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 19:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> By single source, I mean that there is only one source (not even a reliable source) in the article. As for "verifiable in principle," that does not meet the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy that I posted for all discussion participants to read in my nomination for deletion - as the policy states, <i>The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain. Editors should therefore provide references. If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic.</i> There are no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, therefore Wikipedia should not have this article. Not that I do not in any way dispute the article on notability grounds, but that is not the primary reason to delete an article. Failing policy <i>is</i> grounds for deletion, and this article fails the tripod of core policies: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 19:34, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <i>sources</i> are, of course, the game, the movie, the books, the musical, the TV show, etc. Yes, the article should cite its sources. Failing to do so is not grounds for deletion, however, only grounds for a good cleanup. Note also that the standard is verifi<i>ability</i>, not that the article <i>has</i> been verified. An article that hasn't been verified, but <i>can</i> be verified is fine. The policy forbids articles on topics that <i>cannot</i> be verified. From the policy: "'Verifiable' in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source". Any reader can go rent the movie, read the books, etc. The contents of the article are therefore <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. If there are specific claims within the article that are not supported by any of these sources, they should be removed, but that is a different matter from the question of whether Wikipedia should have an article on the Clue characters.--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 12:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As the policy says, "Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources," and "The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it." There isn't wiggle room to say "There could be sources provided, and we should leave those statements in because someone could check and find sources." The only source in the entire article that remotely qualifies is the link to the Clue Musical cast page- and even then, that information is <i>only</i> valid for the Clue Musical cast, and would probably be better treated on the Clue Musical page. At this point, if I were to edit the entire article such that it complied with Wikipedia policies, we would be left with two sentences per Clue Musical character, and the page would be a slam-dunk candidate for merging. The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> specifically indicates that articles filled with Original Research should be deleted (not deleted and protected, just deleted; pages can be deleted for reasons other than notability or encyclopedic worthiness).

<li>Your article, <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Heroes_9af2.html" title="Iron Heroes">Iron_Heroes</a> does not have a single citation and is full of facts. By your definition, it should be deleted. I have taken the initiative (<a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7EBE_BOLD_d937.html" title="WP:BE BOLD">WP:BE BOLD</a>) and marked your page as needing citation and added fact reminders to first paragraph -- though really you should be adding a citation for nearly every sentence in the entire article, as they are all facts. <a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiu_Bei_6738.html" title="User:Liu Bei">Liu Bei</a> 18:24, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You're incorrect about the citations - the book itself is the source for most of the claims (and I have added and am maintaining the cite.php format); page numbers are helpful but not mandatory. Nevertheless I will be adding page numbers over the next month as I have time, and I have added external links for claims not directly related to the book. I am going to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and not take this as an example of retribution for "attacking" a favored article. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 19:51, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If a book is the source of the claims in <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Heroes_9af2.html" title="Iron Heroes">Iron_Heroes</a>, why can't we just cite the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clue.html" title="Clue">Clue</a> novel once in <i>this</i> article? <a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiu_Bei_6738.html" title="User:Liu Bei">Liu Bei</a> 20:07, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would probably be fine for now, so long as it's clear that the claims are from the novel - and anything not from the novel or another cited source would be deleted, of course. The preferred solution, of course, to prevent fact challenges, would be to add page numbers. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 01:09, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As of yesterday, this article has references to <i>eighteen</i> books, and the film. This of course doesn't change much: it only makes it a very well-referenced crummy article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Beg pardon??? Almost none of the statements in the article are backed up by reliable sources. I bring for example the Colonel Mustard section. "Weaving together the strands collected from Clue mythologies and Hasbro's lore" - that's a patent example of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. The closest thing managed to a citation is "there is a rumor from the movie" - that's very doubtful, and doesn't answer the questions about the veracity of the entire rest of the article. For that matter, please read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <i>again</i> - the burden of proof is on those who wish to retain the article, <i>not</i> the editor proposing deletion.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I was being facetious that since most AfD nominations do not source their claims outside of wikipedia, they should be considered original research. (IE - they would need to get another webside to corroborate the claim that article X is against wikipedia policy).

<li><b>Delete</b> since this list will not likely become a "handy and concise instrument" as the criteria for inclusion are too vague (define "persecuted" and, for that matter, "writer" since the list claims that it will include "other persons"). If it adds extra info to the article on human rights in Turkey, that strikes me as the best place for it. There or the pages of the writers themselves. To say that it's related to the history of Journalism only broadens the inclusionary criteria further as there were many journalists persecuted under the early Republic (to say nothing of authors, poets, writers etc). Not that it's not a useful topic to have information on, just that it's not a topic to have a separate article on. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:06, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Several reasons: 1. that lists contains names that are NOT included in other pages (yet), 2. The prupose of lists is providing of a kind of an easy index (sort of table of contents) into other, more detailled information, 3. Conciseness of information. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the lists is still rather short, so there is no 'huge' value in it yet. Of course, that are only my feelings about it. On the whole, I rather favor keeping this list. --Rudi Dierick 07:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Persecuted" is inherently POV. Orhan Pamuk was charged, but the charges were dismissed; hardly "persecution". The author of the article confuses being charged and being convicted; I corrected one instance but there is more. The list form is not very useful for this. And what are the criteria? Should <a href="../../../n/a/z/Naz%C4%B1m_Hikmet_f2cb.html" title="Nazım Hikmet">Nazım Hikmet</a>, Aziz Nesim and <a href="../../../y/a/%C5%9F/Ya%C5%9Far_Kemal_8014.html" title="Yaşar Kemal">Yaşar Kemal</a> be included?

<dl>
<dd>Your arguments are not very clear:</dd>
<dd>1. the fact that you provide some potential names for possible inclusion, isn't that a good reason for <b>KEEP</b>ing it?</dd>
<dd>2. When checking the definition of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution.html" title="Persecution">persecution</a>, there appear to be some good reasons that suggest Pamuk is indeed persecuted. the def. speaks about 'persistent mistreatment of an individual or group by another group.', so the fact of a condemnation or not is irrelevant here! persecution is about mistreatment. The legal harrassment, the public attacks on his person and reputation are therefore relevant indicators. --Rudi Dierick 07:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>3. Apparently, the fact of just speaking about 'persecution' is already enough for you to pretend that anybody saying there is persecution is only describing a POV, and that it can just be censored away. So, according to that principle, you would be allowed to remove any article from Wikipedia that speaks abouit persecution. Just to show how ridiculous your reasoning is. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 16:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, why did you suggest these writers? --Rudi Dierick 07:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Neither of those responses washes with me. Where the first issue is concerned (the idea that more names means that it's more "keepable"), the point is being made that the criteria are sufficiently vague that the list will become unwieldy. Hikmet was (as far as I can remember) in trouble with the early Republic for totally different reasons than Pamuk was controversial in the last few years. A similar comment can be made about the definition of "persecution" - define "persistent", for example. If a "writer" (someone who writes - a "Turkish writer", therefore, can be as broad a category as any ethnic Turk who writes anything) is routinely woken up by his next door neighbour's pets, is that "persistent mistreatment"? I'd imagine not, which means that the definition of "persecution" is similarly vague. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 08:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, 'persecution' is not an exact, say mathematical category, but that is NO reason enough why we should not be allowed to use this term. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 10:16, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It strikes me as a particularly good reason why this term shouldn't be used. As an encyclopedia, we're in the business of presenting <i>facts</i>. Now, while it's a fact that Orhan Pamuk (an author I greatly admire) was charged and later had the charges dropped, there's considerable dispute throughout this discussion as to whether than constitutes "persecution", which is what having him in this article means occurred to him. The same goes for any other writer we have on this list. You might say that X was persecuted, I might say that X was served with a lawsuit and someone else might say that X had it coming all along - who's right? With such a vague word as "persecuted", we can't really tell. However, there's no disputing the fact that Orhan was charged at one point - which is a fact relevant to his particular article. Likewise, there's no disputing that some of these other writers had various things happen to them as well. Do they constitute persecution, though? You say yes, but others say no. Therein lies the problem with this article, it's an attempt to analyse facts in such a way that your take on the matter is upheld while someone else's isn't. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 11:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If one would follow your line of reasoning, then it would become impossible to speak about persecutin here, because the persecutor and his sympathisers will then off course object, and that would be it. If you would be really applying the Wikipedia approach, should you not provide a clear definition and an way of evaluation whether that definition applies in this case so that you can avoid the pitfall of giving a veto right to the persecutioners and their sympathisers? --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 16:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way, I have no objectiona against mentionning on the page with the list of persecuted writers that some people object to this or that case being a case of persecution, but only ill-fated prosecution. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 16:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, that's exactly my point. The only definition of "persecution" that you've put forwards so far is one which is open to interpretation. If there's a definition of the term which doesn't allow for interpretation along the lines we've just been discussing, then it might be worthwhile to use it. As it stands, we're dealing with a vague term which has no right being here in the first place. I'm not "giving a veto right" to anybody - merely pointing out that this article moves from presenting fact to presenting opinion. The object of an encyclopedia is to present fact and allow the reader to form his or her own opinion. As far as mentioning the dispute over the term goes, that's a good concession to have made, but I don't think it's enough - we're still left with this vague term floating around. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This seems a rather disingenuous series of remarks. To begin with, there are only two Turks who have responded, which is a comparatively small number when taken as a whole in relation to everyone who's responded - I'd also suggest that commenting on the argument, rather than the person making it, is probably for the best. As far as the "neutral" sources go (presumably "neutral" means "people who aren't Turkish"), there are in fact 4 who've suggested it be kept, with 3 suggesting it be deleted. Given the results of the CheckUser quoted here, I think we can be quite safe in saying that one of the 4 "keeps" is in fact an artificial vote, giving us 3-3. That's hardly a majority, and neither is 4-3 a consensus, which is what the object of the exercise is here, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">we're not a democracy</a>.<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 11:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear, constructive suggestions are very much OK to me, but here I was left somewhat puzled. Being still relatively new to Wikipedia, I've checked the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">not assuming good faith</a> page, and it speaks about either NPOV contributions, either personal attacks. So could you please tell me what is a 'wikitrout' and give me the reasons why you suggets this. I find it quite stuning that you start suggesting what should be done with another contributor, without giving a clear argumentation why. Especially since I've tried to be as constructive as possible to anyone suggestion how to improve things. I only got pissed off in the past by the amount of times when contributions were just deleted, without any argumentation on the discussion page at all, not to say, without any indication that the factual info I contributed was not correct. Looking forward to a constructive solution, regards, Lucas

<dd>Hundreds upon hundreds of people have faced charges in Turkey over things they said. Just the other day someone was convicted to a jail sentence for jocularly making the statement "I have a bomb on me" while on a ferry. Someone else was so upset that he called a customs official an idiot, something that is frowned upon in Turkey and not considered a liberty allowed by the constitutional freedom of expression. There would just be no end to it. I guess the same could be said for most other countries, including the United States. If we are to have a list, we need rather precise criteria for what goes on it, and these criteria should also be such that the list is not endless. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A list with clear objective criteria is not content forking, true. However, I'm not convinced that this is such a list. There is no agreement (either in this discussion or in the article) about what "persecution" is apart from the general comment that it's something which is believed to have happened to the people on that list. Likewise, there is no indication anywhere of exactly what constitutes a "writer" ("fiction writers" and "journalists" are explicitly included, as are "officials" which is another vague term which can be stretched all over the place). Thus, we have a list of a broad collection of people to whom something hard to define has happened. I'll admit that the broad collection of people who were originally eligible for inclusion here has been narrowed a fair bit, but we've still got politicians, a judge, a number of journalists, an "editor", a publisher, an author or two, at least one publisher, a human rights activist and at least one person with no employment listed - so I'd have difficulty believing that there are hard-and-fast criteria for inclusion other than the fact that they've been a <i>cause celebre</i> somewhere around the world. Regarding the "persecution" side, we range in seriousness from a murder through to a complaint that someone's freedom of expression is being curtailed. So as far as exactly what happens to constitute "persecution", we're similarly vague. In other words, this is an article which exists purely to push a certain POV in a forked manner. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable modification for HL2 - could use a mention in the HL2 article, but I don't think it deserves it's own article. I'm also concerned the page is being used as a readme file/advert for the add-on. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 19:44, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> since certainly a few HL2 players <i>have</i> to wander in here every once in a while: Is this a significant or well-known mod to the game? I can't pretend I know enough about the game or its mods to know myself. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 06:49, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Answer</b>This is a significant mod that has been featured in magazines, has a forum dedicated to it that has had 200,000 hits and is an invaluable resource to many. Please leave the page up since the internet can handle it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.212.160.12 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.212.160.12.html" title="User talk:71.212.160.12">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.212.160.12_08bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.212.160.12">contribs</a>) 24 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Witty Reparté</b> Which magazines? Can we have sources? And my cat has a forum dedicated to him that has had almost 5,000 hits in the past six months - but it doesn't make it notable! take a look at <a href="http://topsites.moddb.com/mod/?game=61" class="external text" title="http://topsites.moddb.com/mod/?game=61" rel="nofollow">this top 100</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 14:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Additional Info</b> The author is japanese and hasn't submitted it to any english sites anywhere, but many English sites had already gotten the site, simply by browsing the Smod community forum, and is still spreading among. Despite being relatively difficult to get and the total lack of english information available from the author the mod has gotten 200,000 hits in six months on one forum. If it wasn't a noteworthy mod it might not have got this amount of attention.</li>
<li><b>Additional Info</b> The community finds this page useful and it should not be deleted. This is the second most popular mod for HL2 after Garry's mod and therefore justifies an entry in wikipedia. If you have any doubt look at <a href="http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=148509" class="external text" title="http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=148509" rel="nofollow">Facepunch</a>, <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=366420" class="external text" title="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=366420" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> or <a href="http://www.hl-improvement.com/forums/index.php?board=29.0" class="external text" title="http://www.hl-improvement.com/forums/index.php?board=29.0" rel="nofollow">H.I.T.</a>. It has also been featured in <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.pcgamer.com/" rel="nofollow">PCGamer</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The three links you have just posted are all forum posts by the people who run Smod, and PC Gamer features HL2 mods all the time as part of it's publication - what we need is proof it's popular beyond a forum link or anything like that - a top 100? Or a review that places it in the top few mods?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This goes to show how little you know about this game and why your personal opinion that it should be deleted should be ignored. Not one of the thousands of posts on those pages is by the makers of SMOD, that's all by players and fans. In any case my post was for the benefit of moderators who will hopefully observe from this that SMOD is very popular and that its page should remain in the Wikipedia.--Fitzroydoll 08:31, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - As an avid fan, follower, and player of the Half-Life games, I can say with great certainty that this mod is in fact <i>very</i> popular, and therefore notable. Smod was a <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/features/motw/smod.shtm" class="external text" title="http://www.planethalflife.com/features/motw/smod.shtm" rel="nofollow">Featured Mod of the Week</a> at <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.planethalflife.com/" rel="nofollow">Planet Half-Life</a>. It's already been mentioned in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html#Mods_and_expansions" title="Half-Life 2">HL2 article</a> for some time now. It's unfortunate, though, that the creator doesn't speak English, meaning that you wont often find it submitted to English mod sites where you can easily compare their ranking. Regardless of this, the mod has become well known throughout the HL2 community due to its outlandish, over-the-top, and amazingly impressive effects. As mentioned before, its a commonly known HL2 mod and it has been mentioned in PC Gamer before. The mod has been released for quite a while now, making it well established, and it is updated very frequently (The last update would be July 25, four days ago). The article could use a little work, but if you have no knowledge of the game, mod, or the community, then you'd be making a very large (and false) assumption saying that Smod is non-notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 09:36, 29 July 2006 (UTC) I also agree with Marphy black for the same reasons --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETOMNORTHWALES_9ce5.html" title="User:TOMNORTHWALES">Tom</a> 10:47, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - SMOD is one of the most noteworthy mods for HL2. SMOD is a mod so popular that people have actually modded the mod to make new mods. Including myself. The mod is extremely customisable, allowing people to totally change the location, appearence and function of weapons and enemies in the game. This has allowed people who have no coding (programming) ability to make mods for HL2, by heavily customising SMOD into a unique experience. And yes, SMOD has been in PC Gamer magazine. Also, because the mod's documentation is in Japanese and there is no english readme file, this wikipedia article is one of the few places that people can read what features are in the mod, other than people's descriptions on forums, or the Mod of the Week article on Planet Half-Life, or the PC gamer article. your evil twin 30 July 2006</li>

<p>Non-notable blogger, possible vanity (author hasn't contributed a great deal except this article). He had some trouble cancelling an AOL subscription, recorded the conversation and made a post about it on his blog, gaining some limited media attention.

There's a paragraph in the <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_c152.html" title="AOL">AOL</a> article that mentions the episode, and that's probably justified, but he certainly isn't notable enough for an article.

<li>I was thinking more of the readers than the editors. Right now, the article includes information not available on the pages I'm working on. My suggestion was to keep this article until I have plundered it for my own purposes on, say, the collapse article.

I think the key objection to this way of proceeding would come from those who want a separate article on the survivors.

<li><b>Comment</b> So then. It says many different things, and people end up quoting those they most like or are best suited to them, yet deletions do go on based on some mystical, elusive interpretations of conflicting stated rules. How very nice and serious for an encyclopeadia (as I've already observed before). People who spend time on such projects certainly have no value either for their input or for their time or both.

<li><b>Comment</b> StevanMD, first off, obviously has a biased view, as his userpage states that he is a member of this society.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> For Heaven's sake, if you could keep to the arguments instead of personal derogations. If a person claims certain reasons for his actions as part of the set of rules and then we see even by his own admission that the rules are not exactly precisely set, but he still adheres to his view, albeit not consistently, as he picks the articles to which to apply *his* set of rules among myriads of articles otherwise equally notable and verifiable, then that is argument and it's an argument that clearly suggests bias. Additional problem is that no firm set of rules guides a supposedly serious encyclopaedic project, so it's subject to most anyone's whims, which makes it very unserious instead. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevanMD_4f53.html" title="User:StevanMD">StevanMD</a> 00:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> For newcomers to this series of deletion debates I'd like to put this deletion debate in perspective and provide some history. Over the past week, there has been a deletionist attack on several major high IQ societies, and one article has already been deleted. That article concerned a reputable society, established for over 20 years, which has received extensive mainstream media coverage and gets 12 thousand Google hits, the Mega Society. Up for deletion is an article about Ronald Hoeflin, who also has received much media attention and is perhaps the leading psychometrician in the field of high-end psychometrics, and also articles about the Triple Nine Society, among others,and of course the Prometheus Society, which has produced major scholarly articles on high IQ testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what I wrote during the Mega Society deletion debate. It's worth printing here because it has implications far beyond the rarefied world of high IQ societies.</p>
<p>This deletion debate horrifies me. When I read 1984, where anyone whom the ruling elite didnt like was made an "unperson" and all records of him erased, I thought, thank God that's fiction. When I read about the old Soviet Encyclopedia, and how anyone who fell out of favor had his article (as well as his life) deleted, and all users were sent a letter by the NKVD telling them to cut that article out of the volume, I thought, thank God I dont live there. But this is chillingly real.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to my horror.</p>
<p>1. I have devoted my life to halping the ultra-high IQ societies gain the credibility they deserve. I first heard of the Mega Society almost 20 years ago, thanks to a cover story in New York magazine. Some of its members became famous, just by being accepted. It is as respected among us as MIT or Harvard are in the world at large. To find that there are people out there who have never heard of it is as shocking to me as when I moved to the Midwest and found people who have never heard of Wordsworth or Rodin. It means that perhaps my life so far has been in vain.</p>
<p>2. I was at first skeptical of Wikipedia, and the whole notion of a grass-roots internet encyclopedia. I've edited a few entries over the years, but I hesitated to devote much effort to work which could be deleted by the first vandal who came across it. But as time passed I became a believer. The thing worked. But now, in the one area I know about, I have seen just HOW it works. Nameless, faceless, ill-informed accusers can at any time delete an area they object to. They pretend to be a democracy but must out of necessity be an oligarchy. And, since no group of a few hundred people can know everything, they must out of necessity be ill-informed about most of the subject matter they consider for deletions. It's a sad (yet almost humourous) blend of Kafka and Joseph Heller. It doesnt much matter now. Wikipedia is young, and one of many souirces of information. But what happens when it becomes the gold standard? What happens when it becomes the Mega Society of the information world?</p>
<p>Several people have said that they pitied the closing administrator who must decide this case. Instead, I feel envy. This is a great opportunity for him or her to make a contribution to Wikipedia that far exceeds this individual case.My dad was a professor of administrative law and from the time I was a kid he drummed into me three things that make a fair decision under administrative law different from an arbitrary decision by administrative fiat. They are notice, hearing, and (perhaps most important) reasons. NOTICE. As it now stands, the parties affected by a deletion are not told about it. They must learn about it by chance. Yes, these parties may well have a POV. But they are also uniquely qualified to provide relevant information. And uniquely injured by an incorrect deletion. HEARING The deletion procedure does indeed provide a good hearing, provided people are aware of it. Thank you for that. REASONS If the closing admin writes up a short statement of reasons for his or her decision, this will help guide future administrators in future cases. As I understand it, there is no clear policy on notability. It may be applied differently in different cases, and whether or not something is deleted will depend on who the admin is. If reasons are given in this case, they may be used to guide future cases. Not as binding precedent, but for guidance, and, over time Wikilaw will evolve</p>
<p>Some people have told me that Wikipedia works through consensus and not rigid procedure and rules. This may have been possible in the early days but I dont think it is now. Norbert Weiner once wrote that the limit of a small self-governing community where everyone knows each other and can reach consensus is about 100. You cant know every editor and I'm sure not every editor knows about this decision. You might well be a self-organizing system, but if you make a mathematical model of it, you might find that model predicts articles being deleted and then undeleted in an infinite cycle.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPromking_4c0b.html" title="User:Promking">Promking</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPromking_4964.html" title="User talk:Promking">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Promking_aaf1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Promking">contribs</a>) 22:09, July 23, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I forgot to sign the post above, which I wrote yesterday. And there are two important points I forgot to include. First, much has been made of the fact that we have far fewer members than Mensa. But we are SIX HUNDRED TIMES MORE SELECTIVE than Mensa. Therefore, if we were as notable as Mensa, with its 60 thousand or so members, we would be expected to have a hundred members, and we do.</dd>

<p>Second, most Wikipedians are totally unaware of this debate, and of the twenty or so others mounted against similar societies by the same people. Most of the debate participants have expressed a prejudice against IQ groups which, were it voiced against an ethnic group, would be considered racism. Avi, the proposer, said " I also note from my associations with various High-IQ societies that there is often a correlation between their members and an inflated sense of self. Not all of us whom G-d has blessed with IQ's significantly above 150 need to broadcast it to the world and preen. Anyway, innate intelligence is more often a gift (although honed and sharpened by use) and not something we should use to foster a sense of superiority" And Byrgenwulf, who was active in several related deletion debates, posted this on another forum in June: "Personally I've never seen the point of these societies...what do they actually do?I was once coerced by a friend to go with him to try to get into Mensa; we both took the test and qualified for acceptance, but I refused to join, because I don't see the value of wearing my IQ like a badge and getting together with a crowd of geeks (well at least this branch of Mensa seemed to be, I obviously cannot say that all Mensa members are) to solve brain teasers." Does the biases of the proponents matter? Well, would you like a deletion debate on a top hip-hop artist to be decided wholly by classical musicians... or by white racists?Brian <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPromking_4c0b.html" title="User:Promking">Promking</a> 14:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Promking wrote that I had posted a comment about Mensa in another forum...that is right. However, I should say that I do not appreciate people stalking my activities across the Internet; not that I care overly much, as I often use my real name (like many here -whom I commend), because I am not ashamed of what I do or say online, but stalking someone is nonetheless just plain rude. Promking also asked another question: "Well, would you like a deletion debate on a top hip-hop artist to be decided wholly by classical musicians?"...personally, yes I would! I wouldn't mind a bit if every trace of hip-hop was removed from this planet. But that's my own bigoted opinion. I also couldn't really care too much about IQ societies on the whole (I'm not sure they merit inclusion in an encyclopaedia more than wargames clubs, for example), but have no vendetta against them <i>per se</i> so let me say here that I am <b>neutral</b>. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 17:21, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I apologize if I did something wrong. I wasnt citing your quote to tell people who you are -- though since I have a legal background the idea of anonymous accusers rankles me -- but to tell people what biases you might have. This is, in my opinion, relevant. Even if you are trying to decide the issue rationally and in good faith, as I think you are, it is very hard to escape one's unconscious biases. The amusing thing is that you are *very much like* (in a good way) people in the ultra-high IQ societies.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPromking_4c0b.html" title="User:Promking">Promking</a> 19:19, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>“jihad” is a very loaded word in today's day and age. You do us all a disservice by making divisive analogies. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, per se, and definitely not a place to me making <i>ad hominem</i> attacks. I would politely suggest that you familiarize yourself with wikipedia policy before denouncing many of its editors as blind, hate-mongering fanatics. As one who has had family members wounded and disfigured, although thank G-d none dead as of yet, at the hands of those truly practicing jihad, I find your similies personally distasteful, if not downright repugnant. You do all of us blessed with significantly above average G-d given mental acuity a disservice this way; and yes, I count myself as one of those, thank G-d, having documented scores that would put me in that group. In general, I prefer not to discuss that, but I feel it is important that it is known that it is not a matter of jealousy or spite that is my motive here. Unfortunately, the vitriol and vituperance that you bring, with other defenders, leads me to believe that your responses are less measured and logical. Alas, the world is not a fair place, and the free and open exchange of ideas is more utopian than practical. At one point, I would have thought that there would be a direct correlation between innate mental talent and the ability to discuss and debate in a cordial manner.

<p>+ Keep. Excellent points about not using problematic group characterizations (i.e., jihad); thanks. Prometheus, like TNS and ISPE, has a history that likely reaches back some time. Our own Wiki entries on human intelligence show that it's a real, quanitifable, largely heritable entity that's consistently measurable with overwhelming reliability. The admissions standards for Prometheus have been continually upgraded and improved, and particularly in the last seven years they have represented the highest level of what serious psychometric research has endorsed (no take-home test, no Internet based tests, etc.), and these standards are currently being revisited to an eye to both rigor and maximum possible inclusiveness. Prometheus has a journal (available to anyone through subscription, my route of having come to appreciate it, through <a href="http://www.prometheussociety.org" class="external free" title="http://www.prometheussociety.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.prometheussociety.org</a>) that puts the journals of other groups, including Mensa with its glossy but disappointing content, to shame: Gift of Fire contains genuinely interesting and engaging excursions into high-level physics, chess, history, and poetry and fiction published in an attractive 64-page format on a regular basis (usually more than 6 issues per year.

<dd>You do understand that, unless you don't take Wikipedia or its mission very seriously, which is clearly not the case, you are trying to erase our life's work from history? That's bound to ruffle a few feathers. What puzzles me is the inconsistency of Wiki delete actions. For example, any article about any public school in the U.S. is automatically kept, even if it is not at all notable.

<dd>Just as an aside, I think Mensans as a rule are just as stuck up, arrogant, and at times downright foolish as any other group, and I know what you mean with your comparison to Gift of Fire.

When Richard May was President of the Prometheus Society he was interviewed by Ellen Graham of the *Wall Street Journal* and the Prometheus Society was included in the *Journal* article on high-IQ organizations of 19 April 1992. Recently the founder of the Prometheus Society, Dr. Ronald K. Hoeflin, was extensively interviewed by CNN's Dr. Mittleman for an upcoming cable TV special on high intelligence and its role in the world today. May-Tzu</p>

<dd>Similarly as an aside, I concur in part with Avi's comment above, from personal experience. Among the certifiably very bright people I've known, I find that the brighter they are, the more modest they are (in other words, there's a certain level of smarts that corresponds to a peak of intellectual arrogance: below and above that, it drops off, either from modesty associated with self-knowledge of one's own limitations or from modesty associated with comparing one's perhaps notable intelligence against the obvious possibilities and the accomplishments of true historical geniuses). It may be that occasionally some Mensans are smart enough to get excited about being sometimes the smartest person in a room but not smart enough to realize that there's a vast range of potential human intellectual accomplishment that they're never going to be dipping their big toes into.

<p><b>Suggestion</b> to clear all of this bickering up, if possible. I know I've made this suggestion before, as well, so sorry if I'm being repetitive. Many people have raised some very good and interesting points on this page, about the nature of IQ societies and people with high IQs and their behaviour. To a large extent, I concur with <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> that not every little society merits an encyclopaedia article. Like him, as well, I know from previous testing that I would get into many of these ultra-high groups if I were so inclined, but for various reasons I see no need to do so. However, seeing the responses these AfDs have generated, I realise that the topic of ultra-high IQ groups is of immense personal import to many people, who feel that these AfDs are an attack on things they hold dear (which I am certain was not the inspiration behind nominating them, but anyway). The current "<a href="../../../h/i/g/High_IQ_society_5751.html" title="High IQ society">high IQ society</a>" article is worthless: it's pretty much a list of "this society admits that percentile or x number of standard deviations". Which may be very interesting to some, but is hardly edifying and informative. <i>Why not create an article on high IQ subculture in general</i>? Many points made here, by all of us, shed much light on the phenomenon, and the various angles from which it may be approached. The marked difference in quality between <i>Gift of Fire</i> and Mensa's rag; the politicking; the self-opinion and egoism (or lack of it) of members...there is lots to go on, and would be both interesting to "High IQers" as well as curious people with more "normal" IQs - whom it might help to understand the phenomenon of ultra high IQ better. Material could be taken from, for example, the Hoeflin interview mentioned above, various publications of the IQ societies, and so forth.

<dd>I think that is an excellent idea. Further, such an article would be able to have, as sub-headings, a brief entry on those societies that are currently not up to Wikipedia standards. Of course, if eventually those sub-entires are properly sourced, fleshed out, and held up against wiki standards, they could then be spun off in their own articles. Articles such as Mensa, Mensa International, Triple Nine (IMO) etc. are already notable enough, but should be mentioned in such a parent article. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 20:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So why haven't I edited it? Since I'm an officer of the Mega Society, I felt I should abstain from doing so because it would have "bad optics." When the Mega Society AfD was first launched by Jefffire (who I think incorrectly throught he was striking a blow against <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Langan_6f82.html" title="Chris Langan">Chris Langan</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe_2d02.html" title="Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe">Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe</a>), I asked him why he had started with the Mega Society.

(2) The Society is not important outside of its membership. This could be claimed of many organizations that correctly have articles (e.g., <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Fellows_404b.html" title="Society of Fellows">Society of Fellows</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Puzzlers%27_League_0145.html" title="National Puzzlers' League">National Puzzlers' League</a>), because these organizations clearly have importance through the interaction of their members. (3) The Society is not notable. It has become clear in the course of this discussion that the existence of these high IQ societies is surprising to many people. This alone makes them notable. (4) The article should be merged into the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_IQ_Society_2a80.html" title="High IQ Society">High IQ Society</a> article. The individual societies are quite different, each has its own character, its own journal, and its own history.

<li>Mr Stoner, this is not a "sour grapes" response at all. If you had read the discussion, you would have noticed that two users here, both of whom have nominated a couple of IQ society articles for deletion and voted "delete" on others, could probably join some of these societies if they wanted; these societies tend to have a tiny fraction of the membership they statistically could have, because not all qualifying people belong to them. Please do not leap to hasty judgments on other peoples' character and motivations. No-one is disputing the "reality" of these societies, and the motivation here is not vindictiveness, as has been repeatedly explained. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 08:07, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Someone mentioned the length of time Gift of Fire has been going -- add it to the article. How many members does it have? What is its relationship to the earlier 4-sigma society? etc etc. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>About verifiability. Our primary -- and most spectacular -- claim is that we select people at the one in thirty thousand level of intelligence, six hundred times more selective than Mensa. We have produced a long, scholarly article examining all reputable intelligence tests, determining which tests are capable of selecting at this high 4-sigma level, and determining what these scores are. <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/MCReport/mcreport.html" class="external free" title="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/MCReport/mcreport.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/MCReport/mcreport.html</a> Surely this is the best verification that we do what we claim to do. After all, when a PhD candidate claims to be worthy of that degree, he is not asked to provide newspaper articles that state he iw worthy. He is instead required to produce a thesis he has written. About expanding the Prometheus article... look at the history. Things are added, and then a few months later someone deletes them. I added the "six hundred times more selective than Mensa" and someone changed it to "six hundred times more gay than Mensa" What's the point of writine for posterity if it's gone in sixty days?<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPromking_4c0b.html" title="User:Promking">Promking</a> 14:30, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

Being the nominator, if I see a good faith effort to turn the article from the current stub/spam/almost copyvio advertising link to something that describes the society including non-"advertisment" descriptions of criteria for membership, interactions with other societies, an example of any peer-reviewed work, mention by mainstream publications, notable members (inclusive-)or notable work products, I will withdraw the nom.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see how this group could pass the <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> guidelines. The article tells us that this is a club with 650 members. There are no gnews hits, one plausible scholar hit (a letter to the editor in <i>American Statistician</i>, but I don't have JSTOR access so I can't say exactly what it is). There's nothing resembling a newspaper or magazine of any sort in the first 3 pages of ghits. Given the nature of the membership I'm not convinced that 310 unique/654 total non-encyclopedia ghits is a great many. The article itself is a (non-copyvio) paraphrase of the society's home page, and in that limited sense is verifiable - it's what they say about themselves. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> explains, articles are not merely deleted, but are speedily deleted, for failure to claim or imply notability (CSD A7). The whole purpose of guidelines such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> is to determine whether the subject persons or groups are suitable for inclusion on Wikipedia, for which notability is merely a shorthand. As <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> says, it is a "test of whether a subject has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources". <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 23:17, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Ah, so. If notability is "only a shorthand", what does it stand for? Is it for suitability as you say? If so, who and on what grounds establishes suitability? You say neutral point of view and verifiable information are imperative. Yes? Who verifies the informations for each and every article and who and in what way provides the certainty of the neutral point? If you truly adhere to concerns about notability I expect you to swiftly put on the road to deletion <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northside_Grizzlies_60f5.html" title="Northside Grizzlies">Northside Grizzlies</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamblen_Elementary_School_%28Spokane%2C_Washington%29_4349.html" title="Hamblen Elementary School (Spokane, Washington)">Hamblen Elementary School (Spokane, Washington)</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosby_Elementary_School_9426.html" title="Cosby Elementary School">Cosby Elementary School</a> and a myriad of similar articles, which by the standards you apply on Triple Nine Society are neither notable, nor verifiable. Will you? Will you ever? Failure to properly answer and undertake such action will render you a biased, bad willed censor, rather than objective, concerned encyclopaedists.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Correction: I díd address your issues, although I have to admit that it wasn't much of an effort. Talossan is one of the best known artistic languages, notable especially for its huge lexicon. It is one of the very few examples of an artistic languages that has actually been learnt by numerous others (although I don't know how many people are really fluent). For the record: it is <i>not</i> a fake language. It would easily survive the notability test for constructed languages. But for the record: I do not believe all the political doings of the Talossan micronation are relevant in this article. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>Uszkiełtu?</i></sub></font></a> 14:55, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I thought the term "vanity" implies that the article has been written, or edited, by the author of the project or someone close to the author?

For what it is worth, I wrote the Dutch version of the article, and I have no connection whatsoever to the creator of Talossan. Yet, I believe the language is significant enough to warrant inclusion.

When I wrote that Talossan is a fairly known conlang, I didn't refer to the number of speakers, but to the fact that it's quite a famous conlang, mostly because it's related to a famous micronation.

<p>This article was originally prod'd and the prod take was removed by the article's creator stating, "Soler has drawn a following among noir, underground readers and deserves mention in Wikipedia.

However, after looking at this, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and anything else I could dig up, nothing came up to prove Soler's notability. There is nothing in Soler article that makes Soler actually appear notable or unique. He appears to be just normal and <i>attempting</i> to get into a larger scope of writing.

<p>&gt;&gt;Evening, people. It's necessary to equate notability with cyber representation. I get that. Soler's absence on search engines, however, should not be taken as a sign of obscurity, or worse - normalcy. On the streets, in coffee shops, his works DO generate discussion. I would know, having attended the same workshop as said author. His writings can be found in the San Fran bay area, in Long Beach, in the southern Californian desert - across the state and back again. The problem is the de-commercialization of his art. You won't find his writings at Barnes and Noble or Amazon. They won't rot in some university bookstore. They are circulated hand to hand, person to person. Free of charge.</p>
<p>Unlike most article creators, I refuse to claim unadulterated neutrality. I do know the author, through his works and a few brief encounters. I am a fan, and not the only one. There are others who've cozied up to his movement. Since we haven't created a webpage in his honor, and since his works never enter the commercial ether, I guess hes too unimportant for this place. Until he attends book signings and sells his art, I suppose he'll continue to be "just normal." Do you need me to email you legitimately published copies of his works, along with critical analyses from outside parties? That can be done in a second. In half a second.</p>
<p>I defend the article in haste, and fully aware that it will do absolutely nothing to impede the article's deletion. Since yanksox already has a "strange inclination" to suspect I am the author on a self-aggrandizing mission, I fear the article is dead already. Pity. -- Englandsfinest 05:51, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This term is a <b>neologism</b> according to the article itself, which writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term Shiny Shoe Music was first used by <a href="http://mochassid.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_mochassid_archive.html#108324855886569269" class="external text" title="http://mochassid.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_mochassid_archive.html#108324855886569269" rel="nofollow">MoChassid</a>, a Jewish music blog. Other names for it commonly refer to "Boro Park Rock," "DosPop," "Hemishe Freilachs," and "Muzica Chasidi" (Hebrew phrase for "Hasidic Music.")</dd>
</dl>
<p>Following that link shows that the term was invented in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> by a blogger; there is no reason to think that it has wide-spread use. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22shiny+shoe%22+music" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22shiny+shoe%22+music" rel="nofollow">Google</a> has "about 674" results, the first of which is WP. The fact that other editors have edited the page means merely that they know about this kind of music (as I do), not that they refer to it by this name. (But I hope to inform all such editors of this nomination.)—<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsh210_2d23.html" title="User:Msh210">msh210</a><span class="Unicode">℠</span> 19:41, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b>. Fact check. Following the link, I learned that the blogger was happy to <b>use</b> the term in 2004 because he felt it was inspired, not that he made it up himself. In fact he specifically disclaims making it up, saying that it was made up by another <i>Yerushalmi musician</i>. The Google hits seem diverse enough to support the idea that it is in use by a lot of people, even if it's a "neologism" (not sure if that term even applies to music, whose styles are constantly evolving) <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 03:32, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Fact re-check:</b> He says his musician friend invented "shiny black shoe music", not "shiny shoe music", which seems to be his own invention. Most of the Google hits are blog entries (at a glance: I haven't checked carefully), which would seem to imply that the term is quite new.—<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsh210_2d23.html" title="User:Msh210">msh210</a><span class="Unicode">℠</span> 20:28, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I actually have no problem moving per <i><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 19:59, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</i>, I guess, but have no idea what to move to. As the article states, the genre is called "Hasidic music" (in Hebrew) in Israel, and I've heard the term "Hasidic music" (in English) too, and <s>I suspect that that's a better title than the current one</s>, but don't know if that's good enough either.—<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsh210_2d23.html" title="User:Msh210">msh210</a><span class="Unicode">℠</span> 20:28, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, my recommendation then becomes to move the article to Hasidic music and if someone comes along later and says that article should include other types of Hasidic music, we can figure out at that point whether to further disambiguate...or if, perhaps, by that time, "Shiny Shoe Music" or some other term is more applicable to this particular genre. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 06:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Come to think of it, "Hasidic music" would be too ambiguous: in fact it sounds like it's referring to music of Chasidim rather than to the stuff now discussed at <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiny_Shoe_Music_16bd.html" title="Shiny Shoe Music">Shiny Shoe Music</a>. So maybe moving thither is <i>not</i> such a good idea.—<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsh210_2d23.html" title="User:Msh210">msh210</a><span class="Unicode">℠</span> 06:23, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which was exactly my point...That said, however, just because you or I think it sounds ambiguous is insufficient grounds to not put it there...essentially, refusing to do so, esp. since you even say right out, above, that you've heard it referred to by that name, becomes a backwards violation of WP:NOR. All that would be required to avoid confusion is to state plainly what's being discussed in the article lead--that is, after all, the lead's purpose. As I said above, if Çasidi music eventually begins to refer to other things as well, or if you're <i>really</i> opposed to putting it at Chasidic music, write an article about chasidic music [it need only be a stub, to begin with], and mention the subject of the current <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiny_Shoe_Music_16bd.html" title="Shiny Shoe Music">Shiny Shoe Music</a>, complete with a link to "this" article, and move it from <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiny_Shoe_Music_16bd.html" title="Shiny Shoe Music">Shiny Shoe Music</a> to Hasidic music (style) or whatever. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 21:40, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I find this introduction to editing on Wiki very confusing and disappointing. I was told of this debate, and have come here to offer my opinion. Is it not valid because I am new? That doesn't make me feel very welcome. When someone has been advised of this situation, are they not entitled to establish an account and advocate on behalf of Very Tasteful? In any event, I support the evidence offered in favour of Very Tasteful Productions. I have collaborated with them in Vancouver, Canada, and can attest to the legitimacy of the above projects. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonbot2000_48c4.html" title="User:Jonbot2000">jonbot2000</a>

<li><b>Delete</b> Reeks of vanity. We'd rather you make some nice edits to other articles than creating a complete article with a somewhat interestingly detailed bit about your group. The fact each of the members histories are clearly known and its all cleanly documented. I'm doubtful any of this could be verified by reputable sources, because the <i>sources</i> are likely the members themselves, writing about themselves. I mean, "<small>They all grew up in Victoria, BC and met in high school. Billy Reid finished film school in 2003, and is the most versatile member of the group.</small>," that's an unlikley sourcable statement. Its all self-vanity sadly, by virtute of impossible knoledge through anyone but the group themselves as they don't appear to be that fameous in any place I can tell. If you guys are filmmakers, perhaps you do better off to write about stuff you know. One of you likely graduated from <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Film_School_f8b3.html" title="Vancouver Film School">Vancouver Film School</a>, go expand the article a little. (Don't list yourself as notable alumni though, you likely aren't yet if this AFD goes for a delete.)

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I had no idea adding a simple article would cause so much debate. True, I spent some time making it perfect, but should not all new articles be as well thought out? I found all of my information on the members from their website, their podcast, from the MacAddict CD's, imdb, articles online: <a href="http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/life/story.html?id=e0697e2d-3aef-43d9-924d-c3387de7f980&amp;p=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/life/story.html?id=e0697e2d-3aef-43d9-924d-c3387de7f980&amp;p=1" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>, word of mouth, and their short films. This is not, although I now see how it can be assumed as such, a vanity piece. I simply was excited to start my Wikipedia experience with a well written article. It would be a be a shame to delete it, as I feel it holds merit. Please reconsider.Trish Rules</li>
<li>I don't really know what sock/meat puppetry means although I have an idea, but I do find it unfair that my vote doesn't carry the same merit as anyone else here. Yes, I made an account with the intention of defending this article. Why is that frowned upon? I frequent this site, however I didn't think I had to participate in discussions all day long for my voice to count. That seems pretty elitist. and certainly uninviting and I don't appreciate it. Is it because we're fans of the work?? Shouldn't that go towards establishing their notability, not against it? I've never personally met Billy Reid. I'm a fan of his work and we speak online occasionally. I subscribe to their podcast. I own one of their DVDs and I don't believe this article is a vanity piece and I do believe that they deserve an article. Who knew the politics of Wikipedia were so cut throat. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnWilliams713_8a38.html" title="User:JohnWilliams713">JohnWilliams713</a>

<li>And not that it probably matters, but this will certainly be the last discussion I participate in on this site. I don't appreciate being called names and bring treated like crap. I had no idea this community would be so unwelcoming. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnWilliams713_8a38.html" title="User:JohnWilliams713">JohnWilliams713</a>
<ul>
<li>The primary reason why new users are allowed to participate is that they may have relevant information to offer. The primary reason why their opinions tend to be discounted is when they ignore Wikipedia standards. Overwhelmingly, what we've seen from new users amounts to "I think it should be kept because I'm a fan of it," which has basically no value in the discussion. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:21, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Don't Delete</b></s> I have reviewed this case since my last posting and would like to highlight some issues if I may. There has been a great deal of condescension dished out to new users such as myself which I think is unfair. I acknowledge that our knowledge of the process is cursory, but I'm not sure that it has undermined this process. It is hypocritical to accuse "us" (new users) of acting in poor taste when the advocates of non-inclusion are guilty of the following: not responding to the assertion re: mac magazines (you were encouraged to pursue this by contacting the editors of the magazines, and have not offered to do so); the claim that one person was unethical by creating a false account based on the subjective belief that "they" have similiar writing styles (how is that credible? It feels underhanded. How can that be "sourced"?); Re: Hope is Emo. Have you consulted the official website for that organization? Why have you not contacted this group about this issue? Again, doing so would legitimize the claim. Once again, you have not indicated you have or will do so. If efficacy is the goal of this site, why are you not playing the devil's advocate? Re: notability criteria. It is demonstrated multiple times that this group has a national/international presence. With their films participating in the New York Musical Theater Festival and the Milan Fim Festival as official selections, this is demonstrated. They have also had their work broadcasted nationally in Canada several times. Hope is Emo, a hugely popular podcast on internet, has been viewed over 1 million times on youtube alone. If you take the time to view this popular podcast, you will see at the end of each episode, an acknowledgement of Very Tasteful Productions. I recognize this is a lenghty entry, but these issues need to be raised and addressed for Very Tasteful advocates to accept your assertions that this group is not credible. Please research the above issues, and explain how they do not match the stated criteria.

<li>And obviously, if you were "told of this debate" then the author or parties involved in the article have posted a link to this discussion on the fan forums or whatever there is. As such, that will further degrade from any chances of this article remaining included in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 20:02, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm getting tired of all these accusations thrown at anyone who comes here to defend the article. How is it "obvious" that there has been a posting on a forum? There are no Very Tasteful forums. Apparently using Google is the only method for research on Wikipedia, and if so, Google this fictional "fan forum". I failed to find any such forum. Also, I'm sure that the other new users were unaware of this four tilde requirement at the end of our edits.Gary Frill 22:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just to put this in context with earlier comments by other users. Being signed to Sundance only counts if Sundance is a major label (or an important Indie label). Judging by the list of unknown bands accredited to Sundance, it seems like neither. The tours only count if they were concert tours and were reported in notable sources - I can't see an indication of that (apart from them using the term concert on their own website). The reviews only count if there are several of them published in reputable media - again I can't see an indication of that.

<p>I propose that this category should be deleted. "Adulterer" is a derogatory label, and if the category is upheld, it could be used to label vast numbers of biographies in a rather unpleasant manner. There is already bad feeling directed towards Wikipedia about some of its biographies, and, in my opinion, this category has the potential to make the situation much worse. Details of extra marital affairs are documented in the biographies where appropriate. Wikipedia seems to have a policy of avoiding derogatory biographical categories. This policy should be continued. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 22:02, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b> As the originator of the cat, I feel this is an historically and culturally important and interesting category. Anyone wondering why it doesn't have any members in it at the moment, the nominator reverted all my +cat edits, but they included people from all walks of life, past, present and fictional, in an unbiased and fully sourced way. I am not aware of the bad feeling issues the nom refers to, and I think adulterer is fine (after all we have Category:Serial Killers), but if people feel strongly that adulterer is an inappropriate label someone who has participated in marital infidelity, don't hesitate to suggest alternatives, e.g. people who have confessed adultery or people who have been prosecuted for adultery. Just resist censorship, and keep this important category with ramifications throughout societies and literature worldwide. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 22:10, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Delete nomination here is well-intended, but off the mark. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 23:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So did Roger Moore and Kim Mohan and others, but does that mean they deserve articles here? Big wigs like Gygax, Arneson, Greenwood, Weis and Hickman, Adkinson, THEY deserve articles. IMHO, Mr. Mona doesn't. Dragon has plenty of independent reviews, but has it won any awards since he began editing them? So, if we keep this article, then we should be creating articles for all RPG authors? I'm an inclusionist and I don't think they all should be.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 01:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So it seems we disagree, and I respect your right to a different opinion. As I see it, Moore has authored numerous publications and probably deserves an article; not sure about Mohan. I agree with you about Gygax, Arneson and Adkinson; I don't know enough about Greenwood, Weis and Hickman to have an informed opinion. But fortunately we don't have to have to reach consensus on the relative importance of any given RPG author, which is an inherently subjective exercise. WP:Bio sets out the suggested criteria, and it would seem that Mona meets those criteria (multiple independent reviews of his work). <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 02:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I do think that the reasons for deletion presented thus far are flimsy, especially compared to the reasons presented against them, and I don't want to see a precedent made of deletion for the sake of deletion. Perhaps if there were more people clamoring for deletion, it wouldn't seem like a lone crusader's goal.
