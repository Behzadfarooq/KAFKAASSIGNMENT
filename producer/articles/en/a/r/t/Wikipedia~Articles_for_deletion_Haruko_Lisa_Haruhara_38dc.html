<li><b>Keep</b> - I think it's good that someone did a great job on making a fictional article. Whoever did this, also stated the names of the voice actors/actresses and developers. He/she also said to give them credit. I think it's very creative!

<li><b>Keep</b> - I see were you are coming from. He/she may have did some editing to an exsiting article, however, I do not know what addtional info was added to that existing article, so I cannot not personally call it non-sense, whoever did that. As of this debate in this created article, I can see some work put into it and he/she is not calling it his/her own. If you go to "references" section in the article, you can see the names of the real people that drew the fictional people and the voice actors/actress as well. Due to the information I see in the article stating to the public that this is all fictional and is trying to explain the detail about it to the best of his/hers ability, I would say, keep the article. Lets give this one a chance and see what happens once this debate is closed. Lets see if this person abuses his/hers privilege of making an fictional article, offical on this site to it's own category. But, hey, this is my personal comment regarding this. Many of you may see it differently than I. ChrisRB 06:18, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I mean, I can see this user has to be a big fan of FLCL. I give whoever credit on the possible time that was spent, but I can see why this should be deleted, or should it? I'm more of a computer guy, so I'm not good and making calls on this. I only go by My own personal actions. When was this article made anyways? I've been on this site before and I know what show Haruko is from, but the info provided on ths new article is not true? or is it? I guess I'll just have to search for sources to answer my question. Anyway, I know this is maybe out of topic, but can I use HTML and Java code to build my page? ChrisRB 06:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I see. Now, I have another question. Lets say I'm doing a project that has been copyright by me, and I want to make an article about it. Can I do so without it be in the same shoes as this article I'm seeing now? I will not bug any of you anymore for such info, lol. As for the fictional deal, I see now. So this fictionl character maybe getting deleted due to the fact of it not being his own character profile and 2. Because this character is an FLCL character, yet different profile, it will be deleted casue of it. ChrisRB 07:02, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's generally frowned-upon to make an article about something you created because of the inherent <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a>. If what you made is famous enough to merit an article, someone else will eventually write one for you. And no, this article is up for deletion for reasons that have nothing to do with copyright or ownership. It's more because it is about a fictional creation that is not famous or influential in the grand scheme of things. FLCL gets an article because it is important and well-known. This actress-character is not. It seems shallow, I know, but that's how the policy works. Wikipedia is a big thing and there have to be some qualifications about what gets in, otherwise everybody and their imaginary friend would have an article, and it would be impossible to find any solid information. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 07:10, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
