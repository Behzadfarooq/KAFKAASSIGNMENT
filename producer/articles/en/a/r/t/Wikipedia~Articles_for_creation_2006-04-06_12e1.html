<p>Metroid Online Map Team is an independent project that is modding Halo: Custom Edition for the PC with characters, creatures, items, weapons, and maps from the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroid.html" title="Metroid">Metroid</a> series. The project has been in the works for some time, a year at the least. So far, they have accomplished Samus Aran's character model, a primitive model for the Metroid, morph ball and <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_beam.html" title="Power beam">power beam</a> models, and several maps from the Metroid series. One recent map in particular was modeled after a level in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroid_Prime_Hunters_7ccc.html" title="Metroid Prime Hunters">Metroid Prime Hunters</a>. The game also appears to be quite similar to the layouts of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroid_Prime_25e2.html" title="Metroid Prime">Metroid Prime</a>. There are videos of testings on the site and a public beta test of the game should be released soon. A date for completion has not been given.</p>

<p>LOSAB at the University of St Andrews</p>
<p>Thought to have been founded sometime during the 16th century. Historical evidence shows that monks, within the Royal Burgh of St Andrews, came together and formed the Loyal Order of St. Andrews Brewers during a period of religious upheaval. However, not much else is known about the organisation and what it does. It is often thought that an oath of allegience is taken, on pain of death, to prevent any information being revealed by members on the nature of the society. Much like the Skull and Cross Bones of Yale, past members are allowed to divulge their membership after their graduation.</p>
<p>What little is known of its past is odd, being largely unverifiable by traditional sources. This is thought to be due to a large fire at mansion where the head quarters once were.</p>
<p>Its modern day existance has been verified by many modern day sources, including The SAINT, a popular student newspaper at the University. But there is no information on members and the location of their meeting place. It is thought that a professional head of security is employed by the society to guard their closely kept secrets.</p>

<p>Ivan Turgenev's novel 'On the eve' is a stunning book based around the main heroine, Elena. A daughter of a retired lieutenant she defies her family by marrying a poor Bulgarian. One of the most outstanding things about this novel is the way that the scenery is described, quite unlike most Russian literature of this time.

<p>The Home Made Hit Show (HMHS) is a weekly podcast that can be freely downloaded from <a href="http://www.homemadehitshow.com" class="external free" title="http://www.homemadehitshow.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.homemadehitshow.com</a> that features songs that have been written and recorded by unsigned artists using equipment that is located in their own homes.</p>
<p>The show often features a wide range of genres and talent with anything from classic rock to progressive pop but typically avoids dance and rap music styles. The home based recording equipment utilized by the contributors often ranges from highly portable hand-held digital recorders to elaborate computer based workstations. The important distinction comes in the “homemade” aspect of the show in that none of the recordings are produced in professional music studios or with large budgets.</p>
<p>The HMHS is the brainchild of home recorder and music enthusiast Tony Butterworth who made the first episode available on November 26, 2005 under the motto “The one stop home for Home Recording, Home Musicians and errr... Home Made Music”. Tony, a native of the United Kingdom who now lives in California, hosts each show with a matter of fact delivery seasoned with an Englishman’s charm and continues to oversee the song selection process as well as producing each broadcast.</p>
<p>Some have likened Tony’s endeavor with the HMHS to that of a modern day Alan Freed in his pioneering for a new musical source rather than a musical genre. Some also suggest that the potential for a paradigm shift away from the corporately sponsored/promoted music industry is now possible given current technological trends and the HMHS seems a natural step in the evolution of creating and distributing music.</p>

<p>Born in 1924, Honourable Bobe Augustine Ngom Jua seemed to be the answer to a struggling British colony named Ambazonia, formerly known as West Cameroon. Politically, he occupied very demanding posts such as Minister of Finance, and Minister of Health. He co-founded KNDP (Kamerun National Democratic Party) along with Dr. Martin Foncha in 1955. This party would go on to settle the biggest land dispute in Africa with Nigeria with the 1961 plebiscite. He also occupied the post of Prime Minister from 1965 – 1968. Along with Dr. Foncha, he joined the reigning political party in French Cameroon to form L’Union Nationale du Cameroun. Numerous Cameroonians allude to and celebrate the late Anglophone politician who had the courage to challenge the inequities perpetrated by Francophone leaders. He threatened to run against Ahmadou Ahidjo for president at the CNU Party Conference in Bafoussam, but was assasinated in 1977, at the age of 53, by the occupational regime of French Cameroon.</p>

<p>The 94th Airlift Wing is the host organization at <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobbins_Air_Reserve_Base_39fc.html" title="Dobbins Air Reserve Base">Dobbins Air Reserve Base</a> and is responsible for providing security, <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_engineering.html" title="Civil engineering">civil engineering</a>, fire protection, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_traffic_control.html" title="Air traffic control">air traffic control</a>, and numerous other services the base and to tenant organizations assigned to the base. This includes the maintenance of the airfield, which is used by <a href="../../../n/a/s/NAS_Atlanta_3540.html" title="NAS Atlanta">NAS Atlanta</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed-Martin_6deb.html" title="Lockheed-Martin">Lockheed-Martin</a>/Air Force Plant #6, as well as Dobbins tenants.</p>

<p>Over 14,000 flight operations occur annually making the Dobbins complex an extremely active facility with diverse air traffic operations from all branches of the military and other US government agencies. This air traffic environment takes place within the area of the busiest airport in the world (Atlanta Hartsfield Airport) and is as busy as many medium-sized commercial airports.</p>
<p>The 94th Airlift Wing is organized into a headquarters element, three groups, and a medical element containing 10 Squadrons and 4 Flights (1600 personnel).</p>
<p>The wing's mission is three fold. The primary mission is to train <a href="../../../c/-/1/C-130H_8cbf.html" title="C-130H">C-130H</a> aircrews for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> (active duty and reserve component). The second mission is to maintain combat ready units to deploy on short notice to support contingencies anywhere in the world. Finally, the 94th is the host organization for supporting all agencies and tenants at Dobbins Air Reserve base. To accomplish this, the wing recruits, organizes, and trains Air Force Reservists for active duty in time of war, national emergency, or contingency tasking. The aircrews trained are capable of using the C-130H aircraft to deliver cargo and personnel into and out of airports as minimal as dirt runways to international airports. They can also deliver paratroopers and equipment to the point of conflict by airdrop.</p>
<p>The unit is capable of deploying 9 C-130s on very short notice to a bare base and operate indefinitely. This includes operating the base, feeding the personnel, maintaining and loading the aircraft, and providing medical services to include evacuation of military personnel.</p>
<p>Personnel from the 94th AW have been involved in every major national crisis since <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Shield_22c5.html" title="Desert Shield">Desert Shield</a>/<a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Storm_ee3e.html" title="Desert Storm">Desert Storm</a>, from Provide Promise (Bosian Airlift) through Hurricanes Hugo and Mitch recovery operations to Shining Hope (Kosovo Airlift). This has been done totally with volunteers, who take time from their civilian jobs and families to support the nation.</p>
<p>As of mid-2001, the major change taking place within the 94th AW concerns the 700 Airlift Squadron whose conversion to a training mission was underway. The 700th AS was expected, as a result, to take on the responsibility of training all <a href="../../../c/-/1/C-130H_8cbf.html" title="C-130H">C-130H</a> crewmembers throughout the entire Air Force (Active, Guard and Reserve).</p>
<p>In another recommendation, <a href="../../../d/o/d/DoD_ca46.html" title="DoD">DoD</a> recommended to close General Mitchell Air Reserve Station (ARS). This recommendation would distribute the eight <a href="../../../c/-/1/C-130H_8cbf.html" title="C-130H">C-130H</a> aircraft of the <a href="../../../4/4/0/440th_Airlift_Wing_b022.html" title="440th Airlift Wing">440th Airlift Wing</a> to the 94th Airlift Wing (AFR), <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobbins_Air_Reserve_Base_39fc.html" title="Dobbins Air Reserve Base">Dobbins Air Reserve Base</a> (ARB), GA (four aircraft) and another station. Adding aircraft at Dobbins would optimize squadron size, creating a larger, more effective squadron. Additionally, this transfer would move <a href="../../../c/-/1/C-130.html" title="C-130">C-130</a> force structure from the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Reserve_ca35.html" title="Air Force Reserve">Air Force Reserve</a> to the active duty--addressing a documented imbalance in the active/<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_National_Guard_ea81.html" title="Air National Guard">Air National Guard</a>/<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Reserve_ca35.html" title="Air Force Reserve">Air Force Reserve</a> manning mix for C-130s.</p>

<p>“Sir, I am no less distrustful of Providence than you are: and return you answer, that I was not placed here by the King to surrender to rebels: and for the effusion of blood you mention, the crime will be your own, not mine: therefore I will not give one inch of ground I am able to maintain with my sword, against all your attempts made against this place, and your servant, Gervase Lucas.”</p>
<p><br />
The reply of Sir Gervase Lucas, Governor of Belvoir Castle, to the summons from Sydenham Poyntz on Thursday, 20th November 1645.</p>
<p><br />
Gervase Lucas was Master of the Earl of Rutland’s Horse. Before the outbreak of the English Civil Wars he had served the Earl for a number of years but the beginning of civil hostilities found his loyalties at odds with those of his pro-Parliament master. He is credited as being one of the first adherents to the Royalist cause of Charles I, raising a company of Horse at his own expense in Leicestershire in 1642.</p>
<p>On 28th January 1643 Lucas scored a major success for the King’s fortunes in Leicestershire through the audacious capture of the Earl’s ancestral home of Belvoir Castle. On this date Lucas arranged for a window in the castle wall to be left open. With a small party of eight men he then crept up to the walls of the castle and cast a rope around a balcony. They thus ascended the wall and opened the gates from within to the rest of their soldiers, taking the Earl’s garrison of 100 men completely by surprise.</p>
<p>During this daring attack Lucas was accompanied by the ubiquitous rector of Southwell, Mr Mason who appeared personally in arms at the head of a troop of Dragoons, the only recorded incident of a clergyman so acting in the Civil Wars.</p>
<p>Belvoir held a key geographic position and was to form one of the outer defences for Royalist Newark. From its lofty height Lucas’ swooped on Parliamentary supplies en route for London and local garrisons via the Great North Road, the Fosse Way and the roads linking Leicester, Melton Mowbray, Grantham, Newark and Lincoln. These lightning descents coupled with damaging raids deep into the strategic heartlands of the surrounding counties earned Lucas’ their soubriquet of the Belvoir Cormorants.</p>
<p>In November 1643 Lucas received information that the Parliamentarian Committee for Leicester was in Melton Mowbray to assess the surrounding countryside. Summoning aid from Lord Byron in Newark Lucas arrived in the town at dawn on the 28th with a force of 300 horse and dragoons. The parliamentarians were taken completely by surprise. A single Parliamentarian Lieutenant was killed and among the prisoners were four captains of Horse, four of Dragoons, one of Foot, four Lieutenants, three Cornets, all the under officers of Horse and Foot, 300 soldiers and the entire Committee. Among them one Captain Hacker who had previously made a vow to pistol his own brother “because he was loyal, and refused to turne rebel”. Captain Hacker now found himself at his brother Roland’s mercy on his way to detention at Belvoir. Only one Parliamentarian Cornet escaped the net. Also included in the haul were all the Parliamentarian colours, their ammunition and baggage, nearly 400 muskets and over 300 horses. This action severely weakened the Parliamentarian influence in Leicestershire. Lord Grey was forced to request 400 replacements and £500 from London to make good his losses.</p>
<p>Despite a setback on Sproxton Heath where Captain Plunkett, a close friend of Prince Rupert’s, was killed by Lieutenant Allen of Wayte’s Horse, and Lucas himself severely cut in the face, the Belvoir Cormorants were in the ascendant. Only two instances of successful opposition to Lucas’ raiding activities (of which there were many) are recorded for the rest of 1643.</p>
<p>The action at Sproxton Heath gave rise to a local legend that accords very closely with the known facts. Apparently Captain Plunkett’s body “the vilest villain among all the Cormorants of Belvoir Castle or Newark either” was taken from the field to the nearby Angel inn to await collection. Sometime later on hearing of his friend’s death Prince Rupert vowed to revenge himself upon Allen. On the very heath where Plunkett had died a second action was again fought in which Lieutenant Allen charged the Prince in a manner to pistol him but on the misfiring of his piece cried out to the Prince for quarter whereupon Rupert immediately shot him dead. Lieutenant Allen’s body was taken to the very same Angel inn where it in turn awaited its interment.</p>
<p>Following the Parliament’s directive for the taking of the National Covenant Lucas’ took a principle role in attempting to capture such clergy as had taken the covenant at Leicester with the aim of enforcing their retractions before they were able to return to their parishes.</p>
<p>In November 1644 Lucas’ ran out the garrison at the ousted Royalist Erasmus De La Fontaine’s house in Kirby Bellars following Sir Marmaduke Langdale’s defeat of Colonel Rossiter’s forces at Melton Mowbray on the way to Relieve Newark.</p>
<p>In August His interception by the Scots whilst on his way to join Montrose turned the King to a wild thrust south into the heart of the Eastern Association, staying with Lucas at Belvoir on the night of the 22nd en route for Hereford. The tide had turned. After the mauling at Rowton Heath Lucas sheltered Gerard’s regiment within the still defensible walls of Belvoir.</p>
<p>In October Princes Rupert and Maurice sheltered within Lucas’ walls whilst trying to join the King and assemble a last viable field force from His remaining garrison troops. By this time however the King’s cause was militarily beyond redemption and although Lucas and his stronghold remained determined to fight on the King took flight after his last stay at Belvoir on November 3rd. On November 9th Major General Poyntz surveyed the 400ft hill on which Lucas’ castle sat. The village of Belvoir having previously been burned in an unsuccessful attempt to bring the Belvoir garrison to terms in 1645. Lucas had weathered that storm and was in bullish mood as Poyntz’s force spread out to invest Belvoir. While Poyntz surveyed the defences the garrison made a sally, shooting the General’s horse out from under him and tearing the coat from his back as he beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>While Belvoir held out, as Lucas well knew, it would not be possible for Parliament to close the siege of Newark. Early Parliamentarian estimates of the duration of a siege proved ambitious – Lucas’ were to hold Belvoir in the teeth of repeated assaults for a further two and a half months. The disgruntled Poyntz, a German mercenary, opted eventually to starve out the Cormorants, ordering all prisoners executed. The garrison was eventually forced to surrender on terms due to a lack of victuals and water. They marched out of Belvoir with all their arms and colours flying bound for Lichfield on 3rd February 1646 leaving behind them a single piece of field ordnance.</p>
<p>Colonel Sir Gervase Lucas was among the most notorious of all the Royalist “Rob Carriers”. His hold on Belvoir and his continuous military activities had maintained a safe corridor for the Royalists from Oxford to Newark and proved a thorn in the side of Parliament’s attempts to supply London. The eventual fall of his castle stronghold was greeted with widespread acclamation in the capital. Following the surrender Lucas, ever the opportunist, escaped to France via Lichfield and Newcastle taking with him many of the Earl of Rutland’s valuables, most notably his highly prized ancestral bed!</p>
<p>The location of Lucas’ at the Battle of Edgehill, the first major engagement of the English Civil Wars, is not known although it is likely that a detachment of Lucas’ Horse may have been with Prince Rupert’s cavalry. The Belvoir Cormorants also fought in the actions at Leicester, Newark, Melton Mowbray, Kirby Park, Sproxton Heath, Rowton Heath, Burghley House and Wilne Ferry.</p>
<p>As a flying column the Belvoir Cormorants were engaged in constant harassing and raiding actions ~ the far more numerous and dirty everyday conflicts of a civil war. At various times secondments of Lucas’ were made to various notable commanders for specific actions or miniature, localised campaigns. A number of Horse and Dragoons of Lucas’ were among the amalgamated squadrons of local garrison troops active in the Naseby campaign. Their colours were blue and gold divided diagonally by a natural bend bearing the motto “UT REX SIT REX” ~ “Once King Always King”.</p>
<p>It seems probable that, like most under strength Royalist regiments, Lucas’ would number less than 500. A ratio of one pike to one musket can be assumed for Foot due to the shortages of modern arms in Royal armies. It should however be noted that the Belvoir garrison is recorded as also being equipped with the brown bill, a more practical weapon when operating within the confines of a castle or raiding. Lucas’ remarkable manoeuvrability though owes more to the use of Horse and Dragoons.</p>
<p>Notables to bear arms in Lucas’ Regiment include Mr Mason, rector of Southwell, and Muckle John, the King’s jester who was attainted after the First Civil War for the striking on the head of a Parliamentarian Captain during a skirmish, resulting in his death.</p>
<p>Following the Restoration many disenfranchised Royalists came forward to seek some reward or office for their past loyalties. These so called “Men Of The Sword” included many professional soldiers of ignoble origins who had learned their trade in the King’s wars against his Parliament. The incorrigible Lucas was among them. Although some were knighted and a very few raised to the peerage, it was not deemed appropriate or necessarily desirable to ennoble all of this warlike multitude with the accompanying rights and privileges of such promotion. Many were appointed to offices abroad or in the Colonies. So impoverished was Lucas that he was prepared to accept the far off commission of Governor of Bombay in India. The now “Honourable Sir Gervase Lucas” served in this role from 1666-1667. Lucas died on May 21st 1667.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-06_12e1.html" title="Edit section: Obituary:  Thomas William Bird">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Obituary: Thomas William Bird</span></h2>
<p>Rev. Thomas William Bird, 75, of 61 John St., died Monday in after a lengthy illness. Mr. Bird was well known in Ottawa and Winnipeg and represented the riding of Nelson, Man., from 1921 to 1930 as a Progressive.</p>
<p>Born in Westmoreland, Eng., he came to Canada in 1911, two years after his ordination.</p>
<p>His decision to come to the Canadian West was influenced by the late Rev. James Woodsworth or Toronto, father of J.S. Woodsworth, leader of the C.C.F. party. The elder Mr. Woodsworth was superintendent of missions for the Methodist Church in Canada and had gone to England to recruit young clergymen to serve in the West.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bird arrived in Northern Manitoba in November, so totally unprepared for a winter there that they were inadequately clothed. He served as pastor in churches at Swan River and Benito, Man., for 10 years.</p>
<p>He had participated in political campaigns in England as a Liberal when Lloyd George was leader of the party. In 1921 he contested the riding of Nelson, now know as Churchill, and was elected a a member of the Progressive party. During his first campaign in the wilds of Northern Manitoba he had to travel from settlement to settlement by canoe, clear to Hudson Bay.</p>
<p>Mr. Bird advocated the development of a port on Hudson Bay which would be served by a railway to give Western Canada a short grain shipping route to England and Europe. He was successful to the extent that a day came when Hon. Charles A. Dunning, then minister of railways and canals, asked him whether Nelson or Churchill should be selected. Mr. Bird had no preference. A few months later, he rode a work train to deliver the first election speech in Churchill.</p>
<p>Mr. Bird was re-elected in 1925 and 1926. He sat in the House of Commons during the decade which has been referred to as the most turbulent political period following World War I.</p>
<p>In 1924, he sponsored the church union bill, legislation which established the United Church of Canada and was a strong advocate of the church union. In 1950 the United Colleges of Manitoba conferred the honorary degree of divinity upon him in recognition of "his eminent service in the life and work of the church."</p>
<p>Mr. Bird came into the national limelight for the misunderstanding about his vote when the Conservatives were defeated in the House of Commons in 1926. This precipitated he 1926 general election which was won by the Liberals.</p>
<p>The vote was close and Mr. Bird had been paired. He rose to make a point of order and the rising was taken to mean that he had voted for the Liberals against the Conservatives. In vain did he try to explain his point, the clerk having counted his vote.</p>
<p>Following his defeat in Nelson in 1930, he resumed his work in the ministry in Manitoba, and in 1936, after completing 25 years in the west, transferred to the Ottawa Presbytery of the United Church, serving as pastor at East Templeton, Quebec, and Gatineau Mills. Ill health forced him to retire in 1950, at the age of 65.</p>
<p>It was then that he and Mrs. Bird took residence in Leamington. He was an intimate friend of the late Rt. Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie King, the late J.S. Woodsworth, the late Hon. Peter Heenan and Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen, and the late Rt. Hon. Ernest Lapointe. But his greatest admiration was for the late Hon. Rodolphe Lemieux, who he regarded as one of the great speakers in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>If Congress is unable to pass an appropriations bill by 1 October (the beginning of the fiscal year), they must provide Continuing Resolution Authority (CRA), which becomes law when signed by the President. This is necessary to prevent agencies from shutting down. The use of continuing resolutions seriously hampers planning and execution because the amount of the approved budget is not known until after the fiscal year has already begun. Normally, rates of obligation are limited and new starts are not permitted while operating under this stopgap funding measure.</p>

<p>The Blackburn Cult was a secret pseudo-religious organization known to early residents of Simi Valley as the “Great Eleven Club.” Select member’s of the order were given bizarre titles like “The North Star of the World,” “The Queen of Scales” and “Grand Royal of the Water and Father’s Blood.” The group was founded by May Otis Blackburn who had come to California from Oregon in the early 1920’s and was officially known as “The Divine Order of the Royal Arms of the Great Eleven.” The cult maintained their headquarters in the high reaches of the Santa Susana Knolls section of Simi Valley from about 1927 to 1930 where they built a crescent-shaped structure that served as their “Mountain Temple.” Inside the temple was a special room that contained a 650 lb. gold throne they called the “Lord’s Chair,” reserved for the second coming. Members of the cult practiced weird religious rites including unorthodox medical procedures, voodoo, nudism and animal sacrifices. Witnesses had seen midnight gatherings conducted by torch light where white animals were sacrificed in a ceremony called the “Jaws of Death.” Knowledge of the group’s strange practices came to light when May Otis Blackburn and her daughter Ruth Weiland were brought up on grand theft charges in Los Angeles in October 1929. During the trial it was revealed they had swindled investors with a bunko scheme to publish a religious book called “The Great Sixth Seal.” Blackburn claimed to channel revelations directly from God and that the book would reveal the location of rich oil and mineral deposits throughout the United States. In the course of additional investigation it was learned that Blackburn and her cult were responsible for very strange practices and the possible demise of some of their elder members. One of the more sensational discoveries was that the cult had kept the corpse of a 16-year old girl named Willa Rhoads in a pickled state for about three years while awaiting her resurrection. Her body was later exhumed from a hermetically crypt beneath a house in Venice, California.</p>

<p><b>Adverse Possession</b> is a legal principle in common law whereby a person may occupy an abandoned or deserted property for a period of time and thereafter claim title to the property on the basis that no action was taken by the original owner to remove the occupant and secure the property.</p>
<p>The common law rules for adverse possession have been codified under both federal and state statutes. A typical statute allows a person to get title to land from the actual owner simply by using the land, out in the open for all to see. For example, your neighbor built a fence on your land with the intention of taking the property, paid property taxes, and you knew about it but did nothing. If this continued for a period of time set by state law, your neighbor may be able to claim this property as his/her own. The theory is that, by not disputing your neighbor’s use of your property through a lawsuit, you, as the actual owner have abandoned your rights to the property. There are several elements needed for adverse possession to result in title:</p>
<p>The length of time required for adverse possession in title varies - it could be as short as a few years or could run for twenty years or more. Typically public entities must establish a longer period of possession than individuals. Some states have adopted a rule which requires the adverse possessor to pay taxes each year on the land.</p>
<p>The possession must be open for all to see.</p>
<p>The possession must be exclusive to him or her (e.g., the fence in the above example, a driveway, road, etc.)</p>
<p>The possession must be hostile to the actual owner of the land.</p>
<p>To gain title to land through adverse possession requires strict compliance with the law, but can have dramatic impact upon land ownership rights.</p>
<p>An encroachment could result in title to your property being transferred to an adverse possessor. Under these circumstances, you might have to bring a lawsuit for trespass in order to prevent your neighbor from getting title to your land through adverse possession.</p>
<p>If you own land, it is important that you do not "sleep on your rights" since you could lose ownership of the land.</p>
<p>In Europe and North America, organized urban squatter movements have used adverse possession as a means to take control of blighted and abandoned properties. By occupying the property and by making good faith effort to renovate it, pay its taxes, reconnect utilites, these groups have been able to prevent city governments from removing them as trespassers and demolishing the structures, giving title to private developers. In New York City, eleven tenaments were recovered from abandonment by squatters who used the principle of adverse possession to take title to the property. One example is the Umbrella House<a href="http://www.fnbnews.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fnbnews.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=20" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> in the lower east side of Manhattan.</p>

<p>Hareball is a game played on a basketball court with one basketball. The goal is to get the ball through the basket, like basketball. The team usually consist of 10-15 people who can go anywhere on the court. The twist here is that the ball can only be hit in an upward motion with an open hand, you can past the ball between your two hands legally. A basket is worth one point and if the ball is slapped in from behind the arc, it is 2 points. There are no out of bounds on the sidelines, but if the ball goes out on the baseline the other team gets the ball and may throw the ball into anywhere on the court. This game was invented and named by members of the 2004-2005 indoor track team at Cathedral HS in Springfield, MA and is named after the infamous coach Kevin Hare</p>

<p>Pisgah Grande was the name given to a Pentecostal Christian community located in Las Llajas Canyon north of Simi Valley. It was started in 1914 by Dr. Finis E. Yoakum, a medical doctor from Denver, Colorado who had come to California after an accident that almost took his life. The name Pisgah came from a mountain in the Arroyo Seco where Dr. Yoakum had a spiritual awakening and decided to devote his life to the lord. Associated with the Christ Faith Mission of Highland Park, California, Pisgah Grande served as a rehabilitation center for the downtrodden of society. Yoakum was known for bringing drunkards, cripples and the disillusioned from the back streets of Los Angeles to Pisgah. It was a place where they could begin a new life by accepting Christianity. The Pisgah newsletter maintained they were “Devoted to the Material Welfare, Bodily Healing, Moral Uplift and Spiritual Life of the Stricken in Body, Victim of Drink, Outcast, Cripple, Hungry, Friendless and Whosoever is in Need of the Waters of Life.” Pisgah Grande was a place where Dr. Yoakum’s converts could have a roof over their heads, receive regular meals and get their life together through spiritual salvation. The colony was mostly self sufficient and had a natural supply of spring water. The colony grew their own food and had carpenters and other skilled laborers to provide the basic necessities of for life. They also built a kiln to make their own bricks that were used in construction of many of their buildings. After a few years the colony grew to almost 300 souls with a number of structures resembling a small town. Pisgah Grande opened their federally chartered post office in 1915 and by that time had built a large dining room for meetings and meals, many residences, corrals for stock and a large brick tower on a hill overlooking the colony. The two-story prayer tower was manned 24-hours a day with converts who maintained continual prayer. One of Dr. Yoakum’s more famous converts was the outlaw Billy Stiles who rode with the Jesse James and Cole Younger gang during the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery of 1876. When Dr. Yoakum died in 1920 the colony soon fell apart and the members dispersed from whence they came. Pisgah Grande remained a virtual ghost town until the 1960s.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-06_12e1.html" title="Edit section: The Go Hard Brothers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Go Hard Brothers</span></h2>
<p>The Go Hard Brothers are an up-and-coming drum and bass/ experimental jazz outfit hailing from the small regency town of Cheltenham, Gloucerstershire. UK. Although they have been active for only a little over 6 months, they are rapidly gaining critical acclaim for their blend of trip-hop rhythms and comedic lyrics. Several notable record labels have reportedly been interested in signing the duo and respected music critic Tom Dalton has described them as "the most exciting band to come out of England since Radiohead".</p>
<p><b>Membership, History and Biography</b></p>
<p>The Go Hard Brothers are infamous in the UK underground garage scene for refusing to reveal their identities and for the very few details that have been released about their private lives. Referring to themeselves only as "Go Hard Brother Number 1" and "Go Hard Brother Number 2", they frequently and often amusingly cover their faces in photo shoots, live gigs or cd covers with masks or super-imposed images. Despite their apparent unwillingness to show themselves or discuss personal matters, they have been happy to discuss the band's history and formation. The two men have been friends since secondary school in the well-respected Pate's Grammar School, Cheltenham but whilst they look back on their time at school fondly, they claim to have been dissatisfied with the somewhat stifling atmosphere of the conservative spa town. "We simply felt that what we wanted to hear wasn't socially acceptable in Cheltenham" writes Go Hard brother Number 2 in the band's first interview with Jas Singh of Bescars fame, whilst Go Hard Brother Number 1 emphasises his desire for artistic singularity, claiming "I always wanted a fresh sound that was totally different from anything else out there and the Go Hard Brothers has given me the chance to create this".</p>
<p>The Go Hard Brothers have, as of April 2006, composed 10 tracks, encompassing styles ranging from bhangra to hip hop and have several more tracks planned for their debut album, "Stick A Fork In It, It's Done"</p>
<p><b>Arguments About Classification and Genre</b></p>
<p>Due to the widely inclusive style of the Go Hard Brothers' music, it is very difficult to label them under any one style. However, some common features of Go Hard Brother music include: -Intense beats and a hard-hitting bass line -Comic lyrics, although they rarely have more than 6 or 7 words in their songs -A range of instruments -A "chill out" or "come down" section in the middle of the song which preceeds a musical climax -A minto intro -Somewhat abrupt or unforeseeable endings, often following a trick ending</p>

<p>What many homosapiens may not be knowledgable of is of the irony in their own lives. This type of irony is called Existational Irony. It is sometimes known as Virgin Irony. This is because the irony is very innocent (as a virgin, who has not yet gotten intament with the opposite sex in bed, or in the case of those who are gay or lesbian, one who has not yet had anal sex), or very subtle. Existational Irony (as already stated) exsists in everyday life. The most common may be that a streetlight is yellow, yet the car races through at a fast pace. Another example of Existational Irony is that an obese man with no life is worried about his weight only because he will not be able to fit through the gates at Disney Land. (This is, of course, only elegible to those with obesity problems.) A last example of this is that a man with an overlly long penis (a very lucky man) wants to get a sex change, chop off his long penis, and become a woman with a vagina instead.</p>

<p>A Defense platform is an orbiting Space Station placed around Earth's colonies during the war against The Covenant. It is built primarily around a giant Super MAC Gun (Magneteic Accelerator Cannon)which fires projectiles coated in ferric tungstein alloy. The projectile is about the size of an Eighteen-Wheeler. Each Station has at least four Pelican Dropship bays. (Two to port, two to starbord.) It usually has an onbard A.I. (Such as Cortana) to help with accuracy and the firing itself. About the size of the <i>Pillar of Autumn</i> <i>Halcyon</i>-class ship,, it is about a kilometer high, including the cannon. An <i>In Amber Clad</i> class cruser can dock with it. (There is a chance a larger ship, Like a <i>Halcyon</i> class can dock, though unlikely.) Known Stations are the <i>Athens</i>, <i>Cairo</i> and <i>Malta</i>, although there are many more in orbit around Earth. The ones at Reach were all destroyed, as were the <i>Athens</i> and <i>Malta</i>. The latter were destroyed from inside by Covenant Bombs.</p>
