<li><b>Comment</b>. There's been <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28news%29_d447.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (news)">some discussion</a>, although no apparent consensus, about the standards that news reports about crimes need to rise to in order to be proper encyclopedia subjects. Versus the obvious fact that they typically <i>do</i> usually meet the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">basic standard</a> of disinterested, third party coverage, there is the sense that we ought not to be creating a memorial to every crime or criminal. As to the specifics of this crime, while half a ton of cocaine is nothing to sniff at — aye, it's a great deal to sniff at — it isn't particularly impressive by U.S. standards; there are at least several thousand people in U.S. prisons who could top that. There are, of course, also <a href="../../../l/i/b/WP%7ELIBEL_4020.html" title="WP:LIBEL">WP:LIBEL</a> considerations when living dealing with people who are accused, or stand convicted of crimes. Have any important legal or police precedents been set by his case? - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 18:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This may certainly be true by U.S. standards, and while that may be an unfair comparison, by British (and arguably European) standards it is one of the largest ever to be smuggled into the country. It was also the subject one of the largest survailance operations undertaken by British customs officials. Additionally, his wife and co-conspiraitor Julie Paterson, apparently a personal friend of actor <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Dalton_911f.html" title="Timothy Dalton">Timothy Dalton</a>, was sentenced the largest prison term ever given to a female drug trafficker. All of the points are stated and cited in the article. Also, if there is discussion on establishing notability on criminals, <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECRIME_b5c5.html" title="WP:CRIME">WikiProject Crime</a> or any of its related projects may also be interested in contributing to the discussion. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 20:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> Although I believe that that the scale of the crime makes it a worthy article, it is based upon such an unreliable source (a single article in the Evening Standard), is lacking in detail and contains so many flaws that it should be deleted. For a start, Michael Tyrrell is spelt with 2 "r's" and he was not married to Julie Paterson (she was a former girlfriend). Michael Tyrrell's partner was Jill Fuller and between them they bought four properties in the UK with a value exceeding £1 million. One of these properties was Orchard Bay House on the Isle of Wight and it was here that the smuggling operation took place. It was Jill Fuller who was convicted of money laundering (not Julie Paterson) and she got a sentence of 4 years. Jill Fuller was a friend of Timothy Dalton and he was a character witness at her trial. Julie Paterson did indeed receive 24 years, the longest sentence for a female trafficker in the UK, although this was subsequently reduced to 22 years on appeal. The comment that this crime is small by American standards is not a good reason for deleting this article but it so fundamentally flawed, it should go. Negferret 14:45, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If there are obvious flaws or otherwise innaccurate information, then it should be corrected, not deleted. As I live outside the UK, my sources are limited to internet news articles and reference books generally between 5-10 years out of date. However, I would assume editors from Great Britain would be able to provide more substansial inforation and references. Obviously as this infomation has since been corrected, this issue should be resolved. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 23:33, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The same case could be made for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Jung_600e.html" title="George Jung">George Jung</a> or Zachary Swann, however both men are also considered notable drug dealers as well. While it would be unfair to compare between American and British drug traffickers (given the larger customer base, supply/demand, street value, etc.), the fact remains Tyrell's career is just as notable as a number of drug traffickers already existing on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 23:33, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, there are few sources available online at this point but they do attest to the "record £100M haul", so there's that.

<li><b>Comment</b> The sources cited are mostly from what is known as the 'gutter press' which thrive on salacious gossip and are known for sensationalism. It is laughable to rely on such tittle tattle. When time allows, I'll present further information from reliable sources such as the UK Government agencies and the BBC. The article should not be published until it is corrected Negferret 18:50, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Tentative Keep</b> the criterion for criminal notability is still ambiguous, but I think this article does fit the general criteria of inclusion set by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, since the person has been main subject of articles on several national newspapers. Until new rules for notability of criminals are set by wiki community, I say now we should keep it, at least for now. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooyi_6e7f.html" title="User:Wooyi">Wooyi</a> 04:09, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as many sources appear to exist. The fact that many of those sources are not available online is a horrible argument. Please imagine for a second what Wikipedia would look like if we would not allow offline sources. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.
