<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
This debate was split evenly down the middle numerically. However the main argument for keeping the article was that it was supposedly a revenge nomination for another article that was deleted, whereas the main argument for deleting the article was that it did not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. When the acrimony has subsided, the result of this debate may be cited as trending towards delete.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> My nomination aside, I really don't think this page should be deleted. My only goal here is consistency on Wiki. Every reason given for the deletion of the Protest Warrior page is just as applicable to the White Rose page. If PW stays, WR should stay. If PW is deleted, WR should be deleted.

<li>Two points: (1) What does the mention consist of? An advertisement? If so, that does not make it notable.

<li>I have a problem with hypocricy. You constantly make bad faith nominations based upon political revenge, many of them successful, yet you are the first to cry about motivation.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ben, as I'm sure you're aware the AfD process is not a vote but a <i>discussion</i>, and if you continually interject to provide facts helpful to a single side of the debate, you're a <i>de facto</i> partisan, no matter how piously you proclaim your neutrality. I reiterate my <b>Keep</b> recommendation. This article is little more than an advertisement for a not-very-popular website, but what of it? Once political partisans begin engineering AfDs for articles they find objectionable, it will never end. It has in fact already begun with the Burch-orchestrated removal of Conservative Underground; let's bring it to a swift and speedy end. Ben, I find your crusade against Wikipedia articles referencing politics you do not share to be in stark conflict with the liberal ideals you purport to espouse, but in compliance with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> I will refrain from accusing you of baldfaced hypocrisy. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 19:22, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I do apologize. I said "I'm sure you're aware" that the AfD process was a discussion and not a <i>vote</i>, but apparently my assumption was hasty and you weren't in fact aware of this. I have done as you suggested and checked the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Conservative_Underground_75fd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Conservative Underground">process for the deletion</a> of Conservative Underground, which was initiated by <i>you</i> on January 11... for reasons, I might add, of a "low Alexa page rank", which happened to be three times higher than the rank of the page which is the subject of the article currently under consideration for deletion. Somehow, Your Neutralness has failed to point this out in your comments on this page, but I'm certain it was just an oversight. Again I find myself struggling to conform to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, which is difficult when confronted with what to all appearances is stark hypocrisy and attempted censorship, and I offer my apologies to any Wikipedians offended by any portions of this comment which cross the line.

<p><b>Comment</b>. Ben Burch brought this on himself for alleging that media attention and Alexa traffic reports were needed for a encylopedic article. His pure hypocrisy is the main reason why this article is being subjected to deletion. I can tell that he is trying to act like the 'nice guy' or 'neutral' on this article. Also, I think that it was he that started the deletion process for the CU article, unless I am mistaken, and his website has a <i>dismal</i> traffic report compared to CU. I think that this article could be deleted based on WP:Web. <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdh_24_ff1e.html" title="User:Jdh 24">Jdh 24</a> 22:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Allow me to buck Ben's expectations and vote <b>Keep.</b> I don't agree with him on a lot of things, and probably don't with about 3/4 of the material on his site, but that's irrelevant to an encyclopedia article. I contend that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is also a poorly conceived policy, as Alexa rankings, especially on sites that attract tech-savvy (and thus non-Internet Explorer using) users, are inaccurately low since Alexa cannot count hits that come from browsers immune to it's spyware. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 01:49, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, thank you. Honestly, I am not sure the White Rose entry meets WP:WEB or WP:NOT, but you are right about Alexa. Here are the statistics for my root server (it has a 10 Mbps line, there are four other servers with 100Mbps lines not included in this, but this hosts all of the actual html) <a href="http://www.WhiteRoseSociety.org/stats/stats.html" class="external text" title="http://www.WhiteRoseSociety.org/stats/stats.html" rel="nofollow">White Rose Root Server Stats</a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 05:25, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's all irrelevent, Ben. One does not gauge notability by the size of one's, um, "equipment." The "mine's bigger than yours" bit won't help you. And it's odd that you've suddenly decided to change your mind about Alexa when it's <b>your</b> site that's on the line.

<ul>
<li>Of course the amount of equipment is irrelevant! I am just clarifying. Alexa does a good job of sites like PW or CU because the users are more likely to install their spyware. When comparing two sites which are similar in their user base, like FR and CU or PW, Alexa is a fiar basis for comparison. WRS's user base, for example, has more Mac users and more Linux users than FR does. I know this as I have posted images to busy threads on FR and watched the logs to see what fetched them. But in any case, go look at the log files and you will observe that 17,000 unique users per week use White Rose. Why don't you ask your people how many use CU in the same interval? And of course none of this makes WRS or CU notable at all. I think neither are notable. Like LU isn't notable, and PW isn't notable and NU isn't notable and DW isn't notable. I would move to delete entries on any of those. And that is why I have not opposed the removal of WRS. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 17:00, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are full-length audio files documenting American political discourse from the left over the last five years in great detail, with some files going back into 2000. I am using it now in my doctoral dissertation on opposition politics in the USA. Assuming this site persists, it is worthy of an encyclopedia entry for just that reason; To guide researchers such as myself to this resource.

<li><b>Keep</b> Examining the site statistics provided above I see that this site serves almost twenty thousand unique IPs every week. And I can only assume that most of those are repeats given the nature of an archive site. This makes it notable. 82.142.150.82 00:36, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the description of the website, verbatim:</p>
<p>Mmp3 audio archive of talk shows criticizing George W. Bush.</p>
<p>There are hundreds-if not thousands-of websites that host either audio files, or video files, or columns criticizing President Bush. I don't think anyone can seriously assert that Wikipedia should maintain entries on each and every website that has content that criticizes President Bush.</p>
<p>The only noteworthy talk show host listed on the main page of his site is Randi Rhodes, who is heard on a scant 33 terrestrial radio stations, and, according to a 2005 Talkers magazine survey, was not even listed among the top 25 syndicated talk show hosts in the country.</p>

<dd>Steve, No contracts involved. I archive shows by permission, and the show hosts mention the archives because they want to. Some do it every show every day. Others, such as Randi Rhodes do it so infrequently that I get emails from my fans telling me that she did it. But I am still myself unsure of the encyclopedic notability of this page. White Rose I have no doubt is notable; I have 15,000 hours of Liberal/Progressive talk radio archived on the site, going back to 2001 for some of the shows, and serve around 17,000 unique people weekly. If I didn't think it was notable and important I wouldn't be doing it. But I am not at all sure if an encyclopedia needs to take note of it. It's not Planck's Constant. It's not Charles Darwin. And you don't have to say that you are going to be fair about this.

<dd>Well, "notability" obviously must subtract how we feel about our own work--it deals solely with how the "world" or the community that surrounds the entity thinks about and treats said entity. <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crooks_and_Liars_b2dc.html" title="Crooks and Liars">Crooks and Liars</a> has been around since 2004, it archives audio/video of interest to the left, and it's notable because in the left-wing blogosphere, one trips over all the references to it. However, I don't notice this same kind of tripping over WRS mentions. I think that necessarily, for a website to have notability, it must be deemed important by its most natural constituency, and for WRS, that is the same (or very similar) constituency as that for Crooks and Liars. Also, just because an entity acts as a great voluminous resource doesn't automatically make it notable--notability is whether a lot of people, especially influential (well, notable) people commonly refer to this resource as some kind of "must-see". I guess I'm just going to have to see more evidence of notability... like mentions in mainstream sources--I read above that Randi Rhodes has mentioned it sometimes... if something like this is documented (as in transcript documentation) as a regular occurrence from Rhodes or other notable personalities, I would be inclined to vote at least "weak keep". Links to several transcripts like this would do the trick for me. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:white; background-color: green;">&#160;<b>Stevie is the man!</b>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 03:02, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as there are not textual transcripts prepared for any of these shows, that is a tough call. Listen to the last ten minutes of Mike Malloy's show, or Bob Kincaid's show and you'll hear me and the site mentioned by name. Unlike Crooks &amp; Liars, I don't archive "events". They have clips of exceptional things that happen in the video realm. I have a daily archive of nine different shows, also archives of several weekly shows, and never take anything offline. Want to hear what Randi Rhodes said the day that Bush landed on the carrier? It's there. And people do refer to the site when they need to refer to a particular show in their blogging. Drudge mentioned me once over a skit that Randi Rhodes' people played that seemed to imply somebody shooting the President, and I had about 38,000 visits that one day! Here is an lgf mention of the same event; <a href="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=15635" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=15635" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> But honestly I am not going to defend White Rose's page here because I don't really know why White Rose, or DU, or FR, or CU, or PW belong in an encyclopedia.

<dd>It should be obvious, but Wikipedia is a encyclopedia/reference while those other things are web search engines. Not everything that is notable has a great presence in search engine results. Also, it might be helpful to think in these terms: Would talking about WRS be suitable for a history book with regards to left-wing broadcasts? Does WRS have a significant degree of indispensability to left-wing broadcasting?

<dd>Well, honestly, I don't want to be in the position of defending this entry. Go look at the server stats linked above if you want some idea of how important it is to the people who use it. 17000 unique users in the average week, and that does not include streaming users or users of our usenet postings of every show we archive, or people who go directly to the mp3 directories and skip the html pages. Is it indispensable? Many think so, but I have no particular desire to document that, though I am happy to answer your earnest inquiries as best I can. The best indication of that is that people donate money to me for what they can download from me for free, This is the third fundraiser I've run at the $10,000 level since last September, and we succeeded with the first two, and are well on the way to succeeding with this one. But, honestly, I don't care if White Rose has a Wikipedia entry or not. My log files show me about 200 hits from that page, most of them during this AfD and the last one. Ppeople don't come to White Rose though looking for White Rose! They come to it by looking for Randi Rhodes or Mike Malloy, or Thom Hartmann. This entry is likely an appropriate jumping off point for the links on their individual Wiki pages, sort of a disabigualtion, but one that could easily be dispensed by having a direct link in all of those individual places. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 04:38, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this determination should be based upon this website's notability within the far-left Web community.</p>
<p>Even using that criterion it fails miserably.</p>
<p>Compare the amount of sites that link to the WRS-a little over a hundred-to the number that link to more popular leftist, vehemently anti-Bush websites, e.g. Bartcop, which has over 800 sites that link to it, or Common Dreams, which has over eight thousand sites that link to it.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that if it is not his job to defend this entry then he should cease to defend it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it simply lends credence to my assertion that this is an advert.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Burch has not come forward with any evidence to demonstrate that "many" believe his website to be an "indispensable" resource, nor has his claim that LGF, i.e. Charles Johnson, not a user on that website, mentioned him or his website been born out.</p>

<dd>I believe that more than just a majority is required for an article to be deleted. Here's another area where learning about how the Wikipedia works could prove useful for you, Anonymous One. It requires a super-majority of what I would call "non-conflicted" votes, that is, votes that aren't sockpuppets, and votes that have no conflict of interest. Also, I think admins look at whether something has been renominated too soon after its previous nomination--if it is too soon, the result here may be possibly voided. This is all my understanding, of course, as I am not an administrator (at this time, heh). — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:white; background-color: green;">&#160;<b>Stevie is the man!</b>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 17:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Politically motivated revenge AfDs should not be rewarded. Neither this one nor the PW one ought to go forward. Shame on on jinxmchue. You pretend to have the interests of this encyclopedia in mind, but you are simply playing a cynical game. You are beneath contempt, as is Mr. Burch for having nominated PW. 62.101.75.14 23:45, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Turnabout is fair play.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia wants to address the legitimate issues raised by its detractors it needs to ensure that avowed partisans, such as Mr. Burch, have no role to play-whatsoever and under any circumstances-in the moderation or deletion process.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This page seems to be absolutely harmless to Wikipedia. It brings into the Wiki new information in the form of the actual existance of a number of Liberal/Progressive talk radio shows. Reading the above, it seems to me that the only people arguing otherwise (other that Mr. Burch himself - are you sure that is really him and not a vandal?) are people who are trying to get back at Mr. Burch for another AfD. I simply cannot imagine that this process we see here serves any interest whatsoever. I think the closing administrator ought to declare this a keep for simple vitriol and meatpuppetry. 213.59.99.178 01:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You apparently did not notice the Wiki admin-I believe that's what they're called here-who voted to delete, upon further reflection.</p>
<p>Or the other (liberal) Wiki users who voted to delete.</p>
<p>And yes, that vituperative, loutish fellow who uses the name Ben Burch is actually Ben Burch in real life.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should consider that, and reflect upon what it says about the administrative controls in place at this website.</p>

<p>Well, liberals were never known for their wit, although I admire your attempts at sarcasm.</p>
<p>Seriously, do you think Mike Malloy is more notable than Al Franken?</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge no AAR host has distinguished him or herself in the ratings book, but the hosts you highlight are particularly obscure, at least in terms of generating large audiences of devoted listeners.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, Laura Ingraham, among others, all have large numbers of listeners who disagree with their political point of view, which is a testament to their popularity, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Can you assert with any credibility that there is a single radio host you link to who reaches an audience beyond their own narrow political constituency?</p>

<p>Among all listeners 12+, it was a race to the bottom for AIR AMERICA and WLIB as mid-days went from a 1.6 share during winter 2005 to a 1.0 share winter 2006.</p>
<p>During PM drive, host Randi Rhodes plunged to 27,900 listeners every quarter hour, finishing 25th place in her time slot, down from 60,900 listeners every quarter hour in the fall.</p>

<p>One of the more popular hosts on your page.</p>
<p>In the recent ratings period, Air America in Austin didn't record any significant listeners under 25.</p>
<p>It might be a ratings anomaly, or maybe young liberals are simply listening to music, satellite radio, and podcasts.</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - There wouldn't be anything like this much effort expended to CENSOR White Rose if you were not notable, Ben. We here love your archives and my iPod is filled with your podcasts each and every morning. We especially like the commercial-free edits you make to Thom Hartmann's show, and we also really enjoy Lizz Brown's show. BTW, When are you going to have an archive page for Bruce Burch's new show on the Head On Radio Network? I work when he is on the air and have not been able to listen yet! 82.119.205.115 00:02, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specious logic.</p>
<p>The only reason any effort was exerted to delete this entry is because Burch is notorious for squelching any speech that he disagrees with, which led him to nominate CU and PW for deletion.</p>
<p>The controversy has nothing to do with the WRS itself, which is too obscure to merit comment, but rather the jihadist tactics of someone who is neither liberal, nor a supporter of free speech, despite claims to the contrary.</p>
<p>My own opinion is that if this entry is retained it should be merged with the wholly unnecessary Ben Burch Wiki, which even its subject has admitted is not noteworthy enough to keep as a stand-alone article.</p>
<p>71.125.240.18 00:15, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are obviously a die-hard fan of his-and the shows he's archived-which leads me to believe that your "strong keep" recommendation has very little to do with the merit-or lack thereof-of this article, in my humble estimation.</p>
<p>If this article is to be retained it should not be retained on the basis of adulatory fans, who offer no impartial reasons for retention, unless you consider one's fanship reason enough for a permanent "keep."</p>
<p>71.125.240.18 00:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> This site is mention on the air daily on Mike Malloy's show, and he considers it to be his official archive site. Peter Werbe, Guy James, and Bob Kincaid never, ever do a show without mentioning White Rose and Ben Burch by name. 61.70.131.246 01:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are no-name hosts.</p>
<p>The most famous being Mike Malloy, who was replaced by the Satellite Sisters on AAR's signature network, the retooled-and much worse, IMO-WLIB.</p>
<p><a href="http://gammablog.com/?cat=52" class="external free" title="http://gammablog.com/?cat=52" rel="nofollow">http://gammablog.com/?cat=52</a></p>
<p>I'm not saying that Malloy's Wiki should be removed, only that the fact that he refers to Burch-no matter how frequently-does not qualify Burch for a Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>If Burch were a regular on a show hosted by an even moderately well-known celebrity, e.g. Al Franken, I would render a different opinion.</p>
<p>71.125.240.18 01:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, the very least that should be done, if this entry is to be retained, is to merge the transparent vanity page, re: Ben Burch, with the larger stub on the White Rose Society.</p>
<p>I don't think even Burch himself would object to that course of action.</p>

<p>Even Ben Burch has not claimed that his website serves "tens of thousands" of people.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has "tens of thousands" of page-views, or has tens of thousands of visitors, however I find it extremely hard to believe that tens of thousands of people are utilizing this resource on a consistent basis.</p>

<p>Sorry for the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I was referring to his claim-which I take at face-value-that his website is mentioned "nine times."</p>
<p>Either weekly, or daily.</p>
<p>I forget which.</p>
<p>He hasn't mentioned-to the best of my knowledge-that he's a correspondent for the Mike Malloy Show-which is alluded to in his Wiki-but I presume that he would cite that as another reason to retain this entry.</p>
<p>As I said before, if no consensus can be reached the simplest course of action would-in my opinion-be to simply merge the two Wikis.</p>
<p>Even Ben Burch has not objected to that, based upon his comments with respect to his own Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>Granted, the notability of this website is a contested issue, but I don't think anyone is seriously suggesting that Ben Burch-as an individual-merits an entire encyclopedic entry, even if it is merely a stub.</p>

<p>I'm still not seeing how this data/IPs served info (which isn't sourced to a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, natch) has anything to do with <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it shows that 274,691 distinct IP addresses accessed the site over the 224 days since the log file was started. And that is not fully inclusive as it misses the servers where most of the binaries are, and the icecast streams. Are distinct IP addresses equivalent to distinct users? Most web sites take them as such. So, somehow, a quarter of a million distinct people found and used the site in that interval. The vast majority of them went after the three Air America hosts; Thom Hartmann, Mike Malloy, and Randi Rhodes. Said content is provided by permission from a well-known and notable entity. Indeed, in the case of Thom Hartmann, I am a contractual publisher of his material and pay a sizable royalty fee for it. But this is not actually Web-Specific content. It is RADIO content, translated into a form that can be hosted on the web. This makes White Rose much more like <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live365.html" title="Live365">Live365</a> than like <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drudge_Report_b304.html" title="Drudge Report">Drudge Report</a>. Live365 produces no content, but it is notable because it serves so much of the streaming content of others. Likewise, I produce very little content, but WRS is notable because it archives, podcasts, and streams so much of the content of notable entities, and does it for so many people. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 06:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did read it, but White Rose doesn't exactly fall into the categories it pertains to. As to a Reliable Sources? The only press mention that I know of is here; <a href="http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/6176506p-6052764c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/6176506p-6052764c.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> But the web sites for the shows I archive, which are all acceptable primary sources as they are the web sites of established notable business entities do mention or link to White Rose, here are a few; <a href="http://www.thomhartmann.com/showlisten.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thomhartmann.com/showlisten.shtml" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.mikemalloy.com/listen.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mikemalloy.com/listen.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://headonradio.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://headonradio.com/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://lizzbrown.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://lizzbrown.com/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Also there are any number of mentions on established blogs, including bradblog, atrios, takebackthemedia, bartcop, dubyad40.com. Just explore <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:D8-ob993rjIJ:www.whiterosesociety.org/&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=80&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:D8-ob993rjIJ:www.whiterosesociety.org/&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=80&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22whiterosesociety.org%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22whiterosesociety.org%22" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> for MANY such mentions. If that's not enough, then I guess there is not enough, but I'd wager that is more than some other pages well established on wiki have. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 07:09, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That site mentions White Rose in passing as a "liberal talk show site" (and does not elaborate further, making it a trivial reference) and the Goodwriters link seems to just be a link page. Can you provide me with a citation from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">RELIABLE SOURCE</a> (not a blog, not a forum) that mentions WRS more than in passing? (Meaning, not "Download our older shows here" or somebody's link page or whatnot.) Without that, WRS is less like a service like Live365 and more like non-notable site that hosts notable primary works, no more noteworthy than a site that hosts pictures of notable paintings or scripts of notable movies. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So there's no way to source any non-trivial claim this article might make? As far as I can tell, the only verifiable thing this article can claim is "The White Rose Society hosts show X, Y, and Z." There are no-outside, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> even stating that you run it. This is a problem, and this is why we don't have articles on these sorts of minor sites. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
