<p>The result was <b>Delete all</b>, on the balance of arguments, not the&#160;!vote tally. The main argument for keeping appears to be that adding this unencyclopaedic information to the main entries bloats them (a view to which there appears to be no significant dissent), therefore the unencyclopaedic information should be in a separate article. I find that extraordinarily unpersuasive. Lists of the films in which a particular weapon can be glimpsed are almost without exception original research, and there is no suggestion that these are the <i>subject</i> of the films. We don't have an article for, say, the Ford Crown Victoria in popular culture because every US cop show based in the last decade or so will <i>of course</i> have Crown Vics in it; similarly, every war film orr shoot-em-up based in the 39-45 period will <i>of course</i> have the Garand and various other weapons in it. The content is functionally equivalent to a list of popular culture references to combat based in the period <i>foo</i>, where <i>foo</i> is the period over which the weapon was used. A subsidiary argument for keeping is "I like it". <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> does not trump <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. We have no authorities for the vast majority of content here, and no authorities for the significance of the individual weapons within the pop culture item (film or whatever) nor of the significance of the film to the subject. The example of the F-14 and Top Gun cited in the debate is an excellent one; where a weapon is integral to the plot of a film that justifies a one-liner in the main article. Where it's a prop, it most surely does not. Finally, as per the nomination, if we have a reliable source for the ubiquity of the weapon in films of a period, then that, too, can go in the main article. We do not need a list of World War II films in every article on any weapon used in World War II. To pick an example not in this collection, the <a href="../../../m/3/_/M3_Half-track_9b54.html" title="M3 Half-track">M3 Half-track</a> was used as the generic half-track, on all sides, in almost every film, with very few notable exceptions. That doesn't take long to say and we sure as hell don't need a list. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:06, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am nominating the following "Firearm X in Popular Culture" pages, because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, specifically, it is not a directory of prop appearances. Moreover, these articles incur severe <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problems. Visual confirmation is often insufficient; there is often debate over which model of M16 is represented; short of commentary from the prop staff, these lists violate <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</p>
<p>This follows the AfD's <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_firearms_in_films_d555.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of firearms in films">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of firearms in films</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_firearms_in_video_games_5f93.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of firearms in video games">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_firearms_in_video_games</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_M16_rifle_in_popular_culture_d03a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/M16 rifle in popular culture">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/M16 rifle in popular culture</a>.</p>
<p>While I cannot rule out the existence of an item of pop culture that prominently featured a firearm in the way that <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gun_ad49.html" title="Top Gun">Top Gun</a> featured the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a>, none of these rise to the occasion. Even if it were, it would deserve a 1-liner in the main article. A wholesale list of prop appearances is irrelevant and often speculative. What's next? Honda Accord in popular culture? Ikea furniture in popular culture? I am willing to accede that a reliable source may make a statement about the ubiquity of some firearm in a film; such a statement should go in the original article.</p>
<p>These are not articles. That much is clear. A comprehensive list is unmaintainable, difficult to verify, and ultimately original research unless the prop director can be quoted on the matter. Visual confirmation does not satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, as evidenced by the debates over what a weapon was. (is that a MAC-10 or a lookalike? Which Beretta did he carry? Who cares?)</p>
<p>Can they be converted to lists or categories? Given the severe verifiability problems and notability issues, I say not. Do we need a category for each prop?</p>

<li>I have created some of these articles, and my reason for doing so was to keep this kind of trivia out of the main firearm/weapon article. If any pop culture section is left in a firearm/weapon article it tends to grow out of control as every video-gamer wants to put their favourite game in, same thing with movies. If we just delete these references as and when they are put it in leads to revert wars and the whole thing just becomes a never ending maintenance issue on the articles. Some say "only leave in the references which are somehow iconic or significant", but of course that's entirely subjective as to which are iconic or significant. The solution which seemed to work best was to create the separate articles for pop culture refs, so that they could just grow and all the gamers and film buffs would be happy but the main article would be left alone. Not ideal - I agree that this stuff shouldn't be in at all, but it WILL keep being put back in the main articles unless you give them somewhere else to put it. So I say <s><b>Keep</b></s> unless someone has a better solution to the problem of pop culture cruft. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERiddley_ccb7.html" title="User:Riddley">Riddley</a> 03:10, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment (Neutral)</b>. I agree that this is not encyclopedic, not notable, etc., and shouldn't be in a separate article. But I have seen similar things in other articles. The "Messiah" article once had a section on "Jewish Messiah Claimants" that eventually wound up taking up about 3/4 of the article with a list of nobodies. The result was that people stopped contribting useful information until the list was split into a separate article. Deleting the articles and protecting against recreation will simply restart the problem in the main articles. <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 06:42, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<li><b>Delete and protect all.</b> I'm not opposed to having <i>one single article</i> listing all of these references (e.g. List of firearms in popular culture), as long as we keep the main articles free from these references/lists and all individual "…in pop culture" articles are deleted and protected. <i>—<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqualla_56c6.html" title="User:Squalla">Squalla</a> 15:47, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> These articles prevent the content from filling up the pages on the individual firearms (look at the histories for the pages if you don't believe me: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GLOCK_18&amp;oldid=60614362" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GLOCK_18&amp;oldid=60614362" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MAC-10&amp;oldid=57741172" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MAC-10&amp;oldid=57741172" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Another comment: if we trimmed it down to merely 'notable' appearances, there's a huge grey area there. It's obvious for movies like <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_at_the_Gates_594b.html" title="Enemy at the Gates">Enemy at the Gates</a> that the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosin-Nagant_d0e6.html" title="Mosin-Nagant">Mosin-Nagant</a> should be listed, as the movie centers around one man's interaction with this rifle. But what about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boondock_Saints_5afb.html" title="The Boondock Saints">The Boondock Saints</a> and the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Eagle_1553.html" title="Desert Eagle">Desert Eagle</a>?

<dd>I think the point is that <i>in the article about the weapon</i> <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosin-Nagant_d0e6.html" title="Mosin-Nagant">Mosin-Nagant</a>, there's no encyclopedic point in listing movies, television programs, video games, novels, short stories, and paintings it made an appearance in, perhaps not even a point in listing the fine film <i>Enemy at the Gates</i>, when the article already mentions sniper Vasily Zaitsev, who is portrayed in the movie. If there was some cultural or other significance <i>about the weapon's portrayal</i> in the movie, it may be worth mentioning, but <i>just having appeared</i> is not notable in itself. (Mentioning the weapon in the article about the film <i><a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_at_the_Gates_594b.html" title="Enemy at the Gates">Enemy at the Gates</a></i> is a different question, but I notice the model of rifle isn't even significant enough to mention there, except in passing in a trivial bullet-point about a poster-illustrator's mistake) &#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-10-01&#160;01:45&#160;Z</small></i>

<dd>Yes, my point was that this stuff should be kept off of the weapon pages, and the best way to do that is with the pop culture pages. Most movie pages are generally void of weapon mentions, except for action-centric movies like <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equilibrium_%282002_film%29.html" title="Equilibrium (2002 film)">Equilibrium</a>. And about verifibility -- would something like <a href="http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mhb3/boondock.htm" class="external text" title="http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mhb3/boondock.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> (a page I made in about 3 minutes) be sufficient to put down that the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Eagle_1553.html" title="Desert Eagle">Desert Eagle</a> was in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boondock_Saints_5afb.html" title="The Boondock Saints">The Boondock Saints</a>, or do we actually need more than that? --<a href="../../../u/n/h/User%7EUNHchabo_7c60.html" title="User:UNHchabo">UNHchabo</a> 04:33, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Verifiable perhaps, but—please don't take offence—not a reliable source. If three-minute web pages start to be considered suitable citations, then we have a problem with not only 50,000 items of trivia which can easily be deleted to improve the encyclopedia, but the icing on the cake would then be a constantly-growing web of tens of thousands of "authorities" which no one could ever fact-check. Better to honour the word and spirit of encyclopedic notability (see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>), and keep the trivia elsewhere.&#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-10-01&#160;16:56&#160;Z</small></i>

<dd>My point was that from that screenshot it's plainly obvious that the pistols are <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Eagle_1553.html" title="Desert Eagle">Desert Eagles</a>. It's the only pistol shaped like that, and according to the canon of the movie, they're fifty caliber (hence .50AE). It's verifiable, as anyone who watches the movie can say for certain that the screenshot is accurate. With those going for us, and the fact that the site is 3rd party (so <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is taken care of), does it really <i>need</i> to be a "reliable" source?

<dd>My point is that you are ignoring <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. I haven't seen the movie and I am no armourer, so I don't know if that is a screen shot from the movie or if those are indeed so plainly obviously and unambiguously Desert Eagles. I also have no way of knowing whether the editor who cited this "reference" and its anonymous author knew what they were talking about (nor do I know that the screenwriter who gave Agent Smecker his line knew what he was talking about). What you are advocating is choosing to ignore <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> when you feel that it's obvious to you, and to ignore <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> by making your own bogus "references". I agree that some things are so widely accepted that citing references to support them is not a high priority, but I completely disagree that what you're describing constitutes a reference at all. As an example of what a real problem this would be, I keep having to remove armour values from modern AFV articles: they are usually uncited, usually pasted from some mil-fan forum or other, and sometimes an editor will revert-war over them until I eventually track them to their source at an "armour estimates for wargamers" page—quite a lot of work removing false information because someone didn't take these Wikipedia guidelines seriously. &#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-10-01&#160;23:16&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but for different reasons. I think these articles should be trimmed and reformatted into something other than lists, so that we only mention notable appearances (such as signature weapons of main characters, or pivotal roles, or places where they're specifically referenced) but I think that such a trimmed version would have no need to be separated out, and could be integrated back into the main article except for big cases like the AK-47, which has massive massive influence. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 21:56, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>To quote Wikiproject aircraft as linked above: "This section should not be a compendium of every trivial appearance, but significant ones of relevance to the airframe. The canonical example would be Top Gun for the F-14 Tomcat. Due to the large number of survey and arcade simulations, an effort should be made to avoid tallying every sim appearance unless there are very few of them. Fictional versions and speculation about fictional likenesses should not be included, as they constitute original research." I agree with that, just replace top gun with james bond and the F-14 with the Walther PPK. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 22:02, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The big-picture solution is for someone to create a TriviaWiki or PopCultureWiki sister project, so <i>all</i> of this less-encyclopedic information, which does have some value after all, can be offloaded there.
