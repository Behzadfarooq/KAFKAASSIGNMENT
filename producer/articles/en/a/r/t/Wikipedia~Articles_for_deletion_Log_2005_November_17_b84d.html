<li>That's a strange new meaning of the word "legitimate" I wasn't previously aware of. You could have simply deleted the material; instead, your edit summary for the deletion from <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bomb.html" title="Google bomb">Google bomb</a> read "Accomplished Googlebombs - move to own page)" Since you almost immediately put up that "own page" for deletion, it sure looked like a way to delete the section without raising suspicions. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 12:44, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>The new article should either be kept, or deleted. Merging back into the main article should not be an option, because the article was over-long. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 12:29, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This would be the case if there was a consensus that removing <i>this</i> information from the main article was the best way to tackle the length issue. As it is, there appears to be a consensus here that it should be merged back in: after that, a different method can be found to solve the length issue, such as splitting out a different section (if there's another one that could be split out), or simply editing the text down so that the same information is conveyed more concisely. However, the appropriate place to discuss such solutions is the article's talk page, not AfD. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:45, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm trying to figure this out... let's say you have an article that is contains what you think is an extraneous section... it seems that one choice is to just edit the article and remove the section... but perhaps you're not <i>sure</i> that the section is extraneous... you want some more sets out eyes on it... wouldn't doing as nominator did -- removing section to a seperate article and putting it up for a 'vote' at AfD serve that purpose? Perhaps nominator was trying to more 'democratic' by using this method? That being said, if this is nominator's intent, then:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Nominator need to explain what he is doing! Nominator's post at the beginning of this section is the <i>first</i> explanation that nominator has offered, belatedly. Suggest nominator explain <i>in original nomination</i> to avoid much mutual misunderstanding!</li>
<li>Could nominator put <b>Article#Section</b> in AfD? And say "I'm going to delete this <i>section</i>, are people OK with that?" If this is proper, I'm pretty new so maybe that's not allowed.</li>
<li>This would be faster than using Article:Talk. But one problem is, AfD is awfully long to wade thru as it is. So maybe using Article:Talk would be better. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:32, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The article isn't for vanity, it's an amusing entry for an amusing message forum that has become reasonably famous with fans of lower league football. The forum goes from strength to strength, and the fact that it has posters from such diverse places as Fort Worth, Texas or Oslo, Norway shows that it has a worldwide appeal.</p>
<p>For Wikipedia to be the "Encyclopedia of the Internet", forums such as The Barrel should be included, as it has brought a lot of humour and friendship to the lives of many, many people. It may be a clique in some ways, but that's because its repuation hasn't been built up enough yet to the wider populace. Gone are the days of it being a football forum, indeed - now it is a scribbling board for the thoughts of its users.</p>
<p>Keep the page, let us keep it updated (and perhaps remove some profanity if you'd rather) and it'll become something you'll wonder why it was considered for deletion.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Is she so successful? I never heard about her (which doesn't mean much). On Amazon all her books have a sales rank less than 200000.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I don't see what a book's Amazon.com sales rank have to do with anything. The Deverry books have been well recieved by critics, as well as by readers. Consider also that Daggerspell is still in print after almost two decades. Chris F. 01:53, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> — As fantasy authors go I think she is relatively successful. I've read several of her works and she's a solid, respected author in the field.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure what the "notability" criteria are, but folks should be aware of some points. The print media references in the article are in fact legit. If that is enough to make this entry notable, then it is in fact notable. The links are unfortunately "verifiable" only to those registered with the publications in question. The NY Sun and Editor &amp; Publisher refer to the blog by name, but the WSJ refers to it only via a link. Here, for example, is an excerpt from the 6/28/05 <i>NY Sun</i>:</li>

<p>I think we need more women listed in this Encyclopedia. Wikipedia could distinguish itself in the long run by including info and articles not included in a more conventional encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Are we trying to recreate the Encyclopedia Britannica? I don't think we can do that, but we can make this even better.</p>
<p>I think if we follow the ideas of Brim, we will have very few women included. I'm a little bit tired of having the vast majority of biographies in encyclopedias only about men.</p>
<p>I also think that Wikipedia could distinguish itself by including articles on subject not included in conventional encyclpedias. That's what I hope to see. People will have the incentive to go to Wikipedia if it has interesting articles not already covered in Britannica. I don't want people just going to Wikipedia just because it is free. Is that the real goal of the open source community?</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune had a very large eulogy about Harriet Mazel. I don't really see why this is something that should be deleted.</p>
<p>We need more articles about women in encyclopedia articles. Fuddlemark, very good idea about merging, but I do think there is a good case for keeping the article. Finally, I think that this article will eventually be expanded to include more details about her life.</p>
<p>Google should not be a test of whether something should be included in this encyclopedia. We certainly don't want to include information about only things that are popular and well known.</p>
<p>I think that when somebody is doing a report on women in hospital administration, it would be nice to have an example of a woman ceo from 1982.</p>
<p>I also think making a reference to family name of poster is not the best argument. We should rely on the strength of the information available and not make conclusions based on somebody's family name.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am impressed by your enthusiasm and well-thought-out defense in support of keeping the article. Perhaps other Wikipedians will see your side and vote in support of keeping the article. To convince others to vote with you, I think you'll need to convince them of the notability of this person. Notability is obviously very subjective, as it depends on the readers experiences and personal biases. However, Wikipedia has made attempts at establishing rough guidelines to notability, in particular notability for people in biographies. You should read <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>.</dd>
<dd>There are a lot of people in this world. People living and people living long ago. Obviously everyone has done something notable to some degree. But not many people have done something notable enough to be included in a general encyclopedia like Wikipedia. I think my mom is pretty notable. I could write several screenfulls about my mom, and she and I would think it's really neat, but would the general readership want that? No, of course not. The rest of the world doesn't care about my mom, because to them, she is no one special. That's a bit of a silly example, but I hope you get my point. What if every person of even the slightest notability were included in Wikipedia? It would be ridiculous. There are a lot of people who are notable in the community, a lot of very industrious people, a lot of business owners, policemen, but we don't have articles about all of them. As such, we don't have articles about all hospital administrators, because, there are just too many of them, and outside of doing their job of administrating, they haven't done much more notable stuff. Would anyone want to read an article about my hospital's administrator? No, probably not.</dd>
<dd>Not everyone agrees on what we should include. We have guidelines, but not everyone agrees with those. That's why we have voting, and a somewhat democratic system here. You may want to make your voice heard over on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_5662.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies</a>.

<p>She is notable enough simply for the matter of being the first woman director of a hospital in Chicago and one of the first in the nation. I really think this type of attitude is going to result in 90% of the biographies in this encyclopedia being men, and that's rediculous.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're the only one who sees her as a woman. Nobody else has mentioned her gender in their reasons above. Man or woman, this person simply is not notable enough for inclusion in this type of encyclopedia. There are plenty of actual noteworthy women you could write articles about.

<dd>There are plenty of women who are more notable and have achieved more than the subject of this article. Why not choose one of those other women to write an article about? Or you might consider writing an article about the Hodgini Circus Family, of which Harriet was a member - a brief bio of her could be part of this page. Incidentally, if you're taking a feminist position on this, Harriet becoming a director by stepping in for her husband when he passes away (in 1986! is she really one of the first hospital female directors in the nation?) is not really the ideal feminist lesson (perhaps, if it were 1886) - and even less so is her being married to several famous husbands. Her circus career might be highlighted instead.</dd>

<p>I would like to weigh in on this discussion as well. I think Harriet Mazel Szanto has led an extremely interesting life. Going from a circus performer, to wife of a lt. governor, to finally head of a hospital. And do you think she achieved this only by being married to Dr. Mazel? Would you argue the same about this with Hillary Clinton in the Senate in 2002? Also, it appears here that all of the posters are men.... Would this have some influence on the process? It's unfortunate that it seems like there are so few women involved with Wikipedia. Cokie Roberts just published a book called the "Founding Mothers" in it she analyzing the lives of the women married to the men who founded this country. Their influence and ideas did have a tremendous impact on the formation of country. Even as late as the 1980s, the only way women could often get important roles were through their husbands. It's still rather rare for a hospital administrator to be a woman. I firmly believe Harriet Mazel Szanto led an interesting, noteworthy, and achieved enough to be included in this encyclopedia. This is what an open source community is all about. Hannah Podlevsky, 19 November 2005</p>
<p>Additionally, I think that Harriet Mazel was an important part of Chicagoland history-HP</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not quite sure what you mean by "this is what an open source community is all about". This is a selective encyclopedia with submission guidelines enforced through voting processes (like the voting happening here - you need to state your vote and sign your comment with your User name and time), community editing, and administrators. Also note that comments from new users with nothing in their user history except their entries in the discussion in question might be ignored by the administrator under the prevailing guidelines. Harriet Mazel is not comparable to Hillary Clinton. I'd still like to see her as part of a Hodgini circus family page though. The Hodginis sound like fun.</li>

<li><b>Neutral &amp; Comment</b>: The rational for keeping this article is an example of what I call "cumulative notability": none of the subject's individual experiences or accomplishments, in my opinion, really meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but when added together (circus performer + prominent hospital administrator + married to weakly notable person), might recognize that the person has achieved a particular degree of public recognition and notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is already a Wikibook about learning Japanese. While the article is said to have been transwikied to Wikibooks, a little more thorough integration of it into Wikibooks would have made it look a little less like this was just a case of "dump into Wikibooks and delete". --DannyWilde 00:55, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't know a whole lot about WB, but I imagined that they would have room for various books with different approaches. One might be an introduction to students who have already undertaken academic study of a different foreign language; another, a phrasebook for people planning travel or a homestay; a third, an overview of business Japanese etc. Also, I figured that on WB, it's up to the author to either integrate the material into an existing WB project, or keep it independent and distinguish it in some way from other books. "Dump and delete" is one point of view; another is "identify the right Wikimedia project for it and move it there." <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 06:57, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please exmine the history of an article prior to nominating it. I've reverted this to a really measly stub that doesn't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> but can probably be expanded into an average article. Also, please don't write "obvious reasons", actually <i>write the reasons</i>. I know it's tedious, but it doesn't take that much extra time to say "per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> this is not encyclopedic" or something like that.<br />

<p>Google News proudly features this “news” article from jihadunspun.com, a known pro-terrorist propaganda site... No, instead we start with the fact that Google News was the focus of an article by honestreporting.com on this same pro-terror site back in January. Six months afterward, Google still features the pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic web site as a valued news contributor...There are many sites of questionable veracity to draw news articles from, but in light of the well-documented pro-terrorist background of Jihad Unspun, one might start to question the motives of those at Google News that still consider Jihad Unspun a valid news source. <a href="http://confederateyankee.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://confederateyankee.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:54, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

This is a good example of why one can't effectively retract an AfD nomination: other editors, acting in good-faith, have expressed their desires for the article and should still be listened to.

<li><b>Delete.</b> No more useful than a category. And Inaccurate on the face of it, since agnosticism was originated by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_H._Huxley_6028.html" title="Thomas H. Huxley">Thomas H. Huxley</a>—as noted in the list itself—and <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/50/A0145000.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/50/A0145000.html" rel="nofollow">the first recorded use of the word was in 1870</a>, so saying someone born before Huxley was "an agnostic" is as wildly speculative as calling someone born before Christ "a Christian." There is no obvious connection between the religious beliefs of many of these people and the things for which they are noted. As with some other lists of this kind, it is poorly defined and badly sourced. For example, it includes "<a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenzin_Gyatso_eb73.html" title="Tenzin Gyatso">Tenzin Gyatso</a>, (1935-), the 14th and current Dalai Lama," but our article on <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenzin_Gyatso_eb73.html" title="Tenzin Gyatso">Tenzin Gyatso</a> does not say he is an agnostic and our article on <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalai_Lama_3904.html" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> says (as you'd expect) that "The current Dalai Lama (the 14th) is a respected Tibetan Buddhist religious leader." So, this is really a "List of people who some Wikipedians thinks are agnostics, or would be if they had lived after 1870, and regardless of what they themselves declare their religious affiliation to be." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:46, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> The reasons given here justify improving the article, not deleting it. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a> is one among dozens of lists at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_belief.html" title="List of people by belief">List of people by belief</a>, all of which serve as useful supplements to their respective "ism" articles, since they help put beliefs in a cultural context by linking them with widely recognized people. I see no reason to suppose that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a> cannot be made just as useful as these other lists. Since agnosticism is a general epistemological position with regard to a belief held widely throughout history (theism), it is perfectly legitimate to apply such a label to persons who lived before the word was coined. The position existed long before the word was coined. Agnostics who lived before Huxley coined the word may be listed, as may people who have not used the word explicitly to label themselves, provided it can be substantiated that their position is consistent with the position described in <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">Agnosticism</a>. Buddhism is consistent with agnosticism, since Buddhism is not a theistic religion. The Dalai Lama might not be an agnostic, but his Buddhist faith does not preclude that possibility. There are people on this list whose agnosticism ought to be verified. There also might be people who ought to be removed from the list. But the article itself ought to remain. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 05:59, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Nothing you've said explains why a list of agnostics shouldn't go in the article on agnosticism. Why split it off from its context?</dd>
<dd>The list <i>can't</i> be "improved," it can only be rebuilt from scratch, because nothing in it says what the criteria for inclusion are or what the justification for including each name is. There's so much garbage in there that every name needs to be checked individually. The only way to fix it would be to remove all of them and add names one by one, with proper citations of other articles or sources. There are less than fifty names now, and in all likelihood there would be far less than fifty after you eliminate the Buddhas and the Protagorases and the people whose agnosticism is a footnote completely unrelated to their notability. It's not as if the list were too long to include in <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> or as if <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> were to long to include them. By my reckoning, <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> is less than 16K.</dd>
<dd>Lists such as these tend to accumulate borderline articles because they can be perceived as trivia challenges. "Can I think of someone to add to the list?" Worse, they become unintentional POV forks. Main articles are watched closely by people familiar with the subject matter. I don't think you could get someone into the article on <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> without its receiving some degree of review. But lists are treated far more casually. Someone who has <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> on their watchlist wouldn't even necessarily know that the list has been created. And, people treat lists as a sort of challenge: "Can I contribute to this list? Can I think of someone who could possibly go on this list who isn't there now?" So, they tend to accumulate borderline items, rumors, vague memories of vague claims, and so forth.</dd>
<dd>As for agnostics before Huxley, would you accept a list of Christians who lived before Christ or Muslims who lived before Mohammed? Suppose someone were to argue that Christianity and Islam do not exclude each other, for which a good case can be made—I believe Muslims make precisely this claim. If someone made a good case that some Christian prior to Mohammed had Muslim-like beliefs, would you accept that person on a list of Christians?</dd>
<dd>Conversely, you say "Buddhism is consistent with agnosticism." Well, Christianity is consistent with Judaism. Would you accept Christians on a list of Jews? Episcopalians on a list of Catholics? Unitarians in a list of deists?</dd>
<dd>But it doesn't matter what you or I think. We are not authorities—well, I am not, anyway—and Wikipedia is not founded on the authority of its contributors. This list itself as a "list of agnostics," not a list of people who Rohirok thinks are agnostics or list of people whose beliefs are not inconsistent with agnosticism. Can you find any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> evidence that the Dalai Lama calls himself an agnostic? What business have people got putting the Dalai Lama on a list like this without providing such a reference? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:23, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Incorporating the verified agnostics (those who self-identify as such, or those who express a documentable view on the knowability of God that can correctly be called "agnostic") into the main article might be a good idea. I still believe that a list of agnostics is not inherently inappropriate for Wikipedia, and that such a list can be made every bit as edifying as the many others also in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_belief.html" title="List of people by belief">List of people by belief</a>. I believe there is a double standard in viewing those other lists as acceptable, while rejecting the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a> whole-sale.</dd>
<dd>The list can be improved, by making the criteria for inclusion specific, and insisting on documentation for each entry. I agree that the criteria shouldn't be "whoever a particular person thinks is an agnostic." It should be whether this person is/was in fact, and verifiably, an agnostic (and this does include people who don't necessarily use the word to identify themselves, since the concept of divine unknowability existed before the word was invented to fit the concept. For example, certainly Huxley was an agnostic before he came up with the word). A list in the main article might be ok, as long as it doesn't get too long. A category has the drawback of not allowing for clear and easy citation to justify a person's inclusion in the category. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">List of atheists</a> is a good example of how <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a> could be improved by making inclusion criteria specific. The temptation to add unverified trivia will be diminished when such criteria are explicated up front.</dd>
<dd>The case of revealed religions is not at all comparable to that of agnosticism with respect to adherence before coinage. Belief in revealed religion is dependent on the revelations of a prophet or prophets, and it is indeed untenable to claim that such a religion had adherents before it was "revealed." However, agnosticism is not a revealed religion dependent on the teachings of any prophet. As I said before, it is a general epistemological principle with respect to God, and does not depend on any revelator for its existence. Did Huxley "reveal" agnosticism to the world? Of course not. He merely invented a word for an already existing concept.</dd>
<dd>Concerning Buddhism/agnosticism compatibility: I never suggested that anyone who has a belief that is not incompatible with agnosticism ought to be listed here, but only that identification by another label is not necessarily grounds for exclusion. Some belief systems are compatible or overlap with others, while others are exclusive. Many Unitarians were Deists, and many Deists were Unitarians, so it's not unreasonable to have some people on both lists. In fact, Thomas Jefferson is one such person. (Note the call on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Deists_4528.html" title="List of Deists">List of Deists</a> to "redefine the list, complete it, prune it, or discuss its parameters on the talk page." This would be an appropriate notice for the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a>, and better than outright deletion. Again, there is a double standard at work here.) I take issue with some of your claims about the supposed compatibility of other belief systems, but will skip over those objections and cut to the salient point: Making distinctions between belief systems can be complicated, but it is possible to do it with reasonable care and verification, and the existence of these lists of people by belief can help clarify the overlaps and distinctions.</dd>
<dd>I grant that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a> needs more specific criteria, it needs pruning, and it needs verification.

<li>Oh dear. This is only one of three bad faith delete votes I've ever done. Every time I do it I feel fairly guilty. Well except the one most widely seen as bad faith, List of virgins. That was only not totally bad faith, I really do think that list is silly. However if "list delete mania" hadn't caught on I admit I wouldn't have bothered. My first "bad faith delete" vote was "<a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationmaster.html" title="Nationmaster">Nationmaster</a>" because I got so irritated with the snarkiness of the editing process there I thought it might shake "things up." I was newer them. This one was because I got mad about religion related lists being hated so I wondered if irreligion lists would get the same treatment.

Anyway I did start believing what I was saying so thought maybe I wasn't in bad faith. That came after about 30 hours of no sleep. After a good sleep I realize now I have made a terrible error as it seems this really will get deleted. That's not what I want. I would like it to be cleaned up and essentially "tightened up", meaning limited to people who strongly identify as Agnostic, but I regret the idea of deleting it.

<li>I went ahead and deleted all of those listed whose own biography pages on Wikipedia did not verify their agnostic status. Note that Protagoras remains, though he predates Huxley's coinage of the word agnostic. This is because he wrote: "Concerning the gods, I have no means of knowing whether they exist or not or of what sort they may be, because of the obscurity of the subject, and the brevity of human life." That's agnosticism, folks. Those I've deleted <i>might</i> be added in again later, but only if whoever adds them can verify their agnostic status with a citation. I'm watching the page, and will be vigilant in enforcing this standard. I believe these changes adequately address the important concerns of those who have thus far supported deletion, and invite them to change their votes. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 07:25, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Go one step (admittedly medium-large step) further and I'll support.</dd>
<dd>A current problem with the page is that although it <i>says</i> "Those whose agnosticism cannot be verified are not listed here," that passive-voice leaves unanwered the question "verified on whose authority."</dd>
<dd>If each name were to be accompanied by a supporting quotation and a source for that quotation, preferable a quotation <i>from the person listed,</i> then there'd be no problem because the reader could then judge for himself whether or not the person used the word agnostic, and, if they did not, whether they were agnostics in the opinion of the reader.</dd>
<dd>That solves the verifiability/authority problem and it makes an interesting page that seems to have some reason to exist beyond categories or the individual articles. For example:</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../p/r/o/Protagoras.html" title="Protagoras">Protagoras</a>, (d.420 BCE), Greek Sophist and first major Humanist: "Concerning the gods, I have no means of knowing whether they exist or not or of what sort they may be, because of the obscurity of the subject, and the brevity of human life."

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists can provide something categories never can: specific information on each entry in the list, vitally important to something as vague as "agnosticism", with its numerous definitions and gradations. If anything, a category would be much <i>worse</i> than a list because it wouldn't be able to explain the nuances or situations surrounding each individual's specific agnostic beliefs, or provide sources or citations to justify the claim that the people listed are indeed agnostic. Categories are only better than lists when (1) having everything in a single, alphabetically-ordered list is preferrable; (2) no information whatsoever needs to be provided for the individuals so categorized; and (3) the category's topic is not significantly disputed or overly complex, such that any of its entries would require sourcing to justify inclusion. 2 and 3 fail, and 1 may fail as well (if we decide to expand the list to include all variants of "agnosticism" and have different sections for each), so clearly a list is better than a category in this case—though I see absolutely no reason not to do both.

<li>The reason for it to have its own article is because we expect it to become much larger.

Merge it if you really want, but I prefer merging articles where there's not a strong chance that it will have the potential to be a good article on its own in the near future. And the argument about a separate page keeping away the <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> editors is invalid, because it could be used to argue against <i>any</i> page separations—anyone interested in <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> can easily monitor this page as well, as it should be linked to quite prominently on that page.

I don't think the AfD can/should be withdrawn. I am opposed to almost all listing by religion because an individual's religious beliefs are far too complex to be neatly summarized on a list- most people struggle with religion throughout their lives.

<dd>I respect that, but in a way a Category has a worse problem on this. In a list you can in least annotate and explain. In a category a name is just there and kind of effects the article. If a priest was on record saying sometimes he wasn't sure about the existence of God a poorly thought out person could add <a href="../../../a/g/n/Category%7EAgnostics_26af.html" title="Category:Agnostics">Category:Agnostics</a> to his name almost as easily as he could add him to this list. Maybe moreso because lists seemed to be watched much more strictly now due to the proliferation of, what I'd mostly agree, are stupid ones. Added to that nothing on his article is changed by being on a list, whereas Categorization does.

<li><s><b>Delete.</b></s> First, the problem with the case for "fixing" is that unfortunately these lists have been constructed in such a slipshod way that it is impossible to fix them, because the list a) does not specify what the inclusion criterion are, and b) does not provide any shortcut to determining whether an entry fits the criteria other than to research each one from scratch. They are intrinsically unfixable and unmaintainable. If the first sentence had say, for example, that this is "list of composers whose Wikipedia articles cite them as adhering to Roman Catholicism during their adult life" something could be done. But, in any case, b) this list serves absolutely no function that a category would not serve better. Finally, c) "to be a source of pride" to a specific group of people is not Wikipedia's mission. In fact it is somewhat at odds with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>, and in the long run could even result in silly list-duels.

<dd>You can't be one-fourth Catholic. Anymore then you could be one fourth atheist or or one fourth Muslim. It's not an ethnicity, as Jewish or maybe Zoroastrian(as traditionally they downright discourage conversion) would be, it's a religion. Either you believe, or believed, it or you don't. Even if you accepted one fourth of it, (this doesn't quite work but to give some sense that'd be like, "I like two of their sacraments, but I could do without the other five" or "I like Purgatory, but I can't go for intercession of saints or Papal infallibility or transubstantiation" or "I accept priestly celibacy, but as a non-priest I want to have lots of gay sex, group sex, and non-marital sex"), you wouldn't be one-fourth Catholic.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Comment</b>: No, and I doubt that I could identify the nationality/sexuality of the composer, the particular symphony or even the style of music. The same goes for painting. The fact that I can’t is not a disqualifying factor. Since I think religion/sexuality/nationality etc. can all strongly color artistic expression, I have no problem with listing artists and composers on this basis. These facts may not always be necessary to judge/appreciate an individual selection, but are often essential to understanding meaning and context (i.e. knowing <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Byrd_dab5.html" title="William Byrd">William Byrd</a> was Catholic does seem critical; that <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copland.html" title="Copland">Copland</a> was American and Jewish adds meaning to his work; just like Picasso’s nationality adds force to <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guernica_%28painting%29.html" title="Guernica (painting)">Guernica_(painting)</a>). I understand the inherent dangers of all these lists. In the present case, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahler.html" title="Mahler">Mahler</a> would seem to be a bit of a stretch. If this was a List of Catholic symphonies rather than composers, I might vote delete.

<li>Yes. However, the presence of other inappropriate articles in Wikipedia is not a justification for including this one. If it were, there would be a rapid "race to the bottom."

<p>This is a collective nomination for the <i>List of Catholic musicians</i> and the <i>List of Catholic actors</i>. The fact that the people listed there are Catholic is incidental to their profession as artists.</p>
<p><b>Do not categorize members</b> of the lists as Catholic unless they are prominent as <i>followers of Catholicism</i>.</p>
<p>In case someone says "But <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinead_O%27Connor_d539.html" title="Sinead O'Connor">Sinead O'Connor</a> is notable for being excommunicated" I'd answer that she is indeed notable for that but that fact that she is Catholic has no bearing on her career as a singer. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 00:35, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cooment on that, FWIW: I would guess that the fact that she is (or was) Catholic had a lot to do with why she has strong feelings about the Pope. Which led her to tear up the Pope's photo on national TV (most Protestants, Hindus, etc. wouldn't do that 'cuz they would care that much about about the Pope). Which severely impacted her singing career, nagatively.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:54, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The fact that a Catholic theologian is Catholic has a bearing on his work. The fact that any actor is typically has not.

<dd>Interesting. I've noticed how many of you seem to think being of a religion has no more effect on peoples' lives or careers then riding a unicycle or having blond hair. Which is odd. I don't recall a period where scientists were refused entry to certain schools or garnered praised by millions even partly for their hair color. Look at some on the Catholic list and it's probable you will find people refused from Oxford for their religion. You think that had no effect on their science career? You really think there is no more interest in Christians or Catholics in science then there'd be for the former waiter idea?--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

For instance, I only know <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bette_Nesmith_Graham_1b04.html" title="Bette Nesmith Graham">Bette Nesmith Graham</a> is a Christian Scientist because another biography of her mentions it and her setting up of multiple foundations, so I assume she's set up some for the church. A random article I checked, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Paulson_6ac7.html" title="Hank Paulson">Hank Paulson</a>, mentions he's devout but nothing else. I think that for this list to be useful it shouldn't just list anyone in Wikipedia who's a member of the church, as that's more what categories are for. — <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder"><big>☎</big></a> 16:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Simply tracking which biographies in Wikipedia identify their subject as Christian Scientists should be done with categories.

<p>Also "<i>Important people to the religion who have been very public supporters</i> belong in the article on Christian Science." is an argument to merge.

<li>I'd just like to reiterate though that that was not my intent when I created this. I am not Christian Scientist. In fact in a test I took Christian Science was listed with Scientology as "religions you have the least agreement with." I had and have no interest in inspiring their pride, shame, or whatever.

<dd>Wow I did better then I thought at explaining/fixing. And yes I agree on the title problems mentioned below. Although awkward I think "List of Christian Science adherents" would be acceptable, to me in least. As long as we make sure both "Christian" and "Science" are capitalized.

<li><b>Comment</b> If kept, the title needs a bit of thought. As I suspected, the official name of the church is <a href="http://www.tfccs.com/index.jhtml;jsessionid=1LBRPMPH1FLBVKGL4L2SFEQ" class="external text" title="http://www.tfccs.com/index.jhtml;jsessionid=1LBRPMPH1FLBVKGL4L2SFEQ" rel="nofollow">Church of Christ, Scientist</a> with a comma. I've been clicking around their website for about five minutes now, with no luck, trying to find out what phrase Christian Scientists use to refer to themselves. I actually believe the site may be sidestepping this; it usually just says "members," members of what being of course understood. Anyway: IMHO</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>List of Church of Christ Scientists</i> doesn't work because without a comma it's <i>not</i> the name of the church. In fact, there's a serious ambiguity, because a Church of Christ scientist (with a small s) could mean a physicist who is a member of a local <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ_acd4.html" title="Church of Christ">Church of Christ</a> congregation.</dd>
<dd><i>List of Church of Christ, Scientists</i> doesn't work either.</dd>
<dd><i>List of Christian Scientists</i> would work if not for the ambiguity problem. One could argue that there <i>isn't</i> an ambiguity problem because a "Christian Scientist" with a capital S means an adherent to Mary Baker Eddy's denomination whereas as "Christian scientist" with a small s means a scientist who is a Christian, but... that argument would be silly.</dd>
<dd><i>List of Christian Science adherents</i> is OK but awkward.</dd>
<dd><i>List of adherents to the Church of Christ, Scientist</i> ditto.
<dl>
<dd>As they use the word "members" would that work? I mean it's still a bit awkward sounding, but possibly better then this title. "List of Church of Christ Scientists" having the comma deal wrong and I suppose is possibly begging a question. (Like "List of Church of Christ Scientists...what? People, churches, organizations, other?)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:08, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>List of members of Church of Christ, Scientist</i></dd>
<dd>I think the second is OK, not great... sounds too much like it's trying to be a list of <i>all</i> of them...</dd>

<dd>I agree there were many suspicious ones. I voted against most of the "lists of religious people" delete votes. I did vote in favor of deleting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Catholic_scientists_c443.html" title="List of Catholic scientists">List of Catholic scientists</a> at first because I said it was redundant with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christian_scientists_f688.html" title="List of Christian scientists">List of Christian scientists</a>.

<dd>The discussion on this page isn't about anonymous IP voting like so many people assume - it's about the page itself - voting to keep a list just on the principle that it was an anon vote (which is allowed ANYWAY) does not take into account the real reasons why this list should be deleted and is frankly immature. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 04:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Given the sensitivities involved in the list topics being nominated, I intend to start voting <b>Strong Keep</b> for all anonymous noms. Call me immature. Cheers --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:27, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The reason this list probably wasn't deleted during the first try was because, like now, people took it too seriously and worried too much about "offending" others than actually analyzing the list. There has been a history of DELETE votes for these type of lists. See List of Jewish Members of the French Academy of Sciences, List of Jewish Members of the French Academy of Sciences. This is the only one left that was made for a nationality (Brits - in some way). As you showed us above, some voters just choose a hysterical "keep!!!!!!!!!1" without really looking at the reasons for deletion (of which there are numrous). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 04:35, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I could care less about offending someone with my votes and I also don't think I've ever voted Keep for any list on VfD. I reiterate my comment above. The anonymous nom and anonymous lobbying on my talk page for a recent VfD close call on an apparently sensitive topic bothers me. If that is immature and hysterical I stand accused. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:45, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"a nationality (Brits - in some way)" - an interesting remark. If they're Fellows, they're British citizens, so why qualify it with "in some way" - aren't Jews who are British citizens as much Brits as anyone else? Actually, this isn't just restricted to Brits; nearly half the list are foreign members. - 86.129.89.139 13:40, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm voting against a merge, because it's going to wind up being a long, long list of cover songs; the Chipmunks have very easily recorded thousands of songs over the last forty-eight years.

<li>Louisiana Baptist University does not fit the category of a <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degree_mill.html" title="Degree mill">degree mill</a>. They have an on-campus program and they have significant degree requirements that rival nationally accredited schools. Furthermore, Duncharris simply has an anti-fundamentalist agenda (not to mention anti-Gastrich agenda) which can be seen all throughout Wiki.

<li>I have no idea what BBFI is, or if they are approved. But, please disregard everything you read at LBU's web site (which is the link you gave). It's all meaningless. As an example, they also say they're an ACSI member, but forget to say they aren't accredited (in other words they paid to be considered, and were rejected). I'm a little disturbed the good name of ACSI was dragged through the mud in this article. This is why private school (or institution) web sites, are never to be considered reliable sources of information (without verification). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:51, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - We are not investigative journalists out to debunk diploma mills (if this is one). Let real journalists do that, and publish their findings in respectable sources. Then, write an article that cites those sources. Also, the article relies heavily on a private school's web site, which it should not. The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/free.christians/msg/2920c9ef366cf7df" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/free.christians/msg/2920c9ef366cf7df" rel="nofollow">usenet</a> "footnote" is entirely unacceptable "research". Without reliable verifiable sources, its very easy for us to misinform people, either slandering a legitimate organization, or promoting an illegitimate organization. Also, I'm not a fan of weasel words that involve talking about something, without saying it explicitly. NPOV shouldn't be obtained by "<i>They say this, but others say that. In one way they're real, but in one way they're not</i>". NPOV should be about citing authoritative sources on facts, and also citing notable published opinions on all sides. If there's a lack of these things, no valid article can ever be created. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:44, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. POV or not, this meets notability standards.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I am in agreement with Rob, since the notability of the institution is principally derived from the way in which it operates to legitimise its students with degrees, the value of which is highly debatable. How do you debunk an institution without engendering <i>necessarily</i> a POV viewpoint. The article should state up front that it is what is commonly known as a Diploma Mill (instead of just unaccredited), but that would lay the article open to NPOV complaints. It is unclear how a neutral rewrite can satisfy this fundamental tension. Better to just kill it. Also, is this a for-profit institution? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 09:26, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If you find half as many well noted published competing opinions on all sides, specifically about LBU, brining NPOV to this, I'll be totally in support of an article. Also, your examples are off-point. I support a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">diploma mill</a> article (which is the closer analogy). I also, wouldn't support an article on Louisiana Institute of Creationism (or Louisiana Institute of Evolution), if it had the same problems <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">Louisiana Baptist University</a> has. Right now, this article rests largely on "sources" like UseNet. I'm not in principal opposed to any non-accredited institution ever getting an article. However, if there isn't what I feel, is a good basis for a verifiable NPOV article, then I am opposed. Note: accreditation isn't an end unto itself. Its simply one good form of verification. Other forms (like widespread news coverage, in noted publications) are also valid (but not present in this case). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:46, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>So, in order to qualify for a Wiki entry you have to exhibit a strong web-presence - the sort of web presence that this alternative entertainer actively avoids? Or perhaps Wiki is a celebration of purely commercial success i.e. you can't be relevant or well-know with charging an entrance fee?</p>
<p>To think that Carrot Top has a page in a user-defined dictionary, and that Luke Wigney is up for potential deletion is both disturbing and telling.</p>
<p>Either Wiki is a user-defined project, or it is not. This performer may well never appear on network television, but the absolute pleasure he brings his modest audiences is beyond description. We need performers like this to show us what we've been missing.</p>

<p>It’s hardly likely that you’re going to find much about Luke Wigney on the internet, that’s kind of the whole point of adding him to Wikipaedia in the first place. If we could pull this information off of a website, why would we be searching Wiki for it?</p>
<p>The idea that a live performer can enjoy cult status without charging money is unusual these days, as is his genuinely successful bid for relative anonymity, but that’s part of the Morningstar charm.</p>
<p>The books won’t turn up on Amazon: they were never priced. Each book was the ticket that let you into the reading room where he performed for the afternoon, reading extracts, taking questions, and generally encouraging the audience with their own creative writing.</p>
<p>Of all the events I have attended in my life, I have never felt so empowered or as inspired as I did walking home from the “Vampire Churches of Newcastle Upon Tyne” book gathering in Leeds.</p>
<p>I don’t know anything about the films, they are shown sometimes by the Halloween Society and other film clubs that I don’t live close enough to join. I imagine they are a similar sort of set up as the book readings though. I’m sure Liz Orange can fill this part in better, being a director.</p>
<p>I don’t think my writing all this is going to convince you of his commitment to alternative entertainment, or even a long list of famous bands that enjoyed their first break under his events, so I leave it to the man himself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.goth.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=b95d24f520b0ff7d3319fc434b287036;act=ST;f=23;t=10420" class="external free" title="http://www.goth.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=b95d24f520b0ff7d3319fc434b287036;act=ST;f=23;t=10420" rel="nofollow">http://www.goth.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=b95d24f520b0ff7d3319fc434b287036;act=ST;f=23;t=10420</a></p>
<p>Please read the advice he gives to this fledgling band all the way through (it continues for about 10 posts after the first reply, and gets better and better as he warms to his subject) before deciding whether to delete him or not.</p>
<p>Thank you for the effort you are going to on behalf of a few music-loving bookworms. I do enjoy Wikipaedia, and was thrilled to be able to add to an entry that meant something personal to me. I’m sure I am not the only one who pulled out their old box of vinyl for the music section. I have some more entries, but I’ll wait and see if there is even going to be an article first.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work - when we get broadband I’m going to sign up to be a proof-reader here, if you’ll take me.</p>

I hope this helps. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">malo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalo_a798.html" title="User talk:Malo">(talk)</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malo_4444.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malo">(contribs)</a></sub> 10:17, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The featured article's "verifiable source" is a commercial press release! So, in other words, if Luke Wigney had a website with exactly this information on it, and he had the information cloned by a PR team across several fake fan sites, you would accept this as legitimate? The wiki rules for inclusion seem to imply that if it can't be googled, it doesn't exist in a meaningful way! Google is a commercial venture, designed to return a profit for its shareholders. Almost all of its content is commercial in nature, especially the criteria for high listings. This is precisely the very last place you will find information about this anti-corporate performer.</p>
<p>That's why I added to the original article here: I was hoping that a public access encyclopaedia would be an inclusive and community-minded project that he might approve of himself. It turns out that "User Defined" actually menas "Can it be Googled?".</p>
<p>If I can google it, why would I wiki it?</p>
<p>I'm hoping the original poster will come back and help me out here - if it really is Liz Orange, I'm sure she can do this a hundred times better than I can.</p>
<hr />
<p>Me again:</p>
<p>“Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A large fan base, fan listing or <b>"cult" following</b>”</p>
<p>Just about sums up how fans of Luke Wigney describe themselves; I know that I have joked with my husband “I’m off to my cult meeting now…” when going to one of his gigs.</p>
<p>He is responsible in part for kick-starting the revival in live rock music at a local level in the UK. Before he came along with his “anyone can do it” approach, we were stuck with stadium rock or pub rock. Luke’s organisation of the network of medium-sized venues now means that we have a legitmate alternative to commerical cynicism or bands who are just mucking around. Yes the scene is pretty secretive, but with articles like this proposed wiki one, it won't go completely unacknowedged before it inevitably sells-out (or so it seems).</p>
<p>“100 year test -- In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?”</p>
<p>When we’re finished listing it, yes, anyone with an interest as to the hows and whys and whens of the British rock music scene at the turn of the millenium will find this information essential, especially as Luke looks set to maintain his low-web profile.</p>
<p>Right! No more from me! Thank you Malo for at least humouring me this far. I really do think that you should include him in the wiki project, or at the very least acknowledge on the front page that original articles without commercial application are unwelcome.</p>
<p>Who in 100 years time is going to type in the word "cool" specifically looking for a Gwen Steffani record????? They might type in "Wigney" or "Morningstar" looking for a bio of the man who helped Brtish alternative music back up on its feet.</p>

<li>Maybe the page should be renamed then. No AfD is required to move a page. We don't delete articles simply because they're misnamed.

<li><b>Comment</b> Reading <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Peikoff_8d24.html" title="Leonard Peikoff">Leonard Peikoff</a>, it seems that Peikoff's view of Objectivism, presumably as presented in this text, is not univerally held by post-Rand Objectivists, that is it should be a subset of <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_philosophy.html" title="Objectivist philosophy">Objectivist philosophy</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Content (all two lines of it) should certainly be moved to <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Peikoff_8d24.html" title="Leonard Peikoff">Leonard Peikoff</a>. This will simply turn into a book review if kept, and that is not encyclopedic. Since there is already an entry under the author, why split this off? On a separate note, I would propose that individual books of philosophy merit their own page only when their importance becomes detached from that of the author (which is not the case here). Thus emblematic would be Nietszche's <a href="../../../a/l/s/Also_Sprach_Zarathustra_31dc.html" title="Also Sprach Zarathustra">Also Sprach Zarathustra</a>, while that other page turner, Hegel`s Dialectic : Five Hermeneutical Studies by Gadamer, should be listed under the author's entry. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 10:38, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is an encycopedia and should contain encycopedia article. Keeping stuff that should be at Wikibooks won't improve their amount of visitors and defeats the purpose of having it.

<li><b>Delete or merge</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of facts. Take out the unencyclopedic facts (the list of packages in the standard library - of interest to nobody but Java developers, who should be looking in the Java library reference manual, not on Wikipedia!), and you have a very short article describing Java's library management system. Now, Java's library management system may be interesting, but it is not so notable that it needs an article of its very own. It should be placed in context: either a brief description of it in <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_programming_language.html" title="Java programming language">Java programming language</a> (which is overlong already, but there's a lot of cruft in it that could be edited down to make room), or in a more expansive article that describes its relation to other hierarchal library systems, like the one used in <a href="../../../h/a/s/Haskell_programming_language.html" title="Haskell programming language">Haskell</a> for example? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:37, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Frankly, I don’t see much use for this in the Wikipedia. This reads like a programmer’s language manual and reference guide. It does not seem likely that anyone would refer to the Wikipedia to learn how to use and program in Java. There are plenty of excellent reference manuals and websites that provide detailed information and instructions on Java programming (and all other languages). ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 01:24, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am a member of the Republic of Volerum, and Captain Porter told me that he put up an article on Wikipedia. Even though it is small I was sad when I looked at it today and it was up for deletion.

<li>Well, I didn't actually tag it as such, specifically because it didn't seem to fall under that category: Patent Nonsense (G1): <i>No meaningful content or history, text unsalvageably incoherent (e.g., random characters). This does not include: bad writing, [...] immature material, [...] hoaxes, [...] unless the material is actually unsalvageably incoherent.</i> — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 15:33, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><s>seems closer to G2.</s> I get the (G1) reference now. Its from WP:CSD not WP:PN. Good point.</li>
<li>At any rate, this article is some sort of a vanity or exaggerated biographical joke, certainly not a hoax (because it is unbelievable and unverifiable), and not encyclopedic. Hard to tell what to call it because it is nonfactual and nonsensical. For whatever reasoning, we should also delete the article Samuel Knapp, by the same authors. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidrowe_2574.html" title="User:Davidrowe">DVD</a>+ <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidrowe_7558.html" title="User talk:Davidrowe">R/W</a> 18:00, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. We definitely need a CSD category for obvious nonsense/hoax biographies, which are depressingly common. They're pretty instantly recognizable, along the lines of "<b>[real name]</b> is a small, furry forest creature..." or <b>[real name]</b> is a bad-smelling green alien..."

<p>All articles should be approachable by laymen, or even high school students. This is the current Wikipedia policy: include as much details as possible, but explain them in the main article in simpler language. You move off details by topic, not move off simpler language by difficulty! This article is being used as a crutch for editors on its parent article <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> to continue writing about their formulas without providing context. In short, it is an excuse in order to continue editor laziness. I love the content. It is a good explanation, a good approach/analogy. However, it needs to be merged. The article title isn't even formal. <b>Merge and redirect</b>. Also needs to be merged with the Simple English version. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 16:50, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have just looked at <a href="../../../../simple/s/p/e/special_relativity_8a06.html" class="extiw" title="simple:special_relativity">simple:special relativity</a> and it is probably the right level of treatment for that section. loxley 11:48, 18 November 2005 (UTC) I did say the following but have changed my mind: <b>Move to a new title</b> (according to whatever Wikipedia rules apply such as moving to <a href="../../../../simple/s/p/e/special_relativity_8a06.html" class="extiw" title="simple:special_relativity">simple:special relativity</a>). .. The main Special Relativity article is an excellent whistle-stop tour of the subject that covers much of the field but does not actually explain it. In my experience the stumbling block for students is the raw assumption that the speed of light is constant so I introduced the geometrical understanding of Minkowski and others to help explain why c is constant. According to the Talk Page the article seems to have helped a few people to get the idea of SR. This explanation of the geometry of SR usually occupies half a page or less in advanced textbooks and is normally seen as an amusing 'aside' for those who are about to meet four vectors and tensor maths. In the same way it really is an 'aside' to the main SR article, but an indispensable aside if the subject is to be understood. The main SR article is well structured and has a global coverage so the problem with actually merging this text with the main article is it would damage the existing structure and detract from it as an overview of the field. loxley 19:34, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikibooks, or possibly <b>move to new title</b> per Loxley. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">Special relativity</a> looks fine to me. Encyclopedia articles should be as accessible as reasonably possible, but they're reference material, not instructional courses. I absolutely disagree that all material needs to be accessible by high-school students; that's effectively a ban on discussion of advanced topics. By the way <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity_for_beginners.html" title="Special relativity for beginners">Special relativity for beginners</a> looks quite nice; it introduces complex topics without dumbing them down or succumbing to the popularizers' temptation of making vague and grandiose claims. But I think it's a better fit at Wikibooks, with a prominent link from the WP article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:30, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I meant "accessible to high school students", I really meant, the argument of every page should be accessible. For example, the points made (that is, the laws, the effects) should always be accessible; you can include the formulas and elaborate explanation of causes, that won't be understood, but that should not be the <i>only</i> thing the article contains. For example, if I wanted to know about the sun, all the basic detail, it works by nuclear fusion, it generates solar wind, should be there. If I needed to know about Parker spirals et al, then I would read more. But the basic explanation should not be replaced with advanced material, they should be <i>supported</i> by the detail. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 02:09, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> within Wikipedia's main namespace, and rename <i>Space-time invariance</i>, since that is what the article describes. (Article names such as "Introductory special relativity", which are more plausible candidates that readers might type in, can redirect to it). This is an article on an independently encyclopedic topic. My own feeling is that the problem lies with the lack of thought in the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> article. Merging this fine article would dilute it's strength (a considered explanation of physical reality) without adding a thing; <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> can include a link to it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 23:34, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, but the thing is special relativity is supposed to NOT be like that in the first place. If this article's existence is an excuse for special relativity not to be improved, then I'd rather have it deleted. We have the option of merging. The point is not "dilute its strength", this is an encylopedia. You write separate articles based on topic. These two articles' topics are the same. Similarly, I'm not even considering adding to this on the side, this could possibly be part of the introduction of the page. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 02:12, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Wikipedia structure is excellent because we can explain the relations of terms with sentences such as: "Use the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagrangian.html" title="Lagrangian">Lagrangian</a> to find the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_geodesic.html" title="Null geodesic">null geodesic</a>". The problem with this hyperlink approach is that although it explains "Lagrangian" and "Null Geodesic" it does not provide clear information on how to use the Lagrangian to find the null geodesic. What would be needed is another article on the technique. Should Wikipedia allow "Use the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagrangian.html" title="Lagrangian">Lagrangian</a> to find the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_geodesic.html" title="Null geodesic">null geodesic</a> (See Using Lagrangians to find null geodesics)"&#160;? or should it insist that all articles expand explanations such as: "Use the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagrangian.html" title="Lagrangian">Lagrangian</a> to find the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_geodesic.html" title="Null geodesic">null geodesic</a>. A Lagrangian is...., Action is...., extremal curves are.... etc..."&#160;? In fact "SR for beginners" is a specific explanation of a small part of SR and should, technically have been called "Space-time invariance and four dimensional manifolds in the early evolution of Relativity Theory" or "Minkowskian Relativity" for short, the problem is that this title would not have tipped off the high school reader to the fact that this is an essential stepping stone to understanding Relativity Theory (which, with general covariance, actually leaves this approach behind(!)). It is interesting to reflect that had the article been called Minkowskian relativity and a hyperlink been hidden in the text of the Special Relativity article this vote for deletion would not be happening. But would this have helped explain SR?loxley 11:48, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as-is. The two articles compliment each other very well. Special Relativity for Beginners bridges the gap between the more technical presentation of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_mechanics.html" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a>. As a seperate article, it avoids placing into the special relativity article a lot of detailed introductory material that would make the parent article overly long and highly tedious. This is an excellent arrangement and should be retained. (If any change is to be made, I would support transwiki-ing this article to Wikibooks.) As for <a href="../../../../simple/s/p/e/special_relativity_8a06.html" class="extiw" title="simple:special_relativity">simple:special relativity</a>, I built that up as a simple broad-brush presentation of special relativity, and referenced BOTH the parent article and the subject article in it. I really feel that the best presentations on this subject in Wikipedia are the ones that are not under the restrictions of simple English. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:11, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

This fulfills point 5 in the corporate inclusion criteria. Also, the reason for creation of this article wasn't to advertise the now defunct company, but rather as a marker for the very large community on the forum. The forum members also spawned two distributed computing teams, one for the soon to finish Find-A-Drug project and one for the Grid.org project.</li>

<li>There are still no references that support the existence of <i>exogenous xeroderma modo</i>; all you've done is quote some physiology stuff. Our collective knowledge, as far as PubMed and Google is concerned, does not contain an entity called "supermarket skin" or "<i>exogenous xeroderma modo</i>". For all we know, you may have invented it. This perception can only change is there is reliable outside material we can trust to describe the situation reliably. I'm more that slightly concerned about the talk about "suppression" and "vested interests"; this simply indicates that all this stuff is already controversial. Wikipedia (I'll state again) describes what is already known, not something <i>you think</i> the world <i>should</i> know. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 07:43, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>, I did not talk of "suppression", vested interests yes. but since you have mentioned it, maybe a collective reputation is acting to suppress this article, or maybe even individuals. This disputed article IS stating what is already known, please re-read the sentance above ('Verifiability' is I believe...) and then Google <i>Exogenous xeroderma</i>, and then start working to heal, and build. I found over 18 thousand hits, <i>Xerosis</i> over 80 thousand. You did originally say "A skin condition. All sounds very reasonable.".</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>, I agree Wikipedia describes what is already known (as I believe this article does), a statement that no individual <i>should</i> be able to state what they <i>think</i> the world <i>should</i> know, is by the same token supportive that no individual should be able to stop another(or others) saying something, and this is why Wikipedians try not to get personal and a decision is made by consensus, involving others. I'd like to think that others would have an opportunity to contribute to this article in the future.<a href="../../../i/f/c/User%7EIfca_3a90.html" title="User:Ifca">Ifca</a> 20:57, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Ifca, your responses are getting embarassing. Googling for "exogenous xeroderma" (with quotation marks) yields <i>three</i> results, none of which describe even remotely the condition you have invented. When I nominated for deletion I wrote "<i>sounds</i> reasonable" because it was actually a hoax and the material was fictive. This decision is indeed to be by consensus, and consensus is overwhelmingly against you. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:19, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>JFW, A response to the two points above many help. By Googling "exogenous xeroderma" with quotes you have proved to not understand, and appear to put more energy into dispute than resolution.

<li>There is no need to correct something if it is verifiable. I would have loved to improve this article if there way any material to rely on. Improving articles is actually one of my most common activities on Wikipedia (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prinzmetal%27s_angina&amp;diff=28937666&amp;oldid=28925177" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prinzmetal%27s_angina&amp;diff=28937666&amp;oldid=28925177" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a recent example). I fully understand the way quotes work in Google: they actually look for the two search terms right next to each other. I'm not looking for dispute: I have given you every opportunity to provide evidence that "exogenous xeroderma" or "supermarket skin" exists. So far you have failed most disappointingly. Now do you mind if I go do something useful? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 09:22, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I am no expert on Indian history and this request for deletion may fail because in fact the article is completely accurate. But it seems to me to be written in the form of a rant and makes factual claims for which there are no footnotes to back them up. I have asked some questions on the talk page (See <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Great_Calamity_1596.html" title="Talk:The Great Calamity">Talk:The Great Calamity</a> ) but as yet there have been no replies. So if this request gingers up the page and fixes some of the problems with it then I will consider that as much a success as it being deleted. The last thing I want to do is have a page which has some redeeming characteristics deleted.</p>

<p>As I said before I am not an expert in the history of this place or period but the article contains many facts which I can not check. Nor am I sure that anyone can without the correct reference books eg the first paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Roughly thirty-year period from 1870-1900 in British-controlled India (see British Raj), in the wake of the Indian rebellion of 1857 against British rule. The period is of interest especially to social historians, economists and demographers because of the manner in which governing administrative policies caused its disastrous conditions to arise and be exacerbated. Furthermore, it represents one of the most severe such economic and demographic collapses ever suffered by a modern nation, exceeding in scale even the similar disasters of the nearly contemporaneous Potato Famine in Ireland, the Ukraine during the mass Soviet collectivization of agriculture in the 1930's, the Killing Fields of Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge in the 1970's, and the famines and massive demographic ruin resulting from the Thirty Years’ War in the lands that now constitute Germany in the 1600's.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I have asked for sources for all the claims made in this first paragraph on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Great_Calamity_1596.html" title="Talk:The Great Calamity">talk page</a> of the article but after 36 hours none has been forthcoming. I have asked for other information on the talk page like a source for the statement "<i>Nevertheless, the extent to which the Great Calamity constituted a deliberate genocide, as opposed to a disastrous though basically unintended consequence of a predatory imperial policy, is highly debated</i>" eg who has claimed that it was a deliberate genocide?</p>
<p>Things which seem to indicate a rant are phrases like "<i>nearly contemporaneous Potato Famine</i>". The Irish potato famine occurred in late 1840s which was 30 years before the period mentioned here (1870-1900) and is as close in time as "<i>the Ukraine during the mass Soviet collectivization of agriculture in the 1930's,</i>"</p>

The content which is not particularly POV is duplicated elsewhere (above links). The last part is hopelessly POV/rant.

<li><b>Comment</b> the connection between the Irish Famine and India appears to come from this poorly thought out high school history homework assignment kept on the Nebraska Department of Education server - [<a href="http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish/unit_6.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish/unit_6.html" rel="nofollow">see here</a>]. The author of the wikipedia article appears to have read that but decided to highlight India instead of Ireland. The assignment itself is horribly skewed and one-sided. While it is true that the British Empire was culpable for various oppressions, the assignment is a almost comically bad way of teaching history. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:22, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but disambiguate, for example with "Great Calamity" as a proper noun used for the Potato Famine and a separate reference for "Great Calamity of India 1870-1900" used here. This is a fairly useful and relevant article- detailed, informative, reasonably even-handed for the topic and scholarly. The term "Great Calamity" for that period is definitely not a neologism as much as there is some nomenclature ambiguity surrounding how it is used in relation to the better-known application of the term to the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Potato_Famine_1a0e.html" title="Irish Potato Famine">Irish Potato Famine</a>. The periods may not precisely be contemporaneous but they were closely associated not only in absolute chronology but in both occurring during the Victorian period, under a similar government and owing to causes and conditions that had some overlap. Thus a number of authors, Sen among them, have naturally drawn links between the Potato Famine and the collapse in the last few decades in India. In addition since the Potato Famine is perhaps better known as the "Great Calamity" (though probably more often as "Great Hunger"), the natural corollary has been to speak of the "ensuing Great Calamity of India" or analogues.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been years admittedly since I have read Sen but I believe he does make this connexion and apply the term to late 19th-century India as well. The other authors I know less about, but Davis at least has a similar tone and they may have also made the same sort of connexion. In South Asian history classes for example, discussions routinely consider the parallels between the policies inciting the Potato Famine and those leading to the broader economic collapse in India 3 decades later, drawing the link between the "great calamity" in Ireland and the "great calamity" in India. Even broad general history texts like the Oxford History of India, if I'm recalling correctly, bracket the same basic timeframe with a similar designation connoting the enormity of the disaster in India. I'm supposing that the author probably intended to later clarify the usage of the term in regards to the Potato Famine and the Famines in India but was not sure of the best way to go about it. As to the question posed above, there indeed *have* been some authors who have called the collapse in India in the late 19th century a genocide since it occurred under British rule and harsh British policies, so many (in sheer numbers) perished, and the famines wiped out a number of Indian cultural communities entirely. (Davis is one.) If anything, the original contributor seems to have doubts about this designation in particular as the last paragraph indicates.</p>
<p>Recall that there is also an oral tradition in Indian tongues such as Tamil, Hindi and Marathi in regards to the collapse of the late 1800s that encompasses roughly those last three decades, and which does refer to them in terms that would roughly translate as "great disaster" or "great calamity" since the memory remains so painful for the stricken states. Therefore, there is a tradition of multiple authors within academia who link the Irish Great Calamity with the great calamity that occurred in India several decades later under a similar government, in the wake of policies with some pertinent similarity and roughly during the period that the author specifies (and is also considered by Sen and I believe by Davis as well), along with an oral tradition within India that uses a designation that would translate in roughly similar terms. The information in the article is accurate and thus the only question is the name designation, and these precedents should meet any reasonable standard for a naming designation as used in an encyclopedia or a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>Since the "Great Calamity" is still most often associated popularly with the Potato Famine and should remain primarily associated with it, my suggestion is as follows: Create a disambiguation page with "Great Calamity" as a *standalone proper noun* linking to the Potato Famine in Ireland. Then set off a secondary link to the India article as something more technical such as "Great Calamity of India 1870-1900" or "Indian Economic Collapse of 1870-1900 a.k.a. Great Calamity of 1870-1900." This in my opinion is the most effective and parsimonious solution since it reserves the explicit standalone term itself for the Potato Famine, while setting off the unique phenomenon of the Indian social/economic collapse in 1870-1900 with a nod to the way "the great calamity" designation has been extended from the Potato Famine to it, while not reappropriating the term itself. Alternatively, if any South Asian scholars out there do know of a separate designation to the phenomenon of the 1870-1900 collapse used in a specialized text (for example in a Tamil, Hindi or other Indian-language text used in India) and can translate, then substitute in that term for the main link and mention "Great Calamity of India 1870-1900" as secondary.

<p>most shias that are online know what answering-ansar.org is, still it is ranked 2,198,338. And ansar.org, the famous Shia hate site has 152,302 and the very very very very famous Shia al-islam.org has only 55,912, i dont know if 318,000 is so bad... Consider allaahuakbar.net has 427,446.</p>
<p>I mean that you must have reasonable expectations of what a Muslim site is going to rate, its not gona rate like <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=mcdonalds.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=mcdonalds.com" rel="nofollow">mcdonalds.com</a> with 6,043 or <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=CocaCola.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=CocaCola.com" rel="nofollow">CocaCola.com</a> with 7,864. The very famous Salafi site <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=islam-qa.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=islam-qa.com" rel="nofollow">islam-qa.com</a> gets 11,098. In my own view, its not to much to want a article for all the above sites... I mean, how much does that cost WP? 1 mb? less?

<dd>My view is that of those Al-Islam.org is notable because... well, I really think it is... just about the most major Shia site I've seen... like Sunni Path is notable I believe... (although I can see why others would want to delete it...) Islam.com is ranked 48,000 but I think it's less notable than the 180,000 ranked Sunni Path... but, this all means very little.... linkforsex.com is ranked 36,000 but I don't think it's notable... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 21:36, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>comment</b> You missundertand me&#160;:) I did not mean that Alexa.com is laughable, in contrary, i belive it is a woderfull site. My argument was that having a net rating of 300 000 with Alexa.com is not a valid argument for not having a article, since Alexa.com in it self has a rating of 500 000, yet still it has its own article. So i argue that the 300 000 rating is not a valid argument for deleting it in it self, rather that an case-to case decision needs to be made. And i argue that Witness-pioneer.org is a profesional Sunni site that is profesional and notable. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 22:24, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
