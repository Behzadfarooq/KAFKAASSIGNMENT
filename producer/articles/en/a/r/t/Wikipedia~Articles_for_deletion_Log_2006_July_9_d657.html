<dd>I didn't say and imply that what I said is a policy. Without mechanical and cyborg answer, I hope I made my point, but you are welcome to disagree though. My main concern and implication is that this article and argument has become so ethnocentric, so blonde loving and worshipping individuals that they forgot to file AfD against the blonde articles, especially the platinum and strawbery blondes, that they are attacking and feeling threatened by black hair color, which is common among non-whites. Just to give you something to think about. You are welcome to give your cyborg answer though. I agree that it should stand on its own, but ethnocentrism is playing huge role in this discussion. I think black hair shouldn't be filed for AfD (some white person filed it), but strawberry and platinum blonde should be filed many years ago (minutes after it was created) and deleted with 100% delete agreement. 168.253.15.112 06:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I noticed that it was a content fork, except with no sourced content. If it were a topic that didn't get covered elsewhere I'd go with the "worthy of expansion" argument but the editors at <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_color.html" title="Hair color">hair color</a> (not long on sources in the first place) should get back to the drawing board and create enough <i>sourced</i> content before they should think about forking.

<dd>You are not making any sense. It's "just random stuff," what is the evidence that you claim that it random? Are you being subjective? Ethnocentric?

<dd><b>Rebuttal</b>- Are you're suggesting I'm proposing we allow articles for every multipurpose building? I think my point is quite specific to that building, ie. the 'it' in my sentence. Maybe my position on the original point will be proven to be incorrect. If the vote is to delete the article, then by all means delete it. But I humbly suggest you refrain from putting thoughts or words into my mouth, since you appear to have decided that my single comment is meant to include <b>all</b> potential articles that might be about buildings. Just as an aside, you might double check your spelling before posting an flame. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob-nick_12bd.html" title="User:Rob-nick">Rob</a> 12:53, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Objection</b> If it needs to be merged then do so. Was only seperated as a means to keep seperate content apart from The Dugout which I believed had no relevance to the original site. Would like to point out that the research is based upon original forum sources and archives and as such I am (for all intents and purposes) the "Expert Editor". I am also in the process of sandboxing additional content for the entire piece including relevant archive materials and publications. No we've not (as a totality) been published by any reliable source, but then we're also not putting forward crackpot science ideas based on "Original Research". Individual contributions and members have however been published. Also somewhat object to the insertion of the Alexa stamp as if that actually counts for anything because as per Wiki's "Importance Criteria" the piece does not need to be qualified by popularity just because it is obscure information of relevance to 'few'. Cheers.--Koncorde 20:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>fancruft. I created this early in my Wikipedia editing career, and I no longer feel it is appropriate for Wikipedia. Since the last time I brought this up for deletion, I have abstained from editing the page, and maybe two other editors have contributed since then. It is apparent that if I do not add to this list the many other items that belong on it, no one else will. I like this project, but it's not encyclopedic, and it's slightly embarrassing to me as an editor who tries to reduce or eliminate this sort of thing with his edits. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 02:48, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

This article's not cruft, it's just very detailed which took a lot of effort and makes it a good quality article and the article is doing no harm, so what's the point of deleting this?</s> <b>Delete</b> as per nom <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:13, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No opinion</b>. I am here to explain what I did and also to respond to "die Baumfabrik."
<ul>
<li>I merely cut and paste part of the old Gameshow Marathon page to the page you're seeing now because some of my fellow Wikipedians suggested that this be done. However, it now appears that someone else doesn't want this page to appear at all. If you insist that the page remain on the Wikipedia server, I suggest that whoever originally created the page put the information on his/her own user page. I understand that those pages are protected from blanking, so at the very least it should be OK. Speaking of my user page, think of it as a two-part page:
<ul>
<li>The first part merely reflects what pages would look like if some fictitious people, places, or concepts that I have made up existed and had their own pages on Wikipedia. I even disclose that these are "fakeout" pages on my edit page. Ideally, I would have created the pages as actual entries, printed them out, and then blanked them out to protect the integrity of Wikipedia as a whole. But the pages are not "WYSIWYG"; in other words, they will look different on the printed page. Besides, the anti-vandalism teams are out in force and are enforcing the regulations. Also, Wikipedia encourages the use of user pages as sandboxes if needed, and that's what I am doing.</li>
<li>The second part is my imagination really running wild. It consists of "corrected" names and the best of wrong answers and puzzles from such shows as <i><a href="../../../n/o/w/Now_You_See_It_a743.html" title="Now You See It">Now You See It</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../y/o/u/You_Don%27t_Know_Jack_b992.html" title="You Don't Know Jack">You Don't Know Jack</a></i>. If these "answers" are Wikipedia entries, even better! Maybe my user page should have more facts in them, but as long as I don't go too far with it, I should be OK. (For the record, "rasslin'" is OK to me, but eating boogers aren't. I'm just reporting it.) Nevertheless, I will acknowledge that anyone can see these pages and apologize to anyone who has been offended.

<li><b>Hack Down and Replace:</b> well, my take on it is, yes, there's waaaaay too much there. but that doesn't mean it all disappears. i feel a very short, to-the-point summary could be made for each game, and then it could go back into the original gameshow marathon article. you don't need to list every celeb's choice made in every game, every single response, and every single witticism uttered, but you could say "so-and-so won such-and-such with a score of blankety-blank, over blah blah blah with yada yada." you could take every episode down to an entire paragraph, then just plug it back in. so... i guess this is a vote for <b>delete</b>, but on the terms that the information is <b>way summarized and put back</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the creator of this article. The purpose was twofold; 1) to reduce the size of the main LTTE article; and 2) to make it <i>more</i> NPOV, not less. Originally, more than a third of the LTTE article consisted of this list. A long, grim list of attacks, even when all true, contributes to an anti-LTTE bias. Moving it a to separate article preserves the information, makes for easier reading, and both articles are more NPOV. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyronen_7385.html" title="User:Tyronen">Tyronen</a> 04:07, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, reporting truth contributes to an anti-LTTE bias. So what is the wrong with it? This is a place to educate the public of truthful information.

<li><b>Observation</b> I have had a couple of days to ponder my first experience being a registered user of Wikipedia. From what I understand, Wikipedia is an international Web-based free-content encyclopedia. I find it interesting to note that Wikipedia does not seem to recognize Internet radio play. Please don’t take this the wrong way, but it seems hypocritical that an online encyclopedia does not recognize online radio. I hope this observation causes other users to ponder this oddity. In its conception, I believe Wikipedia was a forerunner. With the advancement of technology, Internet and satellite radio stations broadcast music worldwide. We should not allow old ideas, and the old way of doing things, to keep us from moving forward. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalle_Leah_c2ea.html" title="User:Halle Leah">Halle Leah</a> 19:50, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi Tychocat - I am not at all implying that WP guidelines do not apply. In answer to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> I have included external links at the bottom of my article to support the radio play, interviews and television appearances. I was trying to make it short and concise, do you think it would be more constructive to put the links within the article? As far as Internet radio goes, based on a couple of comments above, my assumption is that Internet radio play is not considered viable within the Wikipedia community. If this is in fact true, I find it to be quite a paradox. If I have been wrong in my assumption, then I absolutely apologize and would ask everyone concerned to please see the Top 10 requests at <a href="http://www.netradio100.com/playing.html" class="external text" title="http://www.netradio100.com/playing.html" rel="nofollow">Netradio</a>.

<p><b>Deletion nomination cybergirlfest</b> These pages are rampant playboycybergirlfancruft (See <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>) on which a lot of effort has been spent, and which includes such fascinating statistical records such as for shortest cybergirl, lightest cybergirl etc. So... detailed fancruft, but still fancruft. The playboy cyber club <a href="http://cyber.playboy.com" class="external text" title="http://cyber.playboy.com" rel="nofollow">website</a> is a subsite of the same domain as playboy.com, on which we already have an article - <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Online_f9ca.html" title="Playboy Online">Playboy Online</a>. I'm not sure how <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> applies to porn sites, but this is moot in this case as the cybergirl website is just part of playboy.com.</p>
<p>Some description of the cybergirl site could be merged into <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Online_f9ca.html" title="Playboy Online">Playboy Online</a> - bizarrely, that article (several months older than the cybergirl articles) remains a one line stub whereas this Playboy CyberClub website article is rich in detail and has spawned multiple daughter articles including possibly specially created articles on specific cybergirl porn models (which I don't have the patience to go through at the moment, but possibly these are questionable too) as well as special cybergirl page templates. (My personal opinion is that the Playboy Online article should be merged into the main Playboy magazine article, but lets take this one step at time)</p>
<p>Anyway, The cybergirl/coed of the week/month/year articles are nonnotable - most of the models are first-timers (according to Cyber Girl of the Week, not my personal experience), and anyway, these are all just sub-parts of features of the cybergirl subsite of the main playboy website.</p>
<p>Personal note: I vaguely remember nominating or being part of an afd for a similar article on playboy cybergirls very early in my wikipedia experience - the article creator was someone different though (he also liked to list all the girls individually for their own articles), and there weren't any daughter articles. the afd was successful and the article deleted but the various individual cybergirl model articles were overlooked by the closing admin (I remember asking about that but neither he or I could be bothered to go through the stack...perhaps we can find some doughty volunteers for this daunting task of playboy model research this time round). Oh well, I'll try to look into my hazy wikipast to try and find that long lost afd)</p>

<p>I tagged this recently-created article as original research since it appeared to be an essay in which the author draws conclusions; i.e., he was using Wikipedia to publish a paper. It appears that I have walked into a war between two (or more) people interested in this particular medical field. See <a href="../../../a/t/t/Talk%7EAttachment_Therapy_980f.html" title="Talk:Attachment Therapy">Talk:Attachment_Therapy</a>, <a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">User_talk:DPeterson</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Bowlby_2e4c.html" title="Talk:John Bowlby">Talk:John Bowlby</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Talk%7EAttachment_disorder_5710.html" title="Talk:Attachment disorder">Talk:Attachment_disorder</a>. One side believes the article should be deleted and redirected to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_disorder.html" title="Attachment disorder">Attachment disorder</a>, and the other side feels that it merits its own article. Hopefully the Wikipedia community can provide some consensus here and settle this. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 07:22, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Furthermore, the person who initiated the page, mercer, is a leader of a fringe group, ACT, or actively involved in it, and has had a book printed regarding this "issue" from which financial interest is derived. Finally, the article is clearly biased and represents an attempt to publish an essay. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 14:13, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article provides information that is not included under any other topic. The other discussions of various attachment issues do not refer to physical restraint or other intrusive practices, or to the role of adjuvant treatments, or to the history of these interventions, all of which are considered in the article under discussion. Popular material on Attachment Therapy presents a picture that may lead the public to search for information in Wikipedia, and it would be a service to provide this information in a concise but complete form rather than adding material to other topics and making the reader search for it. I am the author of the draft under consideration, and I can present as my credentials a doctorate in psychology, many years' work in developmental psychology and infant mental health, and publication of a number of the articles cited in the draft, which is not "original".As for the more substantive issue here, whether Attachment Therapy is an independent topic, I note that the American Professional Society on Abuse of Children (APSAC)appointed a task force to consider "Attachment therapy, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and Attachment Problems" (report published in the journal Child Maltreatment, 2006, Vol. 11, pp. 76-89). The report referred to "a particular subset of attachment therapy techniques developed by a subset of attachment therapy practitioners, techniques that have been implicated in several child deaths and other harmful effects... the controversy also extends to the theories, diagnoses, diagnostic practices, beliefs, and social group norms supporting these practices, and to the patient recruitment and advertising practices used by their proponents" (p. 77). I put it to this group that if APSAC considers this "subset" to be worthy of investigation by a task force, the "subset" is a topic separate from other considerations of attachment or of Reactive Attachment Disorder. It is to this subset that I applied the term Attachment Therapy, a label frequently used by "subset" practitioners and one likely to be known to members of the public who might be searching for information. I would like to continue with the page I drafted and to edit it to reflect the comments of the APSAC task force as quoted above.Jean Mercer 14:29, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Suggestion Delete</b> This article reads more as propaganda. I'd recommend adding material on physical restraint or other intrusive practices to the relevant pages. Redirection to those pages, as occurs if you try <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_therapy.html" title="Attachment therapy">Attachment therapy</a> would work fine.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Attachment therapy itself may be bogus, and the entire article may be a mess, but the therapy warranted a study in a medical journal, so the solution is not to delete the article, rather to clean it up and reference it. That will at least serve the purpose of warning others who seek info that it has been studied, and may be bogus. The article may be a problem, and the therapy may be a problem, but it has been medically studied, and Wiki should report that accurately, and with references. If there are problems with the group pushing this therapy, that should also be dealt with in the article via information from reliable sources. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16382093" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16382093">PMID 16382093</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 01:11, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>|*'<b>Comment'</b> It is important that contributors sign in...we don't really know who is the above contributor and if the "keep" suggestion is new or just a repeat and continuation of a previous users comments...which I suspect may be the case. It is also becoming confusing as sandy and mercer put up comments that they then later delete, move, and change...reading through the history one sees this and I am concerned that relevant material of others may have also been deleted?</p>
<p>It does not matter the amount of money involved, but the fact of a financial interest among mercer, sarner, and sarner's wife, rosa is the salient issue. In addition, mercer and sarner are leaders of the group ACT, which is another set of ties and financial interests as the ACT (Advocates for Children in Therapy) website shows (<a href="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.childrenintherapy.org/</a>).</p>
<p>The APSAC report does not describe Attachment Therapy, it uses the term attachment therapy (no caps). They state, “The terms attachment disorder, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. Pg 77 Furthermore, what seems to be focus of this proposed page only addresses a very narrow area, “Controversies have arisen about potentially harmful attachment therapy techniques used by a subset of attachment therapists.” Pg 76 Attachment therapy is better discussed in context, especially if the focus is on “a particular subset of attachment therapy techniques developed by a subset of attachment therapy practitioners” pg 77. In which case, the material would belong on the existing pages, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_therapy.html" title="Attachment therapy">attachment therapy</a> or <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_therapy.html" title="Attachment therapy">Attachment therapy</a>, which redirect the reader to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_disorder.html" title="Attachment disorder">Attachment disorder</a>. The controversy is a narrow one and should be placed in context so that readers understand the full range of issues. “ The attachment therapy controversy has centered most broadly on the use of what is known as “holding therapy” (Welch, 1988) and coercive, restraining, or aversive procedures such as deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, punishments related to food and water intake, enforced eye contact, requiring children to submit totally to adult control over all their needs, barring children’s access to normal social relationships outside the primary parent or caretaker, encouraging children to regress to infant status, reparenting, attachment parenting, or techniques designed to provoke cathartic emotional discharge” pg 83.</p>
<p>To include the full range of issues on this proposed page would then have to duplicate material on the previously cited Wikipedia articles or duplicate the APSAC report. A better solution would be to include a reference and brief description of the controversy on the previously mentioned page with a link to the APSAC report for details. '<b><a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 14:56, 10 July 2006 (UTC)'</b></p>
<p>'<b>delete'</b> I've read the comments here and on the bowlby talk page and the various associated articles mentioned. There is no reason to keep this article. Related material in on other pages. The narrowness of the dispute means that, as described above, it should be in context and, as such, would be better as a section in the article on attachment disorder. If there is concern about individuals looking up attachment therapy, there is already a redirect from that term and there could be a redirect from Attachment Therapy too. This would better serve readers of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnsonRon_066c.html" title="User:JohnsonRon">JohnsonRon</a> 19:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'<b>DELETE'</b>The material and reasons stated make the point clearly and I agree that the article is unncessary.

<p>'<b>DELETE...COMMENT'</b>While this may not be a primary reason for deletion, inclusion of this page would become a needless forum for such fringe groups as ACT and its leaders to state a point of view and then invite rebuttal and then reverts by the "opponents" in the ACT camp, etc. etc. Alternativly to have two sections in which each side could put their material would then create an "article" that is neither an article nor informative in the sense of presenting information in as neutral a manner as possible. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonesRD_606d.html" title="User:JonesRD">JonesRD</a> 22:19, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'<b>DELETE'</b> I agree with all the previous points raised for deletion. These points are very cogent. I find the argument of DPeterson very convincing: The APSAC report does not describe Attachment Therapy, it uses the term attachment therapy without capital letters. There is already a redirect for this term. They state, “The terms attachment disorder, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. Pg 77 Furthermore, the focus of this proposed page only addresses a very narrow area, “Controversies have arisen about potentially harmful attachment therapy techniques used by a subset of attachment therapists.” Pg 76 Attachment therapy is better discussed in context, especially if the focus is on “a particular subset of attachment therapy techniques developed by a subset of attachment therapy practitioners” pg 77. In which case, the material would belong on the existing pages, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_therapy.html" title="Attachment therapy">attachment therapy</a> or <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_therapy.html" title="Attachment therapy">Attachment therapy</a>, which redirect the reader to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_disorder.html" title="Attachment disorder">Attachment disorder</a>. The controversy is a narrow one and should be placed in context so that readers understand the full range of issues. “ The attachment therapy controversy has centered most broadly on the use of what is known as “holding therapy” (Welch, 1988) and coercive, restraining, or aversive procedures such as deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, punishments related to food and water intake, enforced eye contact, requiring children to submit totally to adult control over all their needs, barring children’s access to normal social relationships outside the primary parent or caretaker, encouraging children to regress to infant status, reparenting, attachment parenting, or techniques designed to provoke cathartic emotional discharge” pg 83.</p>
<p>To include the full range of issues on this proposed page would then have to duplicate material on the previously cited Wikipedia articles or duplicate the APSAC report. A '<b>better solution'</b> is to include a reference and brief description of the controversy on the previously mentioned page with a link to the APSAC report for details.</p>

These informal codes, which we call "emotext," may include intentional misspelling, lexical surrogates for vocal segregates, grammatical markers, strategic capitalization, and visual arrangements of text characters into "emoticons." Intentional misspelling often includes the repetition of a vowel or consonant to represent the accentuation of a word or phrase for affect, as in the phrase, "sssoooooo good!" Lexical surrogates function as parenthetical metalinguistic cues, as "hmmm" might represent a paraverbal expression of thoughtfulness or "yuk yuk"&#160;; might express self-deprecating laughter. Grammatical markers include gratuitous capitalization as well as repeated exclamation points and question marks to add affective emphasis. Emoticons refer to short combinations of textual characters which, if turned clockwise, resemble various facial expressions.</i> in <a href="http://members.kr.inter.net/yesunny/genderps.html" class="external text" title="http://members.kr.inter.net/yesunny/genderps.html" rel="nofollow">Paper submitted for presentation to the 45th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association, 1995, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA</a> so this is not it.

<li>It is wrong of course but could be fixed and it is a rather neat simple way of introducing matrices. I'm inclined to say fix it and keep it.

<li>It is fixable, but I'm guestioning the value of repairing it because i think the example is a poor oversimplification of the simple uses of a matrix. I dont think it would be unresonable to use the basic concept, rewritten into a section of the arcticle <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrix_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Matrix (mathematics)">Matrix (mathematics)</a> if you feel that the information is really helpfull.

<p>The result was: There is a clear consensus to <b>categorise and delete</b> here - but how exactly to close this AfD is a bit vexing. It's not clear that the categorisation is complete. Basically, I see two options:</p>

<li>Keep all the articles until it's confirmed that they've been categorised, then... um... well, god knows. <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> them? Except, of course, that any article which has been nominated for deletion before cannot be prodded. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all rules</a> and speedy them? God help us, another 100-article AfD? I think there's a high chance they'd just be forgotten about and hang around for months.</li>
<li>Or I can delete them all now, and if any of these lists have not been fully categorised and someone wants to complete the work, they can contact me and I'll restore them to userspace.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going with 2, especially given that no-one's objected to Dr Zak's assertion "delete, categories exist" below, despite this AfD hanging around for several extra days. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:01, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I was involved in maintaining both of the Wisconsin articles on this list due to my involvement in WikiProject Wisconsin. I vote weak delete because the Wisconsin articles were frequently "vandalized" by anons adding red links to bands and musicians without asserting their notability. The articles were too hard to maintain too. I think that categories are a better route, because notability is automatic (or else the article will eventually be nominated on AfD). The problem is that the categories don't allow for a list of notable artists/bands to be added later. <b><u>These lists HAVE to be converted into categories so the data is not lost.</u></b> Hopefully a bot can do that task. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 14:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find it particularly useful when state lists are broken down by city, such as that of List of bands from Ohio. I don't think the sub-categorization would be as clean using categories.

I was helping maintain the List of bands from Oregon, and think lists are handy, but understand the reasons for the nomination. No loss of data (except for redlinks of dubious value) would be good. Thanks for tagging this and opening it up for debate--as a fairly new user, the disappearance of the article kept me puzzled for a few days until I learned to check the deletion log...thus, if deleted, it will be necessary to tag/protect/redirect/whatever the article so it doesn't get recreated endlessly. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatr67_a209.html" title="User:Katr67">Katr67</a> 23:27, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are a lot of anonymous editors posting vanity entries on these lists, from what I've seen on List of bands from Oregon, and it makes it difficult to maintain. That same list now has dubious genre categories and isn't alphabetised. This process of reaching consensus through formal nomination is a good thing, though. I like the idea of lists of (whomever) from (wherever), but all the anonymous vanity edits on these lists are annoying. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittle_Otik_3998.html" title="User:Little Otik">little otik</a> 01:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Two points need to be made here. First, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28pornographic_actors%29_a726.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)">Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)</a> suggests that if an adult performer "has been in around or over 100 movies" they may merit an article, the one hundred mark is an approximation, not a concrete figure. Secondly, if you combine the two databases referred to within the article, it adds up to well over one hundred credits, even after subtracting the duplicates which come about from alternative title names. I understand that the purpose of proposing the PORN BIO guideline is to discourage every 18 year old girl out there with an erotic website from spamming Wikipedia, but this porn star actually is one, and I see no valid reason why this article should not be included. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 00:10, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Rewrite and keep</b>. It's a fairly major NASA outreach program. Government information <i>can</i> be non-notable, but only under fairly unlikely circumstances. I'm not even sure it counts as vanity- nationalism, sure, but it isn't promoting the author, close associates, or family of the author. Instead, it's promoting her government, which can be fixed with a cleanup. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 13:46, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Government information can be non-notable, but not in the case of an agency like NASA that often has huge public interest. An army general writing about his specialty or a publicly funded scientist writing about their branch of science are just experts writing about what they know. There might be vanity involved as motive or vanity-like side-benefits of greater recognition and so more chance for the program to be renewed or expanded, but I don't think the Wikipolicy applies to that.

<p>This article is not about Darek Sokol's present activity. It rather showes (or suppose to show) his about 10 years input in restoration and conservation of historic places of significant value while back in Poland. I'm a first time user of Wikipedia (just registered 2 days ago) and regardless what other admins call me ("malicious vandal" etc.) I would like to stay a member at Wikipedia and learn how to write a good articles. I would expect some help though, not only a criticism from experienced members as you are. I was going to work on the article and enrich it with some photographs and facts. I may delete the last lines about Sokol's present activity in the USA if it may prevent the article from deletion. Also I want to mention that this person is not only a restorator and artist but also quite influential person in some Christian circles. Besides his artistic achievements he also graduated from the Evangelical School of Theology in Wroclaw <a href="http://www.est.edu.pl/en/begin" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.est.edu.pl/en/begin" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> , Poland, where he proved to be a good leader and youth mentor.</p>
<p>(I noticed that many AOL users have the same problem: shared IP problems, accusations of vandalizing Wikipedia, etc.) I'd like you to help me with that, rather than calling me names. I hope all that I wrote here will find some understanding. --<font color="orange"><b>Darpics</b></font></p>

<p>I'm wavering, hence this AfD for peer review and decision. There are many Ghits, but all seem like well placed links to publicise this movie, which appears otherwise to be wholly non notable.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - For several reasons:
<ol>
<li>) This short-film is actually fairly famous amongst fans of the Buffyverse on the net and it often comes up on message boards, and although I can't find out how many downloads it has during the many years it has been freely available, I'm guessing it's at least thousands (considering that the new <i>Angel</i> fan film, <a href="http://www.cautionzero.net/cherub/" class="external text" title="http://www.cautionzero.net/cherub/" rel="nofollow">Cherub</a> was only released in February 2006, and already has over 100 000 downloads.</li>
<li>) Surely <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22fluffy+the+english+vampire+slayer%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22fluffy+the+english+vampire+slayer%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">690 google hits is more than a fair amount</a>.</li>
<li>) Don't films deserve the right to an article as long as they does not break anything in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">WP:Deletion Policy</a>? "Fluffy" is a film, admittedly it is low low budget short-film (just over 18 minutes) that is seen by less people than a film like <i>Star Wars</i>, but "Fluffy" is still a film.</li>
<li>) <i>Star Trek</i> has been allowed articles on various of it's fan films, and in my opinion rightfully so. Check out these articles:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_%28Fan_made_productions%29_256b.html" title="Star Trek (Fan made productions)">Star Trek (Fan made productions)</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship_Exeter_51fc.html" title="Starship Exeter">Starship Exeter</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Pepsi_Generation_a3ff.html" title="Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation">Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation</a></li>
<li>It was after I read these <i>Star Trek</i> articles, that I thought there might be some interest for the equivalent on Wikipedia for the Buffyverse. So I created the article: <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_%28Fan_made_productions%29_9947.html" title="Buffyverse (Fan made productions)">Buffyverse (Fan made productions)</a>, and <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluffy_the_English_Vampire_Slayer_0989.html" title="Fluffy the English Vampire Slayer">Fluffy the English Vampire Slayer</a>.
<p><i>Buffy</i> and <i>Angel</i> are huge shows that have had a massive impact on pop culture and much of their audience. Only four fan films have been made, set in (or parodying) the Buffyverse. These are "Fluffy", "Cherub", "Consanguinity", and the upcoming "Forgotten Memories". Shouldn't Wikipedians be able to access information to the only four fan films related to the popular world of <i>Buffy</i> and <i>Angel</i>?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>) Notability is not mentioned anywhere in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> ("<i>official policy</i>"). <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is not an official policy, it is an "<i>essay expressing the opinions and ideas of some Wikipedians. While it can help explain and understand existing Wikipedia policies and guidelines, this is not an actual policy or guideline.</i>".
<p>Notability can be a problem with say a local band in London, where people maybe unable to verify anything about the band. How would a wikipedian in France know the band truly even existed? This film is entirely verifiable by the external links available, it does not contain any original research. However in my opinion "Fluffy" along with "Cherub", "Consanguinity", &amp; "Forgotten Memories"with are <i>just about</i> notable enough anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>) I only just created the article today and it could be hugely improved, give me a few days, and this article will be better. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 18:14, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Notability can be a problem with say a local band in London, where people maybe unable to verify anything about the band.</i> — No. The problem with that band is verifiability. It is unverifiable, and Wikipedia is not permitted to have an article about it. The problem with a band is notability when the only sources of information about the band, that are to be had, are not independent of the band itself (e.g. reprinted press releases, advertisements, autobiographies, the band's web sites, and so forth). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:34, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Mark Harwood here. I found a link to my name from my girlfriend Louise Robey's page and simply added what I thought would be of interest. More in order to provide a link to my sister Oriel who I think deserves it. As to the information I have provided it is all easily verifible try google. Its about one tenth of the credits from important bands that I have. The Aviation expert that flaged it for deletion may be interested in linking me to my uncle Robin Thomas and his firsts in light aviation history. See power flow systems Daytona and laminar flow systems. I am not trying to big myself up by dishonest claims. I don't know how to program in computer language and I am asking for help.

<li><b>Comment</b> as the nominator, I wish to add further thoughts - I did not nominate this article under issues of verifiablity. Also, now that the author has indicated himself to be the subject of the article, it has issues around <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>. Finally, a person is not notable because they are related to a sister or uncle who is notable.--<a href="../../../g/a/y/User%7EGay_Cdn_0b6b.html" title="User:Gay Cdn">Gay Cdn</a> 20:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that the vanity issue is a little troublesome, but technically there is no actual policy against contributing to an article about yourself.

<p>Well I did not create the page it was there with just my name on it. Is the problem that I am the boyfriend of one of Canada's top actresses well known as a gay icon?. All the information I have provided is true, I am not trying to big myself up. I am just trying to provide information on a formerly blank page with only my name at the top. Please help me with the wikifying etc because if you want to add any more information about me, I was the first person statemented by Suffolk education for dyslexia. Thats how come I got a tape recorder.</p>
<p>Oh and PS Che? Is it in factor that I have a hyphenated name and that you may have found out that my stepson James is the future Duke of St Albans?. Bring forth the Guillotine</p>

<p>Duplicate article. The article name is incorrect, and should be "<a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Lothian_question_08ab.html" title="West Lothian question">West Lothian question</a>" which already exists. This had already been pointed out even before the article had been created — see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-15_5c48.html#The_Midlothian_Question" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2006-01-15">Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2006-01-15#The Midlothian Question</a>. Personally I don't think there's much useful content in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Midlothian_Question_1874.html" title="The Midlothian Question">The Midlothian Question</a> to consider a merge into <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Lothian_question_08ab.html" title="West Lothian question">West Lothian question</a>.

<li><i><b>Strongly oppose</b></i> - Some of the edits that have taken place in the short time since this entry was added seem to have been done in the first instance by the owner of the site in question, then by others to counter what he is adding. I'm sure it isn't the first wikipedia article that started life under a cloud of controversy, but it is a controversial subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, I'm quite new to the rules for Wikipedia entries, so please bear with me if I make any incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>I feel the article is needed on Wikipedia, but perhaps under a different heading. I'll try and explain.</p>
<p>Mr Duncan Oldham is becoming quite a personality in his own right. He's certainly done enough over the years to be allowed an entry on Wikipedia (in my view). A carefully-written article on all of these sometimes newsworthy items would be worth adding to the encyclopedia. Unfortunately for Wikipedia, many of Mr Oldham's activities are controversial. However surely as long as they are all cited there should be no problem in them being included, whether positive or negative. In positive terms, Mr Oldham has claimed to carry out a lot of work for charity for example, some newspaper articles could perhaps be added by him to prove this. He's also claimed to be the instigator / creator of the first UK Liverpool FC newsgroup. His Koptalk site is effectively a more up-to-date use of technology. Although Mr Oldham isn't a famous personality as such, he's certainly infamous amongst supporters of Liverpool Football Club and with his involvement in websites promoting other soccer teams and also football in general (I can list these if required) then it's safe to say his infamy may also have spread within those communities.</p>
<p>He's known for a lot of things both good and bad. For example he once changed his name to "Mr Manchester United" by deed poll, something which made the national newspapers of the time if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>On the controversial side there is (citable) evidence that Mr Oldham has engaged in a long line of dubious activities. The blog mentioned has got a lot of the evidence included, but there is also evidence to be found on the Way-back Machine (archive.org).</p>
<p>Mr Oldham is Koptalk essentially - his "team" seems to consist of his family members, and as such perhaps a seperate Koptalk entry is overkill and merely a redirect would be needed.</p>
<p>There's no need to "spam" with links to other sites, but it did prove a point that other websites are more popular (or they were at the time I compared them after seeing them listed in the article).</p>
<p>So when I say "strongly oppose" I feel that rather than a deletion a rename and slight rewrite would be more in order.</p>
<p>If the Wikipedia policy is to remove entries on people who are controversial then yes, remove the entry, but I am sure that's not the case. It's certainly an interesting article to have in the enyclopedia, but careful monitoring is needed to ensure it is neutral with all claims cited. --Whatthef 15:00, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> From what I've seen, it's not a notable website, and the article should be deleted.

It does sound like it was trivial coverage, rather than anything substantial, but it may not be. I'd tend towards deleting the article, but I'd like to see what this coverage is. Also, it's a shame that the article is being used both to air grievances, rather than just report on criticism, and to promote the owner's own website by blanking the criticism, and manipulating the external links.

<p>I do not believe that Wikipedia should eradicate reference to Koptalk - I think it is an interesting case of how a single individual using the net can exploit a respected institution like LFC and exploit its world wide followers. But to give a full picture Wikepeida should not lend credence to Koptalk's false claims and it should link to the sites of others especially koptalk-insider which is a dedicated not-for-profit site set up to expose Koptalk.</p>
<p>The testimonial to Koptalk from major newspapers - The Independent, for example - was given many years ago when Koptalk was, indeed, one of the most populated LFC sites simply because they were early days of the net and there were very few about. Oldham had engineered the takeover of Koptalk from the original creator. Most of that generation of members left Koptalk to open new sites. Mainly they disliked that Koptalk had been converted from a discussion site about LFC into a site about the owner, Duncan Oldham, his unsual sexual interests and and his various money making schemes, most of which had nothing to do with LFC. One of those schemes was a pyramid sales scheme in which he offered readers the opportunity of making quick money with very little effort by setting up sites like his own or by selling the scheme to others who would sell it to others and so on. Another was his attempt to circumvent securities law by selling shares in Koptalk to members. He was obliged to pay back the money. Oldham's response to this exodus of members was to buy up the domain names similar to thsoe of his rivals, and similar even to the LFC offical site, and redirect the traffic to his own site. His active editing of Wikipedia to support his false claim to be the No 1 site and to elminate references to other LFC fan sites is in this tradtion - including his attempt to crush the latest site set up by genuine fans who are upset by what they consider to be his exploitation of LFC and LFC supporters. <a href="http://www.koptalk-insider.com" class="external free" title="http://www.koptalk-insider.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.koptalk-insider.com</a> Actually he just bought that domain two days ago to redirect its traffic to his site.</p>
<p>His claim that various LFC footballers write for his site is false. In those early days - 5-7 years ago - he did contract to buy the rights to reproduce some syndicated articles by Tommy Smith and Ian St. John and the Liverpool writer Paul Tomkins - but he never paid them and they forbade him using their name.</p>
<p>Duncan Oldham claimed last week that he has taken 5 pounds advance payments from LFC supporters for 20,000 copíes of his proposed book "Anfield Exposed". The book is now in its third year of missed launches and he announced last week that it is now postponed until May of 2007. There is no such book. However the rpospeod title is typical of his exploitative attitude to the club he purports to support.</p>
<p>Oldham uses his site to collect for various causes and charities. The beneficiares of some of these charities are members of his family. Whatever the charity or cause he insists that donations are made out to him personally or his mother. He does not register any of them. He never produces accounts.</p>
<p>Koptalk claims to have connection to the players, directors and management of LFC. All these claims are false. Many of his "informers" are in fact aliases of Duncan Oldham He uses these "stories" to drum up paid membership in his Insider and Gold Club. Many of his members are people from Asia, Australia and the Americas who are not in a position to understand how his claims lack feasibility. They believe Koptalk is a Liverpool based site run by LFC fans. In fact it is run from Newcastle by Oldham alone with some help from his mother and a 17 yr old step brother. Oldham has a season ticket for Newcastle United, rarely if ever attends LFC games, and is in the process of starting similar sites for Newcasle, Spurs and Forest supporters.</p>
<p>He repeatedly claims he does not pay his two relatives who work for him. There are many obvious inconsistencies between his claims to make hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, to buy 40,000 sterling mercedes and other vehicle, expensive video equipment and various properties (his latest target being a 300,000 property near the LFC training ground) and his claims to be poor, doing it as a hobby and unable to pay his relatives.</p>
<p>Many observors believe these inconsistences suggest his attempt to duck and weave to avoid investigation of various frauds including fraud of the public exchequer. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.139.76.91 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.139.76.91_e3c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.139.76.91">contribs</a>).</small> I cannot put in the symbols you ask for - my user name is rupert <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.139.76.91 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.139.76.91_e3c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.139.76.91">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>In the article you say that Koptalk was founded by Duncan Oldham. In fact it was founded by Colin Seaman. He gave a share of it to Duncan Oldham. Apparently the Oldham takeover became complete. However, Colin Seaman's claim to co-ownership can be found on his own site at: <a href="http://www.dbcreate.com/dbcreate/content/team.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.dbcreate.com/dbcreate/content/team.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbcreate.com/dbcreate/content/team.htm</a></p>
<p>The following is a partial list of the sites squatted on by Duncan Oldham. This is not a contentious list he admits to it on his site. He admits that he has sat on these sites and pointed some of them to his own site to punish rival sites. Most of these sites have names similar to the names of rival sites. This list is taken from Koptalk-Insider which monitors his activities. The poster is "whois look up" _________________ Here are eight current squats - all three fanzines and 5 other main LFC sites. There’s probably more. Notice the dates and you’ll see all have been renewed at least once and he’s had some since 2001. A couple were pointed to his site until this information appeared on June 15th in another thread on this blog:</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - this is a <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">discussion on possible deletion</a> for this article - we're trying to establish whether the <a href="../../../k/o/p/Koptalk.html" title="Koptalk">Koptalk</a> article meets the criteria required to warrant an article. Most of the above is very interesting but doesn't directly relate to whether this article has met the requirements to prevent its deletion. It has already been generally agreed that this is a not-notable website that doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Can we concentrate on determining whether the article has some justification to exist within the Wikipedia? <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 21:16, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Clearly, a compilation would usually not be noteworthy, however, I feel that this one is because it is the only She album to be released. But, delete if you will. Manolo Siegfried</p>

This is the only album for this band, released in 1999, although the band was around in the sixties and seventies, and released one single.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would suggest rewriting an article on She and making sure that the article claims notability and is well referenced. Sites like allmusic and the Village Voice article mentioned above would make a good start. I saw the band referred to as legendary and as the original <a href="../../../g/r/r/Grrl.html" title="Grrl">grrl</a> group, so claiming notability shouldn't be so hard. Any band that releases a compilation close to 30 years after breaking up and gets notices from reliable press has to be somewhat notable. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelmills_0f99.html" title="User:Joelmills">Joelmills</a> 21:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow. Clearly the "among television's scariest logos" type of stuff needs to be sourced (or deleted per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). Real subject matter that millions of people saw, although few noted at all. If these articles can be cited by something more than a YouTube thingie that the same person might have posted, then I would call these good enough daughter articles to be kept, even though actual <i>interest</i> in the topic seems very much a niche phenomenon. I'm not sure the three logo articles would be any more encyclopedically organized if merged into Viacom/ScreenGems/DiC articles or into a TV-closing-logos article; if kept they should probably remain standalone articles. Lacking reliable sources, though, it's hard to argue with Dpbsmith's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> call. <b>No vote pending documentation.</b> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 03:21, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rather than delete this page, (and because we're striving to create a truly comprehensive encyclopaedia), shouldn't we create pages for the other Twenty20 teams (and onwards for 1 day teams), seeing as there is no info on the Brown Caps on the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club_c790.html" title="Surrey County Cricket Club">Surrey County Cricket Club</a> page (and as we've established no other teams even have an article)? <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJoncomelately_5300.html" title="User:Joncomelately">Joncomelately</a><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJoncomelately_c04e.html" title="User talk:Joncomelately"><sub>Come over</sub></a> 22:01, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Surely one-day and 20-20 teams are part of their respective county cricket clubs rather than separate teams? <a href="http://www.surreycricket.com/team/fixtures/" class="external text" title="http://www.surreycricket.com/team/fixtures/" rel="nofollow">Surrey CCC's website</a> puts them all in one fixture list, implying they are one entity. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldelpaso_61eb.html" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 18:20, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If that is the case (and is most probably is) shouldn't we have at least ensure there is some info on the respective 1 day/Twenty20 teams on the CCC articles? The Surrey one mentions the Twenty20 teams once, and doesn't even mention the name change (from Lions to Brown Caps). I only started this article so that anyone as confused as I was might find that information - I don't think it matters on which page that info goes. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJoncomelately_5300.html" title="User:Joncomelately">Joncomelately</a><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJoncomelately_c04e.html" title="User talk:Joncomelately"><sub>Come over</sub></a> 22:18, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>no result</b> - as is pointed out, this is part of a wider issue which cannot be solved by one AfD, and the lack of discussion here about the specific article reflects that. Someone can try and remove all the German terms if they want (they should), but be prepared to engage in a pointless edit war with Sheynhertz. The prevailing opinion on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Sheynhertz-Unbayg_b17c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Sheynhertz-Unbayg">his RfC</a> is that <i>"...a serious underlying problem here is a cultural clash... therefore, my recommendation is that people give him a heaping serving of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> and back off and think of creative ways to help him overcome his fears"</i>. I'll refrain from adding my interpretation of what that actually means, due to it not being particularly relevant to the closing of this discussion. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:23, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I believe that this "list" article merits deletion due to Wikipedia's policy that it is not an indiscriminate collection of information; specifically, that it is not for "lists or repositories of loosely associated topics." The policy seems to indicate that if the list <i>itself</i> (not the entries comprising the list, but the <i>actual list itself</i>) is famous on its own standing, or contributed to the fame of the subject, it is acceptable to keep; I do not believe this list satisfies that corollary. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;<span class="plainlinks">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a></span>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 16:40, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not so much a list as a collection of small articles. Thus the "lists" argument for deletion doesn't really apply here, IMO. Probably <b>rename</b> to something like <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Star_Wars_organizations_9b72.html" title="Minor Star Wars organizations">Minor Star Wars organizations</a>, currently a redirect. Most of these are incredibly important. Black Sun, ExGal, the Bounty Hunter's Guild and CorSec, for example, have all been in a lot of hugely important novels. Black Sun was central to the whole <a href="../../../s/h/a/Star_Wars%7E_Shadows_of_the_Empire_99bc.html" title="Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire">Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire</a> project, and has been featured in a variety of other sources as well. The Peace Brigade was a major part of the 19-book <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jedi_Order_75be.html" title="New Jedi Order">New Jedi Order</a> series. The 181st was in Aaron Allston's X-wing novels, and various comics.

<li>What do you mean? I think the reasons given by LtNOWIS are good and concise. They show that these organizations have played a part in a number of Star Wars novels, and are therefore not made-up fan fiction. They have not had mere mentions in the novels, but have been described. There are a number of people interested in Star Wars, and who might want to find such information. The fact that the organizations are minor means that we probably don't want <i>individual</i> articles on each organization, but as <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines say about minor characters in major universes, we now have them altogether in a single nice organized article as they ought to be. LtNOWIS has made a fully relevant argument for this article's inclusion which I concur with. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:02, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> needs better sourcing but so do lots of articles. As <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> says this is what the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guideline calls for in these cases, merge otherwise nn articles into lists. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 07:19, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is obvious from the comments above that, collectively, the information presented in this list is rather essential if you want to understand the Star Wars universe (a topic I'm no expert on, but read the comments and it's perfectly clear) and could - indeed, should, but that's for cleanup not AFD - be verified and referenced. At present, Wikipedia is split between a bunch of <b>wikilumpers</b> who say "small articles on small topics should be deleted! If they're important enough to keep but it's not possible to write a long article they should be stuck together in agglomerated articles!" and cite <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> (amongst others) to help them, versus a bunch of <b>wikisplitters</b> who say "delete these horrid collective articles! If anything is worth keeping, it should be in a bunch of smaller, split-off articles!" and cite <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>. This is the most unproductive type of argument imaginable - I really don't care whether we lump or split, but I hate to have to vote in AFDs to stop us losing content that clearly some people are finding relevant and useful, just because these two factions can't make their mind up... the bottom line is that content shouldn't be held to ransom at AFD in the fall-out between the battle of splitters and lumpers. Go and argue at some guideline talk pages, sort yourselves out, reach consensus, then come back and start AFDing whichever type of the articles (piddly or listy) you've decided to purge. Arguing about this on fragmented AFD listings while waving great big content-whacking axes isn't safe and is unlikely to lead to the sane and centralized debate this obviously needs.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 08:01, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I would disagree that one could get an accurate reflection of the importance of this article by reading the comments here. Editors of articles in this particular subject emigrate in mass to AfDs when one of their articles are threatened, regardless of notability guidelines. Keep an eye out for Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of colors of Jedis' socks in the original trilogy. You also are misstating the support of my citing. I'm not citing the <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> <i>guideline</i>, <b>I'm citing the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> <i><u>policy</u></i></b>.

<dd><i>"Joel Leyden is a known SEO spammer and states that on his website. He is using Wikipedia, and has admitted as such, to get traffic to his blog. He is not a noted journalist. I state this unequivocally as someone who has worked for 15 years in the Israeli media, and as anyone from the Hebrew wikipedia will tell you. In fact, he is an unknown in Israel. Here is a classic example of someone abusing wikipedia for personal gain. What is worse, his blog (and as an examination will show, it is nothing more) is one of the tools he is using to fight a custody battle with his ex-wife over his children. As a user, now banned, he attempted to use wikipedia to fight this same custody battle, as a perusal of the history of Raanana will show. In addition, he was banned for harrassing another user, both online and in person. The votes to keep included sockpuppets and personal friends, who have fewer than ten edits each, i.e., make 3 edits and vote for Joel. I am not even going to discuss his personal attacks against me or the foundation on his blog. Given the confusion of information and misinformation there, I can only wonder what kind of nonsense he is posting in his article. Nevertheless, I will state this, summarizing a lengthy email which I sent to the Arb Com about two months ago: if the Hebrew Wikipedia, based in Israel, sees fit to include a version of the article about him or his blog, I will support its inclusion in English. If not, I will continue to regard it as simple SEO spam and unverifiable drivel by someone attempting to use wikipedia to attain fame and pursue his own, selfish agenda, using false information, sock puppets, and what have you. I sincerely hope that this is not the direction that Wikipedia is taking.

<p><b>Comment</b> For people google-checking etc., note that there is a well-established organization sometimes known as "ITIM" or "The Israel News Agency" which as been around since 1950 and has relations with Israel's major newspapers<a href="http://www.globaljournalist.org/magazine/2004-2/agency-gets-fresh-start.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globaljournalist.org/magazine/2004-2/agency-gets-fresh-start.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>.

<li>I strongly oppose the suggestion to redirect. I've never seen ITIM referred to as "The Israel News Agency" - perhaps informally "Israel's News Agency" or "The Israeli News Agency", but never "The Israel News Agency". I'm afraid such a redirect would only create further confusion as readers encountering Leyden's criticism of Wikipedia search for his agency, and find the highly reputable ITIM instead. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">User:Woggly</a> 18:46, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

There are also a few hits on the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> database including a report from China's Xinhua news agency, several articles from Israel Business Arena and a column in the Jerusalem Post which describe ITIM as "ITIM - the Israel News Agency" or simply "Israel News Agency (ITIM)". Factiva also shows the BBC as the original source for this March 2006 Israel Media Guide article <a href="http://fmb-ebank.bancinternal.com/portal/story.asp?idstr=90716977" class="external text" title="http://fmb-ebank.bancinternal.com/portal/story.asp?idstr=90716977" rel="nofollow">here</a> (unsourced and breaching copyright in this link), which uses the phrase "ITIM (Israel News Agency)".

<li>I'm sure the name <i>Israel News Agency</i> was purposefully chosen precisely so as to to give the (false) impression that the INA is a central national and/or government service. In fact, ITIM is the only Israeli news agency of any significance. You've convinced me that ITIM has on occasion been referred to as "The Israel News Agency" - this is equivalent to calling <i>The Boston Globe</i> "The Boston Newspaper". My point is this: if the Wikipedia article Israel News Agency is made into a redirect to ITIM, it will end up looking as if ITIM is responsible for all the nonsense issuing from the INA. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 05:40, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is a <i>reason</i> this keeps coming up. Danny's deletion may have been rash, but it seems more and more justified when I get the impression people want to keep this article just so we don't have to discuss this again.

<li><b>Delete</b> The <i>only</i> source that seems to imply any notabiliy for the INA is the INA itself. I would assume the reason behind Geni's action was that Leyden has sent many of his friends to the previous AfDs to vote to keep. I have been following this debacle for a while, and I have yet to see anything that suggests the INA is notable. I do not think being mentioned in small news sources because of an SEO stunt is sufficient notability to warrant a Wikipedia article. It's not surprising that Leyden has a Israeli press card, as everything he publishes has a distinctly pro-Israel slant. As for referring to it as "fully accredited by the Israel Government Press Office," a Google search of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22accredited+by+the+Israel+Government+Press+Office+&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22accredited+by+the+Israel+Government+Press+Office+&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">that phrase</a> shows that it is being applied to <i>only</i> the INA.

<li>Google News is a search engine. INA is run by an experienced search-engine optimizer. It should therefore not be surprising that they manage to show up there. It is also worth pointing out that Google News has, at various times, indexed questionable "news sources" that look genuine on the surface. An example is <a href="../../../o/f/f/OfficialWire_da8c.html" title="OfficialWire">OfficialWire</a>, which was Google News indexed and is associated with a very dubious organization called "QuakeAID"; the newswire was also used to distribute Holocaust denial stories which ended up in the Google News index. Our article <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_News_26ac.html" title="Google News">Google News</a> also points out that they have accidentally indexed white supremacist content in the past. The problem with INA is that, aside from the direct results of their search-engine optimization and marketing, there is very little genuine reporting <i>about</i> INA that could form the basis of a coherent, verifiable article. It appears to me that the crusade of the site's creator is in part focused on establishing the very notability and recognition that it lacks, by gaining an entry in an online encyclopedia. This, in my opinion, weighs heavily in favor of deletion.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a>

<li>Yes, and Wikipedia has an article about OfficialWire (covered as part of its affiliate <a href="../../../q/u/a/QuakeAID_76cd.html" title="QuakeAID">QuakeAID</a>). The Google News listing does not prove that Israel News Agency is a reliable news source, but it shows up in Google News searches alongside the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>, so it would be appropriate for Wikipedia to explain what INA is about. If we can verify that, despite its Google News listing, the INA devotes much of its content to reprints of information released by the Israeli government and op-ed pieces by its founder, it would be appropriate to state that in the article. (Also, I question the characterization of INA as a blog. It lacks several characteristics of the typical blog, like clear chronology of items, items linking other blogs, a blogroll, and comment space for each item. A blog doesn't need to have all of these, but INA has none of them as far as I can tell. It's true that much of it is a collection of opinionated commentaries, but it doesn't look much like a blog otherwise.) --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:52, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You wrote, <i>If we can verify that, despite its Google News listing, the INA devotes much of its content to reprints of information released by the Israeli government and op-ed pieces by its founder</i> - what would serve as verification? I've already sampled ten articles and shown just that: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Israel_News_Agency_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=55537150&amp;oldid=55529606" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Israel_News_Agency_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=55537150&amp;oldid=55529606" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>; the one exception was, quite simply, an advertisement. I don't have the time or inclination to continue this line of analysis. What I can point to, is how much news the INA <b>doesn't</b> cover. In a country where radio news programs are updated by the half hour, updating a website once every couple of days - even if the updates were all genuine news reports, which they aren't - would not sustain a true news agency. There are <a href="http://rotter.net/cgi-bin/forum/dcboard.cgi?az=list&amp;forum=scoops1" class="external text" title="http://rotter.net/cgi-bin/forum/dcboard.cgi?az=list&amp;forum=scoops1" rel="nofollow">unofficial Israeli news sites</a> where one can be updated on news and rumours within minutes of events - not trustworthy reports, but timely. The INA is neither timely nor trustworthy. Take for example this story reported by the INA on [www.israelnewsagency.com/israeldefenseforcesnavyterrorism480516.html May 16] , as an event that occurred <i><b>"earlier today"</b></i>. This story was copied from a government site where it had been posted on <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terrorism+and+Islamic+Fundamentalism-/IDF+Naval+craft+seized+several+hundred+kg+of+explosives+14-May-2006.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terrorism+and+Islamic+Fundamentalism-/IDF+Naval+craft+seized+several+hundred+kg+of+explosives+14-May-2006.htm" rel="nofollow">May 14</a>, two days earlier. Here is a case where, by not being timely, and not bothering to proofread or update copy, the INA is in fact spreading false information. Is this not ample proof, in your eyes, that the INA is no news agency? --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 09:48, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>QuakeAID is notable for other reasons (though it's definitely borderline). I doubt an article about OfficialWire would survive on AfD on the grounds that it's been indexed by a search engine. Yes, Google News has put obscure websites (including, as noted, Holocaust denial and white supremacism) on equal footing with the NYT. That doesn't make them notable. As for whether it is a blog or a traditional website, I don't find the distinction relevant. The reason people call it a blog is because of articles [www.israelnewsagency.com/wikipedialibelslandersexwoolencyclopedia48330508.html like this], which begins with: " It all started with a divorced father in Israel who wanted more hours with his child.

<li><b>Comment:</b> One of the reasons the article is difficult to clean up into a decent NPOV stub, is that there virtually no independently verifiable information available about the INA. It is a one man show, and virtually every search leads back to that one man and his exhaustive efforts at self promotion. Unlike other Israeli operations, about which information can be found in Hebrew and translated, in the case of the INA there is far less information available on the agency in Hebrew than in English. In fact, no information whatsoever! I searched Google using the name as it appears on Leyden's scanned press-card: "ישראל - סוכנות ידיעות" gave 0 results as did "סוכנות ידיעות ישראל". Proving a negative is very difficult, and I don't know how to prove that the Israel News Agency is a non-entity, absolutely unheard of in Israel. I'd wager that a very high percentage of the traffic to the site comes from Wikipedians and members of the Wikipedia Review who visit trying to figure out what's going on. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 07:40, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia spamming and sockpuppetry are both deeply counterproductive, create more work for editors, and generally disrupt the encyclopedia to no good end. At the same time, Danny's out-of-process deletion of both this and Joel Leyden smack of someone who thinks he knows better than the community, and I find that deeply disturbing for someone who wields power limited only by the Board (in other words, essentially unlimited.) <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> should be commended, though, for a logical and necessary semi-protection of this debate, given the previous behavior of those surrounding this. I think WP:WEB is overly vague, but as far as I am able to discern, this qualifies. Assuming this deletion fails, I recommend the debate be moved there for further refinement of that guideline. I would personally support tightening the guideline and citing specifically the number of republications required and the notability those publications should have. For example, I don't think that Kotepho's blog roundups <i>should</i> qualify. Nevertheless, I believe they <i>do</i> qualify under the current (vague) guidelines.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 21:38, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only two blogs I even mentionare the story from Newswireless.net, but that was reprinted by The Register and the one from one of The Washington Post's blog done by a staff writer. I specifically avoided average blogs as I would never consider them a source for anything in a serious article. Kotepho 22:07, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The link is not from the Washington Post, it's from the Washington Post blog. While written by a staff writer, it seems to be a "cast a wide net and find out what people are writing" piece, not subject to general journalistic standards. In my opinion, the Register's little better than a tabloid. The Tampa Bay Primer Kotepho lists is by no means an unbiased journalistic publication. That leaves 4 links of those listed by Kotepho which are, in my opinion, completely valid. Even college newspapers produce many, many more articles meeting journalistic standards. In my mind, the question is whether this should be decided by WP:WEB. I mean, this organization purports to be a news agency. Shouldn't it be judged as one? Unfortunately, we have no notability guidelines for those (though there appears to be a proposed one for US broadcasters.) Actually, in that light, I can't justify calling this a news agency, and I'm changing my Keep to a Comment.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 23:35, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that it's the blog section of the WashPost url (though not in title), but as you say it is a staff writer. My test with this and the Guardian is not their reliability as fact vetters per se - it is their circulation, which I assume is fairly wide, combined, and hence we achieve <i>notability</i> for the subject. Now, whether INA is a bona-fide news agency is another issue - I don't know if we have enough evidence for that, and in general the present article may need serious NPOVing and verifiable sourcing for its various claims. But for me step 1 is notability and we have it. Step 2 would be to present sourced facts about what it really is. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:52, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>With all due respect to <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a>, the Washington Post is a major newspaper. If they are going to pay their staff reporters to do web-based news round-ups, for publication on their website, and the Israel News Agency is put on the same footing with <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Ahram_Weekly_3dea.html" title="Al-Ahram Weekly">Al-Ahram Weekly</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_News_ee8f.html" title="Gulf News">Gulf News</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a>, blogger <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Cole_474e.html" title="Juan Cole">Juan Cole</a>, and the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_Times_bc85.html" title="Middle East Times">Middle East Times</a>, then we need this article. I don't live in an area where the Washington Post or NY Times is available in print. Like millions of people, I read their websites. If they are quoting from a news source, then we should have an article on that news source.

<li>From WP:WEB, Criteria for web content: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple <b>non-trivial</b> published works <b>whose source is independent of the site itself</b>." I don't understand how being quoted in a couple of news stories (one in a blog section) meets this criteria. Also from WP:WEB "The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it." Nothing you're linking to <b>focuses</b> on the INA, it just mentions it. Has anyone found any independent parties that have, in fact, written <b>about the Israel News Agency itself</b>, as opposed to it simply quoting it? <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 01:46, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a <i>guideline</i>, not a policy, and it is obviously in conflict with itself, because the <i>note</i> you quote conflicts with the main criterion. You cannot have an explanatory note at the bottom contradicting the main criterion presented in the body of a stable guideline or policy. But I think you need to take a step back and ask: do we have notability here? Well, if you are cited by the Washington Post right alongside Al Ahram<a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/worldopinionroundup/2006/06/the_hostage_and_the_picnic_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/worldopinionroundup/2006/06/the_hostage_and_the_picnic_1.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, that to me shows notability. The Wash Post online (the root of this url is the Wash Post main site) has a huge reach, and this is clear notability.

<li>I know Alexa rankings are innacurate, but I think they do provide some basis for comparing the traffic various sites get. I don't think the INA is exactly on the "same footing" as these other organizations. I also don't understand what you are saying about WP:WEB contradicting itself. From the "Criteria for web content" section, "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Please show me sources where the INA itself is the <i>subject</i> of works whose source is <i>independent of the site itself.</i> Or are you saying that since WP:WEB is merely a <i>guideline</i> we should ignore it to save <i>this</i> particular article? <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 17:41, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Here is the contradiction in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as I see it:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In "Criteria for Web content" is says, as you quote, that the entry in question must be "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself". Well, WashPost/Guardian are idependent of INA, 2 is 'multiple', both news articles there are 'non-trivial' published works and INA is 'a subject' (note the preposition 'a' - not <i>the</i> subject - this is a critical distinction for later)</li>
<li>In the same major item, a sub-item states: "This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.[5]" - I think you will concede that a published report on the Wash Post online and Guardian online meet that criterion, as 'newspaper' nowadays includes the electronic version and in any case it would fall under 'reliable published works in all forms'.</li>
<li>Now we come to the contradiction. In the <b>Notes</b> section, well after the <b>Criteria</b> section, even past <b>See also</b>, we have a list of examples/clarifications/refinements called 'notes', where one of those 'notes' states, as was also quoted above: "The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it." Note the final <i>focus upon it</i> part. That IMO contradicts the main inclusion criteria section where it says that the item in question must be <b>a</b> subject of the published work, not <b>the</b> subject. I think that in a case of contradiction like this in a guideline, I would assume the main section trumps a note at the end. Of course logic is on our side also: imagine 2 people X and Y invent something important. They get written up everywhere, <i>but always in the same article</i>. If we were to take the footnote version as our inclusion criterion, X and Y would never get their own WP articles, since they were always mentioned together. That's not logical obviously and should be fixed in the guideline.</li>

<dd>Now as far as the ratings of Al Ahram vs. INA - I never implied that INA is as well known as Al Ahram, my point is simply that if a reputable, widely distributed source quotes INA alongside Al Ahram, it gives INA notability, regardless of the Alexa ratings. And note that I switched from Delete to Keep, so I have no ax to grind - just trying my best to be neutral. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we're just reading the same sentence two different ways. I see "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." to mean:
<ul>
<li>"The content itself has been the subject..." That would be the INA. Has <i>the INA</i> been the subject? No. It was merely mentioned.</li>
<li>"...of multiple non-trivial published works..." I consider two quotes from INA stories in two papers (one of them in the blog section) to be fairly trivial.</li>
<li>"...whose source is independent of the site itself." How could the source of the work be independent of the site itself when the only mention of the site is a quote from it?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I would agree with you if both of the articles were <i>about</i> the INA, but all they're doing is quoting one small piece of an INA story. And considering the INA has been around since 1995 (according to... itself) having two quotes used is incredibly trivial. Eleven years, and that's the extent of the "published works" they've been the "subject" of? Nota-what? <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 23:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(outdent) I agree with you that for 11 years worth of claimed existence it's not much, but the question is 'is it notable today or not' - not 'is it fast growing or not'. Now as to your 3 points, let me address them one by one:
<ol>
<li>INA being 'the subject': I interpret that to mean as <i>non exclusive subject</i>. IOW, the Wash Post for instance, used the INA content alongside Al Ahram (in fact they are being <i>contrasted</i>, which is even more of a 'use' as opposed to just a listing of similar items), and I would make a case that in this type article, each of the used quotes are an essential and integral part of the article, hence they are a 'subject' that is being discussed there (per my X/Y example above).</li>
<li>Non triviality: Again, at least in the Wash Post example it is being <i>contrasted</i> with Al Ahram, so it is not a 'trivial' mention, as would be the case if it were part of a list.</li>
<li>Independent source: I think the meaning of the criterion you mention is to elimiate a situation where self-promotion, where the notability citation is on a site <i>related</i> to the web site we are evaluating for notability. I don't think the Guardian or the Wash Post are related to INA.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Again, look at the big picture: does this connote notability? Of course. How much? fairly large circulation/distribution/reach. Will readers remember the name INA or follow up its links and learn more about it? Some will, some won't. But you have to stay objective - it does give it a fairly wide audience.</dd>
<dd>Also, assume that these 2 publications do mention INA in the future (not unlikely). A curious reader (maybe one of many) does want to follow up and find out who in the world is this INA. Well if we delete the entry WP won't educate them any. All they'll have the INA web site itself (and Google-cached WP). <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One minor clarification: My reading of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is that the 'subject' of the published article is the <i>content</i> of the Web site being evaluated for inclusion, not the <i>company</i> or individual(s) that run(s) that site. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see the INA (or the content of the INA) as being a <i>source</i> for the article, not <i>the subject</i>, or even <i>a</i> subject. I also see the WP:WEB criteria as being there so we could be assured of having sources for a Wikipedia article (which would require the INA to be the <i>subject</i> of the article). Otherwise, how will we write an article? "The INA was once quoted in the Washington Post blog?" The article tells us nothing really <i>about</i> the INA. <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 04:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Crum375, rather than explain, I'll demonstrate.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with you we don't have a nice write-up <i>about</i> INA, like the ITIM article, which of course doesn't need it for notability in the first place, since it's already well established. The article by Wash Post is stated to be about the international online sources' view of recent events. As such, the mention of INA, with its opinion on the events, contrasted with Al Ahram's, is a part of the article and hence <i>a</i> part of the subject (though of course not <i>the</i> subject). I agree that this article is not <i>focused</i> on the INA content, and certainly not on INA as an entity. The point is simply that the citation there makes INA <i>notable</i>. The question is whether it is notable <i>enough</i> to meet WP requirements. The reason I say 'yes' is simply having seen lots of AfD votes on much more obscure organizations or persons that got kept, that had a fraction of INA's exposure. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:44, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, Woggly. That's exactly the type of article I was talking about. Instead of a non-trivial write-up like that, we're talking about including what's basically a blog because it was a source for... a blog? Look at this another way, if you use <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Notability (organizations)</a> instead, "Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found." That's my issue- absolutely no "verifiable information from reliable third party sources." I believe that's the essence of what WP:WEB means, that we must have <i>something</i> to use to write the article. If we don't have something "...whose source is independent of the site itself," all we have to base the article on is <i>the site itself</i>.

Also one must consider quality over quantity i.e. - The Register, The Washington Post, The Jerusalem Post, Google News and thousands of blogs that pick up from Google News. Israel is at war on two fronts today with terrorism. Israel and every free democracy needs the INA and other media which transmit direct feeds from their respective governments. If 67,200 Google results is not notable, what is? <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonnieisrael_553e.html" title="User:Bonnieisrael">Bonnieisrael</a> 14:15, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, I think such a thing can be sourced, and a more-complete article on the subject could be of some use. But if it's to be kept, it needs to be sourced, and right now it is severely lacking in that respect. I'd prefer to give the article some time to mature before consigning it to the dumps so soon, but if improvements aren't quick in coming I wouldn't object to seeing it back here again. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 20:53, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think the list may help form an article like Street gangs in Detroit. I am maybe a little biased because of my personal familiarity with Detroit, but I think there are quite a number of gangs active (although the list is a little long and I suspect some of the names are BS) yet it can be very surpriisng how territorial they are. Plus when I go to a sporting event or something in Detroit, you see Cops wearing special "Gang Unit" vests. So I tried to clean the page up some, and hopefully it may actually prove to be a useful way to learn about these gangs. Although, like any article it should be adequately sourced with outside links, like th earticle i wrote on the <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errol_Flynns_b6d5.html" title="Errol Flynns">Errol Flynns</a>--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 05:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete it</b>, many vegetarians love this list. And visit Wikipedia more often because of this list. Other countries also have a "List of vegetarians" on Wikipedia.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.46.204.236 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.46.204.236_a067.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.46.204.236">contribs</a>) 11 July 2006.</small></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>To deal with those points in order, and bearing in mind the conventions of <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> (which is a must-read on category vs list vs serial box issues):</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>large - could be split if necessary, there are several ways to do this (splitting lists is perfectly common)</li>
<li>incomplete to an unknown and probably unknowable degree - doesn't matter. Sometimes a selected list - even slightly arbitrarily selected - is more interesting. Look, if the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (okay, bad example, but bear with the logic) contains <i>everything anybody had ever been recorded as saying</i> there'd be no point reading it. It's fine for a list to be a work in progress, no different to any of our other articles.</li>
<li>may include entire religions with all their adherents - indeed, just stating the religion would save space without losing information. Indeed a link to the appropriate category could be provided.</li>
<li>hence, unmaintainable - there's a risk of it degrading, but I think once it's cleaned up, the periodic cull of unreferenced articles will keep it tidy enough. If needs be it can be split.</li>
<li>largely uncited - cleanup, not afd. Yes, needs culling to the barebones, but remember that (a) categories themselves don't have any citations and (b) articles will only give references for the vegetarianism of their subjects if you're very lucky! With most articles you're lucky to get a reference on <i>anything</i>, let alone something like that. The most straightforward place to find references about people's vegetarianism is probably a secondary reliable source list of vegetarians</li>
<li>no better than a category would be - no. Just no. There are things that this list is much worse at (categories stay up to date) but here are some things that this list does <i>far</i> better:
<ul>
<li>It's actually an article. You could print it out and show it to your vegetarian/meat-eating friends; you could take it for your bedtime reading. It's actually quite an interesting read! Why? Because when I see all those names in a category, I have no idea who they all are. In this article, there's some brief contextual details, which I for one found rather interesting.</li>
<li>It's sorted in quite a good way i.e. people who you would associate with one another appear quite near each other. The categories are only sorted alphabetically (other than the fact that there are subcategories for nationality). They're purely arranged you can find stuff. You'd have to be even more anal than I am to actually print out page after page of category listings for your bedtime reading. There's no context to it. (And as for the "associated" aspect, <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> would break down in howls of laughter at the sight of Category:Vegetarians by occupation and subcats - that would be a ridiculous cross-cat in terms of our category system; yet on the other hand, it seems quite natural, indeed the way most books would do it, on a listings page.)</li>
<li>You can also check the references. Here of course, there's basically nothing, so you know straight away not to trust anything included so far&#160;:-) On the category system, you could load up a page of listings and find that only a couple of the articles actually had references for the vegetarianism - and that would only be after loading up and reading through 200 articles! That hardly makes verifiability a piece of cake; you're just left trusting that there's enough editors taking tender care of those articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sometimes used to push a POV (e.g. Shakespeare, Hitler) - the list's not inherently POV-pushing so that's a matter for cleanup, not AFD. It's also quite a neutral thing to report that Hitler was vegetarian - I'd be more worried to see a list of vegetarians that deliberately left him out as an "unrepresentative example" than one that put him in.</li>
<li>contains real and fictional characters mixed, always a bad idea - cleanup matter, not AFD. But good point nonetheless.</li>
<li>contains contemporary and historical characters in no kind of balance - cleanup matter, not AFD. Again a good point, though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basically, the thrust of the objection here is based on <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a>, which actually makes perfectly clear that there are both <i>advantages</i> and <i>disadvantages</i> to a list, many of which have been listed (between JzG and myself) above. It's not a case of finding a "winner" but finding whether it's useful for them to sit side by side. As far as I can see, they may be useful complements to each other. (Suppose, for instance, you did want to source a claim about a person's vegetarianism in their article - this list would be a perfect place to check whether it's already covered by a general vegetarianism reference.) I'm not going to shy away from the fact that the list at the moment, while a rather interesting and definitely quite offbeat read, is basically substandard and shouldn't go anywhere near "magic 1.0", but most of these concerns are cleanup ones being used to bolster a one-side-of-the-argument-only CLS case. If this is deleted (and given its current shoddy state I can understand that) may I <b>request that it be userfied</b> in its final, pre-deletion state to User:TheGrappler/List of vegetarians? Once the organization, inclusion criteria, and most importantly the references get sorted, I can't see why the list shouldn't be put back in article space. There's no clear policy against such lists (in fact, it's closer to the reverse), and a well-referenced, humanly readable (rather than purely intended for "eyeball searching") list would have additional (not "alternative") benefits to the categories. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 09:00, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have no problem at all with that. My favourite kinds of lists are the ones which add something encyclopaedic beyond the bare list of names. Here one could have a group of people named by <i>foo</i> source as following certain diets, for example. There's lot that <i>could</i> be done with it. Starting with sourcing it and removing the possibility of ioncluding a third of the world's population&#160;;-) Maybe people noted for advocacy? People who have publicly spoken out about vegetarianism or against the eating of meat? Something a bit more than "does not eat dead animal" anyway. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:59, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I can see perfectly well the problems with the list in current form. At the moment, I'm too busy to commit personal resources to it but on the other hand, having seen it, I'd definitely like to over the next few weeks/months. If it does end up userfied at least it will give me chance to slash and burn with impunity... as anyone who has encountered me on <a href="../../../g/a/n/WP%7EGAN_e8d4.html" title="WP:GAN">WP:GAN</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> may be aware, I take sources and references seriously, and this list's in trouble at the moment, especially given the ambitious claims of pro-vegetarianism groups. Nevertheless, I still think it should be kept in article space so that other people can have a bash at knocking it into shape. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 12:17, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>delete.</b> My rationale for discounting some of the keep calls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment 1 - I understand "pending verification" to mean "if sources are provided for the article", and throughout the AfD the article remained unsourced, thus the rationale behind the merge call is nullified.</li>
<li>Comment 2 - There were at least 5 days during the AfD to expand the article, yet after the AfD tag was placed on it, it wasn't touched a bit.</li>
<li>Comment 3 - due to lack of reasoning behind the call.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, BlueValour pointed out a major problem with the article - it is unsourced, and hence original research. The article was not edited to remedy this. Hence I can only see 2 delete / 1 merge which is a consensus to delete. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 19:10, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Every item on this list already has on or more Wikipedia entries devoted to it - eg - [Trojan horse (computing)] - it is my intention to link every item in my list to the appropriate Wikipedia entry to ultimately create a master "table of contents" to which everyone can refer when they are investigating any one of these threats (in order to see where the individual threats fit into the "big picture")</p>
<p>This linkage will take substantial amounts of time (days) - but I beleive the end result will be a valuable resource for the world of computer security Cnd 19:11, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Malware is item 1.1.2 in the list - there's 100 or so other things that are not Malware listed.</p>
<p>This is the <b>point</b> of this list - when people who are looking at Malware need to know anything about similar threats, this list is the only thing in existence that can show them what other things are potential problems, and how malware fits into the scheme of this topic.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as original research. This is a very nice outline, though. If you decide to put it on the web, consider alerting people at sites with similar purposes of its existence. If they deem it appropriate, they can link to your site, and then it will be able to serve its purpose. Also, when it goes to its new location, consider linking to appropriate reference sites with further information about each of these things. Then the page can serve as a nice reference index for computer threats, which I think would be more useful to the general population than a list. GassyGuy 11:45, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Addendum</b> for Warren's sake, a more detailed description of the problems with this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The idea of a "wrong" winner of an election implies that one or more "right" winners exist, which is inherently biased. The idea that the "right" winner is defined as the one that "most of the populace would have preferred" is also biased, because some voting systems are explicitly designed to use other factors than plain majorities.</li>
<li>The text is biased. Wrong-way elections are "pathologies" and "alter history, presumably usually for the worse"?</li>
<li>The examples are poor. Other than the Gore-Bush election, which is adequately covered elsewhere, the only example is that of Allende. The article even admits that the sole source cited in this example uses its references inappropriately.</li>
<li>The mathematical properties of voting systems are already covered in the articles <a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting_system.html" title="Voting system">Voting system</a> and <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_different_voting_systems_under_similar_circumstances.html" title="Effects of different voting systems under similar circumstances">Effects of different voting systems under similar circumstances</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have no objections to the suggested creation of a List of elections in which the winner received fewer votes than an opponent, but such an article would be able to retain so little from this one that I'd suggest deleting this and starting the new one afresh. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 23:20, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--thank you for this addendum. Let me reply point by point. &gt;The idea of a "wrong" winner of an election implies that one or more "right" winners exist, which is inherently biased. --So if I say that "wrong way Corrigan" flew across the Atlantic in the wrong direction (famous front page fact), then that was an inherently biased statement unacceptable for wikipedia? I don't follow this "logic." Also wikipedia itself does not agree with that logic since it has an article on him. &gt; The idea that the "right" winner is defined as the one that "most of the populace would have preferred" is also biased, because some voting systems are explicitly designed to use other factors than plain majorities. --That is somewhat true if you want to quibble about irrelevant bull. But the reason I call that "irrelevant bull" is we do not actually need to get into the finer points - The fact is, in the examples in the 20-example table, it is pretty obvious to anybody who should have won and why. Also, I did not make this "definition" anyhow; you did. &gt;The examples are poor. Other than the Gore-Bush election, which is adequately covered elsewhere, the only example is that of Allende. The article even admits that the sole source cited in this example uses its references inappropriately. --I gave a table with about 20 different elections. You ignored it. I said I'd be happy to put it in the wikipedia article [rather than 1 click away], provided anybody could show me how. You ignored that. YES, the wikipedia has an article on the Gore-Bush election - but it did not say that it was an election which Condorcet, IRV, etc etc would have given it to Gore. By the way, the fact that is true, is not an "opinion", it is not "biased", it is agreed to by 100% of political scientists, it has been stated in at least half a dozen political science books and papers because everybody regards it as an excellent example, etc. &gt;The article even admits that the sole source cited in this example uses its references inappropriately. --hello? I was not "admitting" that, I was "attacking" that source and "correcting" it. This makes twice so far you have attacked "me" when actually you have been attacking "something other than what I said." &gt;The mathematical properties of voting systems are already covered in the articles <a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting_system.html" title="Voting system">Voting system</a> and <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_different_voting_systems_under_similar_circumstances.html" title="Effects of different voting systems under similar circumstances">Effects of different voting systems under similar circumstances</a>. --yes, but those articles did not even try to answer the central question addressed here: how often do these problems occur in real elections and how big an effect do they have on history? --So I thank you for your feedback. I merely find it unjustified. -Warren Smith.</p>

<p>--uh, hi. I am a new wikipedia user and not very familiar with how to best do things. I also do not know what prod and prod2 and opabinia regalis are. But anyway, to respond to this criticism:</p>
<p>1. if you do not like the title, I would be happy to rename it, assuming you or anybody can think of a better title. I myself was not thrilled with the title but could not think of a better one. On the other hand if you cannot think of a better title I think that hould be regarded as an admission by you my title was optimal.</p>
<p>2. if you do not like the writing, again, improve the writing.</p>
<p>3. I dispute the claim this article either has a point of view (which I assume is what you mean by POV) or inherently has one. My claim instead is, it is an extremely important and interesting question how often different voting systems yield the wrong winner. There is no question this is a more interesting and important topic than a random wikipedia topic, as I proved by hitting the "random article" button 10 times. Also I know of at least two political science professors who told me they had not seen such a collection (as the table) before, and were glad it had been compiled at last. So it is worthy of inclusion.</p>
<p>Now you may say that the fact anybody was a "wrong" election winner is always an opinion... and while I guess I agree there is always some element of opinion or guesswork in there, in many cases it is pretty darn clear. The table the article hyperlinks at</p>
<pre>
 <a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/FunnyElections.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rangevoting.org/FunnyElections.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rangevoting.org/FunnyElections.html</a>
</pre>
<p>of about 20 wrong-winner elections, backs up every claim it makes with pretty solid evidence and while I suppose it is conceivable a few entries could be disputed by some devil's advocate, the vast bulk of them are surely correct. Incidentally, I would not object if this table were included directly in the article rather than hyperlinked, but I do not know how to do that.</p>
<p>I mean, you claiming that table is an "opinion" is like claiming the "Jim Crow" era in American politics is merely a "POV opinion" - maybe it did not really exist - and hence the wikipedia should not cover that topic. In fact, just about everything in political science would by that logic be excluded. So I can't agree on that.</p>

--Warren again. Hi, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to respond to an attack which simply expresses an opinion with zero supporting evidence. I mean, am I supposed to do the same and then we just say "is! isnt't! is too!" for a while?</p>
<p>It is well accepted by 100% of political scientists, or at least 100% of all the ones I ever saw, that wrong way elections exist and are an important topic. I suppose you could say this is an opinion, in which case you dismiss statements 100% of all political scientists agree with, as not worthy of inclusion in wikipedia, because they are "opinions."</p>
<p>To return to my Jim Crow example, it is well accepted Jim Crow laws were passed to disenfrachise blacks. Probably not as well accepted as the fact that wrong-way elections exist and are important, but well accepted. But these laws all were written in a way not mentioning "blacks" per se. Therefore that was only an "opinion"? Well, no.</p>
<p>Now one can cite a ton of statistics proving that after JC law passed, suddenly black voters and elected rep counts dropped like a rock, but, hey, there are a ton of statistics in the table in my article too, and you aren't paying any attention to them either, so I guess such statistics are considered by you irrelevant. The point I'm making is, I do not see why Jim Crow is accepted for wikipedia and Wrong-way elections is not. As far as I can see, the sole reason is your POV or unsupported opinion.</p>
<p>I also continue to suggest improving the writing or the title. I have seen wikip articles myself with poor writing, but I tried to improve it if so, rather than recommending it be deleted. That seems counterproductive. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by WarrenDSmith (<a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrenDSmith_ca7e.html" title="User talk:WarrenDSmith">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WarrenDSmith_e5c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/WarrenDSmith">contribs</a>).</small></p>

--Warren again. OK, a slightly different title would be</p>
<pre>
  "Wrong way" elections.
</pre>
<p>The point is that by putting the quote marks in the title, it somehow is made clearer that the author is acknowledging that there is a certain amount of arbitraryness to the concept. It is kind of like newspapers using the word "alleged." Do you agree this is a superior title? if so, go ahead and change the title. (I do not know how to change titles myself.)</p>
<p>--I also did a certain amount of writing-improvement.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>It's a decent article, but the entire concept that winning an election under the guidelines in place for that election produces the wrong result does not sit well with me. <b>Weak delete</b> and replace with the proposed list of elections in which an opponent of the winner has received more votes. Within that list, there could be a brief explanation of what electoral system/rules were in place for each example given that caused the winner to be the winner over the cited opponent. However, anything remotely implying that the result is "wrong" is pushing the POV that direct democracy is the "right" way, and that obviously will always be a debated opinion, not a fact. GassyGuy 11:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>--response by WarrenSmith - hi, you are correct that the whole "wrong way election" concept I speak of, involves a valid winner under the rules of that election, whom we nevertheless contend is somehow wrong.</p>
<p>But you are confused in saying there are elections in which an opponent received more votes. Obviously if the rules were that the winner is the one with the most votes, then no such example exists under those rules. Furhter, I never argued in the article that "direct democracy is the right way" (nor even mentioned direct democracy) - you did that. So your entire comment is just ludicrous, makes no logical sense, and attacks something I never said (which makes the third time that has happened).</p>
<p>The problem, which "does not sit well with you" that somebody could be a wholy legitimate winner under the rules, but nevertheless the rules were flawed, is your real stumbling block. Suppose the rules are "no matter what the votes are, Adolf Hitler is elected." Then the election is carried out under those rules. Well, according to you, that was a wholy legitimate election under those rules and it is merely an "opinion" that Hitler maybe was a "wrong winner." But a more productive view would be, some election rules are less good than other rules, and that can cause problems, which we can document via 20 historical examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Poorly written, inherently biased article on a subject with better, balanced coverage elsewhere on Wikipedia. Adding quote marks to the title draws attention to the fact that the title is not an established expression, and requires clarification. If further coverage of the topic is required, it needs a more accessible title. This is not the place to popularise new expressions. Warren, your reference to 'wrong way' Corrigan fails on this count, if on no other - the term is well-established in reference to sailing and aeronautical feats, whereas in voting, it certainly isn't. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 12:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>--Look, I was reposnding to the attack which said the veyr use of "wrong way" implied bias unacceptable in wikipedia. The attack was not saying "wrong way" is unacceptable because it is not a common enough expression. I responded to the attack. Then you complained I should have responded to a different, not-stated, attack. But how could I do that?</p>
<p>But anyway, since you raise the point, "wrong way" is a very common expression. I do not think I am plunging into new incomprehensible territory with it. And so far nobody has proposed a better title.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is an <i>argument</i> - a thesis for (say) a political science paper. The citations are essentially to individual elections; the concept holding them together is more-or-less solely in the author's head.

<p>--This is not an "opinion", it is based on "facts".</p>
<p>And I was not explictly arguing against instant runoff voting, although the Chile 1970 and Peru 2006 elections bith are examples of its failure.</p>
<p>--Let us look at the big picture. 1. Wrong way elections are important and change history resulting sometimes in enormous changes. 2. they happen fairly frequently. So far, nobody here has disputed those things.</p>
<p>OK, given that this is an important and tolerably frequent phenomenon, which has considerably more effect on humanity than most wikipedia topics, and also given that nobody has compiled my big table of wrong winner elections before that I know of (although of course all the data was out there - I have merely compiled it which is exactly what encyclopedias are supposed to do), then it is irresponsible of wikipedia not to include it. By not including it, wikipedia does a disservice to humanity, and possibly causes thousands or even millions of more deaths. That is the downside of deleting it. OK, what is the downside of keeping it? Well, gee, it does not "sit well" with some people who just don't have the time to bother improving the article themselves, and who attack it for a bunch of things that it never said, and gee, the title seems a bit funny even though they can't think of a better one. Aaaah, big bummer.</p>
<p>OK, comparing the cost versus benefits, it seems to me, there is something to be said for keeping the article.

<p>--Look, you are going to have to be more clear than NOR NPOV. I repeat for the gazillionth time I do not understand your copious weird abbreviations. (This is WD Smith again). Now concerning the "scare quotes" and "preposterous hyperbole." Again, my critic seems to be missing the entire point of the article. Wrong way elections change history. In some cases those changes cause the deaths of thousands. Is my critic seriously disputing those facts? I shall assume not. (If he is, please give refutations election by election in order that you can be counter-refuted.)</p>
<p>Now given that is the case, my question is - should wikipedia make its readers aware of a phenomenon which changes history and causes the deaths of thousands or even millions? Or should it pretend the phenomenon does not exist and/or is not worthy of coverage?</p>
<p>I DID NOT say there is a right and wrong path of history. You did. I am very tired of being attacked for things I never said but the critic did say. This is at least the 4th time such an attack has happened. As far as I can see, in such cases the "bias" is in my critics' minds, but not in my article.</p>
<p>My article *did* make the incredibly far out opinionated statement that "presumably" in cases where the voting system delivers an election result contrary to what the voters wanted, that usually affects history for the worse.</p>
<p>If the critic wants, I am perfectly fine with putting in to the article (to null out that horribly opinionated statement) the claim that</p>
<pre>
  This has been disputed.  Critic XXXX (name here) believes that voting 
  systems delivering results different
  from what the voters want, usually changes history for the better.
</pre>
<p>Then we can proceed.</p>
<p>However, since I doubt any such XXXX exists, and if so this will not happen, I guess the statement is undisputed and therefore not an "opinion."</p>

<p>--hi (warren again) look. WPNOR stands for "original reserach." You are the first critic ever to complain my article was "original research" and (as appears to be usual with wikipedia critics) you cite zero examples. But I am rather surprised to learn that "looking up data in almanacs and reading newspapers" is "original research". It appears I've done a great deal of original research in my life without even knowing it. Golly.</p>
<p>Next, I am attacked for WPNPOV, which stands for neutral point of view, me supposedly not having one. Well, as usual, zero actual quotes from my article are presented to justify this accusation, where it can join the large number of accusations which actually do cite fake pseudo-quotes by me which, however, never existed.</p>
<p>I must say, I am not impressed by the quality of the know-it-alls at wikipedia based on all this.</p>
<p>I was just looking at</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2002" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2002" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2002</a>
</pre>
<p>which is another wrong-way election, by the way, and golly, sure looks a hell of a lot more opinionated than my article, but I do not see you objecting to it. Let's see. That article says Le Pen was "unexpected" (with no support), says it led to "serious discussions" (with no support), says Le Pen had "harsh rhetoric" (whatever that is) according to "many observers" (not one of which is actually named) and Chirac I see was "suspect".</p>
<p>Well, ok. Why is this fine, and mere mathematical facts as in my article, supported by a table of about 20 elections worth of data (i.e. way more facts) are somehow bad? Answer: that was written by one of you. I don't get it. As far as I can see, the idea is to try to divide the world into wikipedia "insiders" vs not, and then try to attack the outsiders perhaps because you don't have anything better to do? Anyway, I recommend as a startlingly original new policy, attacking articles by actually quoting them and saying what is wrong, and/or suggesting fixes.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Warren, please sign your edits in the same way as other users, by putting four tildes (~) at the end of your comment. As to your continued advocacy of your position: Nothing can be said to change history. You are promoting the biased (not to mention inaccurate) position that there is a true future history from which we are diverted by things like disputed elections. If you cannot understand why this is inaccurate, you may need to think again about what you mean by concepts like "history" and "future". History is the past. It is a record of things that happened, and an attempt to explain them. It is in no way altered by disputed elections, or by the fact that it records them. There is no right winner of an election; an election may be regarded as debatable because of overt or covert manipulation, or because it is specific to the use of a specific electoral method. What it is not is "wrong". Your article is an essay promoting the opposite of this point of view, and is irretrievably biased. And your claim that Wikipedia will cause thousands or millions of deaths by removing that article would make a fine illustration of what is meant by <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 10:25, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
--Again you continue to attack a position I never have held, and never said. That makes at least the 5th time that has happened. What is the matter with simply quoting what I <i>did</i> say???</p>
<p>Now about my "hyperbole". OK, there are 2 claims here, and from them a conclusion:</p>
<p>1. wrong way elections alter history and can cause thousands of deaths. For example, Bush got elected not Gore even though the voters wanted Gore more both in the USA-wide and in Florida 2000. Gore claimed the Iraq war was a mistake and he would not have done it. The Iraq war directly and indirectly caused 100,000 deaths according to a study in <i>The Lancet</i>. OK. Note, I did NOT claim Bush was better, or Gore was better, or wars are wrong, or wars are right, or deaths are wrong, or history was untrue, and more generally I did NOT say 1000 other things I did not say. Let us stick to the facts and the things I did say. I'm saying this because I realize you really really like inventing things I never said.</p>
<p>2. Wikipedia is the world's largest and most widely read encyclopedia. It therefore follows that somebody might pay attention to an idea in wikipedia, and change a voting system, whereas, if wikipedia remained silent, they might not. For example, the Chileans have changed their voting system to now employ a top-2 runoff, whereas in the famous wrong-way 1970 election my article discussed, they did not do that. Actually, this improvement would not have sufficed to fix their 1970 problem, but thanks to the fact my wikipedia article was not around, they did not realize that. Also, thanks to the fact my wikipedia article was not around, the French also did not realize it, and therefore encountered (what the wikipedia article on the French 2000 election calls) an "unexpected" problem. If my article had been around, then it would not have been "unexpected" it would have been "predictable as a repeat of the Chilean 1970 events."</p>
<p>3. Combining (1) and (2) we come to the conclusion that Wikipedia, by having this article, may well prevent thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>Now. Was this "hyperbole"? If so, then you dispute either (1) or (2). Are you the first-ever person to dispute 1? Or do you instead believe Wikipedia is not widely read and has little effect on anybody? Which is it?</p>
<p>I am now signing off as Warren Smith by putting 4 tildes as you told me, despite the fact I see this whole attack on me was started by some anonymous coward who calls her or himself "opabinia regalis." But I guess you all have no sense of irony.69.123.66.114 19:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Warren, you've proved my point. There is no such thing as changing history. To rebut both your points above: 1) History records that George W Bush was the winner of the 2000 presidential election. History was not altered to say this; it has been true since the Supreme Court handed down its decision in 'Bush vs Gore'. We only have Gore's opinion as to how he would have acted had he been in power. Personally I trust him; but his view is just an opinion, and the Iraq war is a matter of historical fact. Nothing was changed or altered. 2) Wikipedia may be one of the largest encyclopedias, but it's surely not the most widely read, because relatively few people have the internet, compared to the numbers who can use 'Britannica' at public libraries, for example. Your claim that your article, had it existed, would have influenced entire nations to alter their voting systems, is astonishingly arrogant and frankly worrying. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 09:28, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I (Greg Wolfe) am wikpedia newbie so please forgive me if I do not follow the correct conventions in this comment. The article seems to be very interesting and useful to me. The criticism of others here seems to be destructive - focused on the need to delete the article for various (to me) marginal reasons. I would very much prefer to see the article and the information of Warren's chart remain in a perhaps editted form. Since none of the critics could come up with an improved title for the article, may I suggest "Examples of election results that would have had different results under different voting methods". The article could indicate what voting system was used and suggestions (&amp; evidence) of how it would have turned out under an assortment of alternative voting methods (including range, approval, IRV). I follow several forums that discuss election methods and I can tell you that having ready references to to actual elections with results that arguably would have been different under different voting systems is extremely important and useful.

<p>--warren again. Glad to see my essay is "deeply POV and OR" but as usual for these attacks not a single example is given, and indeed all the attacks so far COMBINED have not given a single OR example. Why is it so hard? How am I to reply to attacks that are non-attacks? Yawn. Moving, on, I see that I am "rebutted" because "History records that George W Bush was the winner of the 2000 presidential election. History was not altered to say this". great. BUT (AND THIS MAKES THE SIXTH TIME this has happened) I never said history had recorded something different. I also never said history was altered. Therefore, these two sentences do not "rebut" me. I even told my critic not to make up things I did not say. I warned him. I continue to await with bated breath the day when this critic will actually quote me for real and attack something I actually said, as opposed to his own fantasies. By the way, since I consider attacks on articles without mentioning a single valid example, and repeatedly, even after being warned, also making up false fantasies, to be wikipedia "vandalism," I would like AlexTiefling to be expelled from wikipedia as a clear vandal. How do I go about making a formal complaint against this vandal? And oho, I see GregWolfe with a note of sanity. Yes, the man is exactly right. And unlike the vast majority of my critics he shows signs of knowing what he is talking about. How refreshing. cheerio - Warren Smith.69.123.66.114 02:21, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh, the phrase "alter history" is <i>right in your article</i>. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 04:26, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Warren, go and read how Wikipedia defines vandalism. I have not touched your article. I have not altered your comments here, except to interpolate my own clearly labelled comments. You said, above, "1. Wrong way elections are important and change history resulting sometimes in enormous changes....So far, nobody here has disputed those things." - and later, "1. wrong way elections alter history and can cause thousands of deaths." So you clearly state that history is altered, contrary to your claim in your last comment. Your difficulty in sticking to the facts even about your own statements is not my problem. Please do not accuse me of vandalism and "making up false fantasies". <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 09:06, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>--(wds again) aha, I see your point. (So I retract my claim AlexT is a vandal, but I do wish he'd use actual quotes. Or anybody else. And I repeat that I never said Bush had not won and I never said history had recorded anything different.) Very well. I guess I was thrown by AlexT's claim that I claimed that either history did not record Bush won (my article said, quote, "Bush won") or that history was "altered" to say this.</p>
<p>Obviously any election alters history from what it would have been if the election had produced a different winner. But AlexT keeps attacking some goofy philosophy of his that supposedly is mine that history has "one true course" or something I never said. I really couldn't care less about his stupid philosophy that isn't mine anyhow.</p>
<p>Now to GregWolfe's suggestion of a new title, I like his title better in the sense it is more informative and also clearer. However it is worse in the sense it is not as short and snappy. So I would suggest Title: "Wrong way" elections of Wrong way elections or Wrong-way elections Subtitle: Examples of elections whose results would have differed under different voting methods or another possibility is Title: Method-dependent elections</p>
<p>I am now about to alter the article a bit to add some new sources and some new WW elections have been added to the table. -wds69.123.66.114 18:58, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Improved since first listed, but still needs some work. All the references in the text to the company (LoveMySeat.com) need to go - a link to the website at the end in an "External Links" section will be enough - and, most importantly, the article needs to establish that this term is in general use - that it's not just specific to the one company. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 23:22, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article looked an awful lot like an adverisement from lovemyseat, and as such I understand the nomination perfectly.

<li><b>Delete</b> because the article is essentially nothing. The only information is that he was president of 1-800-Mattress and that he died recently. While he was an important figure for the company, it was actually his father who started the business. In my opinion, he's not notable enough to be put on the list of notable deaths-- personally, when I saw his name on the list, I had no idea who he was, and after reading that article, I wasn't much more informed. --Evan Carlstrom 04:40, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay, people. Please listen carefully: this article is in a dreadful, dreadful, self-inflicted-by-the-author-who-is-the-subject state. That is <b>not</b> why it is here. Articles such as this can be cleaned up. This article is here to establish whether it is worth doing so: <b>is the subject notable or not</b>? There's an assertion of notability of sorts right at the bottom. Please judge whether the <b>subject</b> is notable, not whether the <b>article</b> is any use to man or beast. Thanks. <b>No opinion</b> is being stated by me - I just want to know whether this is worth me cleaning up, watching and looking after or not&#160;:o) <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:13, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> I am concerned by the notation with respect to copyright and editing at the top of the article. Does this mean that copyright permission is granted only so long as nobody edits the article without contacting him? This is unacceptable at a wiki. If the article is kept (and it does seem to just meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>) the notice limiting editing needs to go. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 21:42, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did some research communticating with old school friends, i have even talked to a member inside the club and he has verified all the information asking me to write this article so the club gets a little more attention since the numbers of the clubs members has fallen, due to memberes migrating.</dd>

<p>I am on the information team for The Lemc so it is not that intersting that it came from the same anonymous user. The club is not Known widely by other people outside Of the LEMC as it is an exclusive members club. However the LEMC would be recognised by potential members. The LEMC is in the process of being made. Will this be a verifiable source of information?

<p>Subject of dubious notability (36 unique GHits for "Missjackie69", most of which appear irrelevant, and none at all for "Jackie Butorsky" -- not a good sign of notability for a supposed "internet celebrity"), and probably impossible to verify many of the assertions in the article. Only claims to fame are having one of her videos played on VH1 alongside other momentary internet funnies, having been on Jenny Jones, and having met some actual celebrities. Was tagged for speedy, was detagged by someone else, so decided to open it up for AfD debate. ~ <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus78</a> 20:44, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the internet she goes only by the name Missjackie, her real name was included for completeness. Also, what "assertations" need to be verified? Perhaps some on here will argue she isn't a "true" celebrity... she doesn't have her own show like Andy Milonakis, but what is the minimum amount of fame to classify someone with that term? Her videos on Youtube have been viewed over 280,000 times and are quite popular. Maybe you should have a look there. I suppose you are free to do whatever you want on here.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are, in fact, quite a few sites dedicated to this fetish.

Also, your first deletion template was not removed by the article creator; you used the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Proposed Deletion</a> template, which I correctly removed.

<li>No problem; sorry if I came across as too harsh. Articles dealing with paraphilias often come under attack from people who consider the activity described as reprehensible, or have other moral objections to it. Considering that many of these paraphilias are practiced by thousands (and in some cases millions) of people, I think they deserve a WP entry at least as much as, say, each of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number_f32d.html" title="List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number">386 Pokémon characters</a>. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 14:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
