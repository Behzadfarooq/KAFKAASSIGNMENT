<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> here. I note that <a href="../../../n/o/w/Now_That%27s_What_I_Call_Music%21_2ca6.html" title="Now That's What I Call Music!">Now That's What I Call Music!</a>, which several people here have referred to, has an article for every album, and a better template to organize all of them. Now, perhaps that series is more notable than this one (it certainly is) and therefore should have individual album articles while this one doesn't, or maybe that series needs a deletion discussion here as well; I'm not sure, and not one to make that judgement based on what I've seen here. However, if the resulting article isn't too massive, it would be prudent to consider merging most or all of these entries, and perhaps after that, a new deletion discussion may proceed on any leftovers with a smaller focus. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="green">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="purple">ka</font></a> 11:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These are all compilation albums, <s>and every article is unsourced. They are likely to remain unsourced,</s> because reliable third party sources don't usually write pieces about compilation albums. The musicians featured are notable people and the albums they create <i>themselves</i> are critically interesting as unique artistic creations; those original albums receive plenty of third party coverage to write an article from. But compilation albums, cobbled together from intellectual property already owned and previously released by the record labels, are not interesting or unique creations, so no one writes about them. Thus the lack of reliable sources. For the same reason that secondary sources don't bother to write about these albums, Wikipedia shouldn't cover them as a tertiary source, lest our coverage devolve into indiscriminate lists.</p>
<p>There are at least nine more of these that are still redlinked, and of course more will be released every year. None of the articles can be sourced for content expansion. Let's nip this in the bud before well meaning editors waste any more time editing these time-sinks.</p>

<li><b>Delete all except main article.</b> It's a fairly long-running series with a number of notable artists that has had a decent sales record (I guess I need to dig up charting history, huh?), so a single article about the series, possibly with a list of the individual releases, would seem to be in order. The individual releases, however, are not notable and should be dumped. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 06:08, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Delete all except main article</s></b> This does seem to have been a successful marketing concept, if nothing else, and a pretty big deal in the Xtian music biz. But we certainly don't need all these articles, at least without evidence that these charted majorly. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:11, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep all with a record of charting</b> I see that most of these now have sources showing that they charted. I think those should be kept. Even a compilation album should probably be kept if it charted; that indicates a lot of sales. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 21:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>These are not notable albums on their own. The artists, who are notable, did not work on these albums. They had nothing to do with their creation. These albums are not their creative endeavors. They are compiled by the companies who already own their previously released works. There's absolutely no limit to how many compilation albums these companies can produce, and it would not surprise me to learn that the artists received no compensation for these. Indeed some of them have probably forgotten that their songs are on these things, if their agents ever forwarded the memo anyway. Can you explain what is notable about a compilation album? Originals are notable for being unique artistic creations, something new that a person brings into the world. What is notable about the fact that record companies combine and rerelease to create the false appearance of something new and grab more money? That's just everyday greed; nothing notable or interesting about it. Nothing about these albums passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The articles about the <i>original</i> songs and albums and the artists themselves pass notability. But a shuffled tracklisting is not further notable on its own.

The company that makes these, Vox Cameo Classics, makes many more. By your reasoning, because all the artists and most of the songs on these albums are notable, <i>the compilations themselves are notable and we should have articles about them.</i> And, indeed, since this is a series, <i>we should have a "25 Favorites by Vox Cameo Classics" article for the series.</i> But this is absurd.

The artists didn't "work" on them, but yet artists don't work on soundtracks or other compilations albums that are listed on wikipedia, it would be stupid to delete one series and not delete all the other series. As for the WOW Christmas and Aqua, most of the songs on these albums are not repackaged, they are exclusive to the series and available nowhere else. WOW Hits, sure, those are available on the artists albums, but Worship and and Christmas are not. How can an album not be "notable" even though it's clearly widely available in stores and is a popular series? Keep them all, even the album pages because only WOW Hits has only reused tracks, wikipedia is an information site correct? You can't list the albums but not give information.

<li><b>Merge all to main WOW article</b>, as there's actually a remote possibility that something substantial and/or worthwhile can be said about the series as a whole. a rule of thumb I'd personally have for compilation albums is: "Did any artist 'break it big', or experience a significant change in his or her career, as a direct result of his or her song being included in this compilation/soundtrack/retrospective/whatever". In this case, the answer is "no". Series is notable, series deserves an article.

I can understand not having pages for the WOW Hits albums due to reused songs not exclusive to the albums but the WOW Christmas, WOW Worship, and WOW Hymns pages have exclusive recordings. If you want notability, what does it take? Nearly every artist on the WOW albums are notable, the series is constantly featured in Christian magazines (WOW Hits 2007 had their own bonus magazine with a recent issue of CCM Magazine which included an ad for WOW Hymns), they have television advertisements, in-store advertisements at all major and small chains that sell Christian music, and more.

<li>Nobody's saying that the artists aren't notable enough to have their own articles. I don't see anyone here saying that the songs aren't notable enough to have their own articles either. But the songs were originally on other albums. Those original creations are the ones that are notable because notable artists worked on them. Charting suggests that people are notable because we they are already people; the charting just lets us know that they are sufficiently in the public eye to make an article worthwhile. People, of course, are special. An album, though, isn't inherently so. It might be if it's an original work.

<li><b>Comment regarding <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a></b>: It's important not to read too much into this notability page. First of all, it's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html#.23The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">a guideline, not a policy</a>. We can work around it and completely outside of it, with no adverse consequences. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> also reminds us: "<i>meeting any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept.</i>" The pertinent section, on albums, notes it "is somewhat controversial" (which is to say that it's more controversial than notability in general, which is always controversial). The albums section then says, "<i>if the musician or ensemble <b>that made them</b> is considered notable, then their albums have sufficient notability</i>" (emphasis mine). That's a particular distinction. The artists here <b>did not make these</b> albums. They weren't involved in the production. Their creative process was already over when these albums were compiled by the marketing divisions of the record company. So all we get out of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is this: a guideline, which we don't have to follow, which says it doesn't mean the articles must be kept, and says the relevant section is especially controversial, doesn't even apply because the notable artists didn't make these albums. So don't read too much into it. I believe the pertinent question is rather, "why would albums not even created by notable artists be notable on their own?"

<li>2) If we use your album option, then I disagree with your interpretation of several words. Let's revisit the key sentence <i>if the musician or ensemble that made them is considered notable, then their albums have sufficient notability</i>. The term "ensemble": If you look <a href="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/ensemble|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/ensemble|here" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> at yahoo's definition, I believe that either definition 1c: "A group of musicians, singers, dancers, or actors who perform together" or 2: "A work for two or more vocalists or instrumentalists." would apply. Either definition state the musicians, not the compilers of the CDs are the ensemble. I disagree with your usage of the word "maker." The maker of an album is the artists that made the each of the individual tracks. The album could not be <i>made</i> without using their tracks. So what if the artists <i>made</i> the tracks earlier and not specifically for this CD? Some of these tracks were actually specifically made for the CD. The guideline doesn't talk about the compilers of the album. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 05:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If we admit that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> has nothing to say here, it's true that we are left with everyone's feelings and various arguments. You act like this is a problem. How do you think guidelines get made in the first place? People bring their opinions to the table and discussion works toward a consensus or at least something resembling a consensus. This is normal and desirable. What people <i>haven't</i> done here is simply state "I don't like it". The arguments for deletion have been argued extensively from several points of view. The argument that only original works matter seems a strong one that Wikipedia carries throughout many other areas, and the fact that you don't agree with this argument does not reduce it to simply <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. Your characterization of this argument as <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a> is unfounded. Such an argument would play very well on any notability talk page, and there's no reason why it shouldn't be aired here. You're flat wrong about what an ensemble is. An ensemble plays <i>together</i>, in the same room. An ensemble is a band. It is not a bunch of bands playing unrelated tracks in different studios. If this is the first time you've encountered the word, you might be legitimately confused, but it is really not open to the interpretation you are trying to ascribe it. You say "<i>The maker of an album is the artists that made the each of the individual tracks</i>", but no, that's the makers of the songs. <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupac_Shakur_8f89.html" title="Tupac Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a> did not make <i><a href="../../../r/_/u/R_U_Still_Down__%28Remember_Me%29_78c0.html" title="R U Still Down? (Remember Me)">R U Still Down? (Remember Me)</a></i>, his first (of six so far) posthumous album. The page for the album recognizes this, that the album was created without Tupac's creative input. That's the important distinction. Of course, that album contained new tracks, unlike these. But these albums were created without the involvement of the artists' creative input. You may be unfamiliar with how the recordning industry works. But these albums can be created without the artists even being informed of them, depending on their contracts. In many cases, they do not have to sign off on their work being included here. Those transactions take place entirely over the artists' heads. That's not creative input. I've seen it being said that some tracks were made exclusively for certain particular CDs here, like the green Christmas album. However, this has still not been cited, and absent a reliable citation, that's still lacking <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and no actual indication of notability. <span style="white-space: nowrap">â€” <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> â€” 11:31, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

You are correct that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does not always have to be followed but normally if the decision is going to be made to remove something that meets the criteria there should be several good reasons why, the same would go for including something that doesn't meet any of the criteria. Your sole argument is that it is a compilation album that feautures previously released songs from different artists. You fail to give any other reasoning at all. I'll play your game and we will just totally forget <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>(which these albums clearly meet the criteria of) for a second. You cannot deny the cultural impact of this series.

Also you seem to be ignoring the fact that most of these albums have charted in the upper half of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_200_chart.html" title="Billboard 200 chart">Billboard 200 chart</a> and are sourced as such on their pages, how is that for standing on their own? The fact that they did chart so well proves that they would be of interest to many music enthusiats and they would want to read about them. Also these albums show what songs were considered to be the most popular CCM songs for the year of each individual release and are notable in that aspect as well. Do you have anything on these compilations at all that merits deletion except for the fact that you don't feel they are notable because they are compilations. You have stood by that despite evidence produced to the contrary and you haven't really elaborated on why that should disscount them from inclusion, so if possible could you please do so?--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 05:29, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
