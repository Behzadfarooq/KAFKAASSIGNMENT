<p>Let me head off the usual "this was just AfD'd" at the pass: the rationale for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chelsea_Charms_6e90.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chelsea Charms">the first AfD</a> was essentially casting moral judgment over the subject rather than discussing the merits of the article; the crux of the nominator's rationale was, "what if some woman comes here and thinks "id like to be like that" and decides to have an augmentation that completely destroys her health because of Wikipedia?" It became a discussion of taste rather than notability. This AfD nomination, on the other hand, has to do with our guidelines and policies. So, without further ado: the article on Chelsea Charms fails both in terms of establishing the notability of the subject, and by our policies of citation and verification. First, to her notability, the only <i>suggestion</i> of notability is that Chelsea Charms has a larger-than-average set of augmented breasts. The article makes no claim that they are record-setting, in any way, and in fact <i>specifically states that they aren't,</i> but just catalogs the various operations she's allegedly had done to them. Her IMDb page has a grand total of two films, so that's not where the notability is coming from. And then there is the second, major major problem with this article: <b>there's not a single reference or citation in the whole thing.</b> By my count, the article makes nearly 20 separate assertions of fact without a single reference as to where these facts came from (and that's not counting the excess verbiage about the general physiology behind breast enlargement, which probably wouldn't belong in the article anyway). <b>Delete</b> as unverifiable, and even if it were verifiable, as simply not notable. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 10:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><small><b>Strong Keep</b> Chelsea Charms is notable as the woman who has the largest breasts as a result of the "silly string" implantation surgery. Although I agree that her article is not as well annotated as it should be, I also must note that this is mainly because of time constraints on my part. (I was not the original author of the article but I do contribute to it from time to time.) As for the fact that the IMDB page on her only shows two films, how many films does IMDB show for James Dean, for instance? Remember that IMDB isn't the most accurate source although it is widely quoted -- they make plenty of omissions in their filmographies. A look at her own website shows that she has appeared in many more than just two films, so that it not a valid reason for deleting her article here. You want third-party, reliable sources on her? Give me a bit of time to compile them and add them to her WP article. -- <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalabi99_f6c7.html" title="User:Jalabi99">Jalabi99</a> 20:29, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><small><b>Comment:</b> Comparing Chelsea Charms to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dean_4236.html" title="James Dean">James Dean</a> is absurd. (Dean, FWIW, has 30 films listed at IMDb.) Her article currently contradicts what you've said: she does <b>not</b> have the largest breasts, nor even the largest via the polypropylene string method. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 23:10, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<ul>
<li><small><b>keep</b>. I think wiki shold have certain objective criteria for deletions. For instance, a google of "chelsea charms" as of Sat Oct7 2006, brings up ~ 200,000+ hits. While we all know about spamm, stuffing, bots , etc, at a certain point, if a person has a enough presence, that in and of itself, even if it is purely a media driven event - you have enough hits because you have enough hits - warrants auto inclusion.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>Further, the whole string implant thing, in and of itself, surely is a wiki article, and as a representative public figure on that topic, this is a <b>keep</b>. As for the ref policy, the whole wiki ref policy thing needs to be completely rethought. Once you start entering the world of dry academic scholasticism with things like references, you need to evaluate them, etc etc.24.60.137.141 15:19, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Actually, on checking I think it's the other way around in that the surgeontothestars page is an uncredited copy of the Wikipedia article. If you check the history of the Wikipedia article, you can see it slowly coming into its current form. For instance, on Nov 8/05, a user names LisaCarol added 3 paragraphs about Chelsea - the ones starting with "Chelsea's bust size...", "She was a natural..." and "When asked if...", citing Chelsea's FAQ as a source. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 00:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> - She is one of the top (breast pun not intended) big bust models over the last several years. She's notable due to her string implants. Her popularizing the rare implant procedure lead several others in her field to attempt to go bigger and bigger. If she isn't notable in her vocation, then no big bust model on Wikipedia is notable. Cause she has thousands of fans at various Yahoo Groups. And her official website gets millions of hits every month. Far more than Maxi Mounds, Minka, or most other big bust models. Also it should be noted that the article has been on Wikipedia for over two years, with several dozen people contributing to its expansion. All the people that have contributed done so because they thought it was important and worthwhile. People have put hours and hours of their time and energy into this article, and the various other model/pornstar articles. If anything the articles need expanded and improved, not deleted. And the above commenter is mistaken. They have it backwards, in that the site <a href="http://www.surgeontothestars.com/pages/celebrities/chelsea_charms.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.surgeontothestars.com/pages/celebrities/chelsea_charms.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> obviously took the free information provided on Wikipedia and used it in part to create their article. But the link does show that other sites do consider her not only notable but also an internet celebrity in her own right worthy of inclusion. Many sites list her name as a key word in attempts to get more visitors to sell their various products or services. Lastly, no information on this article, an article that has been worked on and edited by many different people for the past two years is in violation of copyright infringement. It is basic info that one would find on any biography page on widipedia about models, which the subject of the article has provided freely on her own site and in interviews or conversations with fans, such as her stage name, birthday, and the fact that she is a big bust model with string implants. The info is as accurate and truthful, as is possible with big bust models, or pornstars that the mainstream media usually ignore.Powergirl 17:43, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ah, but nobody here <i>is</i> raising a moral objection to the article. That was the issue of the previous AfD, which was plagued with a series of problems.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The assertion of notability is that she is a top big bust model and that she has the largest breast implants in the world (10000cc string implants). Her 10000cc chest can be seen at YouTube where over 95,000 folks have viewed her video.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK3rvkmx67o" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK3rvkmx67o" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> With that many YouTube views, and all the search results on the major search engines, or the fact she's the #1 model at Photoclubs.com proves that she's not only notable in the industry but to most big bust fans online. Their can be no denying that she is more known than most big bust models listed on Wikipedia. Only someone that knows nothing about the big bust industry over the last few years would be unware to the status that this lady holds. There is no way to deny that she is one of the top big bust models in America this decade. And that her breasts weigh 31 pounds each. If that isn't mentioned in the article, then someone should add that. The article needs to be edited to make clear that the 26 pound number is from a few years ago when she was at 7000cc. Although the end of the article clearly mentions her announcement about having reached the milestone 10000cc at the 2005 Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vagas. Keisha Evans<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keisha_Evans" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keisha_Evans" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> is the only other women in the exotic dancing/big bust business today that even comes close, with Miss Evans recently getting 6000cc implants. For the last few years everyone in the big breast niche market (ie Score, Photoclubs.com, ect.) recognize that with the FDA banning anyone else from getting string implants; and none of the other women that did having the level of growth that Chelsea Charms experienced; that Chelsea Charms is left as the undisputed title holder of "women with the largest breasts in the industry." Check out this article about Sabrina Sabrok, it mentions that Chelsea Charms has the largest breasts in the world, and that Sabrina is trying to go bigger and bigger to be #1 someday.<a href="http://www.amontillado.it/sabrok.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amontillado.it/sabrok.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Just because Maxi Mounds has an award from early 2005 for her string implants that weigh far less than Chelsea's has nothing to do with the notability of Miss Charms. Wikipedia clearly needs editors that know at least a little bit about what their writing about. If someone knows nothing about who is a top big bust model, or whether their notable in their profession, then they shouldn't be voting on or trying to delete such articles.Powergirl 07:03, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Restated Delete</b>. I took a look at the new references provided, and they have not changed my mind. None of them look like "credible sources", and indeed, most of them are just links to promotional or porn sites (one of them even requires a password for entry), some of which did nothing more than confirming that there is an entertainer named "Chelsea Charms", without giving any other information about her <a href="http://www.exoticdancer.com/?page_id=116" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exoticdancer.com/?page_id=116" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. As for the others, the two that looked the most credible were an article in a 2002 issue of <i>Hustler</i><a href="http://www.kapelovitz.com/stripcon.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kapelovitz.com/stripcon.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and a website about San Francisco erotica <a href="http://eros-guide.com/articles/2004-09-21/edance04/" class="external autonumber" title="http://eros-guide.com/articles/2004-09-21/edance04/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, but again, they did little but confirm that Chelsea Charms exists. This kind of coverage is what we refer to as "trivial mentions", and they don't verify notability. Not every model who has appeared on the cover of a magazine, is notable enough to deserve a Wikipedia bio. To prove that Ms. Charms is "famous", I would want to see proof of published articles that don't just mention her, but are <i>about</i> her. Notability could also be established by providing proof that she had won an award of some type, or a credible claim somewhere that she was "biggest" or "most famous" or any of the other claims being made. As is said in many other places around Wikipedia: If someone is genuinely famous, then many articles are going to be written about them, and that will provide proof of notability. Wikipedia is not what <i>makes</i> someone famous, Wikipedia is what is used to report on someone who is <i>already</i> famous. If proof can be provided of that notability, to show that she meets any of the requirements listed in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>, I might change my mind, but so far such proof has not yet been provided. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that there definitely seems to be a "big bust" genre, of which Ms. Charms is a part, but which of the references do you believe establish that she is more notable within that niche than any of the other similar models?
