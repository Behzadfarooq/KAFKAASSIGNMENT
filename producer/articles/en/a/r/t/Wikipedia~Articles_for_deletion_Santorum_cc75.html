<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. There is substantial support among established commenters that this word has now reached encyclopedic notability. The name "Santorum" will be redirected to the Senator, as I think consensus and common sense demand. There is widespread support for Santorum (neologism) as a renaming, but neologisms don't belong in Wikipedia: the result of this debate thus compels a different title. Santorum (sexual slang) is adopted as the most popular option consistent with WP:NOT. The question of how, exactly, to disambig. (a delicate matter, considering the Senator is deserving of personal respect, per BLP), I will leave to talk page discussion. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:28, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The neologism referred to, created by <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a>, does not have any evidence of real currency as a neologism.

<dd>Change to <b>Keep and rename</b>, per various notes below. I agree it's notable; my complaint is really about the listing as a neologism when I don't see any usage evidence, only notability evidence. I also agree it probably deserves its own article now, rather than just a section in <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a>. Per Kaustuv Chaudhuri, I think <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> should go to the senator, and I also agree that the article should discuss the impact or political action; the coinage and its meaning should be given but not treated as being in current usage. (With reference to a couple of suppositions below, my objections to this are all about currency, not politics.) I'm also not sure what to call the article -- I suppose "Santorum (neologism)" is the best idea, though I'd really like to see something that doesn't imply the usage is widespread. Barring a better wording I'm happy with "Santorum (neologism)". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 00:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: with regard to the ADS citation, I contacted Jesse Sheidlower, who is a member of the ADS and was at the meeting at which the word was nominated. (Jesse is Editor-at-Large for the Oxford English Dictionary.) I'd like to introduce his comments into this debate, not as a final authority, but as informative. If they are relevant but regarded as needing verification I'll see what I can do about making them verifiable. Anyway, he said that the ADF listing "should not be cited as proof of currency", and went on to say with regard to selection for those categories that "the only criterion is that someone nominates it. Many of the words we select, esp. for categories such as 'most outrageous', are stunt words with no real currency. The nomination or election of a word in one of the ADS words-of-the-year categories has nothing to do with whether the word is truly current." Finally, I asked him if he personally thought the word had currency, and he said "I don't think it has any real currency". Personally I think the nomination supports the notability of the political act but does not support the currency of the term. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 14:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (italicized comments from the WP:NEO talk page) <i>In my opinion, an article about the political act is verifiable if there are news citations. The word 'santorum' is clearly an integral part of that act, and its usage and meaning within the context of the political action is verifiable from the news sources</i> [so within context it is a verifiable neologism]. <i>However, it would not be OK to go around adding santorum as a technical term within articles on, say, anal sex (although again mentioning it within the context of the political act would be ok).</i> Regarding whether it should be merged, an article for a political act by a notable person is distinct from other articles concerning the person, and I think that Santorum has a life separate from its genesis in Savage Love. The article, however, should focus on the act, and not just on a dicdef or it is inappropriate for WP. At this point it has some historical information, etc. and therefore I think it can stay. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 15:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak rename</b> to Santorum (neologism). Santorum should lead to the disambiguation page or to the Senator's article.

<li>I agree. Name should remain. The word has grabbed hold in the culture. It is clear why people want it to go away, but this is nothing more than knee-jerk linguistic stuffiness born from the idea that language stands still.

<dd>I agree 100% that a reader curious about santorum-the-frothy-mix shouldn't need to know that it was coined by Dan Savage or that it appeared in Savage Love. However, we don't know what a user who types in "santorum" as a Go word is looking for. If a user searching for information on the Senator... particularly one of the Senator's supporters... types in "Santorum" as the "go" word, he or she should not be subjected to material which he or she might find offensive... should not, if you like, be subjected to symbolically being soiled with santorum! The obvious solution is for <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> to be, as before, a disambiguation page which a) makes clear that "santorum" is a sexually explicit neologism, b) makes it easy for the reader who wants to know what it means to find out, and c) also makes it easy for the reader who does <i>not</i> want to know what it means to remain ignorant of its meaning. It's not Wikipedia's job to force awareness of Savage's opinion on anyone. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:18, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a separate issue from having an article on the frothy-mix meaning.

It's tricky, though, because someone who types in the full term <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Santorum_41a3.html" title="Rick Santorum">Rick Santorum</a> probably is <i>not</i> looking for the neologism. On the one hand, it doesn't seem right to have <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> be a dab page that seemingly gives equal weight to both disambiguations; on the other hand, it seems a little inappropriate to put a frothy mixture of you-know-what right at the top of the Rick Santorum article.</dd>

<dd>The other terms don't really belong on the dab page, because they are not commonly abbreviated to "Santorum," but I've always thought they added value to the page—someone typing in Santorum might well want an overview of all articles with Santorum-related content. And, quite frankly, I've thought they served a useful purpose in diluting the santorum, so to speak; the dab page is 75% devoted to material about the Senator and only 25% to the notable attack on the Senator.

<li>That the first result is an effect of Googlebombing is certainly relevant. I disagree that we can't deduce anything from it, however. We can deduce something very simple: more people have linked "Santorum" to the "frothy mix" than to the Senator's home page. That's actually saying quite a lot, considering all the political websites (neutral and pro-) that must be linking to the Senator's page, and all the mainstream media sites that link to the Senator when they cover him, etc. There are so astoundingly many links to the Senator's home page as to have made it the number 2 result out of "about 4,580,000" yet all those links have been outvoted, plain and simple. — <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">Coelacan</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">talk</a> 23:09, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP: Defining Santorum thusly, as it is used on the street, is no different than using the term "Comstockery" which is now used in everyday parlance.

It is no different, and I'm certain the Comstock family has long survived the realities of the polysemous nature of discourse.

<li>No, no, not better liked by any means. I mean more popular in the sense that santorum the excrement is more noteworthy than the senator.

This is very significant to my way of thinking because <i>many of the references to the Senator are very negative,</i> so this is a venue where you'd expect to see the Savage neologism if, in fact, it were really current. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>At this point I am utterly unconvinced that the neologism has gotten real currency, and I have no idea what people were talking about when they said Savage's neologism was getting more Google hits than the Senator, unless it was a short-lived successful Google manipulation. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:41, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The overwhelming majority of Google hits are along the lines of "Hey, here's a neat word Dan Savage made up to make fun of Rick Santorum" rather than usages of the word in its intended context ("Man, I had to clean up a bunch of santorum before I could get to sleep last night"). I'm not sure if the former category really qualifies to indicate something is "in wide usage". <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 22:47, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
