<p>Hmmm...biography with no assertion of notability other than that he spoke on the radio once (how many people have done that?). I would like to try to keep this neutral, but perhaps the fact that this person is the "inventor" of a "thought screen helmet" designed to stop "alien mind control" and curtail abductions deserves mention. But at any rate, this fails notability, verifiability, etc., etc., etc. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 12:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think that the relevant clause of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should be interpreted as "anybody that has been interviewed". This is a weak opinion of mine. To interview somebody is vastly less notable than to have a real article on them. Hell, I've been interviewed numerous times on radio shows. I'd be the first one to put a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}} tag on an article about myself. Also, the only reason that Menkin has been so extensively interviewed (without a non-interview article) is that he is so bizarre.

<dd>Invented by someone called Michael Menkin in 1998, the helmet uses "Velostat" shielding, and is apparently easy to make if you follow the instructions. "Aliens," we are told, "cannot immobilise people wearing thought screens nor can they control their minds or communicate with them."</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Keeping aliens from reading your thoughts sounds like something that would be more appropriately controlled with antipsychotic medication than with a helmet of any sort.

<dd>Great work, indeed. Especially considering that some of the publications in question don't seem to remember having published anything on this chap...for example, the Herald Sun, which according to Zagalejo ran a piece on Menkin last month, has no entries whatsoever in its online archive <a href="http://www.newstext.com.au/pages/s.asp?source=newstext&amp;indexkey=3406949611942060245E190&amp;_P=1&amp;ResultMaxDocs=20&amp;ResultCount=20&amp;summreqd=yes&amp;pubsel=DHS&amp;SrchText=Menkin&amp;QueryText=%28Menkin%29+%3CAND%3E+%28PUB%3DDHS%29+%3CAND%3E+%28%28SDate%3E%3D08%2F18%2F2006%29%29&amp;SortField=SDate&amp;SortOrder=desc&amp;SortField=Pub&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;SortField=EDN&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;SortField=Page&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;Site=ALL&amp;datetype=1m%3A08%2F18%2F2006&amp;DateFrom=&amp;DateTo=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newstext.com.au/pages/s.asp?source=newstext&amp;indexkey=3406949611942060245E190&amp;_P=1&amp;ResultMaxDocs=20&amp;ResultCount=20&amp;summreqd=yes&amp;pubsel=DHS&amp;SrchText=Menkin&amp;QueryText=%28Menkin%29+%3CAND%3E+%28PUB%3DDHS%29+%3CAND%3E+%28%28SDate%3E%3D08%2F18%2F2006%29%29&amp;SortField=SDate&amp;SortOrder=desc&amp;SortField=Pub&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;SortField=EDN&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;SortField=Page&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;Site=ALL&amp;datetype=1m%3A08%2F18%2F2006&amp;DateFrom=&amp;DateTo=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd><b>Addendum</b>: I just noticed that there was a typo on my part; the Herald Sun article was published in Augst 200<b>0</b>. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 23:09, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Herald Sun's online archive goes back to 1990, apparently, and I searched simply for "Menkin", which means that even if they ran an article on an egg salesman named "John Menkin" something should have come up...but nothing did. I also searched The Daily Mirror, The Standard, the New Zealand Herald, and the Sydney Morning Herald.</dd>
<dd>Now, to be charitable, we could say it might just be that the newspapers themselves don't put minor, humorous back-page sort of stories on their websites. But, if this is the case, then is this guy really notable? If in retrospect his story is not one that newspapers consider important enough to put on their sites, then should Wikipedia be bothering with him.</dd>
<dd>Look, I understand the humour here. Hell, I have been chuckling about the guy all weekend. But, Wikipedia is not a hall of fame for cranks and loonies. It is an encyclopaedia. This chap is simply not a candidate for an encyclopaedic biography. While tin-foil hats, as a pop culture phenomenon, probably deserve mention, his particular brand of them (made of Velostat, not tin-foil), is in all likelihood not notable enough to be mentioned either. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 06:19, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you have a subscription to the archives? The free search -for the Herald Sun, and most newspapers actually - is limited to articles from the last thirty days. In any case, the articles <i>do</i> appear on Factiva. I invite anyone with access to Factiva to run searches for "Michael Menkin," "Mike Menkin", and "thought screen helmet" (individually, not in combination with each other). All of the above articles should show up. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 14:00, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, I suppose: I don't have a subscription to the Herald Sun (why would I?)...one simply cannot be too careful, especially when dealing with a subject like this, which is apt to attract the certifiably insane; my sincere apologies for any undue insult I may have caused, Zagalejo. Nonetheless, whether or not Menkin has had a few tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-disparaging newspaper articles about him, I still maintain that that is insufficient to meet criteria of notability. I would not be averse to a (brief) mention of the "thought screen helmet" in the tin-foil hat article, either (I also enjoy the idiosyncratic humour behind this whole thing) - I just don't think that someone who makes Velostat hats to stop people being "abducted by aliens" merits a biography in an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 14:20, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since the article is essentially three paragraphs long, and the only "notable" contribution Menkin has made is in the context of the <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin-foil_hat.html" title="Tin-foil hat">Tin-foil hat</a> perhaps the content in this article would be best merged with that entry. Then, the "contributions" and the appropriate value of this invention and its inventor are all integrated, with some appropriate caveats. However, I still feel that the current inventor is not noteworthy enough to have his own bio page, so my vote is still for delete as per nom. <a href="../../../e/d/h/User%7EEdhubbard_3245.html" title="User:Edhubbard">Edhubbard</a> 23:38, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep as joke&#160;;-) Someone crackpot enough to have been picked up by newspapers around the world. Judgement on whether to keep or not would really depend on the articles. News agencies often syndicate human-interest or light-hearted articles for the amusement of worldwide readers, and I suspect most of them on meakin would have been tongue-in-cheek (ie trivial) articles, though, and would more likely than not count as one coverage per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>I think this is perfect. It includes some mention of Menkin's appearances in the media (both positive and negative, with statistical weight towards the tongue in cheek), is relevant and could flow nicely into the tin-foil hat entry. It seems appropriately encyclopedic, and NPOV. Nice job. I have one quibbble over one word choice, which is "target" in the phrase "has made Menking a target of..." <a href="../../../e/d/h/User%7EEdhubbard_3245.html" title="User:Edhubbard">Edhubbard</a> 19:38, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How about, "Because of his unusual invention, Menkin has become the subject of <s>tongue-and-cheek</s> tongue-in-cheek newspaper and magazine articles throughout the world"? And, looking back on it, I could probably chop off the last four words of the first sentence, since I would assume that would be obvious within the context of the article. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 20:33, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(resetting indent). I think subject is better than target, and agree that there are some things that would be clearer in the context of the article. I think tongue-in-cheek is the standard phrase over tongue-and-cheek. But these are tiny details. I think that this is quite good now, and all we need is to see if the other editors who have been voting on this are pretty much in agreement, and we can go ahead and do this... Indeed, you could probably add the text you've suggested to <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin-foil_hat.html" title="Tin-foil hat">tin-foil hat</a> now, and then we can just see if others are in agreement to close the AfD and delete.
