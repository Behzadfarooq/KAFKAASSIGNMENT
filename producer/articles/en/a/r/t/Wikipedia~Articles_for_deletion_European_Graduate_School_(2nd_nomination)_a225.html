No proofs are provided apart of the School's own website. The link is repeatedly spammed on others Wikipedia pages (namely, anybody who allegedly had a connection once in their life with the school, and placed in the first line of biographies). This has already been nominated because of spam concerns, but it should really be deleted again.

<dd>The point is not in claiming the school doesn't exist, the problem is that in order to avoid spam-links on biographies creating external links to the EGS, some anons have created this EGS page in order to link it internally to all biographies: the end result is SPAMMING!!! If I asked for deletion although this has already been asked before, it is because it is getting tiring to see on the first line of all biographies of famous "hype" philosophers &amp; artists "This guy teachs at the European Graduate School". Who cares? <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:No Advertising</a>. This is the problem, not the question whether this school exists, whether it's good or not, whether it's a public or a private school, in Switzerland, in Italy or in Turkey. Some solution needs to be found for this spamming; if this page is not deleted, maybe by banning the users who keep on spamming. BTW, <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEuropeangraduateschool_9e7f.html" title="User:Europeangraduateschool">User:Europeangraduateschool</a> has created itself a page a few days ago, as a new spam attempt? Is Wikipedia going to be used as a platform for unscrupulous and cynical schools? (this is what this spamming gives as opinion on that school, whatever the reality is). <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanta_Sangre_6a34.html" title="User:Santa Sangre">Santa Sangre</a> 22:09, 11 June 2006 (UTC) Beside it is totally dishonest making this list of alleged teachers without giving precisions: these people might have been for two hours on the campus and they are listed as if they teach there. Note that attempts to correct this have been reverted by anons. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanta_Sangre_6a34.html" title="User:Santa Sangre">Santa Sangre</a> 22:12, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> We are posting this message to establish open dialogue with Wikipedia and render a permanent resolution regarding Wikipedian assaults upon European Graduate School and the legitimacy of its Wikipedia entry. As European Graduate School is essentially committed to openness, we find great harmony with the central aims of Wikipedia. It is from such perspective that EGS is concerned with the abuse of openness that certain users of Wikipedia display in continuing to attack our institution and its Wikipedia entry. We are concerned not only for our ourselves, but the implications of such abuse upon the internet at large, and Wikipedia in particular. Specifically, such abuse within one of the leading internet sites, especially one promoting open and egalitarian philosophy, can easily (and unfortunately) indicate the necessary implementations of restraints on freedom of communication to ensure the continued availability of high quality reputable knowledge against the growing maelstrom of misinformation (thereby fundamentally and permanently altering the egalitarian nature of cyberspace).</li>
</ul>
<p>European Graduate School believes those committed to the founding values of the internet should take this threat to such openness seriously.</p>
<p>To these ends we would like to establish the following points:</p>
<p>1. European Graduate School has already won the debate regarding the legitimacy of its Wikipedia article during the initial assertion towards deletion of the Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>2. The accusation of abuse regarding the listing of European Graduate School faculty is unfounded. Santa Sangre is simply wrong that EGS appears in the first lines of our faculty biographies in Wikipedia - one need only look to Sangre’s own list to verify this for oneself .. while their faculty status with European Graduate School is mentioned in their Wikipedia biographies the primary teaching institutions of Jean-Luc Nancy, Claire Denis, Giorgio Agamben and others is clearly listed first. The Wikipedia European Graduate School entry simply provides a list of its notable faculty as do the entries of such larger institutions as New York University .. NYU Notable Persons: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_University_People" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_University_People" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_University_People</a></p>
<p>3. The accusation that European Graduate School information is independently unverified is unfounded: a simple Google search can establish this fact. In addition to the external links provided by the previous entries (including mention in Wired magazine blog and DJ Spooky’s website), there are many other examples of independent reference to European Graduate School.

<p>(Note: We thought it appropriate to include below a recent photograph of Jean Luc Nancy with his 2006 student cohort at the Saas-Fee campus of European Graduate School. As one can see in the photograph, ensuring the quality of Wikipedia articles is important to Jean-Luc as well as EGS, and stimulated some vigourous intellectual exchanges during this summer residency. EGS students are excited to continue these discussions within Wikipedia - in fact two students have already expressed their personal opinions in the previous discussions.)</p>

<p>4. In keeping with its committed open philosophy, European Graduate School invites meaningful dialogue with Wikipedia to resolve issues with the EGS Wikipedia entry. The university is currently considering the release through Wikipedia, under Creative Commons license, holdings from its extensive image and video archives - a catalogue including photographs, exclusive European Graduate School lectures and seminars by notable EGS faculty. If Wikipedia is interested in such material please contact European Graduate School either directly or through the talk page of this Wikipedia user account.</p>
<p>The following pages might serve as examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow</a></p>

<p>To promote such a dialogue with Wikipedia, European Graduate School invites wishes, proposals, and critiques to the discussion page of the Wikipedia article. The students and faculty of European Graduate School sincerely thank Wikipedia for its consideration of these points, and EGS looks forward to an increasingly close relationship with Wikipedia towards the achievement of our common aim of open access to knowledge. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEuropeangraduateschool_9e7f.html" title="User:Europeangraduateschool">Europeangraduateschool</a> 18:16, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"while their faculty status with European Graduate School is mentioned in their Wikipedia biographies the primary teaching institutions of Jean-Luc Nancy, Claire Denis, Giorgio Agamben and others is clearly listed first.": the point is if it is relevant AT ALL to include the EGS on these people's page. IMO, this is <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">simple spamming</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm not convinced that this school actually exists. I couldn't find anything verifiable about it, and one thing that struck me as odd was that when I was searching for stuff about it, I could find anyone who said that they hated this school, that it sucked, that they couldn't stand it, etc. Real schools usally evoke such feelings - both from the rivalry/competition of other schools and the stress and distress that they can put on their students and faculty. So if this school is real then it must be the most well-liked school (by its students and faculty and other schools) of any school in the whole history of the world! And if this were the case then it would have recieved a lot of media attention and it wouldn't be so hard for us to ample verifiable evidence of its existance. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 04:27, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I ran a multi-decade <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> newspaper and magazine database search (which covers English, German and French language publications) - while there are perhaps <s>40-50ish</s> 20-30 articles which mention the EGS in some way (usually as a brief reference in describing a person's background) there are veeeeeery few articles which actually <i>describe</i> the EGS (Perhaps this more traditional media outreach channel is something the EGS press office should focus its efforts on rather than the new-fangled wikipedia avenue?). The best English one I could find was a brief <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a> profile which is, as the article itself admits, almost entirely blurby quotes (e.g. by faculty inc. <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Spooky_a3de.html" title="DJ Spooky">DJ Spooky</a>) taken directly from the the EGS website.

<dd>I think some people affiliated with the school have been a little too devoted to self-aggrandizement, sure. But look at the links the EGS account gives for external faculty/personal pages of Ronell, Zizek, Greenaway and DJ Spooky. Those links by themselves are more than enough to verify that highly notable people are (loosely) affiliated with the school. None of those are hosted by EGS. I wince a bit at the jargony stuff about "openness", "collaboration", "the net" and all that. I wouldn't necessarily argue against the propositions that the school is "self-important" or "goofy", but it's pretty obviously not a hoax. The defunct journal <a href="http://www.jstor.org/journals/01622870.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jstor.org/journals/01622870.html" rel="nofollow">October</a> had some of that quality, but also published some really good work (by some overlapping names). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 22:56, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Ronell, Zizek, and Greenaway pages are simply entries that link to the EGS website for whatever reason, but have no content on EGS itself. Spooky says he's "faculty" in quotes, what does that mean?

<dd>If it's a hoax, it's a hoax that Ronell, Zizek and Greenaway are participating in; that would actually be more notable than is a small school of recent incorporation... but that would be a different type of article. In any case, it's not a hoax. Google shows 122k hits, for gosh sake. EGS itself comes up first, and WP is second; but not scrolling very far we get neutral mentions like: <a href="http://schools.gradschools.com/graduate-schools/European-Grad-School.html" class="external free" title="http://schools.gradschools.com/graduate-schools/European-Grad-School.html" rel="nofollow">http://schools.gradschools.com/graduate-schools/European-Grad-School.html</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/Top/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities/Europe/Switzerland/European_Graduate_School/" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/Top/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities/Europe/Switzerland/European_Graduate_School/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/Top/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities/Europe/Switzerland/European_Graduate_School/</a>, <a href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/European+Graduate+School" class="external free" title="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/European+Graduate+School" rel="nofollow">http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/European+Graduate+School</a>.

<dd>What do you mean "write their own article"? Do you have some evidence that one of the contributors to the article is an official representative of EGS, or something? I do notice a couple IP addresses that seem to edit primarily this article; but then almost all the edits by the AfD nominator, Santa Sangre, are about EGS too.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> <b>I formally disclaim</b> that "all my edits" are about EGS. You may have a quick look at my contributions to verify this. I apologize for what may have been perceived as "uncivilized manners" that don't respect Wikipedia rules, I am not familiar with all of them and I have very strong suspicions against this school, which are founded on the spam I've observed on Wikipedia biographies (as I've said over &amp; over; I repeat that when I first heard of the EGS on Wikipedia, I had the same attitude as "Lulu" who thought it strange that I consider the internal link to be "spam" - someone had deleted it for that reason -. A few weeks later I understood the user's annoyal and the reason for its removal, and I see that Internet research does not provide any external sources on the notability of this school. If we were to include all private schools no matter how notable they are and how limited the sources on them are, we would be effectively transforming Wikipedia into a "Trojan horse" for advertising. Furthermore, I am surely not the only one to find it profoundly dishonest to put such an awesome lists of "teachers" without providing proof that they were there &amp; precisions on their presence (if they were there one hour once, two hours twice, all year long, etc.) Finally, the anonymity of the users who've edited this page &amp; who've repeatedly profited from the fact that it was a low-traffic page (surely something they hope to get higher, basing themselves on internal spam — and maybe external advertising for Wikipedia, so the Google hit rise? We are starting to get familiar with techniques to boost one's site's popularity, and Wikipedia certainly is a powerful platform for this) by deleting NPOV modifications made by astoundished users as me does not encline one to put anymore trust. It is also symptomatic that with this second deletion <i>someone</i> has considered it necessary to create a EGS page. To end with what I began in this disclaimer, I firmly ask to Lulu to stop his ad-hominen attacks against me (falsely saying that main of my edits are related to the EGS) and his intimidation on my talk page. This does not encline me to believe in Lulu's neutrality, although I certainly do believe on his good faith (which seems not to be his case if one is to believe his own user page&#160;; I'm not sure if Lulu has understood that presupposition of good faith is like "presupposition of innocence": the matter is not what you believe about another user ("when it is evidently self-absent" - how do you judge that mate?) but the fact that, <i>whatever you believe</i>, you should maintain <i>as an a priori rule</i> that this user is doing things with good faith; i.e. he is presumed innocent until judged guilty.) Therefore, I would be thankful for Lulu to not condemn me before having suited me, if such is his intent (see the threats on my talk page).

<dd>I can't really make sense of your claim, Trialsanderrors, that the article topic "fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>]". If you don't think it's a hoax, presumably you think it's a school. There's a stub right there, no? An AfD isn't a vote on the specific content that's in an article currently, but on whether the topic itself is notable. If some particular fact purported in the article seems unverifiable, remove that fact, not the topic itself. Still, even if some information is sourced to EGS official sources, that isn't necessarily unacceptable. I haven't looked, but I'm pretty sure a lot of the information on <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> comes from the uni's own materials. Or to pick something more modest, the article on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holyoke_Community_College_81df.html" title="Holyoke Community College">Holyoke Community College</a> (a school near me, with which I've never had any affilation beyond driving past) is pretty obviously taken almost entirely from the college's own website. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 02:21, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a bit of a common fallacy around here to point at other questionable articles in order to lend credence to the one at hand. If the HCC article is swiped from the school website, the entry schould at least be tagged with a POV tag. Also, technically it doesn't matter who edits the article, we also can't write an article based on our own impressions, DJ Spooky's weblog or a Flickr page. My point is quite simply: If you followed WP policies on using only reliable sources (no school website, no blog entries, no future publications), what would you be able to put in the article? AfD's are there to allow editors to establish that WP guidelines are fulfilled. So far the only ones I've seen try to do this are Bwithh, ENpeeOHvee and me. And we pretty much came up empty. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:51, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The European Graduate School sincerely thanks those participating in this discussion. As previously expressed we are always open for meaningful/ constructive critique, and are committed to transparency of information regarding our institution and its Wikipedia entry. This forum is designed to openly engage the Wikipedia community in questions about European Graduate School, including its participation in open access to knowledge initiatives, media programmes, and its educational pedagogy. We refer Wikipedians to general search engines and the official EGS website for answers to rudimentary questions (including accreditation, courses and degree plans); video lectures, webcasts, as well as independent newspaper articles and blog entries (particularly those of Bruce Sterling and DJ Spooky); and invite the public to contact year-long faculty members directly for answers to questions of a more specific nature. European Graduate School believes that free and open discussion about itself and its impact upon postmodern media landscapes will not only strengthen our reputation but develop new democratic standards of excellence in the field of communications at large.</li>

<p>The European Graduate School Wikipedia entry is recently subject to various sorts of abuse, which generally (and unfoundedly) question the authenticity and quality standards of the institution. The EGS administration feels these issues were repeatedly resolved according to Wikipedia’s policies. While we admit that the EGS entry is far from perfect, its is our institutional policy not to edit the Wikipedia entries of our institution and its faculty. Of course members of the European Graduate School community are free (as any Wikipedian) to independently edit any Wikipedia articles, and the reasonable person can easily understand the impossibility of strictly regulating the private behaviour of 600+ adult students from around the world.</p>
<p>As an established yet still growing university, European Graduate School welcomes all thoughtful contributions towards the improved quality of its educational programmes and interfaces with the academe. We value the recent Wikipedia discussion about our educational model as an engaging example of the practical issues involved with developing and preserving a philosophy of openness in cyberspace. Again, sincere thanks to all the participants in that conversation.<a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEuropeangraduateschool_9e7f.html" title="User:Europeangraduateschool">Europeangraduateschool</a> 12:25, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is <b>not a "forum"</b> to "engage the Wikipedia community in questions about EGS". If you would stop using your official business <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">newspeak</a> (which quite clearly identifies yourself as a marketing or public communication type of person) and stop saying "white" when you hear "black", you would acknowledge the fact that we are discussing:
<ul>
<li>if your institution is notable enough to be included here</li>
<li>if we have independent sources (doesn't seems so, but you seem to be keen on making photos as quick as you can, such as this photo of Dj Spooky where you ask him to engage in the Wikipedia debate - that's fair game...), which doesn't seems the case. I won't give you any advice on public relations, but if you muse on that you might need some, I'll be pleased to be your guest... Not that I'm a "fashion maker", but it seems that you do have some troubles which might benefit from amateur, external views&#160;:)</li>
<li>if what you're doing is not actually spam &amp; auto-promotion, both on Wikipedia &amp; through Wikipedia (spamming Wikipedia with EGS links boost your Google hit, you do know that, don't you?)</li>
<li>The creation of your own user page, while perfectly acceptable on a general way, is highly suspicious due to its timing. Your disclaimer are also highly suspicious, you do know that the problem of "newspeak" is that the few sceptics out there read "black" when we see "white" (a method surely acquired from Salvador Dali's paranoiac-critic method, which you are surely familiar with, and others innovative ways of reading that some persons have developed over the age, in particular when confronted to official censorship - you surely are familiar with Leo Strauss' founding works on "suspicious reading" also)... So, when we see that you state that "its is our institutional policy not to edit the Wikipedia entries of our institution and its faculty" and then put the responsibility on your alumni, when no one has ever accused you of self-editing <i>and</i> when almost only anonymous users have contributed to the EGS page is quite suspicious, don't you think? If not, close your school &amp; read again Freud (instead of Sun Tzu and other commercial hype readings), that might be useful for your futures endeavours.</li>
<li>Last but not least, in the same sense that I've politedly requested from Lulu not to stop considering that I edit on good faiths (we are not in a Stalinian trial here, although I've speaken of "paranoiac" methods, do not read more than what I write), I would ask you not to make unfounded accusations such as "The European Graduate School Wikipedia entry is recently subject to various sorts of abuse, which generally (and unfoundedly) question the authenticity and quality standards of the institution.", which, if you stop using your newspeak &amp; really were "keen on Wikipedia", you would have simply called "vandalism". Although this nomination may failed to achieve its aim (stopping your spammming &amp; establishing your unnotability), I am quite surprised to see your reaction, which have only confirmed my fears. You are definitely using Wikipedia for commercial purposes, you're probably not the first, nor the last one, but since you seem to be one of the main source on the Internet about your school, I would require from you to precise and prove that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE GENIUSES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TO YOUR SCHOOL. PS: in the era of images, it is quite doubtful to present "photos" as "proof". We would expect more from a school which keeps inviting "critical theorists".

<dd>This is definitely getting into "paranoid conspiracy" territory by Santa Sangre. I think there's some cruft in this discussion, actually, but I've never taken a photo of EGS. I've never been to EGS or taken a course from them. In fact, I've never been in Switzerland (seems like a nice place, but I haven't been there). I've never posted any photo relating to EGS, even one taken by someone else; nor have I ever edited the EGS WP article. About the closest I come to any connection is that I have met a couple of the guest faculty EGS has had (but I never talked about EGS with them; can't see why that would have come up, and probably they were guest faculty later than when I met them). And yet apparently I'm part of this same global conspiracy to advertise for this school, or hoax, or plot, or whatever Santa Sangre's latest fantasy of its nature is. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 17:18, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I also wonder on Lulu's needs to counsel EGS on the best way to use Wikipedia (see EGS's talk page). If EGS is interested in "news technologies", surely it can get this on its own?

<i>TRAINING AND RESEARCH - The department of Education, Culture and Sport organizes and oversees training and research in <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valais.html" title="Valais">Valais</a>. Only <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romandie.html" title="Romandie">Romand</a> <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_canton.html" title="Swiss canton">canton</a> <b>without university</b>, Valais is nevertheless an important place for research and training.

So, writing that the EGS is <i>the University of Valais</i> is highly misleading. It is a small private school in a remote skiing resort that calls itself a <i>universtity</i>. It may do so, but it has nothing to do with 'real' (and all public) universities of Switzerland (<a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Lausanne_9cfc.html" title="University of Lausanne">University of Lausanne</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Geneva_af8a.html" title="University of Geneva">University of Geneva</a>, <a href="../../../e/p/f/EPFL_a0c9.html" title="EPFL">EPFL</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/ETHZ_9c58.html" title="ETHZ">ETHZ</a>...) and nobody in Switzerland considers such schools as universities (this why canton of Valais itself writes it has got no university, which is common knowledge in Switzerland). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Mongenet_1ce6.html" title="User:Marc Mongenet">Marc Mongenet</a> 10:58, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Here is an English page from the Rectors' Conference of Swiss Universities that talks a bit about Swiss graduate instiutions which backs up Marc Mongenet's point:"<a href="http://www.crus.ch/engl/study.html#study_2" class="external text" title="http://www.crus.ch/engl/study.html#study_2" rel="nofollow">The following are considered as institutions of higher education: the Graduate Institute for International Studies (Institut universitaire de hautes études internationales IUHEI) in Geneva, the Graduate Institute for Advanced Public Administration (Institut de hautes études en administration publique IDHEAP) in Lausanne, the Graduate Institute Kurt Bösch (Institut Universitaire Kurt Bösch, IUKB) in Sion and the Graduate Institute of Development Studies (Institut universitaire d’études du développement, IUED) in Geneva. <b>In addition to the institutes of higher education mentioned above, there are a number of private colleges which offer courses based on the Anglo-Saxon system. The studies and examinations offered by these colleges are not recognized in Switzerland.</b> Some of these colleges may even offer courses which are not serious. We therefore advise anyone interested in following such a course to make careful initial investigations into the problem of recognition.".</a> This does not mean that EGS is not notable, of course - and where does anyone claim the EGS is the University of Valais? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 12:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not an expert but I remember LBS sneaked in before they closed the registration to non-US schools.

<li><i>Domain record activated: 26-Sep-1997</i></li>
<li><i>According to the Cooperative Agreement between EDUCAUSE and the U.S. Department of Commerce, all .edu names in existence as of October 29, 2001, are "grandfathered."

<li><b>KEEP</b> I'm about to enter my third year with EGS and while they may have a tendency for self-promotion, it's a very new school that first has to gain credibility through its faculty until it has enough graduates out there to speak on its behalf. When we all showed up at this dreamy alpine village, we still thought it was a hoax, but it wasn't. It's a truly challenging and nonconventional environment. It's not perfect, but it certainly does exist.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> (Disclaimer: I am a philosophy student and I did talk to a few EGS students. I have also registered at Wikipedia to read and discuss this article. My final decision and disclaimer: I am planning to study there.) The school is very real - several editors have pointed that out already. (I could confirm that with a simple phone call to the accrediting organization - the Swiss canton Valais.) Another phone call to the tourism information in Saas-Fee (<a href="http://www.saas-fee.ch/de/contact.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.saas-fee.ch/de/contact.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.saas-fee.ch/de/contact.cfm</a>) has confirmed the "real" existence.

<p>As long as they all teach there; as long as the pictures the school has added on its pages are real I am fine. Here in Germany I would never have a chance to meet and study with these people (not sure about the US) - but the Swiss school suits me fine. There are even videoclips listed at the faculty pages of European Graduate School (<a href="http://www.egs.edu/main/videolectures.html" class="external free" title="http://www.egs.edu/main/videolectures.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egs.edu/main/videolectures.html</a>) and the photos listed at the individual resource pages are quite amusing ... but they are certainly fake&#160;:) They must be ... (The video clips are either really good animations or Giorgio Agamben, Claire Denis, Chris Fynsk, Peter Greenaway, Agnes Varda, Alain Badiou, Chantal Akerman, Jean Baudrillard, Yve Alain Bois, Victor Burgin, Shelley jackson, Claude Lanzmann, Victor Vitanza, Michael Schmidt, Sandy Stone, Martin Hielscher, and DJ Spooky really teach there.) Another professor or guest speaker has discussed EGS and its faculty on his personal blog (Caveh Zahedi <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004354/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004354/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004354/</a> , Blog&gt;<a href="http://www.cavehzahedi.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.cavehzahedi.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavehzahedi.com/</a> - <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/caveh/" class="external free" title="http://blogs.indiewire.com/caveh/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.indiewire.com/caveh/</a> ) - he personally met some other filmmakers including the Quay Brothers ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093025/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093025/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093025/</a> ), Claire Denis ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219136/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219136/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219136/</a> ), DJ Spooky and Jean Luc Nancy. Either EGS can really mind control all these thinkers and artists and influence their blogs, websites and relationships - or ... The student blogs and statements are of the usual type, some are good others are less enlightening ... Im not worried about that - actually i would be more worried if such entries wouldnt be there&#160;:) (Please check: Elizabeth Albrycht <a href="http://ringblog.typepad.com/corporatepr/" class="external free" title="http://ringblog.typepad.com/corporatepr/" rel="nofollow">http://ringblog.typepad.com/corporatepr/</a> , Paul Tulipana <a href="http://www.paultulipana.net/egs/" class="external free" title="http://www.paultulipana.net/egs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.paultulipana.net/egs/</a> , Alexander Klemm <a href="http://www.alexanderklemm.ch/?European_Graduate_School:Ph.D._Program" class="external free" title="http://www.alexanderklemm.ch/?European_Graduate_School:Ph.D._Program" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexanderklemm.ch/?European_Graduate_School:Ph.D._Program</a> , and editor lotu 5 <a href="http://deletetheborder.org/node/591/" class="external free" title="http://deletetheborder.org/node/591/" rel="nofollow">http://deletetheborder.org/node/591/</a> ). Now add the few newspaper articles and the AfD smells bad faith and has been started by one very "determined" editor with a certain agenda - the educational model of EGS and the faculty it offers can certainly pose a challenge for other minds and institutions. So far most comments are pro keep - Im looking forward to similar discussions in Switzerland next year. Thank you for this discussion.Philophil</p>
