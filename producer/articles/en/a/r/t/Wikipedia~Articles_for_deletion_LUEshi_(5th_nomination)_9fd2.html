<p><b>First let's look at the first four times this has been debated:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_LUEshi_49e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/LUEshi">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/LUEshi</a> - listed, speedied, restored, no closure</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Now, coming to this discussions, there is again <i>no new information presented</i>:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There are several calims to "internet meme" status, but no evidence given to support these claims. As there is no agreed upon definition of what's a "meme" or what metric it is to be measured by, claims of this nature do not have <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>. I'd suggest that this be taken up on the talk of the only relevent guideline, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28websites%29_4134.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (websites)</a>.</li>
<li>There are several complaints about "having too many AfDs" but this does not adress the article in question and is also impossible to refute. The simplest answer would be "no there haven't been" but that's not terribly satifying. As this is a systemic problem resulting from the <i>general</i> handling of AfD closure for contentions topics, this would best be adressed at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_977d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion</a>.</li>

<p>Looking over the past discussions, and bearing the above in mind, the resulting redirect is the clearest consensus of not only the participants in this venue but in all the others as well. I thank everyone for their participation.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, this just got off AfD on a no consensus vote Feb 19th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/LUEshi_2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/LUEshi_2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Response to comment</b>: There is nothing at all notable about this page to those outside of its home board. Many of the Keep votes from past nomintions for deletion came from board users who rarely use Wikipedia, that just voted Keep once they saw their so-called-meme was up for deletion.

<li>I agree, this has no notability outside of GameFAQs message board users, but my point is simply that this will probably end in another <i>No Consensus</i>, just like it seems to have every other time.

<li><b>Dismiss this request for deletion</b>. I <i>am</i> from the board that this fad is from, and while this meme may not be notable in my own opinion, the mere fact that 2 administrators have decided to keep the page, as it currently stands, seems reason enough to me to leave this page alone. Seriously, just like <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>, the page will continue to be nominated, and lack of concensus will still show. Certain memes are notable, certain memes are not. The community has twice failed to demonstrate a lack of notability in this meme. On another note, the community that spawned this meme has their own version of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digg.html" title="Digg">Digg</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">Myspace</a>, and even a full Shoutcast radio station. They are a big community, dedicated to solidarity and expansion. They are not likely to sit down and watch this page die without a fight. Many of them, like me, are reliable members of Wikipedia, who contribute regularly, boldly, and in good faith. And as for notability, here is an article whose subject is much less notable, but still has survived one VfD, and thus was decided by the community to not be non-notable: Limecat. That's all I have to add. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a></strong><em><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Simpson</font></a></em> 21:11, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I don't agree with the relisting of this for AfD so close to the closing of the last one, but to play devil's advocate for a moment, 2 administrators did not <i>decide to keep the page</i>: there was simply not a consensus to delete based on the opinions rendered and the closing admins did the correct thing: labeled the AfD as no consensus and thus kept the article by default. Furthermore the notability of the community that spawned this meme is not what is being debated here and really has no bearing on the general notability of the meme. I suppose an admin could dismiss the AfD, but it's just going to happen again, so IMO it might as well play out. If this ends <i>No Consensus</i>, it needs a tag that it has survived deletion 5 times so people don't continue to AfD it.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:29, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As the nominator of the 4th AfD, I'd rather abstain.

<li>Uh, that's a gross misrepresentation. The first debate was no consensus, the second was an improper speedy delete, the third was the only one that had a keep outcome, but that was keep/merge and there was little consensus (information could be kept, but really doens't need an article), and the last one had no consensus, mainly due to heavy vote padding.--<a href="../../../t/o/f/User%7EToffile_98ee.html" title="User:Toffile">Toffile</a> 17:45, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Intertwined with <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>, <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a>, <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBaum%27s_World_2f93.html" title="EBaum's World">eBaum's World</a>, drawball, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shigeru_Miyamoto_6a47.html" title="Shigeru Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, etc...too expansive to simply merge, too notable to delete. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronMasters_79bb.html" title="User:BaronMasters">BaronMasters</a> 20:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. GameFAQs and its spinoffs are the only places this has notability. The fact that some people from LUE/LL got a printout of the ASCII signed by Miyamoto, took a picture of it taped to the eBaum's offices, and are trying to draw it on Drawball does not give it notoriety outside of the LUE/LL community. If several others not linked to LUE were also using it and referring to it as "LUEshi", it would be different.<br /></li>
<li>As it stands, this meme is virtually excLUEsive (see what I did there?) to GameFAQs, LUE, and its spinoffs, and the article's content does nothing to convince me otherwise. My biggest problem here, which I partially stated during the last VfD, is the fact that <i>LUE itself has been deemed not notable enough for its own article</i> (a decision which I personally disagree with, being a regular visitor myself). If the main originators of this meme can't even get their own article, why should their mascot get one? <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">WarpstarRider</a> 11:10, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't really understand what most people are talking about, but I came here and learned what I wanted to from this article. It serves its purpose. -- 5th nomination?? Does someone hate this page so badly? -- 58.64.102.150 15:04, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, a lot of people do. LUE, unlike SA and 4chan, is not open to the public (although not by board concensus or vote), and so is quite secretive, appearing elitist and snobby to most of the surrounding communities. Oh, and here's another meme that should be deleted, if the "<i>zomg only oen comunitie uses it, LOLXD delte delete lue sux&#160;!!!oneone!!</i>" argument is considered valid: <a href="../../../o/s/-/OS-tan_f23e.html" title="OS-tan">OS-tan</a>. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a></strong><em><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Simpson</font></a></em> 20:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not the best example you could've chosen. I've seen those used plenty outside of Futaba Channel. Plus the OS-tan subject includes a number of different characters, as opposed to a simple ASCII representation of Mario and Yoshi.<br /></li>
<li>Also, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>. I have nothing against LUE; quite the opposite, if you read all of my previous comment. But if LUE itself can't get an article, I don't think this should either. It seems that most of the keep votes here either say "it's notable" with no supporting evidence, or voted to keep simply because it's been voted on with no consensus so many times already. I haven't seen a convincing argument yet as to why this deserves a standalone article. I'd much rather see an article for LUE made, then have the content here merged into it. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">WarpstarRider</a> 00:04, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm. Origin? Connotation? Offensiveness?

<li>Perhaps, but LUEshi has none of those things. I think this line of discussion is probably should be saved for another day, it's a bit off-topic.--<a href="../../../t/o/f/User%7EToffile_98ee.html" title="User:Toffile">Toffile</a> 04:24, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> LUEshi is not confined to GameFAQs or related message boards. It is often posted elsewhere which could be part of a message post or signature on virtually any message board in existence. It is the 'mark of LUE' and I feel that many people are currently and will be confused about what it is &amp; means, and where it came from. I only say keep because I feel like Wikipedia is a great place to alleviate confusion &amp; spread information. -<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStatikeffeck_4e08.html" title="User:Statikeffeck">Statikeffeck</a> 02:59, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Scenario: Someone goes to a site and BAM. There's an ASCII of Mario and Yoshi. Under it, it says "LUEshi Forever." Now, how the hell is some person supposed to find out what LUEshi is? Wikipedia. This scenario is actually more common than detractors are willing to admit. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 199.74.79.242 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_199.74.79.242_b189.html" title="Special:Contributions/199.74.79.242">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
