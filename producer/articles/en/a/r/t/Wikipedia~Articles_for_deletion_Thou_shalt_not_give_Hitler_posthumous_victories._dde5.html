This is known by several terms including <b>the 614th commandment</b>, a representative sample of which will appear in the final draft. The original title is a direct quote from Emil Fackenheim, the statement's original framer. I request withdrawal of this nomination.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please at least wait for the article to be written before calling for a merge. Three of my recent new articles have been featured on "Did you know...?" I'm less than halfway through a first draft. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 01:56, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My only hassle with the article, Durova, is the long name -- no one would type that into the search box to find it. Here is my reasoning: There is an article titled <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Eleventh_Commandment_3feb.html" title="The Eleventh Commandment">The Eleventh Commandment</a> but not one titled Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Endomion</a> 02:13, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When it's completed it will have redirects from other formulations such as 614th commandment. People usually paraphrase the concept, which makes the title a challenge. Please assume good faith in the meantime. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 02:33, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, there you go, start the 614th commandment article, copy all your content to there, and then redirect <i>this</i> article to the new one. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Endomion</a> 03:58, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>As you can see from a few responses, this evokes strong reactions among the people it concerns most. To address this important subject requires caution and taste. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 21:23, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is absolutely no such notion in <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> as a "614 commandment". This was all purely an invention, a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>, from the mind of Fackenheim, where it should be re-deposited. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 04:38, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but as noted, it's gonna need some redirects and serious linking for anyone to ever find it. I found "Jews are forbidden to hand Hitler posthumous victories", "the 614th commandment is: to survive", "Thou Shalt Not Give Hitler a Posthumous Victory", "Do not grant Hitler a posthumous victory", and the fuller piece of the original text (which would make a *really* bad article title) "...we are first commanded to survive as Jews, lest the Jewish people perish. We are commanded, second, to remember in our very guts and bones the martyrs of the Holocaust, lest their memory perish. We are forbidden, thirdly, to deny or despair of God, however much we may have to contend with Him or with belief in Him lest Judaism perish. We are forbidden, finally, to despair of the world as the place which is to become the kingdom of God, lest we make it a meaningless place in which God is dead or irrelevant and everything is permitted. To abandon any of these imperatives, in response to Hitler's victory at Auschwitz, would be to hand him yet other posthumous victories"..... etc. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 04:07, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

One step at a time: these categories and links will come after I finish editing quotes from several rabbis, a Catholic professor of theology, and a Unitarian Universalist minister.

<li><b>Delete</b>, it can not be added to one of God's commandments. But throught the power of the Sunheadren, it could be added to the 7 Rabbincal commandments.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: this is one reason why the title is not <i>614th commandment</i> although Rabbi Fackenheim did propose it by that name. The introduction explicitly states that this is unofficial. If you can find a reference that adds it to the 7 Rabbinical commandments I'll add a mention to the article. I welcome suggestions and contribution that would add to balance and NPOV. Would you really delete this important subject over a technical objection? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 20:55, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: ripped from my reply on my talk page: You misunderstand me, I was saying this couldn't be added to the 613 (thou shall not add or remove). The only thing possible would be to the 7 (I do asume you know what the Sunheadren is). And that in itself is not that possible. It can't even be called unoffical, that is a clear violation of "thou shall not add or remove." This person you call Rabbi, has not got Smicha (Rabbincal Degree). Do you call some wacko on the street doctor, just because he calls himself a doctor and use him as a doctor? Do I hear a no? Why do people make weird exception for the title Rabbi? Don't give a person a title that needs a degree that they don't have. <a href="../../../2/2/0/User%7E220.233.48.200.html" title="User:220.233.48.200">220.233.48.200</a> 22:45, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unless I'm mistaken, he was a Reform Rabbi as well as a professor of philosophy. I would gladly change any relevant reference if that proves to be false. Your criticism appears thoughtful and I would like to include it in the article. Please provide a reputable source that I can cite in the text. Bear in mind that Wikipedia has articles on ideas that aren't true such as <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">phrenology</a>. A good Wikipedia article doesn't endorse a controversial idea. It just reports both sides fairly. That's what I've aimed to do - literally overnight - and it's unrealistic to expect perfection so soon. I hope you support this article and help to make it better. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 23:53, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>He is just like that wacko on my street that calls himself a doctor, but hasn't got a doctor's degree. He has not got a valid Rabbincal degree. Please refer to Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, chapters 63 - "The Prohibition of Deceiving Others with Words and Misleading Others."

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Let's review what we have for a moment - it's a phrase which sums up the thesis of someone's book. Wonderful. Give the <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emil_Fackenheim_c4b5.html" title="Emil Fackenheim">author</a> a page, the book a page, but the phrase doesn't deserve an entry. (Heck - it's an admitted neologism for crying out loud). Secondly, the page is filled with things which are blatantly false - <i>Some Jews regard it as an addition to Jewish Talmudic Law.</i> - some Jews also regard <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis.html" title="Elvis">Elvis</a> as still alive, but that's not how we do things on WP. There is absolutely no normative claim under which this can be considered an addition to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">talmudic</a> law. (For those of you don't know, the Talmud was written between 200-550 CE, and as such, it's a little hard for any 20th century person to be able to claim an addition). The claim that it's another <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitzvah.html" title="Mitzvah">mitzvah</a> is also nothing more than a misinformed joke. People frequently like to joke about the ""1th commandment" or the "614th mitzvah", but the truth is it's just that - a joke, or a phrase used to convey the importance of something with no real fact behind it. Take the worthwhile info and merge in <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emil_Fackenheim_c4b5.html" title="Emil Fackenheim">Emil Fackenheim</a>, but the rest of this page is poppycock. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">אריאל יהודה</a> 03:57, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment, <s>especially to admin I've done a move/redirect to a more NPOV title. Please double check to make sure I've done this in accordance with AfD policy.</s> To other editors: I've added a new section about terminology to include the passage from Deuteronomy that some editors believe Fackenheim violated and I've made other edits to address this unintentional POV issue.

<dd>I'm justp pointing that I think it was a copy-and-paste move, not the proper way to preserve article history for gfdl compliance, so I undid it. I'm not opposing the move per se. And as it was stated above, <b>this debate is about the content not the title</b>. Again, I may have been wrong thinking it was a copy and paste move, if so I'll move it back.

<li>I wasn't trying to be funny, and you missed my point.

<li>Huh? "The factor of importance"- the only one mentioning importance was you, and all you said was "it's important". It <i>is</i>, important not disputing that, but it's not important enough for it's own article. It's good information, but it's too detailed- that can be fixed, but once you are able to condense and NPOVify, this would be small enough to merge.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean</a>|<a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">Bla</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">ck</font></a> 23:14, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and don't merge. I'm the author and I'm finally voting to voice this: the phrase is known among people who cannot name its author. As the citations and examples show, it's a concept that has achieved a currency separate from and beyond the original meanings he attributed to it.
