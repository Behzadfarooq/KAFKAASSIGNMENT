<p>Semiretired from <i>Coast to Coast AM</i>, he returned from his hiatus from hosting the weekend broadcasts, but then took another leave while technical problems were worked out.

Bell served in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAF_6999.html" title="USAF">U.S. Air Force</a> as a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medic.html" title="Medic">medic</a> during the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> and, in his free time, operated a <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate_radio.html" title="Pirate radio">pirate radio</a> station at <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amarillo_Air_Force_Base_853f.html" title="Amarillo Air Force Base">Amarillo Air Force Base</a>.

While there, he set a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_World_Records_df77.html" title="Guinness World Records">Guinness record</a> by staying on the air for 116 hours 15 minutes. The money raised there allowed Bell to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter_airline.html" title="Charter airline">charter</a> a <a href="../../../d/c/-/DC-8_aa1a.html" title="DC-8">DC-8</a>, fly to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and rescue 130 Vietnamese <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphans.html" title="Orphans">Orphans</a> stranded in <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saigon.html" title="Saigon">Saigon</a> at the war's end.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Bell_b332.html" title="Edit section: Broadcasting career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Broadcasting career</span></h2>
<p>Bell's original <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a> program was a political call-in <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_radio.html" title="Talk radio">talk radio</a> show, but he tired of the format, believing there were too many such programs, especially in the wake of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>'s massive success.</p>
<p>Bell abandoned conventional political talk and began highlighting topics such as <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_control.html" title="Gun control">gun control</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theories.html" title="Conspiracy theories">conspiracy theories</a>. This led to a significant success in his overnight ratings. However the main focus of his show shifted significantly after the <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_City_bombing_680f.html" title="Oklahoma City bombing">Oklahoma City bombing</a> in 1995. Many in the media did not want to be blamed for inciting the militia/anti-government actions like the bombing. Afterwards, Bell discussed offbeat topics like the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranormal.html" title="Paranormal">paranormal</a>, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occult.html" title="Occult">occult</a> knowledge, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unidentified_flying_object.html" title="Unidentified flying object">UFOs</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">protoscience</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo-science.html" title="Pseudo-science">pseudo-science</a>. If one were to only read a transcript of Bell's early 1990s shows, one might not recognize it as the same show with which he later found widespread success. Gone is the militia talk, replaced with UFOs and ghosts. During his tenure at KDWN, Bell met and married his second wife, Ramona, who later handled production and management duties for the program.</p>
<p>At its initial peak in popularity, <i><a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_To_Coast_AM_7e03.html" title="Coast To Coast AM">Coast To Coast AM</a></i> was syndicated on over 500 radio stations, and it claimed 15 million listeners nightly. In its current form, the show receives upwards of 30 million listeners when Bell is actually hosting the show.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Bell broadcasts from his home in the town of Pahrump, located in <a href="../../../n/y/e/Nye_County_80c6.html" title="Nye County">Nye County</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada.html" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, hence, the catchphrase "from the Kingdom of Nye".</p>

<p>Some critics see Bell as a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlatan.html" title="Charlatan">charlatan</a>, and some guests have been criticized as <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crank_%28person%29.html" title="Crank (person)">cranks</a> or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">quacks</a>; Coast-to-Coast is subject to frequent ridicule, criticism and mockery on the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">usenet</a> group <a href="news:alt.fan.art-bell" class="external text" title="news:alt.fan.art-bell" rel="nofollow">alt.fan.art-bell</a>, in the <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_c152.html" title="AOL">AOL</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatroom.html" title="Chatroom">chatroom</a> "Beyond Belief", the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undernet.html" title="Undernet">Undernet</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatroom.html" title="Chatroom">chatroom</a> #coast2coast (among others), and on some <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>.

Hoagland">Richard C. Hoagland</a>), and the unusual products offered by advertisers. Other observers regard Bell as simply a master showman, noting that he calls his show "absolute entertainment" <a href="http://www.csicop.org/sb/9803/art-bell.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csicop.org/sb/9803/art-bell.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and that he expressly says that he does not necessarily accept every guest or caller's claims but only offers a forum where they will not be openly ridiculed. Bell is one of only a few talk show hosts who do not screen calls. His calm attitude, patient questions, and ability to tease substance from nebulous statements of callers and guests imbue his show with a relaxed yet serious atmosphere earning him praise from those who contend the paranormal deserves a mature outlet of discussion in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a>, as well as the approval of those simply amused by the nightly parade of bizarre, typically fringe topics. <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Dames_c8f0.html" title="Ed Dames">Ed Dames</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_C._Hoagland_6dba.html" title="Richard C.

<p>Bell's interests, however, extend beyond the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranormal.html" title="Paranormal">paranormal</a>.

<p>There are three annual gimmicks on Bell's program: On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fool%27s_Day_5641.html" title="April Fool's Day">April Fool's Day</a>, Art always winds up having at least one gag story that's presented in such a way that the listeners are left guessing as to whether or not their legs are really being pulled hard, such as the time when Bell took a cellphone call from a pilot who was claiming to be flying his <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cessna.html" title="Cessna">Cessna</a> <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">airplane</a> over <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">Area 51</a> and wound up getting shot down while still on the line. On <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>, his show is renamed "Ghost to Ghost A.M.", and is devoted to callers relating their allegedly real-life encounters with <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">ghosts</a>. Every <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Eve_e542.html" title="New Year's Eve">New Year's Eve</a>, Bell invites callers to make a prediction for the coming year based on actual precognitive experiences, not just guesses or wishful thinking. The predictions are then reviewed at the close of the next year and given a audible "Ding" if they are deemed to have been correct, or a "Bonk" if the prediction did not come true.</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the most notorious Coast to Coast interviews Bell had was with Mel Waters. Mel Waters talked about what is known as <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel%27s_Hole_e809.html" title="Mel's Hole">Mel's Hole</a> in rural Washington, which is said to be an infinitely deep hole featuring paranormal powers. No such hole has ever been found.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bell has also had several amusing arguments with a regular caller who refers to himself as "JC Webster the 3rd", a <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right-wing.html" title="Far-right-wing">far-right-wing</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> who believes that Art is "the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">Devil</a>'s mouthpiece."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In March 2006, Bell received a call from a person or entity calling itself "Oscar" or "Swede", who is allegedly "the Son of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>". Bell reacted toward Oscar the same way he has reacted toward JC.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At about 1am EST, Friday, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, he designated one phone line for Area 51 employees who wanted to discuss the secretive base. Several callers claimed to work at Area 51, but the bizarre highlight of the night came when a seemingly distraught and terrified man claimed to be a former Area 51 employee recently discharged for "medical" reasons. He cited malevolent extraterrestrials at Area 51 ("extradimensional beings" who are not "what they claim to be") and an impending disaster that the government knew would take out "major population centers." Midway through this call, Bell's program went off the air for about 30 minutes. After talking to network engineers, the official explanation was that the network satellite had "lost earth lock" or forgotten where the earth was. Network officials were baffled. The caller surfaced a couple weeks later, by the name Brian, and said he had created the character (confirming the claim after a brief performance, using the same panicked voice) but said he had no idea how or why the show was knocked off the air.
<ul>
<li>This incident formed the basis of the song "<a href="../../../f/a/a/Faaip_de_Oiad_1d51.html" title="Faaip de Oiad">Faaip de Oiad</a>" by the progressive-rock band <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool_%28band%29.html" title="Tool (band)">Tool</a>, which features said interview (with Art Bell's part cut out), over frantic drumming and buzzing static.</li>
<li>Another song featuring this call was "They are not what they claim to be ..." by electronic artist <a href="http://www.theboyflood.com" class="external text" title="http://www.theboyflood.com" rel="nofollow">The Boy Flood</a>. It was featured on the main page of <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_to_Coast_AM_b201.html" title="Coast to Coast AM">Coast to Coast AM</a> in the listers submission section. This version is a more musical affair than the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool_%28band%29.html" title="Tool (band)">Tool</a> one, but still has that dark edge about it.</li>
<li>Yet another song featuring the call was "It's Out There and It's Gonna Get You" by experimental Texas-quartet <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Paper_Chase_%28band%29_557c.html" title="The Paper Chase (band)">the paper chase</a> on their 2006 album <i>Now You Are One Of Us</i>.</li>
<li>Johnette Napolitano's album <i>Sketchbook</i> contains Art Bell interviews interspersed within the music throughout.</li>
<li>This call served as the inspiration for the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Alternate reality game">alternate reality game</a> <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majestic_%28video_game%29.html" title="Majestic (video game)">Majestic</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In March 2005 a man also called about disturbing events on <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwajalein.html" title="Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnston_Atoll_f933.html" title="Johnston Atoll">Johnston Atoll</a> about a weapon that only targeted certain people and could leave others unhurt. He indicated he had been on both islands (that are US military only) and that these weapons had been tested in 1993. Art lost the call after another voice came on the line with a click saying "Shelton, terminate the call from A-6." Art tried to call the man back but was unsuccessful.</li>

<p>In 1998, Bell was named as recipient of the less-than-prestigious Snuffed Candle Award. The <a href="http://www.csicop.org/cmi/" class="external text" title="http://www.csicop.org/cmi/" rel="nofollow">Council for Media Integrity</a> cited Bell "for encouraging credulity, presenting pseudoscience as genuine, and contributing to the public's lack of understanding of the methods of scientific inquiry."</p>
<p>In 2005, the City of Las Vegas renamed a portion of 11th Street in the downtown area "Art Bell Drive."</p>

<p>Bell has retired and returned to <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> several times.</p>
<p><b>Retirement</b>: His first retirement, highly unexpected, was announced on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">October 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Return</b>: He returned two weeks later, leading many to believe it was merely a publicity stunt. Bell asserted that the brief departure was brought on by threats made against his family. Later, in 2000, it was explained that this retirement was due to an allegation made by hosts of <a href="../../../w/w/c/WWCR_87ad.html" title="WWCR">WWCR</a> <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortwave.html" title="Shortwave">shortwave</a> radio that Bell had paid to cover up a criminal indictment. (Bell took legal action against the hosts and stations, which was settled in 2000. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001202164100/http://www.coasttocoastam.com/F0005.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20001202164100/http://www.coasttocoastam.com/F0005.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Retirement</b>: In April 2000, Bell again retired, but offered no details other than stating he intended to "resolve a family crisis." <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Siegel_211e.html" title="Mike Siegel">Mike Siegel</a> was left in charge of the program. It was later explained he had left to deal with the aftermath of a sexual assault against his son. Brian Lepley, a substitute teacher, was convicted of sexual assault and attempted transmission of <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> and was sentenced to 10 to 25 years. <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/May-07-Tue-2002/news/18691181.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/May-07-Tue-2002/news/18691181.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Return</b>: Nearly a year later, in February 2001, Bell again returned. He noted that since his departure the show had lost a number of affiliates, commercial content had risen to an unbearable level, and that Siegel had taken the program in a "different direction", one which Bell disapproved of. He retained some authority over the program as its creator, and thus felt his return was necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Retirement</b>: In late 2002, recurring back pain (the result of a fall from a telephone pole during his youth) forced yet another departure, and Bell was permanently replaced by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Noory_27d1.html" title="George Noory">George Noory</a> as weekday host of <i>Coast to Coast AM</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Return</b>: Bell <i>again</i> returned in September 2003, having missed the microphone, this time replacing <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Simpson_9ecd.html" title="Barbara Simpson">Barbara Simpson</a> and <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Punnett_6d6d.html" title="Ian Punnett">Ian Punnett</a> as host of the Saturday and Sunday evening broadcasts. In June 2005, he scaled this schedule back a bit (a "semi-retirement"), deciding to host only the last two Sundays of every month. Bell has since gone back to hosting every weekend show as his schedule permits.</dd>

<p>Ramona Bell, his wife of fifteen years, died unexpectedly, at the age of 47, of what appeared to be an acute <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> attack on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">January 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> in <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laughlin%2C_Nevada_e886.html" title="Laughlin, Nevada">Laughlin, Nevada</a>, where the couple was taking a short vacation.

<p>The events surrounding Ramona's death were described, in great detail, by Art Bell during the January 22 broadcast of <i>Coast to Coast AM</i>.

<p>By the end of January, Bell began hinting that he was making a significant life decision, but that he would keep it a secret for at least one year, asking listeners to remind him in 2007 to let them in on it. By March, he was saying that he would soon be taking a <i>"huge risk"</i> and <i>"do something rash."</i> On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, he ended the mystery and, to the mild surprise of listeners, revealed that, after several weeks of mourning, he had recently gone to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and <a href="http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=5222" class="external text" title="http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=5222" rel="nofollow">married Airyn Ruiz</a>, whose name is pronounced like the name "Irene", but Art likes to pronounce her name as "Arin". This is because during their <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_dating.html" title="Internet dating">Internet dating</a> Art imprinted her name with that pronunciation. Airyn Ruiz Bell is a recent <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> graduate. Ruiz&#160;— given Bell's private <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-mail.html" title="E-mail">e-mail</a> address by a <a href="../../../h/a/m/Ham_radio.html" title="Ham radio">ham radio</a> friend&#160;— had contacted Bell to offer condolences shortly after Ramona's death. After "dating" via Internet <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_conferencing.html" title="Video conferencing">video conferencing</a> for "hundreds of hours", the two married one week after Bell arrived in the Philippines to actually meet her in person&#160;. Bell also paid for his friend&#160;— who was courting Airyn's sister&#160;— to accompany him to the Philippines and marry her. The two couples wed in a double marriage ceremony on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_11.html" title="April 11">April 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>

Art recently announced that the couple's child is indeed a girl as many listeners suspected. He noted that they were hoping for a girl and had announced only a girl's name for their unborn child in hopes of receiving a girl. Art and Airyn's baby girl will be named Asia.</p>

<p>The <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Daily_Inquirer_5ca6.html" title="Philippine Daily Inquirer">Philippine Daily Inquirer</a></i> printed a letter found on a web page purportedly from Bell that made derogatory statements about Filipinos. This letter was subsequently demonstrated to be a hoax perpetrated upon Bell, who in fact had a publicly loving relationship with his Filipina wife, and who often spoke openly about his admiration for the Filipino people on his radio show. Subsequently, the <i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i> printed a retraction and apologized for printing the statement upon their verification of the hoax. This fraudulent act upon Bell still periodically results in serious threats to Bell when this material surfaces from time to time. <a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/gen/page1661.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/gen/page1661.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
