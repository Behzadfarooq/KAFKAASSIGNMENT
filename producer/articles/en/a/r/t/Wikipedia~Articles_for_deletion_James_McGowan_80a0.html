<li>I'm fairly certain that, when we want to engage in an evaluation of notability, we can't deal in "probably." Apparently Wikipedia does have standards. Do you have evidence that "between the book and the ministry" McGowan is "known well beyond his own congregation?" What is "known well?" Is it enough to merit an encyclopedia article and, if so, why? That's part of the point, I think. Thanks for your vote. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 22:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
