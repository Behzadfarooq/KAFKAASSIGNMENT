<p>This nomination was made by an anonymous user. I've tried to fix it. The article was deleted once on AfD and the second AfD was cut short after it was realized that it had been deleted before. However, I believe that she might be notable for an article. She has a lot of non-duplicate Google page results and about 100 image results. She has also appeared in <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxim_%28magazine%29.html" title="Maxim (magazine)">Maxim</a> magazine. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:51, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think that some here are saying she is not notable simply because she is not famous. There is a distinction and just because she is not as familiar to the general public as say <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Crawford_136a.html" title="Cindy Crawford">Cindy Crawford</a>, that does not mean she is less signifigant as a model worthy of an entry on this site. She has appeared in one of the world's formost men's magazines in Maxim, has been featured on many sites such as gorrilamask and ifilm and is certainly worthy of an entry here as she made a bit of a stir on the internet that has lead to her notarieity in many circles (evidenced by the fact that she was asked to pose for a magazine as popular as Maxim). <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriGold_7a2c.html" title="User:AriGold">AriGold</a> 18:30, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - NON ENCICLOPEDIC. she ISN'T a model,those pics have been STOLEN from her PC,She doesn't want to be a famous,Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,I hope you can understand the 90% of the information is false, she hasn't got an official web site,that links are spam of porn websites with publicity.

<li><b>Keep</b> the Maxim shoot pushed her notability up over the borderline, if only just barely.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've never heard of that gal before, but that is completely immaterial. The article is well-written, NPOV, referenced, and she has really become notable (and thus encyclopaedic), if only / exactly because (let's suppose it's true) "those pics have been STOLEN from her PC,She doesn't want to be a famous". <font color="green"><a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">&lt;K</a><a href="../../../k/f/_/User_talk%7EKF_e975.html" title="User talk:KF">F&gt;</a></font> 22:05, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
