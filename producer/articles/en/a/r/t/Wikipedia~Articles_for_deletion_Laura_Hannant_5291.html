<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> following the rewrite (most delete arguments do not address it). No articles link to this one, which is usually cause for concern, particularly given the whiff of self-promotion, but given the subject's involvement with noteworthy organisations and people, there should be scope to add some links to this article somewhere. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:47, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it has potential. Using a 'Strong Keep' to push a marginally notable person will not gain you any extra votes here. Quiet and reasoned persuasion works better. I think some of the previous references have dropped out and the ones there are not all functional or do not have her name. My recommendation is to work on adding as many good references as possible to neutral reliable sites, such as news media, UNICEF, etc. that show her name. I will switch my vote to Keep once the refs have been added/fixed up. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 12:16, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I kept two important references, but made a formatting mistake. Corrected it now, and they are both sources that refer to her by name. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a> 12:27, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am still not comfortable with sufficiently proven notability based on the current references to change my mind. Yes, she was mentioned a couple of times, but so have lots of kids, and it seems in most cases she is mentioned as example of an 'activist kid' in a site or publication of questionable (to me) popularity. Has she done anything remarkable since? She is about 20 years old now - I think it takes more to get <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
