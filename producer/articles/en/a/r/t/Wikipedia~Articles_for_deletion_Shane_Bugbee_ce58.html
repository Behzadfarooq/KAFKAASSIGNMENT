<p>This page should be deleted for a number of reasons. First and foremost, he is non-notable. His name reveals only about 560 google hits, most prominent of which are wikipedia or wikipedia related pages (such as Answers.com), and webpages hawking his stuff. Secondly, the article suffers from being autobiographical, in that almost all of the article was written by Mr. Bugbee and his wife. Furthermore, the vast majority of claims in the article are subjective and completely unsourced. In short, the article is a messy, largely unverified biography about a non-notable individual that fails the criteria for inclusion. Edit: All of sources are either a)tiny webzines, b) concerning a local event or c) mention the subject only in passing. <a href="../../../d/e/t/User%7EDetruncate_24c6.html" title="User:Detruncate">Detruncate</a> 20:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>- 360 unique hits, then. Well, a user with no previous edits by the name "Amy bugbee" and another with the name "Shane Bugbee" edited the article several times. The creator of the article user "Cyril Grey" created about 5 longish articles out of whole cloth. The first one wasShane Bugbee, and all the others were subjects that had links to Shane Bugbee, and all lacked proper citation. Given that you're an inclusionist you will presumably be in favor of keeping everything, regardless of guidelines such as notability, which is the one that I'm primarily concerned with. Apologies if you feel that's rude of me to say.--<a href="../../../d/e/t/User%7EDetruncate_24c6.html" title="User:Detruncate">Detruncate</a> 21:07, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please refer to the definition of <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> - finding fault with my personal viewpoints is irrelevant to our discussion on the merits of this article. Please cite the edits in question, though there is still no proof that the editors you speak of are in fact the subject or his spouse. It is an assumption, even if said editors declared themselves to be the subject or his spouse on their talk pages. Finally, there is still the assertion in the article and the reliable sources, which is more than enough to establish notability, regardless of whether or not the article's subject or his spouse edited the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I hate to dominate the discussion here, (though I started this and I intend to see it through) but to be fair, he fails every single criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He has no widely recognized contributions in the field of politics, athletics, or entertainment, obviously. The only thing he even comes close to is publisher/author, but he has won no awards and has only one review that could be considered notable. He also fails the alternative tests of google hits, autobiography, verifiability, and the 100 years test. If we included everyone who has even been on a tour of any kind or has ever written a book... well, this deletion seems like a no-brainer.--<a href="../../../d/e/t/User%7EDetruncate_24c6.html" title="User:Detruncate">Detruncate</a> 22:25, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Publishing <b>ANSWER ME #4</b> is justification enough. That zine was polarizing and widely discussed. Label the article as self promotion, but keep it.<a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhosts%26empties_0e07.html" title="User:Ghosts&amp;empties">Ghosts&amp;empties</a> 03:53, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>- To clarify, Bugbee published a reprint of ANSWER Me! #4 seven years after the original edition—the original edition is the one that caused all the controversy. Nearly all of the polarization and discussion occurred long before Bugbee's reprint. Bugbee had no hand in the magazine's creation. A review of all his "accomplishments" would show an identical pattern—attaching himself to noteworthy events or people while creating nothing of note himself. This, I believe, is a crucial distinction. Shawarma Chondroitin 13:51, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. What stands out among all of this is the fact that Bugbee himself—as a creator—has produced nothing notable or lasting. He hasn't written anything or filmed anything or recorded anything of note—absolutely nothing. Again and again, he's merely attached himself to notable people. If Forrest Gump is notable merely by squeezing himself into a photo op with LBJ, then I suppose Bugbee is notable. Otherwise, he very clearly isn't. Again, the Google search of his name (as a phrase) yielded only 502 hits. Look closely at the first few pages of hits—every one of them is linked to a site which Bugbee hosts. If that's not evidence enough that he needs to be deleted, I'm not sure what is. Look closely also at early versions of this page—they included an ad for, of all things, a soda-pop company which Bugbee apparently owns. That seems like conclusive evidence that he wrote his own profile. Shawarma Chondroitin 13:18, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>-This is all all directed from one place, Jim Goad, or a Jim Goad fan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look back on all the notes &amp; edits, they ALL revolve around Mr. Goad, a subject that seems to be attaching it self to me at this point. Let's talk stuff other than Jim Goad.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>- Judging from what has been presented here, it is possible that Shane Bugbee did not write his profile. There is one other possibility that seems likely: His wife wrote it.

<li><b>Comment</b>- Subject states the following: "Look back on all the notes &amp; edits, they ALL revolve around Mr. Goad, " This is simply not true. The edit history is available for all to see. I uncovered only two edits that mention Goad at all. Nearly all of the edits involve typos, the idea that this page was created by the subject as self-promotion (following the links, this seems highly plausible), and the topic of the subject's notability/obscurity. I was considering a vote for inclusion until the subject compromised his own credibility with the above statement. I must now vote to delete. Adam Burton 10:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Subject links to an unreleased book as evidence of his notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>. So "Shane Bugbee" has appeared to declare himself notable. Well, this is what his detractors have been saying all along--his wikipedia page is a vanity page, and it seems obvious from a review of the evidence that he was the one who created it. I have never heard of this person until now, although he surrounds himself with famous and/or notorious people. I believe his page violates the spirit of Wikipedia. 63.242.155.58 13:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Entire profile appears to have been written by Shane Bugbee as self-promotion. I agree with prior opinions stating that surrounding oneself with notable people does not make oneself noteworthy, unless one creates something noteworthy themselves. A scan of Bugbee's "creative output" reveals no products/artifacts that have sold remotely well or been remotely successful or noteworthy. A small mention in some East Coast free weekly "upcoming events" column seems like little more than a reworded press release. If that alone made someone noteworthy, every indie rock band on the planet would deserve a wikipedia profile. 68.80.86.90 20:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Inevitably, dismissing, debunking, and deflating the notability of someone who is attempting to be notable will seem somewhat personal and quite possibly harsh. However I agree in that we should strive to be civil, but also honest. The exact problem we have here is that this IS the community, or at least all of the community who cares about this article, so when you're referring to the community I'm not sure what you mean. Don't bandy about accusations of sock puppetry without any evidence, though. Just because a user is new to wikipedia does not mean that a) their opinions and arguments are invalid or b) they are a sock puppet. <a href="../../../d/e/t/User%7EDetruncate_24c6.html" title="User:Detruncate">Detruncate</a> 03:50, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This dud is non-notable and his book on Gacy was self-published. Its not like a major publisher produced it 617USA</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> A search of "A Question of Doubt" reveals it was published in New York in 1991. Bugbee is not listed as publisher or co-author. In fact, the only links I could uncover which associate Bugbee with the book are a scant handful where Bugbee himself is claiming this. It's possible he reprinted the book, but it seems as if he's either fabricating or heavily embellishing the facts about exactly who co-wrote the book with Gacy. 68.80.86.90 14:15, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<i>Comment</i> The book "A Question of Doubt" is listed as being published by "Craig Bowley Consultants." A search of the phrase "Craig Bowley" alongside the word "Bugbee" yielded zero hits. 68.80.86.90 14:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
