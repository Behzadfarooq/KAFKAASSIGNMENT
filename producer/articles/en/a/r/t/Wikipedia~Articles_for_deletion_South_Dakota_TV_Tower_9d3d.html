<li><b>Delete</b> all the dozens of individual tower articles cluttering Wikipedia, <i>unless</i> the particular tower is notable in some way that makes it distinct from other towers. <i>Every</i> town and city of any size has several of these, so there must be thousands of them around the world.

<li><b>Keep</b> The articles contain all basic information for a tatter expansion! The table on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> has no column for location data! It has only a column for the country and when you write <a href="../../../k/t/m/KTMD-TV_Tower_c22a.html" title="KTMD-TV Tower">KTMD-TV Tower</a> is in <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> the statement does not give much information, because the USA is very big! Even for small countries an exact location data is necessary and because of the fact that radio masts are almost outside urban areas geographical coordinates are very useful to give the exact location and are often listed in transmitter tables. Keep them!
<ul>
<li>Above remark by User:85.74.13.16, who has twenty edits. He accidentally bolded the word 'keep' twice, I've unbolded one to prevent confusion.</li>
<li>Why can't you just change the formatting of the table on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> to include the additional information you think is notable? <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">RussBlau</a> 13:24, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree. There's already a forum for these towers, and it's <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>. There just is not enough information on each individual tower to warrant a separate article. It's not that I object to the information being presented somewhere, it's just that I think a separate article is not warranted. Why not expand the table on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> as RussBlau suggests?
