Perhaps worthy of mention in the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bomb.html" title="Google bomb">Google bomb</a> article or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-French_sentiment_in_the_United_States_2cfe.html" title="Anti-French sentiment in the United States">Anti-French sentiment in the United States</a> but not its own article. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 01:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete.</b> Having studied googlebombs extensively, and I even created one myself (no further comment on that), I can tell you that no single google bomb is noteworthy in and of itself. The phenomenon as a whole is noteworthy, and is discussed properly in the article titled <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlebomb.html" title="Googlebomb">Googlebomb</a>. The specific example of "French military victories" is not worthy of its own article. In addition, the article as written contains some factual errors and NPOV problems, but I won't fix them because it should just be deleted. 129.98.212.143 02:24, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I recall this one being more notable than most googlebombs, having been mentioned in quite a few newspapers. At 2003 it was topical, due to the Iraq war and France using their UN veto. Perhaps since it's been a long time since then it no longer meets the Wikipedia notability guidelines, and is deserving of a merge or deletion, but at the moment for me, it's still a weak keep. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETkenna_58af.html" title="User:Tkenna">Tkenna</a> 13:19, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. If people are going to get picky about PPV events, then the UK only WWE PPVs should go as well.

<li><b>Weak delete, but I'm not sure.</b> The vast majority of chess clubs are not notable. I would say that a chess club is notable if a historic chess event took place there, or if a world-class grandmaster played there for several years. On these criteria the Marshall Chess Club in New York City would qualify, but all we have about it in Wikipedia is this line in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Marshall_f918.html" title="Frank Marshall">Frank Marshall</a>: "In 1915 he opened the Marshall Chess Club in New York." Look at the pages in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChess_clubs_f756.html" title="Category:Chess clubs">Category:Chess clubs</a>, and you will see that the notability of most of them is highly questionable. A particular offender is SKSamobor. So I think the article under discussion should be deleted, and the other chess club articles should be reviewed, perhaps in CfD. 129.98.212.143 02:35, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but clean up. This Club is old and has been involved with various notable chess people and events.

<dd>Which reasoning? The main keep recommendation or the comment? The problem with this article is that it needs cleanup. I came across it by chance. I am not a chess player and I am not from Canada. "the oldest traceable recorded Canadian correspondence chess game" seems to meet notability guidelines, except I can not find the reference on the URL given. Outside verification is likely for much of this article, but has not been found. Much of the article should be trimmed out. Instead of trying to delete interesting but unverified material, we should at this stage be trying to find verified sources. Maybe in the end this will have to go, but I do not see it has to go now. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 04:08, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I'm not sure where it is but something that goes back with a continuous history of 160 years is very frequently considered notable. Age for schools for example is used as a criteria. Both the Club and presumably corrspondence chess have such a continuous history. Stuff in my country that goes back to the 1840s is certainly considered notable. Remember we are using guidelines. If something is interested and can be verified we should ignore guidelines if we have to and keep. However I grant you that this article needs work, and I guess it will not happen over the Christmas holiday period. I'm going to leave to others now and sort out my holiday period. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 06:34, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Notability guidelines are <i>guidelines</i>. There is no need to cite one when recommending keep or delete. You are even free to say that you think the article should be kept, despite the guidelines. Your opinion is still valid. The guidelines are simply a refection on what the community tends to view as notable etc.: they are <i>descriptive not proscriptive</i>. Some of us think notability is pretty useless as a criterion anyway.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 09:03, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> per plenty of precedents of student societies being <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">not notable</a> by definition, or per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. Quite frankly, this is not one of those exceptions which proves the rule. Don't be fooled by the <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_and_mirrors.html" title="Smoke and mirrors">smoke and mirrors</a>, the article tries to give the impression of things which were not the case, by including some verbose POV text, tenuous links and assertions. It seems to be written in a specific attempt to avoid deletion, with too much padding not of direct relevance to the club. Some examples, the QUCC's origins within the Kingston Chess club are tenuous at best; QUCC was founded in the 1950s, not 1841!; Larry Melvyn Evans was already American champ when he played at the tournament at QU, and was not a member of the QUCC. A complete re-write will show this up clearly, but I don't see it worth the effort unless it's the only way to convince the community of the <b>delete</b> conclusion which is staring me in the face. I was equally surprised at the keep verdict, for the reasons given by the nom. In addition, this poorly written, excessively linked up article is a real turn-off. But then, I suspect that's also part of the smoke and mirrors. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:14, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article reads to imply that the club was founded at the same time as the university; however, I'm about 99.44% certain that this is not the case. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 13:14, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Reference to student clubs as an overall category is misleading. This is a club with international connections, mentioned in the article, and clearly a definite, if closely defined, notability. If it is thought that the clear and uncontested notability of some players who belong to the club does not confer notability to the club, then so be it; but in chess, the players ARE the club. Arguing admittedly by analogy and not by official policy, in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> a band is notable if it contains a notable member. Why should a chess club be different?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 19:45, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> True, a band is notable if it contains a notable member. But this argument by analogy turns, I think, on two different senses of the word "member." A "member" of a club is merely someone who has joined the club, whearas a band is <i>defined</i> as that particular group of musicians. To put it another way, if the most famous member of a chess club left it, the club would still continue. The same may not be true of the most famous member of a band. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 20:40, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> plus a good cleanup. 03:04, 22 December 2006 (UTC) Without going into too much detail, I support the notion of keeping this article per the reasoning of the first AfD debate. However, the article needs improvement in terms of style, organization, citations, etc. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 19:03, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>General question</b> for the people commenting "keep and clean up": what would a cleaned-up article would look like? It would just be a shorter version of the current article: a disconnected list of tournaments and matches. This is because the club itself has not been the subject of multiple, independent reliable sources, which would enable us to write a good article on it. Also, does anybody dispute Ohconfucius's analysis of the true age of this club? "It's old" was a reason offered for keep in both AfDs. Also, <a href="../../../i/n/t/WP%7EINTERESTING_6e23.html" title="WP:INTERESTING">WP:INTERESTING</a> is not a valid rationale for keep, nor is the connection to something else (Queen's University) that is (definitely) notable. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 19:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>don't need to, find a comparable chess club in wikipedia. the history in the article, if cited and verified makes this club notable. how so you ask? if i were on a high school chess team and looking to go to a college with a chess club, this is the sort of chess club that would strike me as having accomplished some things in the chess world.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 13:41, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Buridan, the point we're trying to make here is that the history of the club as presented in the article is incredibly misleading to a reader. It needs to explicitly say when the club was founded, and provide a source saying that the club was founded in that year. Right now, it makes a misleading claim that implies that the club was founded in the same year as Queen's University itself, which I'm pretty sure is false. This goes nothing to say that the precedent set by other discussions around here that says that "student clubs are generally NOT notable", and I don't particularly see any internationally famous grandmasters that played chess at this club. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 15:34, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Buridan, you may not need verifiable, reliable sources (not to mention straightforward claims) in order to believe this club is the greatest chess club ever, but Wikipedia does <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:40, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That means it needs <b>cleanup</b> not deletion, if they do not have sources, which I bet they easily do given the documentation of chess history, that is a different story, but to me they meet the notable test, they just need cleanup to be verifiable. I agree, student clubs are generally not notable, that is why they put the word 'generally' in there. there are exceptions to the rule, this seems to be an easy one.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 05:04, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>When proposing the Radio and TV masts for deletion, I never imagined that I would find articles for electricity pylons in wikipedia. Now I have been proven wrong. Watch out now for telephone boxes and lampadaires next!&#160;;-) I propose the above articles for deletion first and above all because I do not see there is a place for them here in wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. Furthermore, I would say these utilitarian structures are of even less interest to the public than radio masts, and the articles are almost certain to remain stubs forever.

<p>Ugh. Okay, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standing.html" title="Standing">Standing</a> is identical to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standing_%28law%29.html" title="Standing (law)">Standing (law)</a>. There is no point in having two identical articles. "Merging" them would still be the same thing as deleting one, since they are <i>the same article</i>. This why I am proposing deletion. Please discuss. Look at the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Talk%7EStanding_2c44.html" title="Talk:Standing">Talk:Standing</a> page or my comment <a href="../../../s/r/1/User_talk%7ESr13_4dc1.html" title="User talk:Sr13">here</a> for more info. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnesh_5043.html" title="User:Arnesh">Arnesh</a> 04:01, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Rename</b> to "Standing to sue" and <b>keep</b>. A notable legal concept that is a big part of supreme court proceedings, the first test for any appeal is whether A: the court has jurisdiction and B: the appelant has standing to sue. Enough importance and potential information for it's own article, and merging into <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawsuit.html" title="Lawsuit">lawsuit</a> would be a bit ungainly. It is well sourced, encyclopedic and discusses importance and origin of the concept. Might use a bit of expansion (into EU law and the origins in common law) but I see no possible reason for deletion under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 04:27, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Filipinos have been basically local soap operas since time immemorial as "telenovelas" until <a href="../../../a/b/s/ABS-CBN_97be.html" title="ABS-CBN">ABS-CBN</a> came up with "<a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleserye.html" title="Teleserye">teleseryes</a>" then <a href="../../../g/m/a/GMA_Network_eb75.html" title="GMA Network">GMA Network</a> came up with "<a href="../../../t/e/l/Teledrama.html" title="Teledrama">teledramas</a>". Then Filipinos had "sineseryes", "<a href="../../../t/e/l/Telefantasya.html" title="Telefantasya">telefantasyas</a> (GMA's version)/fantaseryes (ABS-CBN's version), Asianovelas (Korean and Taiwanese dramas) etc. while the basic premise of a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telenovela.html" title="Telenovela">telenovela</a>, even a <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> wasn't changed (where the heroine is beat up all night then has revenge, etc., you know the drill.)</p>
<p>Now since these terms are all redundant, I won't suggest deletion, but a <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telenovela.html" title="Telenovela">telenovela</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> or a creation of Television in the Philippines for a more comprehensive look.

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>redirect</b>. I think there's very little to salvage for a merge, as the whole thing is original research (or at the very least unsourced).

<li><b>Keep</b>. This certainly doesn't read badly, and I'm inclined to assume good faith about the contents despite its current lack of references. (I will have to continue to assume good faith even if references are added, for they're likely to be hard to access and in a language I don't read.) If these series are in fact known as <i>telenovelas</i> in the Philippines, I'd support <b>moving</b> the article to Telenovelas in the Philippines, but there's too much information here to dump it straight into the <i><a href="../../../t/e/l/Telenovela.html" title="Telenovela">telenovela</a></i> article. Agree also that we should have a Television in the Philippines article, but it should be in addition to this one. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I tend to identify <i>telenovela</i> with Spanish language programming; that's where the word originated, and it isn't surprising that they are called something slightly different in the Philippines. "Television in the Philippines" is a bit too broad for these; at least I <i>hope</i> there's something on TV in the Philippines besides these shows. Perhaps something like Serial dramas on Filipino television would be the best place to merge these several articles; it seems we may have articles about several of these coined terms. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Neologism. Google scholar and JSTOR search show zero publications that even mention "eggcorns." What this article describes falls, more or less, more appropriately in the article about <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mondegreen.html" title="Mondegreen">mondegreens</a>. The claim that eggcorns "make sense" while mondegreens do not is not (and can not objectively be) borne out empirically and goes completely unmentioned in the links provided (three of which are blogs). The examples can be moved to the mondegreen article. It's possible that the term <i>eggcorn</i> can be mentioned, but a whole article is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> appropriate on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 06:06, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you elaborate on what your search criterion was? "eggcorn" gets 153,000 hits and "egg corn" gets 32,100 but those could include many actual mispellings of something as eggcorn or egg corn.

<dd>In a Language Log post of April 9, 2004, Mark Liberman noted that there were around 200 Google hits for "egg corn" and "eggcorn". I don't think thousands of people started misspelling something else as "eggcorn" in the last 2.5 years; the huge increase is due to the currency that the concept has achieved in that short period.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> These examples cannot be merged to the mondegreen article. According to Wikipedia's mondegreen article:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>"A mondegreen...is the mishearing...of a phrase in such a way that it <b>acquires a new meaning</b>."<sup id="_ref-emphasis_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emphasis" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>One of the ones that was brought up when discussing this point on the eggcorn talk page was "there's a bathroom on the right," a mondegreen for "there's a bad moon on the rise." Both phrases make sense, but the mondegreen doesn't make sense as a substitution for the actual line. "There's a bathroom on the right" means something considerably differnt than "there's a bad moon on the rise".</dd>
<dd>While eggcorns fit two out of three of distinguishing features of malapropisms, they don't fit all three. According to the wikipedia <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropism</a> article, the first distinguishing feature of a malapropism is:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>"The word used means <b>something different</b> from the word (as indicated by the context in which the word was used) the speaker or writer intended to use." <sup id="_ref-emphasis_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emphasis" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>What makes the eggcorn different, at least from my understanding, is that "the new phrase makes sense on some level". "old-timer's disease" for "Alzheimer's disease" is not a mondegreen. You can't really say that "old-timer's disease" has a different meaning than "Alzheimer's disease". These are phrases that could be substituted for each other in many places--unlike mondegreens where the substitutions don't make sense or people don't know that they don't make sense because song lyrics often never do. This can't be merged into the malapropism article--this phrase doesn't mean something different than the original phrase--not as indicated by the context--not in any context. In fact, "old-timer's disease" and most of the other eggcorn's are most similar to deliberate misnomers.<br /></dd>
<dd>But let's take a harder one like eggcorn. Eggcorn is a misspelling for acorn and acorns are egg shaped. The "egg corn" example can't be merged into malapropism, "egg corn" does not "[have] a recognized meaning in the speaker's or writer's language." Nor can it be merged into mondegreen--there was no mishearing, this is a written example and there is no difference in meaning. Neither of these examples can be merged into either the malapropism or mondegreen article.<br /></dd>

<dd>Oh, and in re references, LexisNexis totally kicks Google's butt. This is just a quick list of what I found by searching LexisNexis for eggcorn, but it should be more than sufficent to stop this deletion proposal. I provided links at the bottom, but they're lexis-nexis ones.<br /></dd>

<dd>I forgot to include a couple things in my previous comment.</dd>
<dd>Malapropisms just refer to words and not phrases--another reason the eggcorn article can't be merged into the malapropism article.</dd>
<dd>This isn't a neologism--there is no definition for this type of linguistic mistake. This isn't a type of mondegreen or malapropism--and it is only similar to them to "sounds like" rule of thumb that these definitions all follow. But mondegreens have to be mishearings and malapropisms have a number of limitations and this definition really fills in a missing space.</dd>
<dd>I don't know if this definition will stand up to the test of time--it is a very recent word and definition and while it has garnered some recognition, I have no idea whether or not it will be widly recognized or incorperated into speaking English. But, that's not the Wikipedia standard. If you feel that this is too new of a word for the article to not have mention of it, then mention it. We have lots of pop culture articles--the word has some recognition, this isn't a word used by one blogger, and it isn't replacing any other word so the wiki standard for article existence is much lower. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 11:35, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>Well, for starters, if this discussion continues, can we move it to the eggcorn talk page. I watch that to, so feel free to reply to me there. This doesn't really belong here. Also, I reverted that--that reference was already on there and you added it again. I think that putting a couple lines for each link is sorta unnecessary--I like a small description or something if it's an additional reference that doesn't have a specific point, but I think it's too much otherwise. Also, which pages asked you for login links. Everything is now non lexisnexis except for one case where lexisnexis is provided as an <i>additional</i> link.

<li><b>Keep</b> The eggcorn article shouldn't be merged with the malapropism article because eggcorns make sense in context while malapropisms don't. And this distinction is indeed mentioned prominently on the "About" page of the Eggcorns Database -- the very first of the three links mentioned in Aeusoes1's original proposal for deletion. Here's the relevant excerpt from the Database page:</li>
</ul>
<p>"The criteria of how to identify eggcorns have also been clarified. Not every homophone substitution is an eggcorn. The crucial element is that the new form makes sense: for anyone except lexicographers or other people trained in etymology, more sense than the original form in many cases." <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/about/" class="external free" title="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/about/" rel="nofollow">http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/about/</a> --<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstmere_82cd.html" title="User:Estmere">estmere</a> 07:28, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a very useful term that has caught on very quickly among both linguists and hobbyists alike. I wouldn't mind merging the content into another article, but it would be completely out of place at the mondegreen article since typical usage of the terms is completely different (although it's true that at the fringes of either there are similarities). --<a href="../../../d/l/u/User%7EDlugar_502f.html" title="User:Dlugar">Dlugar</a> 01:31, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a> merely says that articles shouldn't attempt to "track the emergence and use of the term", e.g. the article shouldn't try to be the equivalent of <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/" class="external text" title="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/" rel="nofollow">The Eggcorn Database</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the sign of a useful neologism is its adoption by those discussing the phenomenon as a shorthand.

<dd>That is actually only one source: an entry in the All Music Guide copied to Billboard, VH1, and presumably MTV. Even supposing that it be perfect reliable, it is not sufficient to support this article. There is no information at all on the Rolling Stones website, and Amazon and Billboard.com discographies have no information about the band, and albums for any band can be found there by the tens or hundreds of thousands. If I had spent the 4 minutes finding this, I would still have nominated it. When the Wikipedia article is 5 times longer than the whole body of independently published text in all the world on the subject, there is a problem. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 08:05, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong WTF Keep</b> I never thought I'd see the day when Screeching Weasel was up for deletion. Notable band with a long history, lots of records, and tons of media attention. Want proof? Look no further than Google: mentioned in a number of books, such as <i>Turn That Down!: A Hysterical History of Rock, Roll, Pop, Soul, International Who's Who in Popular Music, The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rock Music in American Popular Culture II, Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Explosion and the Music of the 90s, A History of Rock Music: 1951-2000, Sonic Cool: The Life &amp; Death of Rock 'n' Roll, Punk e hardcore (in Spanish), Punk Rock: So What?</i>, and others. Google News has 210 press articles on the band including Chicago Sun-Times, New York Times, and many others, using adjectives including "great", "influential", "legendary" and "iconic" to describe the band. There is no way any reasonable person can claim Screeching Weasel do not pass WP:MUSIC on a number of counts. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Rather obvious <b>keep</b> I think, as per <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a>.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Usually the thing to do when an article lacks sources is to <i>go and get them</i> rather than put the article up for deletion. <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> got some vital links to sources in just about the amount of time it would have taken to put the article up for deletion!

<li><b>comment</b> I think some unnecessary incivility is being directed toward Centrx, he requested sources be added several weeks ago and none were forthcoming, but that doesn't mean the onus is on him to bring the article up to par.

<p>This is a program broadcast on Bristol student radio. As student clubs, societies, and media are not generally considered notable per consensus, and this subset would be even less so. There is little assertion of notability, but I felt it preferable to bring to AfD rather than speedy as someone obviously put a lot of time creating this article. I also take the opportunity to propose two student DJs of the program. The articles are probable breaches of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>, the author is one <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chiosso_6c48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chiosso">Chiosso</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I feel that the allegations aimed at this article are somewhat unfair. 'Conflict of interest' - this article does not aim to promote anything whatsoever, least of all the show itself, or the University of Bristol. 'Notability' - Wikipedia seeks to style itself as something of a "People's Encyclopaedia" (please note correct spelling), and it is, without doubt, an addition to this, and certainly does not cheapen, nor detract from, this goal. Finally, as has been noted above, a great deal of time and effort has been put into this article, and to delete it reeks of real petty-mindedness. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nick boite (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nick_boite_1b80.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nick boite">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Nick boite (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nick_boite_1b80.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nick boite">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I thought one of the main points of Wikipedia was that it didn't have to only contain articles concerning subjects that are large enough to warrant a professional author's research. The beauty of Wikipedia is that it <i>can</i> contain articles on any subject, no matter how obscure, so that the few people who <i>do</i> want to read it can find it. Obviously, poorly written, offensive, unreliable or untrue articles must be removed and so must any deemed advertisements or those which have ulterior motives. However, this article falls into none of those categories, and deleting it simply because it is "not notable enough" seems to completely undermine the philosophy of a free and user-edited encyclopaedia. Removing articles such as this just detract from Wikipedia's main competitive advantage over other encyclopaediae. <s>Chiosso 11:26, 21 December 2006 (GMT)</s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 170.252.64.1 (<a href="../../../1/7/0/User_talk%7E170.252.64.1.html" title="User talk:170.252.64.1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_170.252.64.1_7069.html" title="Special:Contributions/170.252.64.1">contribs</a>).</small>

<p><b>Reason the page should be deleted</b>: This article is not suitable for Wikipedia. It is a long description of a single politically motivated talk show segment. The decription combined with the reply from an advocacy organization turn Wikipedia into a soapbox. See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>.<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 08:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p><b>Arguement for keeping</b>: The title "parody" is probably a misnomer, he is not a comedian he acted like he was for forcing American-Muslims to have special identification marks to gauge his audience's reaction.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>On charge of Soapbox:</b> in accord with wiki-standards (<a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a>) the article is obviously not "advertising"; nor "writing in self-promotion", so that leaves "Propaganda or advocacy". Nowhere in the article are any views expressed that are not in referenced quotations. No action is advocated, all quotes are properly sourced and can not be described as propaganda. The claim of violation of these wiki-standards is at odds with the definitions those standards present.</dd>
<dd><b>Notability:</b>The story has appeared on four continents. In North America by many papers printing the Reuters story, in Europe by the “BBC and Channel 4 in England” and the London newspaper “The Guardian”; in South Asia by the “The Brunei Times” of Darussalam, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunei.html" title="Brunei">Brunei</a>; and in Africa by the "Mail &amp; Guardian" of South Africa, and the "Daily News" of South Africa.</dd>
<dd><b>Notability Update:</b> It was most recently mentioned in a review of significant events for Muslims in 2006 by The Milli Gazette of India on Dec. 23rd.</dd>
<dd><b>Links to other wiki-pages:</b> The topic was first brought up on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> wiki-page in the post 06:56, 3 December 2006 Ibnraza (Talk | contribs) (→Efforts against Islamophobia - 630 WMAL talk show hoax) and the article now under consideration provides greater background to that information and is linked to from that page. The page is also linked from the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Imams_controversy_28c9.html" title="Flying Imams controversy">Flying Imams controversy</a> which was the reason behind the experiment. The article in question shows that the radio host received comments on both sides of the issue to gauge if Americans were willing to use force on American-Muslims to make them receive tattoos or wear arm-bands analogous to the activities of the Nazis during World War II. Some called for American-Muslims to be placed in internment camps. This information about how some Americans are turning on others during a war with terrorist Muslim theocrats seems historically notable. Especially in light of the Quran Oath Controversy of the 110th Untied States Congress where Rep. Goode has attacked Rep-elect Ellison for his desire to use the Quran during the swearing in ceremonies as a threat to "the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America” and saying “I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies”.--<a href="../../../w/o/w/User%7EWowaconia_eb5e.html" title="User:Wowaconia">Wowaconia</a> 22:28, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I am based in England, so if this US-event made BBC, Channel 4 and the Guardian then it is certainly notable in my opinion (but also a depressing sign of the times). Recently over here MP <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Straw_%28politician%29_822f.html" title="Jack Straw (politician)">Jack Straw</a> started a huge controversy about Muslim women wearing veils - heard about this? anyway - this led to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_debate_over_veils_63fb.html" title="United Kingdom debate over veils">United Kingdom debate over veils</a>, so I see the two controversies as equally deserving of separate articles. By all means create Jerry Klein, but this event merits it's own domain. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipidian_2724.html" title="User:Wikipidian">Wikipidian</a> 02:15, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article offers a number of reputable sources which deal exclusively with the article's topic which serves to meet verifiability and notability requirements. There doesn't seem to be any legitimate reason for deletion. The event seems to have gotten itself quite a bit of attention in more than one country. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, notability of host/radio station is of comparatively little importance compared with the fact of, and the nature of, the public response. As <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<li><b>strong keep</b>. I heard about this from some news outlet long before I saw it on wikipedia article. It is clearly notable and verifiable.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>: My first suggestion is to create Jerry Klein first and <i>then</i> mentioning the incident of this parody there. Surely he's notable himself? But even if this is not renamed, it should'nt be deleted.

This incident is definitely notable and very famous. And now when I read this article, yes I've heard of this incident before.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Cheetah Girls have confirmed this album. This is not different when The Pussycat Dolls had a "Second studio album" page.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have removed the rumored tracks section and added citaions and more information about the album, and as I said above, i could move everything back to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheetahs_Gonna_Get_Down_d7bb.html" title="Cheetahs Gonna Get Down">Cheetahs Gonna Get Down</a>, which was once the title of the album, but since it is no longer that, I believe it would not be informational and confusing.

<dd>My apologies.. what I meant to say, is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> addresses the issue more succinctly. To be notable, "It[he/she] has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable. This criterion includes published works in all forms... except...publications where the musician/ensemble talks about themselves." The only source listed is an interview, thus that criteria for inclusion is not met. The only other one within <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> That has been brought up, is "Has won or placed in a major music competition," so it seems that this discussion ought to come down to either determining whether X-Factor is a "major" competition, and whether finishing third overall counts towards the intended spirit of "win or place." As for that, I must say I am now sitting on the fence. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 10:54, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For example: "He states his musical influences as Joe Cocker, Tom Waits, Rod Stewart and David Bowie and some of his favourite artists are Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Dire Straits, and James Brown. He classes Jim Morrison as a legend." This information is unsourced, and does not seem particularly pertinent, unless a third party source has expressed that these statements are notable in some way.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Satisfies major music competition clause (as per above), precedent established by entries from previous series of the competition - eg Journey South - as well as entries from other similarly sized competitions - eg American Idol - see Chris Daughtry entry (4th place). Concerns noted by some discussants regarding citations/references easily rectifiable, traceable to notable and credible sources (as demonstrated by copious editing post-submission for deletion by entry convenors). As noted by previous discussant, artist currently popular in the UK and more notable than a number of soap celebrities which have their own entries and many people are interested in finding out more about him. Advocate strongly for retention as not only is entry justified by satisfaction of Wiki policy but also that precedents have been established for entries of this nature.

<dd>An album is currently in the pipeline and Ben is sufficiently famous in the UK. He recently performed with a line-up of the best British comedians and had a rousing response. If there is no record by the time the next season of the X Factor comes along, then the entry can always be removed but as stated earlier, precedents have been estbalished for this sort of entry.

<li><b>Comment</b> - But why does anyone wants an article with the details and functions of an unknown product? Maybe it looks like an ad but without mentioning the brand (silvercrest) of the receiver this is of no use to anyone. This shouldn't be deleted because there's no other article of wikipedia regarding this FTA receiver and it is very difficult for people to find a good structured information on google about this. <a href="../../../a/r/p/User_talk%7EArpcpro_74d8.html" title="User talk:Arpcpro">AR PcPro</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arpcpro_1409.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arpcpro">contribs</a>) 18:10, 15 December 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is about a product range from a single retail chain. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a catalogue. Under no circumstances should this article be merged with that of the retail chain: we don't detail products carried by other stores, nor should we here. To suggest, as an earlier participant in this discussion has, that this article shouldn't be deleted because there's no other article about this product in Wikipedia is to entirely misunderstand what encyclopedias are for. My own view is that this is an obvious "speedy". <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 20:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/Cleanup</b> useful product information, I doubt its advertising since real advertisers would do a better job with the article. --64.230.127.234 21:41, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree that the encyclopaedia is not a catalog. But when I search for something on an encyclopaedia I expect to find information about it, whatever the matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven’t understood yet why you want to delete this. If it’s because it could be advertising in that case let’s also delete all articles with individual products of several brands. For example when I search for <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nokia_6630.html" title="Nokia 6630">Nokia 6630</a> it’s advertising to Nokia isn’t it???? Or if I search for Sony <a href="../../../v/a/i/VAIO_06cb.html" title="VAIO">VAIO</a>…But let’s suppose it is advertising and I’m here promoting this item. If someone specifically searches for it, then it is because it wants to know information about it, either with the intention of buying it or not. And my view is that the role of an encyclopaedia is to provide information to people. Plus this receiver is not sold exclusively on that particular chain. It’s a Comag receiver sold on many satellite stores around.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think, the matter is if this article must be deleted or not. But not rewritten (perhaps made more accurate, or little changes)... If we look for what means <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a> I find the following:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>-An encyclopedia, encyclopaedia or (traditionally) encyclopædia,[1] is a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, I find that this article gives <b>knowledge</b> about a specific product, quite popular in the <i>Satellite receivers world</i>, and whose info available in the net, is spread and confuse. I found this article in the net, and was very useful for me... OK... I can accept an "traditional" encyclopedia is not a catalogue, but Wikipedia is not a traditional one. It has pages with thousands of "devices", like cameras&#160;: <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_XL-2_c462.html" title="Canon XL-2">Canon_XL-2</a>, computers&#160;: <a href="../../../i/c/u/Icube.html" title="Icube">Icube</a>, Mobile phones <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nokia_6230.html" title="Nokia 6230">Nokia_6230</a>, cars <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seat_Ibiza_3492.html" title="Seat Ibiza">Seat_Ibiza</a>.... And so on.... is TRULY easy to find popular brand+model items on wikipedia, and they offer knowledge about popular devices, products, items of our life.... When a item is not popular enough to appear on wikipedia? I don't know ... It its because lack of popularity.... Someone can explain me why those products mobile phones/cars can be on wikipedia, and this not?? .... Nevertheless... I think is OBVIOUSLY not an ADVERTISEMENT, even is difficult to find/buy itself because their marketing techniques... and it uses a very objective language --</p>

<li>Inbound links are not a justification in any way. If they were, then our vandals would simply crosslink their names from all the "bands" they formed. There are no actual claims in the article of notability, as each of the listed accomplishments is certainly admirable but not actually a position of leadership, public fame, or superior placement in the field.

<li><b>Comment</b> this seems a gray area to me. Several companies started, some authorship, inward links, all together suggest notability. I would tend to favour shading toward delete if the subject is a longstanding contributor who wants not to have it (that's not an open and shut reason, but a shading). But I'm seeing enough notability to build a case for keep barring that. Note that a speedy was in my view, not warranted. This is an area where some discussion would be of benefit. withhold opinion barring more information. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:36, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The subject of the article tagged this for speedy deletion, as he recognized, as others did, that the article fails WP:BIO, and he didn't write it or want it. The article was speedy deleted because it literally makes no claim to notability, which is a perfectly valid A7. Undeletion should not have taken place without the use of WP:DRV, which is a place that <i>all users</i> must employ, not just non-administrators, as there the validity of the A7 deletion could have been assessed. So, we have another week for outside sites to gather up personal details about a Wikipedian, another week of potential abuse. I'm not sure "HTH" or how this will allow anyone to "HAND."

<li><b>Delete</b>. Per Geogre. Theo Clarke (the wikipedian) is entitled to his privacy. If he wanted it kept he would add further information to display his notability, he has not. He has expressed surprise that he is considered notable (not false modesty but genuine surprise) he has asserted the wish this page be deleted, and in this case his wishes should be respected. .<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 07:14, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, I'm fairly sympathetic to Giano's statement above. However, it would be a <i>major</i> change of policy to decide (a) that bio subjects are entitled to their privacy, and (b) the wishes of the subject are to be a consideration. As it stands, Wikipedia has rejected both those principles. (See <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Beesley_5b39.html" title="Angela Beesley">Angela Beesley</a>). As I say, I somewhat warm to these ideas in cases of marginal notability. However, I reject the idea of special treatment for our Wikipedian friends. Either this bio stands (or is deleted), like others, on its notability/verifiability, or we make a major change policy for all bios.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 09:12, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Doc is right, of course, and I did not mean to imply that this was a "Right to vanish" case that was up against demonstrated notability. Rather, I felt that the article's contents indicated a very successful career, but not one that had achieved break out "note," and that this <i>combined with</i> the subject not wanting the article to remain (or get userfied) made this a clearer <i>speedy</i> delete. (I.e. something on the fence like this should generally never be a speedy delete, as the authors and subjects are almost surely going to protest, and reasonably, but, here, we had no one stepping up on behalf of the article, except Phil Bosworth, and his actions were irregular.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:46, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think that AfD was the right route here. Previous precedent is that the subject's request is NOT a valid consideration. I think we're reaching a fairly ground-breaking agreement that it is (if not a major one). I welcome that. But when something is as debatable as this, an open discussion is probably better than a quiet speedy (although I understand the motives of the speedy). However, Phil's actions were perfectly valid - speedies are really for open and shut cases; any admin should feel free to undelete any speedy and send to afd. I suppose he could have taken it to DRV instead - but then we'd just be having this same discussion in another forum. (And a forum which might well, in turn, have sent it back here).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 13:18, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article at the time of the speedy made no serious claim to notability. That being said, I actually looked at this when it was so tagged and, purely on the face of the multiple but individually non-notable claims, chickened out and went to softer targets. So <b>Endorse balls-y deletion</b> since that should be the venue that this is being discussed in. The article as it stands still makes no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">cited</a> claim to notability, and as such should be deleted unless more evidence is introduced. Nothing to do with "niceness" or "mateship" here, but in the event that it was a line ball, we should be nice to everyone as long as we retain our integrity. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 10:41, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, borderline notability, as admitted by the subject. Angela and Daniel B (no, not me, the <i>other</i> one) were, in my opinion, substantially more notable than this. I would have probably not been inclined to give my opinion if the subject wasn't requesting deletion - just another AfD bio - and if I had of, it probably would have been a weak delete. However, the borderline notability coupled with the expressed wish of the subject, who is acting in a decent way, has swung my&#160;!vote. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">T</a>&#160;·&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel.Bryant_a73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel.Bryant">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 10:51, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>An important distinction to make, and well-stated.

<li>Agree with delete, disagree with speedy tagging, because the article subject is borderline enough notable (there doesn't need to be a literal statement "This subject is notable" for the article to assert notability, you know) that this was NOT a clear cut speedy.

<p>I prodded this page yesterday and left an explanatory note to the creator, User:Drummerboykyle. He then modified the article to make the subject ten years older and added a ref to a ten year old magazine that is itself difficult to verify, plus some additional claims of notability. It appears to be a fanciful <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">autobiography</a>. I can find no evidence of the claims he makes to fame--particularly that he is an international music star involved with bands that also appear to be <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">unnotable</a> or that he has written scholarly articles. As such, I would urge a <b>delete</b> for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiability</a> unless I've missed something. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 16:19, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was speedy closure, with no prejudice against an immediate trip back to AfD with a nomination by someone who actually wants the article deleted. I'm not going to comment on the bad faith, meatpuppet, and other accusations, but it's generally best to leave an AfD nomination to whoever does want an article deleted.

<li>KoS's Beard, just to make clear and expand on what I said on my talk page: I don't <i>know</i> whether this article should be deleted. The reason is, I don't know whether there are good sources out there. I did a cursory look, found none, and that's why I put the tags on the article. It is reasonable to think that the regular contributor/s to the article (in this case, you) are more likely to know where to find good sources than anyone else (including me). The point of the tags is not to be rude or to defile the article but to alert the contributors that they need to find sources. If you understand what I'm saying, please withdraw this nomination, because it is <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupting Wikipedia to make a point</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:11, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reading the first debate, I'm leaning towards delete. The concerns were not addressed. Some had an <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> stance, some wanted to keep the article because "WP:WEB is not policy, so it has no relevance".

<li><b>Comment</b>: Those recommending to keep are correct in stating <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not a <i>policy</i>. However, it is still a <i>guideline</i>, which does carry more weight in an AfD discussion than a generalized statement calling for its ignoring. To quote <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, the main notability guideline: <i>It is generally accepted among editors and is considered a standard that all users should follow.</i> Likewise, <i>One notability criterion shared by nearly all of the subject-specific notability guidelines, as well as Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not, is the criterion that a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</i> Look at other AfDs: a majority of the decision to keep and delete is based on such notability guidelines; while not policy, they provide an accepted barometer for whether a site is reasonably covered in third-party sources to be included herein. Any reasonable administrator will ignore, rightfully so, recommendations which simply state <i><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not policy, so it doesn't matter</i>, as they come off as <i>well, the guideline doesn't work for us, so let's give ourselves a free pass here</i>. Rather than simply stating that obvious truth, those recommending to keep are advised to find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> indicating if and how the notability guidelines are met. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 16:59, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The arguments were laid out at length last time and there was a clear decision to keep.

Even if <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not a policy (a guideline but still), it is often used to show notability or non-notability on Wikipedia's deletion process, and saying that this article should be kept because it isn't a policy is not a valid arguement. Instead, try to find something to help you prove that this website might pass one of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s criteria, but until then there is no reason for this to be kept. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 23:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keepish Comment.</b> I don't have a passionate interest in this in any direction. But it seems to me that two things have happened: one is that, the first time this article was nominated for deletion, the final decision was to keep the article in Wikipedia; the other, which <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxwoman_c5ae.html" title="User:Taxwoman">Taxwoman</a> has pointed out, is that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> has been specifically demoted from policy to a guideline. I don't track the Wipipedia website; but it seems to me that such a website, in the half year or so that has passed since this article first survived a deletion nomination, would have <i>grown</i>, not shrunk, in whatever worthiness it had to be mentioned in its own Wikipedia article. I'm too busy right now to keep on following this discussion in detail; but I offer these points for consideration.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Many articles are listed, relisted, and listed again at AfD; most of these are good-faith attempts to benefit the project, and this appears to be one of those cases. To say that <i>it was kept once already, so it should be kept again</i> is circular logic: if indeed the article should be kept this time as well, there should be valid arguments to that point, rather than the simple fact that it did survive a previous attempt for <i>x</i> reason. Establishing a consensus, and reaffirming that consensus, hardly constitutes double jeopardy; the quality of the article can change over time, facts about the subject of the article can change over time, and so on, and comparing the article then to the article now may ultimately be comparing apples and oranges, rather than (to continue the example) "trying the same article twice". Regardless, bear in mind that double jeopardy or anything to that effect is not a policy, nor is it a guideline. Notability, however, is a guideline, and regardless of the outcome of the first AfD and/or the reason the original administrator closed it as a keep, the article should be able to (but as far as I can see, does not) stand on its own merits... and I will repeat myself: those recommending to keep are advised to find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> indicating if and how the notability guidelines are met. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 18:55, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> One of the test for notability is that the contenst should be republished. The wipipedia is republished in its entirity on Informed Consent. Informed Consent (according to Alexa) is the UKs largest (non porn) BDSM website. Informed Consent is a non trivial website dealing with issues relevent to the subject of BDSM. Within the world of alternative sexuality Informed Consent is as serious as it gets (BTW this is kinky sex we are talking about, the wipipedia is never going to be repubished in Nature!). <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 21:33, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>What is wrong with that. In my opinion IC is a notable site, for a webbsite to be in the top 15,000 worldwide would give it the same reach as a regional newapaper's website. That is a popular site by any definition. Again, this is a specialist field, many specialist scientific sites would not get into the top 250,000 that does not make them not notable. You have also not given any specific reasons why you think it is not notable nor have you offered examples of what you would consider notable sites in the field of BDSM. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 22:35, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>This still does not make it an "online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster", which means it has no content that would be labeled as official by any means. I believe I provided enough examples above to why it doesn't pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and I consider any website that doesn't that doesn't meet it as a non-notable website. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 22:51, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am still not sure why you consider that IC is not an online magazine, it published articles and listings, it provides a non trivial forum (yes, there are also trivial posts as well!) for discussion of the subject matter of BDSM. This meets my definition of a magazine. I am not sure what do you mean by <i>labeled as official</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are two issues. One is the notability of the site. This was established in the last AfD, and nobody has provided any evidence that it has become less notable since. The other is the overall good of Wikipedia. Even if a case could be made for deleting the article, this would damage Wipipedia, and therefore Wikipedia which increasingly is getting content from Wipipedia rather than vice versa. And if the zealous application of the letter of the law would damage Wikipedia, then it is our duty to apply <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and keep the article.--<a href="../../../o/s/i/User%7EOsidge_c9f6.html" title="User:Osidge">Osidge</a> 21:55, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

We don't keep it articles because deleting them might damage their subject, and the fact that Wikipedia takes content from Wipipedia is ridiculous and has nothing to do with this AfD. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 22:07, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I disagree, notability was established, hence the keep result. No arguments were given as to why IC (the basis for passing the test) was not notable apart from unsupported assertions that it was not. The people making the assertions appeared to have little knowledge of the BDSM scene (correct me if I am wrong)and therefore are not best placed to give an informed opinion on the subject. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 11:46, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can't help but feel that we are going around in circles with this argument. I maintain that the site is notable for reasons already stated and you maintain that for reasons already stated it is not&#160;:-). The problem I feel is due in a large part to the subject matter, BDSM is never going to have sources of sufficient gravitas to satisfy the purists. This is because it is a sexual activity that many people feel is wrong and whose practices would fall foul of every health and safety code going. Personally I think that many of the current articles about BDSM should not be on the Wikipedia as the website is used by minors (but this is a separate argument). Within the BDSM community the Wipipedia is published on two of the largest UK BDSM websites and has supplied content for the Wikipedia. The article on the Wipipedia is not very good but I am sure it will be improved. In the end someone will have to make a call as to if the article is adding value to the Wikipedia or not. P.S.

Anyway, there deserves to be an article on this wiki. As for whether this article is good enough to keep, that's another thing altogehter.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Just being an indy wrestler should not automatically make a subject <i>non-notable</i>. As far as indy wrestlers go, my impression is that he is notorious, if nothing else, and that places him above the undistinguished masses of people just "waiting for a break", even if he's not at the highest level of indy notability. If his article lacks mention of his notability, it should be added rather than deleting the article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffg_946b.html" title="User:Geoffg">Geoffg</a> 03:29, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> Sorry, no bigotry intended. Of course there should be information about Arianism on Wikipedia, which was an important movement in the early church.

<dd>Dear KHM03, I speak as a queer [intergendered/khoti] black [practising and rather religious] RC and I have to disagree with the assertion that Arianism was incompatible with the early Church [which would be properly called Orthodox rather than Catholic/Orthodox or <i>Church of the East and the West</i> as it is now by (presumably) polite convention]; in fact St. Jerome's famous quote bears witness to the appeal of Arianism in the early Church, "The world awoke and <i>groaned</i> to find itself Arian!" That the tide eventually turned in favour of the Trinity had as much [if not more] to do with Roman imperial pressure [which in itself would render episcopal conformity suspect if not invalid] as with the moving of the Holy Spirit...one cannot but notice that the Christian Trinity is at least a partial [if not radical] departure from the strict monotheism of the Abrahamic tradition represented by the Samaritan, Jewish, Sabian, Islamic and Baha'i faiths. [Christian] Scripture itself, is remarkably silent with respect to a doctrine of such importance and if we believe it as Roman Catholics and apostolic Christians, we do so inspite of logic, scriptural witness and ourselves. Jesus [or Yeshua bin Yusuf as He was known in His own language] made very few [if any] recognisable claims with respect to His own divinity and seems to have been more concerned with the good news and meek simplicity of Love than with complicated doctrines of three persons [or Persons] in one God with the Second Person having two natures - divine and human and <i>hypostatically</i> united - AND the Third Person <i>proceeding</i> BOTH from the Father and the Son [and not only from the Father like the Orthodox and our common scriptures maintain]...matter-of-fact, He goes far enough in the canonical gospels to rebuke one of his disciples saying, 'Why do you call me good for only God is good'...additionally, according to my own RC faith, the test of a doctrine is <b>ecclesial reception</b> which means that the <b>central magisterium</b> [id est, Rome] can propound doctrines till kingdom come but the test of its validity is its reception by the <i>whole</i> church [id est, all Christians of all times] and some of our theologians would argue that it would need reception by the triumphant [or resurrected] church at the end of time to truly meet the criterion of full ecclesial reception. One must also note with respect to the parallel discussion on RC 'idolatry' that our veneration of images not only sets us apart from nearly all other Abrahamic monotheistic faiths but also from our own RC iconoclastic forbears and popes who would have destroyed all of our sacred images if they hadn't been hidden and guarded by Franciscan and Carmelite monks [and cloistered nuns]; loyalty to my own tradition does not prevent me from seeing how Catholic crucifixes and Ezidi images could give offence to other children of Abraham [and perhaps to the Gnostics]. Having said that, there is a remarkable consensus among the Apostolic Churches with respect to the Trinity inspite of the mathematical impossibility of 1=3 equations; also, for a Church to call itself Catholic or Orthodox, demonstrable apostolic succession would perhaps be at least as important as considerations of ecclesial reception of [Arian/Trinitarian/Nestorian/Monophysite] theological doctrines. The Holy Qu'ran clearly says that Jesus was the Messiah but not God and there are more than a billion Muslims who would [with good reason] dispute the accuracy of ALL the Christian pages in Wikipedia...it would be a pity if they were deleted on those grounds. The Hindus have a Sanskrit saying about God: Neti, neti [not this and not that: which corresponds more or less to the Augustinian Catholic position on our God]. Although it is rather late in the day now to cut a long story short, I would like to apologise for dragging this out [and for any hurt I may have caused] and request KHM03 not to delete, move or mark the Arian Catholic page [for deletion]. My given name is Pratap Patrick Paikaray altho' my queer pseudonym is Pratibha Rani Sixer but that's quite enough of my rambling already. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasimir_Declan_O%27Conchobhar_9939.html" title="User:Casimir Declan O'Conchobhar">Casimir Declan O'Conchobhar</a> 06:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable free MMORPG. The entire article seems to be original research; there are no reliable sources (every source is either a personal blog or from the creators of the game). No notability is established by any of the sources. In addition, the article is poorly written, overly long (50 kb), filled with unencyclopedic content (lists of game content, etc), and appears to be full of fancruft. All in all, a pretty bad article that I think needs to go. <span style="plainlinks"><a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoogy_5100.html" title="User:Moogy"><font color="black"><b>Moogy</b></font></a> <font size="-3"><sup><a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoogy_ec12.html" title="User talk:Moogy"><b><font color="red">(</font><font color="black">talk</font><font color="red">)</font></b></a></sup></font></span> 21:12, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One of the things that distinguishes Wikipedia from other encyclopedias (like Britannica) is that Wikipedia has articles on nearly everything, not just things editors find important. Therefore, we shouldn't delete it just because it is a "Non-notable free MMORPG."</p>
<p>The second argument is that the article is mostly first-hand opinion. This is easy to fix: There have been plenty of online reviews of MapleStory which can validate or refute those authors' claims.</p>
<p>The final argument for deletion is that the article doesn't cite sources. Instead of outright deleting articles written by careless authors, we could easily find sources and add them to the article (similar to problem two). This would help further show the world the value of a free, user-edited encyclopedia.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveSims_3c81.html" title="User:SteveSims">SteveSims</a> 03:36, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is generally because no experienced editors (OK, wrong word, but "editors who use references for their edits" is too long) have wanted to edit the article. It's extremely easy to find sources - Google News has 9 sources, then you have sites like GameSpot and IGN. I'm not surprised this article was nominated (it's not in the BEST condition, albeit a lot better than other), but the nominator could've done a small search on Google and would've realized the possibilities are endless.

<li>Most of the articles on Wikipedia are not cited at all. Lack of citations is <i>not</i> a reason to bring an article to Afd. Editors should first actually try to find sources rather than nom every article they see that has not been sourced yet. It is a waste of everyone's time when notable subjects are brought to Afd because editors are lazy and/or want to prove a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's obviously notable, verifiable, etc. But the article itself needs some serious work - as an example, the supposed "Criticisms" section is almost unintelligible to someone (like me) who hasn't played the game, which gives me the impression that the article is not written in an encyclopedic fashion (in an proper encyclopedia article, a "criticism" section would address third-party criticism, not just petty complaints by fans.

<p>Jointly nominating this page as well as the arguably not quite as bad <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myth_World_Cup_48b4.html" title="Myth World Cup">Myth World Cup</a>. This is a perfect example of Wikipedia being used as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">a free webspace provider</a>. As far as I know these tournaments are not getting any third-party coverage. This is content suited for Myth fanpages and not an encyclopedia.

<li>Both articles have a fair amount of unencyclopedic content - I noted this on the talk page months ago.

<li><b>Delete both.</b> There's simply not enough <i>interesting</i> things to be said about these tournaments; if there is, it can easily be summarised in the <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myth_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Myth (computer game)">Myth (computer game)</a> article, with the external references. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:41, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myth_World_Cup_48b4.html" title="Myth World Cup">Myth World Cup</a> - the topic is notable and the content is verifiable, though it needs some more cleanup. The Tournaments article likewise has some encyclopedic content, but would need a lot of pruning.

<ul>
<li><i>debatable</i> I can see why the main tournaments page is open to question. The comment on third party support...there was a lot of sponsors out there but details are just too hazy, especially on who actually paid up with prizes at the end. I worked hard on that page so I'm biased, but I think that it should stay, or be adapted into a form we can hang on to. In the main Myth page we can't ignore tournaments altogether but the instant you mentioned a little it seemed impossible to fully describe without going into depth.</li>
</ul>
<p>MWC on the other hand, I feel absolutely should stay. Whatever happens to the other page, this series had a lot of competitors and is noteworthy because annual events that have so many different organisers are rare. Its one of the oldest surviving on-line gaming tournament series. (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Elfoid_abf0.html" title="User:The Elfoid">The Elfoid</a> 03:11, 27 December 2006 (UTC))</p>
<ul>
<li>Further note: I feel the MWC page has been vastly improved by clean-ups. Particularly what was done with images. I feel credits for the tournaments should be more extensive as before, but my word is not the final one here I suppose and I have to admit to being a fanboy who would take everything a step further than most others. Definitely keep it in some shape or form though. How many online gaming tournaments in 1999 had 96 teams of average 10 - 16 players in them? And how many games released in 1999 that had no official support after 2001 could organise a 32 man tournament come 2006? Its happened elsewhere I'm sure but is rare enough to be noteworthy.(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Elfoid_abf0.html" title="User:The Elfoid">The Elfoid</a> 03:17, 27 December 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li>Comment: Assuming it's not a "big misconception" to consider magazines on gaming and Macintosh as "third-party", the Myth World Cup event has verifiable third party coverage. Whether I've edited that article or not is irrelevant. (In fact, I've edited the World Cup article a total of twice, including once during this AfD.) As for the Tournaments article, yes I've edited it before, the last time being in May. I doubt many of these other tournaments have third party coverage, but I think the article's creator would be in a better position to know. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 04:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Websites like atomicgamer have done some coverage. Inside Mac Games advertises just about any tournament. There's the bungie community at large, including Bungie itself. A lot of information is out there. And while some tournament websites yes - info is hard to find...MWCs all have their official websites. MWC98, 99, 00, 01, 04, 06 all do. MWC05 just went down but existed at time of writing and may well return. MWC03's the only site not around, and when writing things I managed to access it in Archive.org.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into an article on the Paris Metro. I don't have a problem with this having an article on its own, Paris is notable as a city, thus many things in the city will be notable, including its metro system. Any article on its metro system should describe the stations, so the only question is, is it better to have that in one page, or several?

<dd>This article is a stub, but a discussion of the engineering, architecture and history of this station, particularly if someone can provide one or more photographs, could get fairly large. The advantage of having articles on each station is to allow better indexing and categorization, so that a link from another article would point directly to the station's article, not to a lengthy combined article on the entire subway line (this one is on Line 12) which many used would find difficult to navigate. This is why when an article gets longer than about 30 k, editors should try to split it up into several useful sub-articles. Given the precedent that exists for other subway stations, in Paris and elsewhere, I would invite the nominator to withdraw his nomination. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 04:13, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> While it may be true that subway stations can, generally speaking, be considered notable, this article contains, in addition to no sources or references other than a map which does not contain the facts cited in the article, no assertion whatsoever of this <i>particular</i> subway station's notability. Being named after a notable person is NOT enough to assert notability. Somewhat trivially, but relevantly, I could name my house after Martin Luther King. Houses, especially historical ones, can be notable, as can places named after notable people, but my house, even if it was so named, would nonetheless fail to be notable in any way. Even if my house was in New York City, for example, or another notable city, even that additional fact would fail to make the house itself notable. So it is, I think, with subway stations. If the information in this article is to be merged with an article about the various stations in the Paris subway system, I would have no problem with its inclusion in WP. However, no sourced statements have shown any assertion of enough notability to stand as an article alone, and I continue to argue for <b>Deletion</b>. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 06:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Note that this also means that the article, as it stands, fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, because it should, under the policy, "contain only material that has been published by reliable sources."

<dd>Unfortunately, I think part of the problem is that most of the information on this subway station is likely to be in French, not that there are no sources whatsoever.

<dd>Excuse me, but I did not say that there were no problems getting sources, since I did clearly say that the problem would be that those sources are French, but I believe it's obviously not an unsurmountable problem. All it will take is finding someone who reads both French and English. Since I'm not one of them, I don't feel I'll try to do it myself. But that doesn't change the fact that there are likely to be sources. It is a subway station, they are hardly undocumented. I don't know why that's so hard to realize, and that instead of calling for deletion, you would be better off calling for sourcing. Then, for example, someone who owns <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0738852481" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0738852481" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> might be inclined to look it up, and report its contents for us. Since I don't own the book though, and the relevant section is protected, I can't cite it myself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:46, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> We can argue about notability until we are blue in the face, and probably get nowhere. However, none of those above arguing for "keep" seem to take seriously the first, and probably stronger, claim of the nominator: that the article is <i>completely</i> unsourced, and so fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>! Take, for example, this, from the article: "The station opened in 1912." Suppose someone came along, and edited this to read "The station opened in 1913." Not being knowlegable about the topic myself, I cannot honestly decide which is correct. And without any sources cited, on what grounds could one argue that it must be changed back to 1912? Additionally, it has been suggested that the problem is that the sources are in french, not that they do not exist. This is a fine point: but the article still needs to cite existant sources, and no one has provided <i>any,</i> in french or otherwise. I do not claim that it is impossible to find sources for the article, and so it must be deleted. I claim that it is against policy that the article remain on WP without sources, and <i>so far,</i> none are forthcoming. If this changes, so will my <b>delete</b> opinion. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 00:22, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

(I was puzzled that the nominator chose that is the crux of their argument to delete). The first sentence of WP:V states "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source." The source currently cited is a map provided by the actual Chemin de Fer Métropolitain de Paris <a href="http://www.ratp.info/Proxi/proxi.php?lang=FRA&amp;Profil=RATP&amp;xCenter=600574&amp;yCenter=2432690&amp;nom_station=Jules%20Joffrin" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ratp.info/Proxi/proxi.php?lang=FRA&amp;Profil=RATP&amp;xCenter=600574&amp;yCenter=2432690&amp;nom_station=Jules%20Joffrin" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> (for the Paris Metro challenged, that's the government body that operates the Metro - I consider that a very reliable source on their own stations).

<li>That's not really a reason to delete the article, but rather should spur an attempt to find sources with the caveat that unsourced material may be deleted from the text.

<li>Ugh? You're muddling the concepts of deletion here. The station is inherently verifiable from the fact that it is on the RATP map. Sure, delete any unsourced material from the article you want, but the bottom line is that the station is verifiable.

</li>
<li>If you are determined to have this discussion center around the notability of the station, then so be it. The only arguments that have been presented for this stations notability are: 1) it is named after a notable person, 2) other subway stations have been determined notable, and 3) It is in a notable city. As I have argued above, none of these arguments successfully establishes the notability of the subject, and WP guidelines call for independent sources to verify notability. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 01:01, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, I think you misunderstood me. While a given station may not be much, I do think that Wikipedia, in order to be complete, should have information on them, since we are clearly going to have information on the New York City subway system. While I might have chosen to present the information in a list for each subway line, it seems that some people have already done a fairly extensive job of presenting them with their own individual articles. Since I don't think these articles shouldn't have their own article, I do not disagree with this choice. It seems well-done and informative, and you'd actually have to work to convince me otherwise, not just assert it. If anything, I'd like these articles expanded, including things like VR pictures of each station. That would be very interesting. So really, I don't think you agree with me at all. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Using the succession box, I just "rode" from terminus to terminus on Line 12 (more enjoyable than you'd think, but perhaps I'm terribly bored).

<p>'Criticism' of a particular person or organization as a standalone article without context is not a viable standalone wikipedia article, and may be slanderous/libelous. Taking criticism out of context of the larger discussion is misleading, and at any rate is a reproduction of the criticism section already included the articles of the respective underlying people/groups.

Why should we expect any different in the future. It still remains a Mere collections of internal links. This topic already has a (self-maintaining) category "ZX Spectrum clones", and serves the existing articles better being listed there. Replacing a prod tag with a cleanup tag without <i>any</i> corrective actions to the article and claiming you'll get around to next year does not change the fact this article fails inclusion criteria for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../h/u/1/User%7EHu12_d0ca.html" title="User:Hu12">Hu12</a> 10:36, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The nomination has no basis. This article is a structured list, and structured lists are specifically noted as an exception to the "Wikipedia articles are not mere collections of internal links." policy. The article is clearly not a directory of businesses or people; it is a list of personal computer models that satisfy a specific criterion, namely that they were clones of one specific type of personal computer. And that criterion is why the list is not indiscriminate, too. <b>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information." is not an indiscriminate criterion for deletion.</b> It is not a cosy catch-all shorthand for "I think that this article should be deleted.".
<p>The only real problem with the article is that the red-links provide temptation to create perpetual stubs. The proper way to develop this list is to add the descriptions to this list, and only give break-out articles to those computer models that actually have enough source material to warrant them. That is, however, a simple matter of cleanup (de-linking the redlinked names), and is not solved by deleting the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:34, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The List guideline requires that lists be a valuable information source and specifically notes "<i>This is particularly the case for a structured list</i>", <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ZX_Spectrum_clones_6cfa.html" title="List of ZX Spectrum clones">List of ZX Spectrum clones</a> does not meet this requirement and is in fact a duplicate (in article form) of a catagory with the same information. see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:ZX_Spectrum_clones" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:ZX_Spectrum_clones" rel="nofollow">Category:ZX Spectrum clones</a>. FWIW, in order to be exempt from "Mere collections of internal links" it would need to "<i>assist with the organisation of articles</i>" it clearly does not because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:ZX_Spectrum_clones" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:ZX_Spectrum_clones" rel="nofollow">Category:ZX Spectrum clones</a> satisfies that Purpose.

<li>So what exactly is the "policy" for a wikipedia entry? I thought this was a community-based encyclopedia, not a special club. There are far more useless entries on Wikipedia, I don't see how 50k of text is going to take up that much space on Wikipedia. Also, it isn't an attack page. The people being "attacked" are perfectly fine with the entry, and from now on I guess we'll stop purging unused accounts every 6 months in an effort to be "popular" enough for your blessed wikipedia.

<li>UPDATE: I have had a cigarette since posting this, so I'm a wee bit calmer. I'm going to register and see about making a REAL madoshi wiki article thats locked, if thats possible.

<li>For a forum such as yours to be eligible for a Wikipedia article, it must fit the criteria for notability set at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - which it clearly does not. Wikipedia is not a special club - however, it is also not <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">an indiscriminate source of information</a>. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a web directory, and as such, subjects contained within it must have a certain level of notability, relevance, and resonance amongst the wider community. The fact that your forum has been proposed (by me) for deletion is not a personal attack, nor is it a judgement on the quality of your web-site. It is simply done in order to keep Wikipedia running as a useful, intelligent, scholarly, and unbloated encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairman_S._cc1b.html" title="User:Chairman S.">Chairman S.</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairman_S._c158.html" title="User talk:Chairman S."><font color="#E32636">Talk</font></a> <font color="#177245"><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chairman_S._1280.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chairman S.">Contribs</a></sup></font></span> 14:46, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As an additional note, I would prefer it if I was not attacked personally by Madoshi members. I have no more authority over this issue than anyone else on Wikipedia, I simply marked the article for potential deletion. If I hadn't done this, someone else would have.
