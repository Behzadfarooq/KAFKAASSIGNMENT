<p>Non-notable middle school. Nominated on Prod but was removed only on grounds that the information is "verifiable" - it is, and in fact that's about the only information on the school's official "About Us" page (which could be seen as violation of copyright if it hadn't been rewritten with so many typos). Only claims to fame are known locally, if at all (and I doubt the fact that the school being its district's first middle school is widely known by residents of Naperville and Aurora, Illinois). Article doesn't even seem to meet any notability requirements of WP:SCHOOLS. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 20:56, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hill is actually mentioned in the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naperville%2C_Illinois_73c5.html" title="Naperville, Illinois">Naperville, Illinois</a> article already (it's in Naperville, not Aurora), and it also garnered a mention in <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school_systems_in_Aurora%2C_Illinois_c4d0.html#Indian_Prairie_School_District_204" title="Public school systems in Aurora, Illinois">Public school systems in Aurora, Illinois#Indian Prairie School District 204</a>. A mascot might be worth adding to the Naperville list (if mascots of the other schools in that article are added), but otherwise I don't think a merge is really necessary, the information is already there. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 21:13, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> No notability, no assertion of anything important about this school. It has no notable alumni, has had no teams or clubs perform at a notable level or anything else that might confer notability. As observed by TJ, it doesn't even come close to passing the highly generous <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:38, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> is just a proposed guideline.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Do you have some reasoning or basis behind that claim? Simply asserting it doesn't give it any validity. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:59, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, asserting it does give it just as much validity as asserting the opposite opinion. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 09:20, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually no it doesn't. The default status for things is to be not-notable. It doesn't matter how much I assert that corner stores are notable. Unless I give some argument as to why that's true that assertion holds no water whatsoever. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 14:40, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The default status for a random item is non-notable, however this isn't a random article, it's a school, which for many editors includes inherent notability due to its mission function, and impact on its attendees. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 20:44, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which comes down to an assertion by fiat. I could make nearly identical arguments for hospitals (people are born there) graveyards (after death you spend eternity there (in some sense at least)) and many other institutions. Furthermore, schools are largely interchangeable and have little actual impact on many people for whom schools are holding pens until they got jobs or for whom there are benefit from schools but they in no way benefit much based on anything unique about that school. There is nothing which distinguishes this school from any others in that regard. Nothing in the article indicates that students here are having a terribly unique experience they wouldn't get at any other school. Schools as a whole are notable, that doesn't make each individual school notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:31, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry but this is bugging me. I don't see how a near-verbatim copy of information already online at the school's own "About Our School" page <a href="http://hill.ipsd.org/about_principal.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://hill.ipsd.org/about_principal.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> can be considered a "nice start". Looks more like copyvio to me. And why should Wikipedia be reproducing information found on the pages that schools have set up about their own history all over the Web? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 03:22, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because there's nothing to suggest that the pages run by the schools themselves are or will remain a neutral source of information. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 05:51, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's unlikely Wikipedia will ever be much better for a simple reason - public schools keep a LOT of information, especially negative information, out of the hands of the press. They don't want to alarm their public with all of the things that really go on within the buildings (thefts are a good example). But, as I only know this first hand, it would be considered <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.... --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 15:20, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They can't keep negative police reports and negative state assessments out of the hands of the press, and this is a fine place to report them, where applicable. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 20:47, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Illinois State School Report Cards are one thing - but there are a LOT of things never reported to the police, see above. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 00:41, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's false logic to conclude that negative reports aren't worth gathering based on the assertion that we can't get all of it. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 04:59, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Being important to the community it serves is not a reason to keep it. Corner stores are important to their communities as is every little park and day-care.

<li><b>Comment</b> The busses that brings kids to school are incredibly important; why not write an article on every bus?

<li><b>Comment</b> That's not a keep reason that's special pleading with buzzwords. What pray tell does "organic expansion" mean? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:20, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Expansion to what? A carbon copy of hill.ipsd.org except on one page instead of several? Links to the rare news articles from the Naperville <i>Sun</i> about the school and/or its teams and activities? That still sounds more like a stub/directory entry than a proper article to me. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 01:34, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
