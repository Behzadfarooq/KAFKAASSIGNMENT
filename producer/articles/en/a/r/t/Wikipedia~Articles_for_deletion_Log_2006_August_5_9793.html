<li><b>Keep</b>. A quick look into the history shows there's a good article there that got buried by a copyvio. This needs a revert, and possibly some citations, but not a delete. --<a href="../../../g/a/u/User%7EGau_283b.html" title="User:Gau">Gau</a> 16:01, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Abe is a major figure in the Shotokan world and his organization is quite big. The idea of his having 750,000 students seems a bit ridiculous withou proof. From what I know about Abe, much of the article would seem to be substantially correct, but not cited. What this article needs is links and citations and corrections, but not deletion.

User:24.34.73.163 has helped round this one out some in the name of NPOV, although I'm not sure of his/her background and how much "balancing" really occured.

To me, the image of his book is vain and should go, but being a principal scholar of the theory doesn't necessarily exclude him from writing the article. I think there needs to be some serious work done, but I wouldn't recommend deletion just yet.

<li><b>Keep</b> While it is true that I am a cofounder of the term/theory and also created the article, it should be noted that I created it back before I understood that it might be seen as self-promotion and thus improper. My current understanding is that the creator of ideas can contribute to articles about them, but that they need to be circumspect in their contributions (which I wasn't, in this case). In any case, there are inumerable references in the psychoanalytic literature to this perspective. As evidence, consider the book <a href="http://www.iup.com/book_details.cfm?PubID=6" class="external text" title="http://www.iup.com/book_details.cfm?PubID=6" rel="nofollow"><i>Theories in Psychoanalysis</i></a> published in 1998 by the main psychoanalytic book publisher, <a href="http://www.iup.com/aboutus.cfm?pg=about" class="external text" title="http://www.iup.com/aboutus.cfm?pg=about" rel="nofollow">International Universities Press</a>, and edited by the well-known analyst, Robert Langs. There were a dozen chapters in the book, each about a different major psychoanalytic perspective. One of the chapters solicited for the book was "An evolutionary biological perspective on psychoanalysis" written by myself and Mal Slavin. If this is insufficient, please let me know and I will provide dozens of published references to this viewpoint by independent psychoanalysts. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 13:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mattisse, if by "your name" you meant "Kriegman," I do not understand this comment as my name was in <s>both</s> the reference above. If you meant "evolutionary psychoanalysis," then note that above you wrote, "There needs to be some evidence of professional recognition of his theory ..." When people recognize this perspective/theory/approach they may refer to it as "the evolutionary perspective on psychoanalysis formulated by Slavin &amp; Kriegman," or "Slavin &amp; Kriegman's evolutionary psychoanalytic perspective," etc. I can provide numerous such examples from published, peer reviewed literature if the example I gave above is insufficient. It is clear from the context---e.g., selecting the perspective for inclusion in a book surveying "theories in psychoanalysis"---that it is being recognized as a coherent, specific psychoanalytic viewpoint/theory. If the name is the problem for others as well, then I would recommend changing the name of the article to "Evolutionary Perspective on Psychoanalysis," or something like that (though I do think that is more awkward). The issue you raised above (evidence of professional recognition . . . in peer reviewed journals) can be easily remedied; if more evidence is needed, just let me know. That issue should not be conflated with the issue of the title of the article, which can be changed, if necessary.<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 15:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply to Reply</b> - I don't understand the first part of your reply about the two web pages I referenced above. While I erroneously said they <b>both</b> contained references to evolutionary psychoanalysis (corrected above), what I meant to say was that they both clearly support the point I was making. <a href="http://www.iup.com/book_details.cfm?PubID=6" class="external text" title="http://www.iup.com/book_details.cfm?PubID=6" rel="nofollow">One</a> does list my name, two times: "Slavin and Kriegman provide an evolutionary perspective on psychoanalysis" and "Table of Contents … 11. An Evolutionary Biological Perspective on Psychoanalysis Malcolm Owen Slavin, Daniel Kriegman." The other was not about evolutionary psychoanalysis; it was a link to show that the publisher (IUP) was a major force in psychoanalytic publishing. Just so, all four links that you note do not contain references to me or evolutionary psychology were NOT presented as verifying the importance of the evolutionary psychoanalysis. Rather, they were external links showing who some of the folks were who were commenting on evolutionary psychoanalysis (other commentators have Wikipedia articles identifying them, which were linked to). The comments from the folks (whom the external links were just identifying) came from promotional material for the book and are printed on the book itself. I do understand that such material may not be considered sufficiently objective to support the article. As I noted, I can provide innumerable quotations from these and other authors in published, peer reviewed (i.e., non-promotional) works to supplement (or replace) the quotations I originally put in the article. However, that would involve my becoming involved in major re-editing of the article, which is something that I have been trying to avoid since I learned that my involvement was considered inappropriate. I can provide peer reviewed references and quotations so that someone else can place them in the article, if that is more appropriate. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 17:18, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - JFW, that's true. But what about the recognition demonstrated by its inclusion in the book <b>Theories of Psychoanalysis</b> and the innumerable references I have offered to provide from the major, peer reviewed, psychoanalytic journals of it being referred to as a specific theoretical viewpoint? My ego aside (OK, that's something not so easily done&#160;;-), there is simply ample evidence that this viewpoint (which, in addition to the book, is presented in more than 50 published papers by myself and Malcolm Slavin in those major, peer reviewed psychoanalytic journals) has achieved recognition as a psychoanalytic perspective. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 16:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I searched <a href="../../../p/s/y/PsycINFO_e4a7.html" title="PsycINFO">PsycINFO</a> and found several peer-reviewed articles and book chapters by Kriegman and others, some of which do indeed talk about this topic. A search for evolutionary psychoanalysis reveals some peer-reviewed articles and chapters by others (Smith, D. L. 1999; Gilbert, P. &amp; Bailey, K. G., 2000). So, it does appear to have recognition in the psychoanalytic literature. Discussions on whether psychoanalysis is valid aside, I think this article <i>if properly sourced</i> is appropriate to keep, though its tone and possibly self-promoting nature probably aren't. With sources including some that don't involve the author cited (which I'm not going to fetch more than I have, not being a fan of psychoanalysis&#160;;) ), this article could be kept and cleaned up. Otherwise, it probably needs to be deleted without prejudice to recreation and started over. Just to clarify, to me (as a psychologist), if all the papers involving a field come from the same set of people, and those are the same people writing it up for Wikipedia, it screams self-promotion of a concept that's possibly failed in the literature. If other people are writing articles on the theory that can be cited, however, it supports the claim that the theory is getting real support. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 09:30, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I only see army.ca mentioned once in the article, and only in passing - and the article was not about army.ca but about reservists in Afghanistan. The quotes were from army.ca but not about the site. I ask the question later in this page - is the fact that a website is used as a reference good enough to establish notability?</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">guidelines</a> seem a bit vague so in my opinion this bears further scrutiny. Also don't forget to please sign your comments with four tildes. Two posters are quoted - the entire content relevant to army.ca reads as follows: <i>Contributors to the discussion forums at the pro-defence website army.ca yesterday characterized Cpl. Boneca's negative comments as a means of dealing with the intense pressure of front-line combat. One contributor called the complaints "normal army bitching."<br />
"Most of us, myself included, have said allot (sic) of not so well intentioned things due to the stress of being so close to 'quitting time'," wrote another poster, armybuck041...."The biggest lesson we as soldiers need to take away from this is how we project ourselves and our experiences to the members of our families waiting on the homefront," armybuck041 continued.</i> I'm not sure how this establishes notability of the website, but as I've said, I'm far from an expert on the subject - can you explain how this is "non-trivial"? I thought the intent of the notability guidelines was to find an article discussing the website in question directly rather than simply establishing that it was used once as a reference.

<ul>
<li>I agree with your comments on requirements for notability which is why the issue is being raised. You do not need to make the info 'available to the staff', simply adding it to the article, or to this discussion itself, should be sufficient. I've raised the question of notability for military sites at the Military History project but consensus seems to be that simple reference sites aren't notable. Perhaps if enough of us can demonstrate constructively that reference and discussion sites are notable an impetus to change the criteria can be created.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 16:48, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>John, bear in mind the guidelines state that merely being mentioned in a news article is not evidence in itself of notability - suggest you read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> thoroughly. We would need to make the case that these mentions are not "trivial".<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 16:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The exact guideline states:
<dl>
<dd><i><b>This criterion excludes:</b></i>
<p><i><b>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</b></i> In the case of the articles you reference, do they do more than simply mention the site in passing? Can you provide quotes as well as links to the online articles, rather than just the headlines? I'm not clear on whether or not the notability guidelines include using the site as a reference. Does that in itself denote notability?<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 16:57, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Army.Ca is being cited as a source of note in all cases and is regarded as such by most defence journalists. ((John Hill6633 00:00, 29 July 2006 (UTC)))
<ul>
<li>I see you edited this sentence, thanks for that. I've talked to Mike Bobbitt briefly this morning and in fact left on good terms - I still have a link to army.ca on my own forum and recommend it for current discussions of the military. I've also added external links to army.ca in several articles on Wikipedia - something that oddly has not been done to this point. Hopefully you will help rectify this. Back on topic, though, this nomination for deletion is based on the facts of the case, which I am hoping will be debated on those merits. My question was - is the fact a site is being used as a reference in itself an indicator of notability? The rules at present suggest no, but I will be happy to be proven wrong. Thanks for participating in the discussion and I look forward to your future contributions.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 17:14, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. To be clear, the article as it stands now is well written, if sparse, and could no doubt be expanded considerably with ease. However, the notability requirements for web-content indicate that a website has to either have been granted an award, or else been mentioned otherwise than trivially in other media. Personally, I feel that is an overly stringent requirement and would love to see a review of these guidelines. Look at a site like <a href="http://www.feldgrau.com" class="external text" title="http://www.feldgrau.com" rel="nofollow">feldgrau.com</a> which contains a ton of information on the German Army, but would fail to meet the requirements for notability for a mention here. Army.ca is particularly noteworthy, in my opinion, for the number of registered users (10,000+) and the apparent utility the site is gaining in the news media. In order to meet Wikipedia’s notability criteria, however, that has to be demonstrated in the article itself, and neither point would meet the stringent criteria as currently stated. If I have mis-interpreted the notability article, I will stand happily corrected. As a side note, I was indeed banned from the site, have left on good terms with the site owner (which is nobody's business and irrelevant here), and still have a link to army.ca from my own <a href="http://www.network54.com/Forum/28173/" class="external text" title="http://www.network54.com/Forum/28173/" rel="nofollow">canadiansoldiers.com forum</a> - and continue to recommend that site for discussion of current <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Army_2abb.html" title="Canadian Army">Canadian Army</a> topics. See <a href="../../../a/g/f/Wikipedia%7EAGF_95c3.html" title="Wikipedia:AGF">Wikipedia:AGF</a>. I would like to see a review of notability requirements for web content in general and military sites in particular, as I feel many useful sites should be featured with articles on WP but fail to meet the requirements at present. Future editors to this page please ensure to follow the guidelines for <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia: Civility</a> and remember to sign comments with four tildes (~~~~). Wikipedia has also stated that its mission is as an encyclopedia rather than just a "list of weblinks". I presume the intent of the web content notability standards was to ensure that truly significant sites (on the order of google.com) receive coverage they deserve rather than "vanity" sites being given coverage. Army.ca has been used by the media to investigate stories - I'm unclear whether or not proof of that on the page would count as "non-trivial" references and therefore qualify for inclusion. I look forward to the debate on this article's deletion/retention as discussion here will certainly guide us on how to apply the rules to similar military websites.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 15:12, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The criteria are not faulty. A web site that contains "a ton of information on the German Army" but that hasn't <i>itself been the subject</i> of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a> material does not warrant an article of its own, although it would be of benefit in a Further Reading section of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Army_5d6b.html" title="German Army">German Army</a>. Our intent is not to create a web directory, and that something is cited as a source for information about <i>other</i> topics does not make it automatically worthy of an article about itself. (<i>I</i> am cited as a source in several Wikipedia articles. Not only do I <i>not</i> warrant an encyclopaedia article, <i>I am unverifiable</i>.)
<p>The requirement that the article itself demonstrate that the notability criteria are satisfied is in part motivated by the move to a strong sourcing policy (although it does have the side benefit of making AFD discussions simpler). Citing sources is not optional.</p>
<p>One should always work from, and cite, sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Writing_about_subjects_close_to_you" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">If you don't have sources that are about the web site, don't write</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:09, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That certainly clears up notability - thanks also for formatting the discussion here - it was driving me buggy&#160;:-) I was thinking more of military websites as they fit in the general historiagraphy of certain subjects - ie the sites themselves become historical participants through their being used to interpret events - but that probably does not warrant separate articles either.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 14:04, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> -- if this webforum was really referred to as the "official" webforum for the Canadian armed forces by the Canadian armed forces, that suggests notability. Relevant guideline is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. But there doesn't seem to be any indication that any third party has ever discussed this website, leading to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> problems in writing an article about it.

<li>One of the anonymous IP addresses who are defending the site may be able to find that reference regarding the Army considering the site an "official" forum, it was included in one of the forum threads. I don't know if the notice is still up. If that can be considered sufficient for notability, then I'd recommend concerned parties find the reference. FWIW, there are few links to army.ca in the "external links" pages of many relevant Wikipedia articles. I've just added links to army.ca at <a href="../../../c/f/_/CF_Land_Force_Command_9592.html" title="CF Land Force Command">CF Land Force Command</a> and a few others; I'd suggest those who also believe army.ca is a useful reference to do likewise to articles that seem appropriate.

<li><b>Delete:</b> I don't understand the need for an Enclopaedic entry for a web site on a web site.

That website, which acts as a portal to the thousands of .mil websites, is not itself blessed with an article and I don't see why this one needs to be. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 02:23, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is a huge difference between a "list of links" and a virtual community of several thousand people that has been used as a reference in the media. <a href="http://army.ca" class="external text" title="http://army.ca" rel="nofollow">Army.ca</a> is not at all the equivalent of <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil" class="external text" title="http://www.defenselink.mil" rel="nofollow">defenselink.mil</a>.

<ul>
<li>No one is denying that army.ca has a large number of registered users, nor is anyone denying that the site is read by a large number of people, and occasionally given passing reference in the media. I myself recommend army.ca for those wishing to engage in current discussions on the CF. What is at issue here is whether any of that makes the site suitable for the subject of an encyclopedia article. Regardless of the ownership - private or public - and regardless of the traffic levels, and regardless of who the membership actually is (completely unverifiable in any event), the crux of the matter is - who is talking about army.ca aside from posters at the site, and how would one research an article on the site without using the site itself? Most of the references in the article are self-referential, or else indicate passing references to the site from external sources that rarely actually discuss the site itself. From that standpoint, the standards of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> are not met. (As an aside, none of this should be taken personally - newcomers to Wikipedia are often alarmed at how rigorous the intellectual standards are, as I was when one or two articles of mine were deleted outright for non-notability. Once one gets used to the idea that standards here have been built up by the consensus of thousands of editors and gets a feel for what the site is generally felt to be about, things get easier. Certainly, don't get discouraged, and should the standards for notability be met in future (if it is shown that have not to this point), you'd be heartily encouraged to resubmit the material.

Please advise how being listed at slashdot.org meets the criteria for notability...which require mentions in other media of a non-trivial nature. <s>Can you present an example of a non-trivial mention of army.ca at slashdot? A link to the site at the main address shows no mention of army.ca. No one has yet demonstrated notability by an actual non-trivial quote - again, passing references to the site are not indicators of notability; that would be fulfilled by an article about the site itself, not just a notice that it was accessed by a researcher.</s> My mistake, I thought you were using mention at slashdot as proof of notability, but instead you are comparing the site to slashdot.

<li>Continuously reasserting something doesn't make it true (and rather renforces the claims that this is vendetta by a disgruntled former user). The site in question has been repeatedly referenced in national media (as scores of citations in the article document) and appears to be the effective "official" discussion site for the Canadian Army (as official as such a body can ever get) That makes meeting the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> trivial - so trivial, in fact, that is is a <b>Speedy Keep</b>
<ul>
<li>Those mentions do not number "in the scores" and all seem to be trivial, unless you can quote an article which does more than just give passing mention to the site. dictionary.com defines "scores" as "A group of 20 items." I do not see 40 or more references cited. Nor do I see a reference to the CF considering it an official discussion fact - in fact <i><b>army.ca's own official disclaimer states irrevocably that army.ca is NOT an official site of the CF.</b></i> "Army.ca is a private effort, and is in no way sponsored by or connected to the Department Of National Defence, the Canadian Forces, or any other military organization.

<dd>There doesn't seem to be any evidence that they do - the article has a self-referential footnote to a forum posting there that seems inconclusive (unless someone can copy the relevant statement here - I believe it was a reference to a notice at an official forces.gc.ca site, but no one has produced that URL.) In any event, the disclaimer on the site states strongly that army.ca is in no way connected to the Canadian Forces - exact words being <i><b>"Army.ca is a private effort, and is in no way sponsored by or connected to the Department Of National Defence, the Canadian Forces, or any other military organization.</b></i> That doesn't exlude the possibility of the Army recommending the forum, but there needs to be proof of that presented other than what an anonymous poster on army.ca may have implied in order to meet the standards of verifiability here.</dd>

<dd>If I am remembering the thread correctly, I believe the "recommendation" by the Army to use army.c for discussions actually came from an Army.ca registered member who happened to also be a moderator at the army's own forums.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> The article makes no real case for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> compliance, such as several links to actual mainstream media mentions.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The website in question has had mention in radio, tv, and print news (references cited in the article) and so meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> Furthermore, it cannot be ignored that the sole champion of deletion is constantly editing the article in an attempt to remove or discredit the citations that enable the meeting of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and it is a matter of record that this user was recently banned from the website in question which causes grave doubts about his good faith in editing. While it may not be the strongest case for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> complience ever seen on Wikipedia, the fact that there 'are' cited instances of national media reports on this website, coupled to the dubious nature of both the deletion request and the subsequent editing pattern, seems to me to make a strong case for retention - at least for now. Perhaps it can be revisited in 6 months, when the disgruntled editor has moved on to other targets and the article contents will have stabilized.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a stub, and it can be expanded, but that is besides the point, many notable subjects have only one sentence written on them in Wikipedia. Does that mean we delete all stubs?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Seems there's some confusion as to what this is. RED, along with the rest of the mods in the template, are total conversions for Marathon, a very old but noteworthy first-person shooter (noteworthy as probably the best-known commercial Mac-only game ever, as well as the first big success of Bungie).

<li>Maybe someone else can come up with something, but for me these claims are 100% unverifiable.

I can find no evidence that they have produced anything of note, and the external link is in Chinese (and even if it wasn't, it's not a source independent of the subject, so it couldn't be used anyway). If the subject's notability can't be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>, it can't survive AfD. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 12:30, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Regarding vanity, it's certainly not a personal conflict of interest. As a researcher in the new field of disaster inforamtics, I feel qualified to begin a page - surely a requirement that an author not be a researcher in the subject area of a page on a research field is counter productive? In the article I currently just give a definition, and links to 18 resources, only one of which is a site I am connected with in any way (the School of Informatics Disaster Informatics page at IU, which also contains information about other researchers).</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Health Informatics and geoinformatics are in very wide use. The <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> guidelines apply to recently coined terms that do not have sufficiently wide use to merit inclusion. I do agree that Parliementary informatics seems to fail this (although it might be that it also needs to be submitted to AfD) as for GIDEON Informatics it's a company so the comparison is irrelevant. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I did a quick Google test for copyright vio and plagiarism. (copy between 3/4 of a sentence to two sentences into the google search box, inclose in quotes and see what pages are hit.) The only pages hit are this article in Wikipedia and the Answers.com mirror of Wikipedia. My conclusion is that it is not an IP violation, legally or ethically.

<p>An incomplete AfD brought here. I'm assuming that the entry was nominated for lacking notability. Personally, I suspect that, unfortunately, victims of the war against Iraq lack notability. There are too many of them and, unless the article asserts greater notability, I'm not sure they come into Wikipedia's radar. However, I'm not prepared to CSD-A7 as I am aware of my own anti-war bias. Therefore I'd like community input. This is a technical nomination with <b>no opinion</b> being expressed by be - well, some opinion, but none on the <i>article</i> itself. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 19:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This being the first time that I do this, I'm not entirely sure how to defend my having put up an entry for iFanboy. It's a site I've read since it's inception and with more and more people downloading their weekly podcast and following their exploits at the movies and at comic-cons. I think that regardless of their joking cultural irrelevance, their relevance to is on the rise, esp. with those who read comic books and listen to discussion podcasts. They were one of the 9 podcasts invited to this year's San Diego Comic-Con and I think that's just another example that speaks to their relevance to comic book audiences at large. <b>don't delete.</b><a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillbot24_5647.html" title="User:Killbot24">Killbot24</a></p>

Also, they're in the top 100 podcasts for the Arts category in iTunes, higher than any other comics podcast. Plus I think that "culturally irrelevant since 2000" is meant to be a joke.

<dd>Well, for starters, "Buzz Out Loud" gets 364,000 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Buzz+Out+Loud%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Buzz+Out+Loud%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">Google hits</a>, and is a podcast run by a very popular internet news site. Even Fanboy radio gets 60,000 or so <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=xUq&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Fanboy+Radio%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=xUq&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Fanboy+Radio%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">hits</a>. To put it simply, both of those podcasts are alot more notable then the one in question. If it's in the top 100 arts podcasts, well then good for it, but how many arts podcasts are there total? 120? 200? You have to put things in perspective, maybe when this article is #5 in the arts podcasts it will deserve an article, but until then it's just not notable enough. Oh, and yeah, I'm pretty sure that's a joke to, but in the grand scheme of things I don't think it really matters. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 21:34, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I definitely get your point about relevance, but the fact is, this podcast is on the rise. Doing a google search yields about 10k worth of hits, which isn't as much as "Fanboy Radio," but they seem to only have about 140 or so more unique hits. And they've only been casting since like this winter where Fanboy Radio's been around for years. Also, there is over 6800 podcasts under the "arts" category on iTunes, being int the top 100 is hardly insignificant.--Crujones13 22:15, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> -- Don't let a transforming medium like the wiki be held hostage to archaic standards that define traditional media. Fact is, these guys fill a niche in a way that no one else does. iFanboy is notable in that they have been blogging since it was still called a weblog, they have been podcasting for a time that has seen an untold number appear and disappear, and they have quietly begun doing video work - without self aggrandisement. Their audience is the measure of how notable they are.</li>

<li>An redirect can be from a marginally related title or from something that is an instance of the more general. Redirects are cheap and save the content in the history---useful in case the subject ever becomes notable and also help prevent recreation if it hasn't yet become notable. In fact for something uncontroversial, a speedy redirect without an AFD can save everyone a lot of time. Deleting history is really only necessary for copyvio, attack pages, completely useless patent nonsense, etc. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">08-06</a> 17:19Z</small></i></span></li>

<dd>Hi Luna: I appreciate the comments. I indeed saw the articles you mentioned above after I had created the article nominated for deletion. I created it in the hopes that other people might notice it, use it, and have something useful to comment on and maybe add those to the page on WP. However I did see a suggestion that I could instead merge the article with the primary function it serves. I took a look at <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream_journal.html" title="Dream journal">Dream journal</a> and noticed it was a stub, so maybe adding a section on 'software' to that article and putting links to some sites (or articles on WP) to dream journalling software would be better. What do you think? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstareGod_4845.html" title="User:AstareGod">AstareGod</a> 03:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As far as I can see, the whole thing is a falsehood, and really has no place in Wikipedia, at least not phrased as a history article.</p>
<p>All of its sources either display that they are untrue (unrealaircraft.com) or are based off of this <i>Luftwaffe 1946</i>.

The last time I checked, I was a bit undecided on the AS6 article, so if someone can show that most of it are direct quotes from Luftwaffe 1946, then I'm willing to vote for deletion.-- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 03:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think I see some of the confusion. There are two similarly-named websites, one is for the <a href="http://www.luftwaffe1946.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.luftwaffe1946.com/" rel="nofollow">aforementioned game</a>, and another is dedicated to <a href="http://www.luft46.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.luft46.com/" rel="nofollow">unrealized-WWII aircraft</a>. Note the game site has no listings for aircraft at all, and is practically empty beyond it's "alternate history" section. Up until this moment, I had fancied myself somewhat of a geek regarding military aircraft, but I've never heard of this prototype. I can tell you the United States independently developed the so-called "<a href="http://www.unrealaircraft.com/wings/cv_flapjack.php" class="external text" title="http://www.unrealaircraft.com/wings/cv_flapjack.php" rel="nofollow">Flying Flapjack</a>", but I can't say I've ever seen hardcopy for the Sacks aircraft. Perhaps the author can return and help us out? <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Was speedy deleted for not asserting notability, but author has screamed loudly - and there does appear to have been an assertion of notability of sorts in the original text. So I've undeleted it out of process (with no judgment on the previous deletion - A7 can be a tough one to call) and it comes here. This gives the author time to beef up the assertion of notability, and the community time to decide about the article. <b>No opinion</b> from me. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 16:36, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for at least listening. I was in the process of writing the article when it was speedy deleted without explanation and without giving time to argue anything. The whole Wikipedia is full of references of tribute bands, most of them are much more "irrelevant" than this one, and I gave the example of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Zeppelin_0a3e.html" title="Fred Zeppelin">Fred Zeppelin</a>, which is not even a recording band, just a pub band. I can list hundreds of cases, check the ridiculous <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Maiden_a0a9.html" title="Anton Maiden">Anton Maiden</a> case, check the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheap_Chick_f166.html" title="Cheap Chick">Cheap Chick</a> case, they are plainly picayune in comparison with The White, which even has some curriculum outside the tribute band world. I'm kinda new for Wikipedia, but I think it's appalling to eliminate an article in the making without the proper research and without somewhat of a vote to let users decide. Thanks again for reconsidering. I'll leave more comments on the discussion page of the article. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrencacloscas_11c3.html" title="User:Trencacloscas">Trencacloscas</a> 20:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't think of anybody else? Anyway, the article on Maobe Maotsetung was created by User:Maobe Maotsetung and is this user's only contribution, so it doesn't look like a coincidence. Other editors did remove one interesting paragraph from the article (see its first version): "He has political ambitions, with plans to set up an alternative political party in Kenya to cater for the young who are increasingly feeling left out by corrupt and inept leadership that spans 40 years" That looks pretty much like self-promovation to me. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a></sup> 00:30, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> a good article on this subject could be written. A theocracy is a form of government. Whether one approves or not is the POV. That said, while what appears thus far is not verified and NPOV, that's not a reason to delete it; it can be improved with sourcing. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 18:18, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm all for article improvement resulting from the AfD process (a positive side-effect of the process, but I do not mean to imply or advocate that the AfD process is means by which one should instigate article improvement). As it appears from the edit history of the article that you're in the process of improving it, I'll keep an eye on it. For now, I still have the same concerns about the article. First of all, if the article is kept, it will have to define or provide a set of criteria for what is a "Shi`ite Theocracy". Right now, it's just an example (almost like the old cliche, I don't know what it is, but I know it when I see it) of a Shi`ite theocracy. Also, the POV needs to be worked on, particularly the last paragraph (critics? which critics? what did they say? when/where/how did they say it)? Finally, while POV can be improved, unless and until the facts of the article are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>, that is a reason to delete it. Good luck with the revisions. I am always of an open mind and am willing to reconsider an AfD nomination if changes warrant it. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:51, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, yeah, in a perfect world. The problem here is that there are literally millions of articles on Wikipedia. And a lot of them shouldn't be there. Hoaxes have a nasty habit of staying up for months. The creator of the article, by default, should be expert on the subject enough to provide evidence of notability. Random passers by like myself should not be expected to spend plane fare to Mauritius to verify the truth of an article. So, the policy is of necessity "guilty until proven innocent." The AFD process is an attempt to deal with this. You attest he's notable, but... You don't provide any backup sources that we can check. Which investment circles are you talking about? Where is the evidence of notablity? We need more. Sorry. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 19:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Strange theory "gulity until proven innocent" - isnt it supposed to be "innocent until proven guilty". Anyways its upto the author to validate. Maybe <a href="../../../0/s/i/User%7E0SIRIS_c0b9.html" title="User:0SIRIS">0SIRIS</a> can throw some light. I have come across this venture cap company at Mauritius having made investments in Brazil.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I tend agree with some of you on lack of verifiability on google - however do take cognizance that in the case with many "Indian" names, the right spelling could be a combination of either Jayram, Jairam, Jayaram. This person is known in banking &amp; investment circles in India as Jay Menon. Anyways, that is my opinion &amp; I wonder if it at all matters. I have read a few comments by other wikipedians. There seems to be a group of wikipedians who are more keen to delete out of a preconceived consensus.

<dd><b>Comment</b> 0SIRIS, you already stated your opinion above, you shouldn't be doing so a second time. I searched under all the variations of Jay Menon that you mentioned and only turned up 19 Google hits. Hardly notable. If he is notable, and more importantly verifiable, someone needs to supply the references. See the policy <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>. In a nutshell "Information on Wikipedia must be reliable and verifiable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources. Articles should cite these sources whenever possible. Any unsourced material may be challenged and removed." This AfD has been open since July 28 and nobody has been able to supply any verifiable information about Jay Menon. <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 17:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)btball</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> your statement on verifiability is Contoversial! I did a google on +Jay +Menon +Venture +Capital and got around 20,900 hits. Now we all know that not all may relate to this individual. However that's different from the 19 that you have been quoting. So there is a contradiction on your own statement. Now when I tried +Jayaram +Menon +Investor I got around 298 hits. The "source" of verifiability was initiated by you, which doesn't hold ground. However a portion of your comment does makes sense &amp; on that point I agree with you that the author should have stated facts and cited sources. <a href="../../../0/s/i/User%7E0SIRIS_c0b9.html" title="User:0SIRIS">0SIRIS</a> 17:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

If someone can provide verifiable information about why Jay Menon is notable, I'll be glad to change my opinion from <b>Delete</b> to <b>Keep</b> but I've already spent a lot of time personally searching for verifiable information about his notability and haven't succeeded.

<dd><b>Comment</b> A Google search on +Jay +Menon +Venture +Capital turns up all sorts of stuff that has 2 or 3 of those words, but not the rest. It's not a valid search. I want to be polite here, but, please, put up or shut up. <s>Don't say "I got X results from Google search Y".

<li><b>Comment.</b> Indeed they do exist, as members of a particular type of choir. I certainly wouldn't argue that, being an ex-choir person myself.&#160;:) However, if you eliminate the POV and not likely verifiable statements in the article ("A separate choir in which has a great deal of talent. This choir is compiled of many great talented singers" and "The person is most likely a great or above singer" are examples), what you end up with is a dictdef, more or less, and that could be merged into <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choir</a> if it isn't effectively there already. When I last read <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choir</a>, it seemed that the key bits of information contained in this article were already there. So, IMO, unless someone can substantially expand this article to really bring it past dictdef status and to include non-POV, verifiable information to clearly separate chamber choirs from concert choirs in a way that warrants their own article, I'm still leaning towards delete. Mostly, I'm rather skeptical that, given the "the information above depends on the schools" quote, that one could show any difference except in some schools that just don't want to call their choirs "intermediate" and "advanced" or, perhaps more commonly, "chorus" and "choir." --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 21:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"2006 News Corporation Management Conference". It appears to be sponsored by News Corporation, and therefore might be considered a service of News Corporation. The <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilderberg_Group_5eac.html" title="Bilderberg Group">Bilderberg Group</a> entry is a discussion of the group and its conference in general, not an agenda of a specific conference. If this article were something along those lines, I would not suggest it for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I appreciate the feedback but have to question the bar for entry into the notability that the editors reviewing this article are applying.

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> that there could be some debate as to whether a gathering of notables is notable. That would make sense absent press coverage of an event, or perhaps covered by local news sources. However this event is being covered by world class papers around the world.</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> - no reason given for notablility.

<p>This ship is the second frigate ship in Naval history to sink a enemy combatant so any Captain that served on this ship is notable. As I see you have you have not taken the time to read about Simpson. The first frigate ship to sink an enemy was the USS Constitution so do you see my point. Further, he served on Samuel Roberts one of two frigates that have been hit by the enemy. I am against you deleting this article and ask for you to reconsider.

<li><b>Comment</b> I do agree that these need deletion, but the information needs to go somewhere and I don't think it will all fit into the main articles so perhaps, as Ace of Sevens suggests, they should be put into a meta-article List of weapons and equipment in the Halo universe.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I wrote three of these articles, because my personal beliefs, which you may or may not share, are that things should not just go to their own Wiki. Most Star Wars articles shouldn't be transferred to Wookieepedia. Most Halo articles shouldn't be transferred to the HaloWiki or Halopedia (they're different). When I told one of my friends was informed that there was an online information repository, an encyclopedia, known as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, he was overjoyed. This was due to the face that he could look up things for video games. Not strategy guides, but information. And then, he fails to find any weapons for <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Halo%7E_Combat_Evolved_d61d.html" title="Halo: Combat Evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>. His opinion of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> goes down a lot, because it is lacking many articles. And he doesn't even know of HaloWiki or Halopedia. And you can't just put a redirect instead of this article, because Wikipedia is not a web directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these articles are <b>strategy guides</b>. So even though <i>Wikipedia is a strategy guide</i>, I would like to see what is in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that I have violated.</p>

<li>A meta-article should be made for all those. As has been suggested a List of weapons and equipment in the Halo universe seems plausible, or perhaps List of weapons and technology in the Halo universe? I personally would have only voted for a merge in the previous list AfD, but that is over and done with.

<li>So when a vote references "Cruft" as the only justification for a vote, it in no way has to do with the essay <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>? "It is true that things labeled fancruft are often deleted from Wikipedia. This is primarily due to the fact that things labeled as fancruft are often poorly written, unreferenced, unwikified, and non-neutral - all things that lead to deletion. Such articles may also fall foul of Wikipedia's policy against creating "indiscriminate collections of information". Well-referenced and well-written articles on obscure topics are from time to time deleted as well, but such deletions are controversial." - Thess articles fall into the former category, and not the "well-referenced and well-written articles on obscure topics" category, but to simply call them "cruft" is not enough.

<li><b>Comment</b> If you had actually read the AFD, you would see that I voted to "delete" for reasons of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The only problem I have is that "Cruft" is not a valid reason to delete. There is no wikipedia policy (or even guideline) on it, only some vague essays. When the argument of "cruft" is used in place of citing valid policy, all it leads to is a bunch of polarized opinions on whether editors "like" the topic being discussed, as opposed to whether they meet wikipedia's well defined requirements for encyclopedic writing.JoshWook 02:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough. If you point out the sections (or even types of sections) that, in your opinion, violate the ban against OR, I'll be happy to copy-edit them out of this article and others. In my opinion, most of the text of this article can probably be supported by something in the novels or manuals (I don't know offhand, since I'm not exactly an avid Halo fan).

<li><b>Keep</b>. The cannons are very important in the universe even though they only had a short air time in the games. I think that someone who played the first level of Halo 2 and was curious about MACs would come here looking for an article. I would. I think the level of detail is acceptable - it's only two pages or so. As for the in-universe-perspective, we can re-write it to be better. Aside: While Star Wars is more culturally significant, read <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber.html" title="Lightsaber">Lightsaber</a> (57k long) (and <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber_users.html" title="Lightsaber users">Lightsaber users</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber_combat.html" title="Lightsaber combat">Lightsaber combat</a>). Also in-universe, hella long and detailed. I don't think any of the movies talk about construction, or specific forms; that's all expanded universe. Summary: I don't see why it should be deleted when people would gain information from it. Isn't that the point of Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevastatorIIC_0823.html" title="User:DevastatorIIC">DevastatorIIC</a> 03:19, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I do agree that the article is very in-universe (<i>Wikipedia articles should describe fiction and fictional elements from the perspective of the real world, not from the perspective of the fiction itself.</i>) and should be taken out-of-universe. However, that would reduce the article to a mere stub. I do like the idea of a Technology of Halo article (thanks, Deckiller), wherein we (or, more likely, I) could put the real-world explanations of different weapons/vehicals/etc. However, for the time being, we should not delete it. I would call this an extended <b>Merge</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The MAC does not just appear once in <i>Halo</i> - it is referred to continually in the Halo books, in the first Halo game, and is an integral part of the "history" of the UNSC.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Herein lies the problem - though the Magnetic Accelerator Cannon <b>is</b> an important part of the story of <i>Halo</i>, it's not specifically mentioned in the games too many times, as the games are from a first-person's perspective (the Master Chief's) and of course, he doesn't operate strategic weapons. Therefore, the MAC cannot be mentioned in the <i>Halo</i> articles really well, as it would seem completely out of place. It is however, mentioned in the books, which describe events leading to the two games, and set the stage for the situations played in the games. That's why I voted to keep earlier. –- <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><b><font color="#0000FF">kungming·2</font></b></a> | <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk</sup></font></a>·<sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Kungming2_0eb5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Kungming2"><font color="#999999">Contact)</font></a></sup> 19:43, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I'm not a fan of having pages on every single insignificant aspect of video games. That said, the Metal Gear series is popular, the Patriots are pretty significant in the Metal gear universe, and explication on the group isn't entirely unwarranted.

<p>I think this article should stay in place. I did the origional deprodding earlier today, the fourth of august, but didn't have enough time to leave a comment. This article does in fact contain alot of insight to certain aspects of the name of "The Patriots" and it's interpretation. For instance: In the game Metal Gear Solid 2, it is not well explained and discussed as to why they have the alternate name of "la-li-lu-le-lo" and actually taught me something new about a series I thought I knew everything about. If the goal of a wikipedia article is to inform, then this one has lived up to the task. Also, it was said that it rarely states what game it is from. However, it is mentioned numerous times that the organization is from the game MGS2, and from the metal gear solid series throughout the article including in the first sentence and furthermore in the template at the end. <a href="../../../j/a/p/User%7EJapan_Acid_38f6.html" title="User:Japan Acid">Japan Acid</a> 03:23, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page is both unencyclopedic (not sufficiently relevant to warrant an article of this size, and it's veracity, scope and enforcement are called into serious question) I am nominating the article for deletion for several reasions 1. lack of citation, this article has insufficient documentation (documentation such that there have been real arguments posed as to the veracity, enforcement, and scope of this alleged list. 2. unencyclopedic. This list at most rates a footnote in history or an encyclopedia, while I agree it passes the notability litmus test, it is not sufficiently notable to command an article of this size. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrelane_e11c.html" title="User:Trelane">Trelane</a> 01:50, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No citations? There are 3 of them done in the standard format, and there are 2 links to the original list. Unencyclopediac? This was a major news event a few years ago which should be mentioned in Wikipedia. The size of the article is needed to fit the list, which is quite important to demostrating the extent to which the list went to remove songs from the air. There is no reason why we should delete an article on such a well-known event in the history of censorship in the US. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 01:53, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest you read the citations, and the discussion on the page, it is altogether unclear as to what the scope of this "censorship" was. That therefore must make this article pure speculation. Furthermore while we're on the discussion of censorship, let us then discuss the definition of a censor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48&#160;:</p>
<pre>
 "Censor \Cen"sor\,    2. One who is empowered to examine manuscripts before they
       are committed to the press, and to forbid their publication if they contain         anything obnoxious"  
</pre>
<p>From this it is clear that a censor must be an outside, not an inside influence, else the arguement would be made that a Clear Channel DJ censored one artist by playing a track by another artist at any given time. And while the previous answer fails the reason test, it does not fail your definition of censorship, therefore your definition is unreasonable. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrelane_e11c.html" title="User:Trelane">Trelane</a> 02:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-censorship.html" title="Self-censorship">self-censorship</a> is a well-known concept (and that definition above is a pretty poor one). Censorship is a much broader concept than the most heavy-handed versions of it, and "content standards" are a very common form of what most people would call censorship, whether they are imposed on an organization from the outside or whether it is a result of an organization having a monopoly and using its own internal standards. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:23, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><s>Keep, but...</s></b> (vote change below). I disagree with the nom about the notability of this article--Clear Channel is a large entity whose decisions affected the playlists of a huge portion of the radio marketplace. Its actions are indicative of the social and cultural climate of that time period in the United States, and a well-maintained list serves to illustrate the extent of that climate/attitude in the music industry. There are also references provided at the end that I expect back up most of the entries. That said, a review of the Talk page and edit history seems to back up allegations of attempted <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">OWNing</a> of the article, and it might have been wise to call for mediation some months ago. But at this point, the edit wars appear to have died down (no conversations on the Talk page for a month before today, and the bulk of recent edits have been more like copy-editing), so even that may not be an issue at this point. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 02:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete (vote change).</b> I still feel that the controversy was notable and that such a list, if it verifiably exists, has a place on Wikipedia. The "urban legend" argument isn't strong here--the article notes that the "banned" element of it has been proved an urban legend, but this doesn't mean a list of "inappropriate" songs wasn't distributed by Clear Channel--in fact, as Snopes points out, there <i>was</i> such a list, though Clear Channel notes that it was intended merely as advisory. However, I hadn't taken the time to review each cited source when I previously voiced a "keep" vote. As far as I can see, none of the sources for the actual list meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (as per Zer0fault's post below). Thus, without any threshold of verifiability met to determine which songs were actually on this list, this article in its current incarnation should go. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 20:05, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I feel the subject of the article is reasonably notable. I was about to go with just having an external link, but the advantage to having the list here instead of just at an external link is that readers can easily click on individual songs and read about them to get a sense as to why the song may have been banned after 9|11. Alternatively, the article could be expanded to include that information directly in this article. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> <small>(joturner)</small> 03:10, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and Delete</b> I have attempted to get the editor to provide some proof of this list being "the" list that was circulated. They cannot do so because the list was never released, both of the sources offered do not have the same list and one is cited as more complete. While I am sure that a list was circulated, it was also need a ban or censor list, well the article fails to prove it was, with one source stating by Clear Channel that it was neither. So we have a list from 2 different sources, a list meaning a bunch of items, because neither is in a proper email or fax formatting or even contain a letter head to prove some sort of authenticity. Since the sources cannot be verified and do not even appear in any form that would be standard as evidence or proof. Keeping the list is promoting information we do not know to be true, the list cannot be different on two dif sources, and neither sources has the original fax email etc. merge mention, but delete the list as the songs on it are unverifiable. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:05, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, there is one real version of the list, which we have here.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Maybe I'm going outside the scope of Wikipedia, but I think the list should stay. As long as it is verified, it makes much more sense to keep this list accessible to the reader so they can view the list and from experience or lyric research synthesise their own opinions on the event rather than relying on citations from other sources in the ClearChannel article. And if we remove the list and don't represent responses to the event, we trivialise it, when in this company represents the majority of radio media in the US and any action to discourage the playing of songs is very relevent to the emotional state of the nation after 9/11.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article indicates accurately that the list was circulated but the songs were not banned. The president of Clear Channel is cited as admitting that the list was circulated. It was a notable incident, in part because of the rumors it caused, and the list should be preserved for researchers interested in this. The "lack of citation" argument seems incorrect, and even the person who nominated it for AfD acknowledges its notability. I could see supporting a merge argument if the list is put on wikisource, but having it here with wikilinks to articles on the bands could be useful.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 09:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> We need to separate the deletion of the incident from deletion of a list of songs. The incident is notable enough for inclusion; perhaps not within its own article but as it currently stands within the Clear Channel article. A list of songs that were "banned" is not worthy of inclusion, and hence my vote is to delete. Unfortunately, a number of the opinions expressed are to include the article without consideration for whether this <b>list of songs</b> should be included. Ask yourself: Were the incident to warrant an article of its own, would a list of 150 songs be appropriate for inclusion in the article? The incident is minor but notable. However, including a list of some 150-odd songs is not, especially as they were a suggestion, not a "ban". --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 01:04, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> What the hell are you on about? This isn't speculative at all - all the information is sourced from the website and other sources (Gamespot and IGN spring to mind) and there is NO chance this is going to be pulled - Maxis have never missed an expansion pack, and its very unlikely they'll start now. Also, the fact there is a package photo definitely suggests this isn't speculative - this is from Maxis!

This article was made to inform people that such a mod exsists, as there are not enough mods ambitious enough to take on Zelda. Also, it should be noted that there are articles on mods that are even shorter and less informative than this one, such as the article on the Sven Co-Op mod. Also, the original version of this article was abandoned far before it was completed because I had to leave the place I was creating it at, and returned home to finish. This is not a crystal-ball article. All my refrences are available on the article. Read them before labling articles for deletion. This is noteable as it has a wider audence then you assume. It encompases the modding community and Zelda fans, which refers to alot of gamers as many enjoy the Zelda series.

This article <i>IS</i> noteable because, as I mentioned, there are very few Zelda mods available. As a matter of fact I only know of one, which is Zelda for Halo CE. As for vanity, is it only being considered that because I am on the development team? I'm not creating this article as an advertisement, but as a piece of information. It is a mod in development, which is perfectly valid. This is another way to note updates and information about it. That's what Wikipedia contains. Information and that's all this is.

<li>Just to clarify, I wasn't refering to everyone who wants the article down as a deletionist. I just had noticed that a good number were. Anyhow, I suppose it is perfectly reasonible. To say it can never be noteable is not reasonible, but comments about waiting for it to be further along in development sounds just fine. One can wait. But please, stop calling this a vanity article, because it was not for that purpose. Otherwise, the comments now seem reasonible, and thank you for those who wished good luck and gave encouragement. As for those who didn't...well, we'll see if this vote comes up again when the time comes to re-make this article. -- Spex -- (I dunno what the hell the time is &gt;.&gt; ) Aug. 5, 06 (One thing that concerns me is juding on noteablility. How can you judge based on something that cannot be measured? It's an opinion, which Wikipedia is not about. It's about facts. I'm guessing this is why it is not official standard.)</li>

Those of you shouting Recentism should wait six months and nominate it again if you still think so. <s><a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagnate_5a09.html" title="User:Magnate">Magnate</a></s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 57.66.49.133 (<a href="../../../5/7/2E/User_talk%7E57.66.49.133.html" title="User talk:57.66.49.133">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_57.66.49.133_3956.html" title="Special:Contributions/57.66.49.133">contribs</a>).</small> <small>Do NOT impersonate other users <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b>Srose</b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 13:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>... but you are missing the point. Someone spent quite a long time working on that article. It's quite good. It doesn't violate any laws or any of Wikipedia's policies. It's no less valid than articles like All Your Base Are Belong To Us or Read My Lips: No New Taxes. These are the kind of articles that distinguish Wikipedia from less interesting sources of information. By all means delete articles if they violate NPOV or some other policy, but deleting it because you think "not long from now this incident is going to be an insignificant memory" is not a good enough reason. Why not wait and see? Why shift the burden onto re-creating it?

<li><b>Keep</b> Should be kept and tried as an organisation and not web content. The web is merely the medium for the informal organisation of like-minded users. "Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source." The scope of the forum is certainly notably international and the fact the pre-registering and approval is required to view the forums sets it apart from being a run-of-the-mill online community and it is a member's organisation. Activities undertaken by the organisation include a charity bike ride around the world and meetings in London and Amsterdam. 68.145.107.234 00:21, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Failed to comprehend the point there. The forum in itself could be considered an independent, albeit informal, organisation separate from SI or anyone. There is international scope and notable events which give this forum an extra dimension from most other Internet forums. Okayplayer has been mentioned, a band called Los Campesinos! have been championed on OTF and recently signed a deal, in part thanks to the exposure received on OTF. Just because there is a general nature to the movement instead of a specialised one does not mean it should be deleted. It should, of course, be completely re-written. 68.145.107.234 21:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I want to play Banjo Threeie <i>more than anyone else in the entire universe</i>. But there is nothing to say about it that can be based in actual fact. The game is <b>not even vaporware</b>; no one has ever announced it, except in jest, and it exists only in the minds of fans who <i>want</i> it. The article is unsourced and by nature unverifiable, and utterly a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">crystal ball article</a>.

<li>Hate to say it but, <b>Delete</b>. Yes, there may well be a third game (actually, fifth, counting the GBA games) planned.

<li>If you can indicate some why in which this falls into one of wikipedia's notability criteria, you may have a chance of saving the article.

<li>How does this fanfilm not constitute a notable criteria?</li>
<li>the wiki criteria says:</li>
<li>1. ...If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include 2008 U.S. presidential election...</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Comment</b> When the wiki criteria talks about "well documented", it means with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The website for sigil bellflower doesn't count as it has no editorial process and isn't a third party source.

<li><b>Rebuttal</b> - I did not create this article. However, it is an article worth having on Wikipedia. Central Market is <b>not</b> a small, local subsidiary. The chain is in all four major Texas markets. The geographic area of the chain can be compared to that of the area of New England. Do not discriminate because Texas is a very lage state. It is a separate chain from its parent, H-E-B. Also, other subsidiaries exist in their own articles. By your suggestion to delete Central Market, those subsidiaries should then also be deleted. Further, only few people know Central Market is owned by H-E-B. Dallas-area users, like most others, will type "Central Market" when looking for an encyclopedia entry, not H-E-B. A deleted article will result in an unsuccessful search of it. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClipper471_09f9.html" title="User:Clipper471">Clipper471</a> 15:57, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I disagree even though it's a small church it is already in the process of recieving Tax-Free status as a Not-For-Profit Church. I don't see it as an advert but more of a statement of belief. Even if you choose not to agree with the message maybe others are looking for information. How do you expect outside sources if their popularity is not exactly top-tier?

<p>I also disagree. BareNakedChurch is in the process of becomeing a "real" (as in IRS approved church). But, according to the Bible a church is really where two or more meet (fellowship), to learn about Chirst (discipleship), break bread and pray (see Acts 2). This is what's happening in the BareNakedChurch Underground Churches (I know as I attend one). All the elements are even there for their web except the break bread part. And, as far as I can tell from the Bible, no church there needed an IRS endorsement. If Wikipedia is a place to share information and learn about an organization then it will be simply a shame to delete Bare Naked Church. I suspect that the peolple who want BareNakedChurch off are really anti-Christain (see the "Jesus spam" comment). So, the other sad thing is that the BareNakedChurch is also a place where Christianty is openly challenged and discussion happens. If someting as open and growing as BareNakedChurch can't be discussed and explained on Wikipedia then this place is a joke and a waste.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.206.57.110 (<a href="../../../2/0/6/User_talk%7E206.206.57.110.html" title="User talk:206.206.57.110">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.206.57.110_0ae2.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.206.57.110">contribs</a>) 22:01, 5 August 2006.</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Firstly, might I remind you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a>. I'm sure many devout christians get annoyed and use unkind terms about the apparent mass-marketing of religion all the time. What I'm hearing of the organisation is pleasing, however wikipedia strives to verify facts with seconary sources - such as news papers, indipendant magazines and journals, a few major websites, etc. As well as helping to prove the truth of something, this also makes it clear that the subject in question is considered to be important to those outside of it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 23:40, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> Just want to reply to Bootstoots. Since when does any movement have to be "notable" to be legitimate? That's absurd. If you knew anything about Christianity then you would know that it's roots are notorious... far from notable. In fact is was subversive... made people angry... got it's founder executed (ie. the crucfixion). And as to the "ad" comment, how is explaining the purpose of a church an ad? Your logic is obviously prejudiced. Wikipedia is a place to share knowledge and information. Leave you prejudices behind or go elsewhere. If Bare Naked Church is deleted then by God we better delete all citings for all religions and non-religions (ie athiesm / secular humanism). See where this can lead?

Why not consier a wikichrist wiki for such information? (name an example alone, no offense intended).

Just another thought. I just came from the BareNakedChurch.com site. Did any of you who want to delete their article happen to notice that they have NO commercial activity on their site? They don't sell anything. Heck, they don't even ask for donations. How can being on Wikipedia be advertising for them?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Avertisting does not have to mean commercial avertising. Advertising is defined as the promotion of products, goods and services. There is nothing to stop anyone advertising for members for a group, or advertising something free to all. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 23:47, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Hi LinaMishima. I thought nobody was reading these things. Thanks for responding. What I'm saying is that they are new. You're not going to be able to cross verify their existence. As for the advertising discussion, again advertising is for products and services to which they are offering neither. The site and some really cool graphics are all free. I suppose if you consider Christianity and Christ a service or product they are advertising. I don't consider religious organizations either. My premise is that should someone be able to come to Wikipedia and get some general info on this church or any church? I think so, otherwise this site is the one that should be deleted. Frogman61. Oh, and why can't every church be mentioned? It's the purpose of Wikipedia... info sharing! Let's not get away from the purpose.
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> The positive aspects of a church, just like those provided by any community, are indeed a service. Moreso, churches are significantly bolstered by increased awareness of their existance, giving good reason to advertise them. If something is so new that you cannot verify their existance, then it is clearly obvious that they are currently of little importance. Wikipedia also suffers from a problem called <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentism_cde3.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentism">Recentism</a>, that new things are more likely to be listed than old things, even if said new thing will be quickly forgotten about in the grand scheme of things. Wikipedia is not for information sharing, it is an encyclopedia - you may find <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> informative in this matter. As such, all articles in wikipedia need to be verified. Again I suggest the idea of a christian based wikisite for all such information, since this would be far more appropriate <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:25, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>My last shot... they must be a church. They're getting their share of censorship and persecution... even here. So much for tolerance for everyone's ideas. When will we start the PC burnings? Finally, there are zero deletes for The Church of Satan and many other so called "churches" on Wikipedia. My question, who's to say what church is legitimate or not? Isn't that what this boils down too? I'm done!</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> If you look at the article <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Of_Satan_ef5c.html" title="Church Of Satan">Church_Of_Satan</a>, you will note that it has many strong references and is clearly notable to many people, as it is the official organisation for a religion. We are not censoring or persecuting, indeed, you will see us repeatedly explaining our reasons - reasons, might I add, that are not just wikipedia policy, but the very premise of scientific practice, such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>.We are not deciding on the legitimacy of anything, only on the appropriateness of a subject to be in wikipedia - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not the absolute truth of everything</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:30, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> If the prereq for entries is notability then Wikipedia is a contradiction. Think of the thousands of articles that are not references, cross check, notable. If the point is that Wikipedia is scientific, then no religion qualifies. This is not a scientific issue or notability issue. Just look at their freakin site. It's a NEW church. People may come here (but I doubt it) to get some info on them. Will it be allowed or not? LinaMishima, get some rest, looks a bit late/early there. This is Frogman1961.
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> If there are articles that you feel cannot be verified, then by all means, see if they have been AfDed before and nominate again. Although it is polite to discuss this first on the talk page. And fyi, <i>theology</i> is the study of religion in a scientific manner, and <i>history</i>, clearly an aspect of social science, is highly influenced by religion. Stating it is "New" again does not help it's case - new things rarely have much cause to be notable. I assure you I'll look after myself well, thank you for your concern.

<p>The church of subgenius is not a church as defined in the article on wikipedia. They're a parody. Rather Notable? Is that notable or not, or opinion? How about the list of Metropolitian churches referenced under <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a>? I have a friend that works for them? They are loosely affiliated with a denomination (as is BareNakedChurch). I guess I'm wondering if someone wants an outside source about BareNakedChurch, shouldn't they be able to find some info here?

<dd>It's not a christian church, no - it's a church as in a religious gathering. Nor is it just a parody, it was founded in 1953, has a number of publications, and followers. The <i>rather</i> of "rather notable" was an opinion, but the <i>notable</i> was not - the article has the references, you are free to look at them. With respect to an outside source - wikipedia needs one itself! This has been explained several times. BareNaked Church would be better served by you spending your time talking about it to news agencies and the like - which would also give us the reference we need to be able to keep the article. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 22:55, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I can understand the reason for submitting this.

He's been profiled in mass-circulation mainstream publications like the New Yorker and the San Francisco Guardian, and is attracting a lot of attention.

<li>Having been involved with several Commonwealth universities in four Commonwealth countries and having visited several US universities, I do think there is at least a difference of emphasis between US dorms and Commonwealth Colleges and Halls. So let us use Commonwealth nomenclature and Commonwealth precedents rather than US ones. The way these Commonwealth Colleges and Halls are dealt with on WP varies. Some universities have separate articles and some have collective articles. One example of the latter is <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Exeter_Halls_of_Residence_b68a.html" title="University of Exeter Halls of Residence">University of Exeter Halls of Residence</a> that arose after a very similar broad Afd discussion earlier this year. Another is <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monash_Residential_Services_bef8.html" title="Monash Residential Services">Monash Residential Services</a>, again after a broad Afd discussion. The different title is because that page existed for the organisation that manages the Halls. I agree with the nom that many Hall articles are vanity and are often the first article written on Wikipedia by a member of the Hall. They can suffer from vandalism. Nevertheless they can be made into usefull articles. I think readers of WP have an expectation to be able to find NPOV information on University Colleges and Halls. They are very significant parts of many Commonwealth Universities, particularly the older more established Universities such as the University of Otago. So my view is to <b>keep</b> them all. If that is not the consensus I would support keeping the two Colleges which are really quite notable and which have links to the Church and the training of ministers, and perhaps some others, and <b>merge</b> the rest into a new article University of Otago Halls of Residence. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 00:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In line with that thinking, I would say that <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massey_University_db38.html" title="Massey University">Massey University</a> has something in the line of 'dorms', effectively just different blocks of the same, with shared dining facilities. Some of the newer Colleges here (NB: the university is in the process of changing all of their institutions to 'colleges') are more dorm-ish, but the older ones are moving toward a more Oxford/Cambridge sense of College (albeit perhaps only midway on that continuum).--<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 01:19, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment: "Wikipedia caters for a multitude of viewers and ex-residents find articles about their former halls very useful about who to contact re: reunions etc. I believe that calling the Halls of Residences (now all offically colleges) dormitaries violates the very tradition in Otago. Some of these halls, eg Selwyn and Knox are officially registered as historic buildings. Infact, Selwyn College is the most popular Hall in New Zealand. We need to keep these articles on Wikipedia so they can be enjoyed by the many people that look them up" Lloyd Burr</p>
<ul>
<li><b>merge</b> into a single article, none are individually notable (though as others mentioned, some are borderline).

<p><b>Knox and Selwyn are not 'dorms'!</b> Both deserve keeping even outside of their university context, if only for the buildings, history, and alumni. And of course Salmond's shouldn't be merged with Knox's, the one and only similarity is the joint-ownership and governership at a board (not management) level. Understand rationale behind not including 'dorms' but both are prestigious colleges with returning students, illustrious histories and significant buildings. They certainly have an identity outside the university, in a way that other halls at the university simply don't.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I see your point, but I think the argument is that he's known <i>for</i> his SF escapades, not that his fame is strictly limited to SF hardcore fans.

<li>Instead of writing the article off immediately why can't we discuss how it might possibly be useful?
<p>Please evaluate the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the analysis provide reliable information in a manner that does not qualify it as opinion?</li>
<li>Does the article take sides on the issue - conservative or liberal - or does it raise a valid issue unrecognized by tertiary sources?</li>
<li>Does the article start with a clear premise - that judicial activism is the opposite of what conventional thinking is today. Does it show the whole issue to be misunderstood.</li>
<li>Each section can be sourced by legal and expert citation (some are) - in other words it can be backed up by facts which when viewed as a whole more than justify the position.</li>
<li>Can a reasonable person see such value in it that it should surmount the rules of original thinking.</li>
<li>Is it <b>reality</b> that qualifies as unspoken rules, exposes a deeper politic, or so goes against the grain of conventional wisdom that makes it dangerous to the author to expose?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I am aware of the fact that WP takes on a certain burden by publishing original thought. But if you establish rules, strict rules, by which such OT can be included you will eliminate political diatribe. You will be able to justify to those who would attack you that such articles are of such value, meet such strict requirements, that it would be censorship to delete them.
<p>One has to admit that the impression WP gives as being open and free is at odds in rare cases with the OT rule. It opens the encyclopedia to the accusation that it has as members thought police who strike well founded ideas. Is the growing view among many other forums that the encyclopedia is dominated by those who will not allow dangerous ideas more destructive than rasing the ire of those who are threatened by truth?</p>
<p>There is a difference between being ungovernable and being averse to rules which can be considered extreme and repressive.</p>
<p>Please discuss the views at length and do not reject it by knee jerk reaction. I have no doubt that in the end it will deleted but at least give me the courtesy of thinking outside the box with an extended discussion before you do it.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as original research. In response to the questions being raised above me, I'll make a handful of comments. Firstly, the article certainly provides <i>information</i> of some kind. As to whether or not it's <i>reliable</i>, it's hard to tell without sources. Perhaps I have my historian-blinkers on, but making a judgement about reliability is much easier when I know where you've got the information from. The second point, insofar as I can speak to it without a legal background, is largely irrelevant. If the article raises a valid point that tertiary sources don't consider, then it needs to be written as a secondary source elsewhere. We're a tertiary source here (that's what being an encyclopedia means), so any valid points raised would need to start life outside before coming in. Where the third point is concerned, I think it probably starts with a relatively clear premise, but that's not the point of an encyclopedia article either. We're presenting facts rather than arguing from premises - we leave that to the sources we cite. The fourth point is patently inaccurate as far as "some are" goes. There are a number of phrases in quotation marks, true, but no indication anywhere of where these phrases come from - leaving the question of whether they are the opinions of an expert or from the fertile mind of the contributor, rendering them as original research. In relation to the fifth point, I consider myself a reasonable person and can see the value in having such issues raised outside of this site - I don't, however, see the point in raising them here to start off with in this form when it goes against policy which already exists. The sixth remark makes little sense to me, as I don't think you're exactly putting yourself in any grave danger by writing anything on this site. Of course, were you to be a judge or a politician and known to be either, you may well be putting your job on the line by writing about judicial activism. As it stands, I don't know. Further, I don't see why expressing a possibly dangerous opinion is a reason to keep an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 11:40, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank You - Even though you voted to delete me!
<p>I greatly appreciate the time you took to consider each of my points.</p>
<p>Before deleting let me cite the article in response to your first critique.</p>
<p>As to the second critique the problem with peer review is that they do not allow some information to become tertiary. There are issues that certain professions do not want generally known and will not allow to be published. The a powerful minority of judges and lawyers see the vast increase in judicial discretion as source of power and profit. NO SECONDARY SOURCE will be allowed to publish a critique on it therefore no peer review can be had. Please believe that even if you are a journalist in a completely unrelated field you do not want to end up in court with your name on such an article</p>
<p>As to the second critique I am not suggesting that all articles should be open to analysis. KEEP the current philosophy intact concerning original articles.</p>
<p>But why is it that WP <b>must</b> be a traditional encyclopedia on a non-traditional more powerful media? Why can it not find a way to be an encyclopedia++.</p>
<p>See Downie's Dictionary for LTWR 600 definition of Encyclopedia -</p>
<dl>
<dd>More in depth study of a person or other topic than a dictionary entry, articles may have attribution and references or be more analytical in the subject-specific works.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>One way is to allow articles that meet the current standards to be allowed a link to an alternative analysis if such analysis meets very strict guidelines for original material. Again, I am suggesting a two tier approach much like a legal appeal. One initial premise and one response both which are credible well thought out and cited. All legal appeals are original material and there are very strict guidelines for how arguments are made. This is to say to those who hold the opinion that original material cannot be distinguished from analysis are not correct. It very well can and has a long history of being done. For those who doubt this please visit your local appeals court and check out an appeal file. It is public record and it is done all of the time. My experiences show me a solution of which others may not be aware.
<p>As to your third critique starting from an objective premise allows administrators to immediately determine if the article is analysis or opinion. If it is considered analysis then the administrator can evaluate if the logic follows the premise by fact based syllogism. This is the whole point I am trying to make - not all original material should be struck for that reason.</p>
<p>As to the fourth critique I will site sources - one was sourced as Alexis De Tocqueville but I will make it a proper citation.</p>
<p>Finally, if someone does not like what WP is doing then you can suffer an increase in vandalism and criticism. I would hope that you would be able to stand up to this. I am not worried about dangerous articles providing the justification for non-deletion, I am worried about dangerous articles being targeted for deletion. Please consider allowing more in-depth study of issues which have not made it, or cannot make it, into the realm of “ authoritative sources”. Let original material stand or fall on facts and analysis and push it into a second tier.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a redirection link may function like deletion of that particular case. In some other case, a redirection link may work as an ad hoc arrangement, pending creation of sufficient contents for that particular page. The page, Ancient Pakistan either requires a distinct page or no page at all. However, a redirection link indicates that the page requires preservation. As such, I have reverted the edits and restored the contents. I place the page before a larger body of wikipedians for their assessment and views. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 10:52, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The area has an interloping and connected history with India, so ideally there should be only one article to discuss the ancient periods for India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> as per Kjkolb. Sorry Bhadani and Nirav, but I think in this case, there is little need to keep this page. Pakistan as an entity never existed prior to partition.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the delete tag was heavy-handed and approaches disrespect of some of our most productive editors. This could have been handled through simple, in-depth discussion to avoid hard feelings. While the content of this article does appear to duplicate much of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Pakistan_a77c.html" title="History of Pakistan">History of Pakistan</a>, the "History of Pakistan" article does seem quite long (it's 70kb) and it is normal for such long national history articles to be split into articles covering specific historical periods in greater detail. Ancient Egypt and Ancient China, for example, have in-depth articles of their own, and Pakistan is home to one of the four first river civilizations in the world, so there's no shortage of information about it. Since the "History of Pakistan" has grown too large, that article's individual sections on ancient history (some of which are quite in-depth) could be split out into the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Pakistan_07de.html" title="Ancient Pakistan">Ancient Pakistan</a> article. But that is just one idea. <b>Proposal</b>: let's cool things down, remove the delete tag, and discuss respectfully. I hope people will be thoughtful about this and genuinely consider the material at hand, and what will be most beneficial to the content and our readers rather than being hot-headed about this. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 23:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b>. I've checked the two articles and everything has already been covered in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Pakistan_a77c.html" title="History of Pakistan">History of Pakistan</a> article. If the History of Pakistan article is too long, we need a new article, but to "Ancient Pakistan" is not an appropriate title (Na, na I am not anti-Pakistani).

<li><b>A rejoinder:</b> At the outset, I would like to submit that tagging the page for deletion had nothing to do with any intent of showing any disrespect to any editor or group of editors – productive, un-productive; adamant or lenient, or otherwise. The page was facing problems akin to an “edit war” and edit summary like “Jesus…”; and under the circumstances, it was a signal that editor/s concerened did not deem it fit to have any discussion. As such, it was necessary in the interest of building the Project, to bring the issue to a wider audience of wikipedians. Having said this, I would like to state that implicit in the re-direction is acceptance of the fact that our users shall come to search for a page named Ancient Pakistan. As such, in my opinion a requirement exists for a separate page for Ancient Pakistan. The topic is perhaps being dealt with only in this style in many books of history though immediately I could not lay my hands on any such book. We all know that our opinions on any issue and the consensus would not change the historical truth. We have example(s) like page(s) <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_sub-continent.html" title="Indian sub-continent">Indian sub-continent</a>, which had remained as a re-direction-page for long until some one knowledgeable came to add appropriate contents. Accordingly, It looks highly unusual to keep the present (and future) contents relating to history of people of Pakistan of ancient time in the page <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Pakistan_a77c.html" title="History of Pakistan">History of Pakistan</a> and give them treatment and coverage as if there were an entity like Ancient Pakistan, and at the same time deny the same contents to an independent page named Ancient Pakistan. Are we creating sum total of human knowledge or contracting the same into minimum number of pages? While I do not believe in unnecessary fragmentation of topics and pages, I do believe that we should have necessary pages as required to build the Project. The business of merger and redirection in this fashion, if done on a continuous basis, may lead to a position when all pages relating to historical matters would lead to a single page named – History. However, as suggested by <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a>, we may rename this page, say, Ancient History of people of Pakistan or some similar name which does not tantamount to original research and/ or neologism. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 08:41, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> requires publicly released sources. In practice, these have varied from conventional published sources, such as books, magazine, newspaper, and academic journal articles, to highly unconventional sources, such as published films and video games. Indeed, many articles about films rely primarily the films themselves as references. However, the ability of "faculty and staff... [to] verify... [the newspaper's] history and existence" does not identify a publicly released source, and thus cannot serve as a valid reference.

<p>Advertorial for a privately-held software company, albeit with some notable clients. There are two options: aggressive cleanup or deletion. The quality of this article is so low that leaving as-is is not an option, in my view. A quick fix is to stub it, but then it would almost be a speedy candidate since there is very little which is neutrally stated in here. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:55, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Crimson Empire</i>, if I'm remembering correctly, was the title for two comic book mini series set after the events of <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Empire_4ca3.html" title="Dark Empire">Dark Empire</a></i>, published by Dark Horse Comics. If I owned the trade paperback collections I'd be tempted to rewrite the article myself. I also vaguely recall that there were hints to the much larger <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Jedi_Order_2a13.html" title="The New Jedi Order">New Jedi Order</a></i> novel series that followed these two comic mini series. I don't know how notable these would be considered, even by hard core fans, though - Dark Empire's main claim to fame is that that mini-series was the first new original Star Wars comic book series since the end of the Marvel Comics Star Wars run in the 1980s. So I'd say <b>Delete</b> unless someone can come in and accurately improve the page with information from these two mini-series. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 00:20, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The current version as well as that suggested by user Anirvan does not deal with the topic. Anti-Bhraminism is akin to anti-racisim. It is a struggle to uproot an inhuman philosophy of Bhraminism of graded inquality (the caste system) and its evil effects destitution, poverty, Bonded labour(slavery), untouchability. Just as anti-racism does not mean a campaign against 'whites' , Anti-Bhraminism does not mean a campaign agains Bhramins. The article does not mention the philosophy of Bhraminism and presents a lopsided POV and pretends that Bhramins are victimised. There is no evidence of that. on the contrary there is excess evidence of the oppression by Bhramins (the so called upper castes) againts the Lower castes. The article has to start with the philosophy of Bhraminsism and How its Inhuman.
<dl>
<dd>Regarding ethinic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits ( Bhramin caste) from Kashmir by Islamic militants, this is a political issue and all hindus irrespective of their caste have suffered and had to leave kashmeer. This problem of ethinic cleansing is not peculiar to Kashmiri Bhramins. Kashmiri Bhramins plight has been redressed by affirmative action (<a href="../../../r/e/s/Reservation.html" title="Reservation">reservation</a>)by the goverment. This issue is not related to this topic --<a href="../../../y/e/d/User%7EYeditor_eb55.html" title="User:Yeditor">Yeditor</a> 06:12, 6 August 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../y/e/d/User%7EYeditor_eb55.html" title="User:Yeditor">Yeditor</a> 08:24, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This topic should not be confused as similar to Anti-Semitism as some (user Netaji) would want others to believe. Anti-semitism is hatred against a particular creed. Anti-Bhraminism is a strugle against a particular inhuman hindu philosophy("Bhramanvad" in hindi) of caste hierarchy and discrimination which was originally written in scriptures and propogated by Bhramins

<dd>They are different. Bhraminism is not necessarily practiced by all Bhramins. Bhraminism is practiced (much more) by other Hindu castes as well, (baniyas,Kurmis, yadavs, marathas) The recent burning of dalit village of 'Gohana' by the 'Jats' is an example. I have no hatred for Bhramins. Please wait till I put up the racist philosophy of Bhraminism as written in their scriptures, No sane man in this world can support it. You are obviously trying to spread misinformation. the oppressed classes are at the recieving end due to this philosophy, not the oppressors.(There have been 5 bhramin prime ministers in India though their population is less than 2%. Is this discrimination against bharmins or preference) --<a href="../../../y/e/d/User%7EYeditor_eb55.html" title="User:Yeditor">Yeditor</a> 04:33, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems Holy Warrior has little knowledge of the Caste system. In fact it is the Christians who discriminate against the dalits the most. Only 3% of their leaders are dalits, while all across India, educated dalits well versed in the Vedas are becoming priests in mandirs. The vast majority of Sanskrit students are former untouchables. But yes, HolyWarrior is no authority on Hinduism so ignore his rants.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub> 16:05, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> entry says that lists of dictionary definitions should not be kept, but glossaries of specialized terms should. This creates a great deal of disagreement about what the policy really means. Is this page a forbidden 'list of definitions' or an allowed 'glossary of specialized terms'? This repeated bickering over that ambiguity on each article is ridiculous... as is the claim above that "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is unambiguous on this"... it really really isn't. People should leave off the deletion wars and discuss the <b>policy</b> itself to clearly define what we do and do not incorporate. If 'glossaries' are no longer going to be allowed (though that has been in the policy for a long time) or redefined to exclude pages like this then we should move to Wiktionary... but the proper course of action is to work on a consensus for that policy. Not declare jihad and battle over every involved page. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 00:14, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is not a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_glossaries.html" title="List of glossaries">glossary</a>. Whatever overlap there might be between glossaries and dictionaries, a list of dialect words is not affected by any change that does not expressly allow lists of dictionary definitions.

<li>Please <i>read</i> the page you link to... "This is a list of glossaries (pages containing terms and their definitions or explanations).". In what way is the article under consideration <i>not</i> a 'page containing terms and their definitions'? You keep saying that current policy is unambiguous on this case. I'm sorry, but that really just is not true. Current policy says that lists of definitions are not allowed, but glossaries are... which is inherently ambiguous, no matter how many times people say it isn't, because glossaries ARE lists of definitions. That's what a glossary <i>is</i>... and indeed exactly how the word is defined on the page linked from the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> entry. The policy is self-contradictory, and <i>that</i> is the issue we should be addressing... because until that is resolved these deletion debates are meaningless. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:06, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I did read the page I linked to. <i>Glossaries</i>, as you can see from the list, are compendiums of specialized terms used in particular fields of competence (mathematics, law, medicine). The term for a general compendium of words in a particular language or dialect is <i>dictionary</i>. If there is any ambiguity between the two terms, it is restricted to, say, compendiums of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584320265" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584320265" rel="nofollow">legal terms in Creole</a>, not to standard dicdefs or colloquialisms in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/002-2927343-5978407?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=creole+dictionary" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/002-2927343-5978407?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=creole+dictionary" rel="nofollow">Creole</a>. I can only guess why the disctinction was made to allow glossaries, but my best guess is that 1. they tend to be lists of blue links, and 2. they are useful as quick references to understand articles on topics in the particular field. We have articles on medicine and law, but we don't have articles in Creole or Trinidadian English, so the need for quick reference isn't given and the entries can be treated like any dicdefs, by listing them in and linking to Wiktionary. And that doesn't even broach the verifiability or copyvio problems of this or similar articles. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 23:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is not a crystal ball - but then, this article does not try to be one.

What mistake? The title Rapunzel Unbraided has been changed to just Rapunzel not just on Wikipedia, but also on imdb. It is also simply called "Rapunzel" elsewhere on the net. "Unbraided" was original added because of the Shrek-like plot, but now when the movie is going in a more serious direction, the name has changed with the plot. My suggestion is to not delete anything before it is documented that the movie will keep its original title. (And just to mention it; Georgia guy has a bad habit of calling all edits for "vandalism" for some reason, which is NOT the correct way to use Wikipedia.) Rhynchosaur 00:17, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact is that you are using the word "vandalism" far too frequently. Quote: "Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change to content, made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia. The most common type of vandalism is the replacement of existing text with obscenities, page blanking, or the insertion of bad jokes or other nonsense. Fortunately, this kind of vandalism is usually easy to spot. Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism." And as you may know, my intention was to improve Wikipedia, not vandalize it. Rhynchosaur 01:52, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rhynchosaur, the mistake was in performing the pagemove incorrectly. It is improper to do so by copying the text to the new name and redirecting. See <a href="../../../m/o/v/Help%7EMoving_a_page_3be0.html" title="Help:Moving a page">Help:Moving a page</a>. It would expedite discussion of whether the page should be renamed or not if you would agree that the new page should be deleted (pending a possible <i>proper</i> page move). <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 00:54, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I know see how to do it. This was my first attempt in removing a phage, so I'll do it correct next time. But I'm pretty sure the phage will be renamed in the future nonetheless, even if there are few who are accepting this for the moment. Rhynchosaur 01:52, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tagged this page {{unref}} five days ago, and left a message on the Talk page, with no response. The page describes a religion or cult (it can't quite make up its mind) which I have never heard of and about which I can find virtually no information elsewhere.

An exception is <a href="http://www.webpost.net/ha/Harmonism/" class="external text" title="http://www.webpost.net/ha/Harmonism/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which looks like a <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made-up religious document</a>. The page is currently disambiguated, but I am unsure whether the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facial_symmetry.html" title="Facial symmetry">facial symmetry</a> meaning of the term is enough to merit a redirect (about 42 google hits for <i>facial harmonism</i>). <b>Delete both</b> this page and the redirect Harmonist. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 17:49, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b>Can anyone tell me why this page needs to be deleted? I disagree. Look at almost every other game show Wikipedia entry. There's always at least a section or two devoted to the show's set evolution. The Price is Right, Family Feud, The Joker's Wild, and Bullseye are just a few of many that have such "set" entries or detailed descriptions in their Wikipedia pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted, I originally wrote the "Set" evolution page and original section on the main Jeopardy! page, but saw it unnecessarily deleted time after time after I'd re-included it. The evolution of a game show's set is as important as the entry to the show itself on Wikipedia, as it is as important to the show's history itself. If you're in doubt, go buy the book "This is Jeopardy!" Each chapter (set to year-by-year or season-by-season) intro begins with an entry on the set changes that year.</p>

<li><b>Strong Move Out of Wikipedia Article Space</b> It's great that he's such a prolific editor but this does <i>not</i> make him encyclopedically notable. Remember its not just notability, its <i>encyclopedic</i> notability. Being covered in a couple of newspapers or even more source is not proof either - as I keep saying, much or even most of the material carried in mainstream news sources every day is non-encyclopedic, and we shouldn't just make articles based on whatever's covered in the news. There is a place for this kind of page but not in the main article space. I recommend a Hall of Fame page for editors who are extraordinarily prolific. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">User:Lord_Emsworth</a> (who has also been mentioned in major media sources such as <i><a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_magazine.html" title="Wired magazine">Wired</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i> but not by his real name or in as much detail), for instance, would be on such a list as well. Note that keeping the Simon Pulsifier article as an encyclopedia article also discriminates against extraordinary editors like Lord Emsworth who prefer to be less revealing about their true identity and avoid Media labels such as "King of Wikipedia" (not enough detail known on Emsworth for an article - but certainly enough for a Hall of Fame list). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:42, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is hardly "discriminatory", as our job is to record notability in the world at large (and yes, Wikipedia is part of the world, which is exactly the point), not to reward profilic contributors. If another profilic contributor chooses to avoid media interviews, then he <i>should</i> be left out because he <i>isn't</i> notable, just as some guy with a billion dollars who nobody's ever heard of would be left out of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Category%7EBillionaires_e18c.html" title="Category:Billionaires">Category:Billionaires</a>. —<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 07:10, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>This article started out suggesting Miika Forssell was "most probably" a game designer on the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Payne_dc8c.html" title="Max Payne">Max Payne</a> series who died and has a memorial shrine easter egg in MP2. The article was prodded as completely unverified, probably not notable, and suggesting only a note in the Max Payne 2 article about it <i>if</i> a reliable source for who this person was could be located. The article has since been edited to give a source for who this person was, and it turns out the late Mr. Forssell was a fan of the series and a regular poster to the Remedy forums. While this does (very) slightly improve the verifiability situation, this pushes the guy down the notability scale hard. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 20:10, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> On second thought... I agree with the consensus that this list as it stands-- a simple alphabetical listing of titles-- is redundant to the categories. However, a list can be informative in a way that a category cannot. For example, just reordering the list chronologically would be useful in a way that an alphabetically-ordered category is not. Also other information can be put after the title-- for example the director, author or studio that produced the anime. Reordering the list chronologically would be a lot of work, but, I think, useful. Just an idea. --<a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 17:11, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Further thought on the matter: By doing the list chronologically, we could break the article down into decades. <i>List of 1960s anime</i>, <i>List of 1970s anime</i>... A paragraph summary of anime activity in each decade could be put at the top of each article. This would address the problem of the list's unwieldy size, make the article into not just a category/list, but a historical chronology of the development of anime (with a list of every anime, which is beyond the scope of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_anime.html" title="History of anime">History of anime</a> article), and also be helpful for those of us who are interested more in one particular era of anime than others. --<a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 20:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Decade/chronologically would be my recommendation. As for it being "unmanagable," that's because the article just throws everything together, in an alphabetical list. In other words, it's just a category. Separate it by decades, and I, for one, would work on the '60s, and I'm sure others would work on other decades that they are interested in. As I've said before though, the article currently is redundant to the categories. But a list can be made into a more informative article than a category can be. Put them in order by when they were made, add info after the title like studio, creator, etc., add an intro paragraph describing activity/trends for the decade... and we would have something of value. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 20:24, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've voted above, so I don't want to give an appearance of trying to vote twice, but I do want to address several of the comments made. Most of the negative votes seem to be either "I don't like it/or find it useful so no one else needs it." or "the page is redundant with various category listings". The first one is pretty subjective, don't you think? Just because Johnny Mecha the mecha expert, doesn't find anything new in this list, doesn't mean that Suzy Newbie, who has just discovered anime, won't. I consider myself pretty well-read about anime, and I've found new stuff here (usually either new shows or alternative names for older shows, but that's beside the point I'm making). As to the Catagory complaint, first of all, while there are certainly trends in anime, one of its appeals is that many shows don't really fit in well into 3 or 4 simplistic pigeonholes. And also, it assumes knowledge of what category the show you're looking for fits in. For instance, someone looking for Sazae-san: they have heard of it, but know NOTHING more than the name (that's why they're searching for more information). They're not even certain of the spelling. With this list, all they need to do is look in the "S" section, and they find the link. It's easy and helps newbies learn more about the subject. I certainly see the point that the size may be a problem, but there are certainly longer listings on Wikipedia (I've just looked up 'Volcanoes" and 'Fish') and I can find nothing about maximum sizes of such listings. Certainly, if this list gets too big for one page, go ahead and break it up into 2 or 3 (or more) pages by letter. I do like the idea above of a chronological listing, probably by decade. BTW, if anyone is really serious in trimming articles which have grown too large, I would suggest looking at the entries for many popular movies, TV shows or novels, which seem to attempt to include every unnecessary minor plot detail, sometimes two or three times. <a href="../../../c/f/l/User%7ECFLeon_0a91.html" title="User:CFLeon">CFLeon</a> 08:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not about it being so long, but being hard to maintain. It is much easier to maintain a category than a list. Also, you said "<i>With this list, all they need to do is look in the "S" section, and they find the link.</i>", they'd be able to do this via category too.. I've converted a few list articles into categories in the past, and the appearance of the category page vs the article were almost exactly alike. The only difference is you can't put in some form of note or something next to a category entry, but considering how much better maintained a category is likely to be vs a list, I think it's a fair trade off. And as Nihonjoe pointed out to me above, you can use redirects for alternative titles, since you can categorize a redirect. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 08:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I voted above to delete, and I stand by that vote, since the article as it stands is nothing more than a category. (It needs to be pointed out however, that there is actually no large "anime" category listing every anime article in alphabetical order, but a bewildering page full of subcategories which link to sub-subcategories. If the article is deleted, shouldn't there actually be a plain and simple "Anime" category put in place which actually <i>does</i> make this list redundant?) But I agree with your points, CFLeon, and think that it would be worthwhile to create new decade articles listing the anime in chronological order with some info after (for example, see entries I added in the the 'Y' section yesterday, with Japanese, # of episodes, and dates of original airing). <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 20:23, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not because the subject isn't notable or important; it's just too huge to ever be even close to completion. A good category, a poor article. Ifnord 15:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it's much more doable than you think. The only real area of trouble would be older shows from the 70s and such, but if focus is kept on licensed series then even that isn't a problem. I don't believe that there too terribly many (licensed) shows that are missing an article.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 00:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have gone ahead and formatted the <b>Numbers &amp; Symbols</b> section and am willing to do the entire list but will wait until the deletion review is over before that. While I would <i>like</i> to add additional information to the list such as dates, I find that having the three titles takes up a lot of space and additional boxes can end up rather cramped, especially on lower resolutions. It would be nice to get consensus on what information would be liked to be included and how to sort it. Personally, I'm for alphabetical, but if it's wished to be done chronologically it's important to know if it should be sorted by decade, year, or strict date of first airing.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 01:22, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was a member of Tie Guard for several years, and disagree with <a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> on its relevance in wikipedia. As the author of the article, no doubt these comments will largely be ignored. However, other school organizations, frosh information, legends etc of a similar nature are included in wikipedia such as <a href="../../../i/h/t/IHTFP_6f74.html" title="IHTFP">IHTFP</a> at MIT. The <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Faculty_of_Applied_Science_b79e.html" title="Queen's Faculty of Applied Science">Queen's_Faculty_of_Applied_Science</a> contains primarily information about their forsh week activites (in spite of the main <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_University_935c.html" title="Queen's University">Queen's_University</a> page listing many of the same). The <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Francis_Xavier_University_Students%27_Union_224e.html" title="St. Francis Xavier University Students' Union">St._Francis_Xavier_University_Students'_Union</a> lists the names of its executives on the site. The article Greasepole about Queen's University's Engineering mascot has an article. As a tradition that has existed for more than a decade at the University, and is promoted and supported by the faculty itself, not just the student body, it seems justly deserving of an article - Razynder 19:45, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I was a member of Tie Guard in 2004 as well. I don't really understand the reason to merge, beyond an arbitrary metric of importance. It is observable in the policies of wikipedia, that though combining information when it makes sense is encourage, a drive to reduce the number of topics isn't. The entry answer a question someone might have: what *is* tie guard anyway? It may make sense to reference and partially include the entry in other entries like the math faculty page, but I do not see reason to merge the article in fully. That being said, I don't yet fully understand how relationship between articles work in Wikipedia. Albert O'Connor --209.183.151.182 20:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I was a member of Tie Guard in 1999 and 2000. One thing we have to realize that although Tie Guard was supported by the Math Faculty it was a University wide service. Many other faculties on Campus informed their frosh that if they've ever got any concerns or are lost to go to Tie Guard. It was a 24 hour service for all on campus. Not just Mathematics.--Ryan.jenkins 12:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I thought you were referring to the article we're voting on right now. Either you mis-read my comment(s) above, or you are confusing social networking with social bookmarking, but I assume the first. I have <i><b>absolutely nothing against</b></i> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_social_networking_websites.html" title="List of social networking websites">List of social networking websites</a>... it was up for deletion recently, and I voted to keep it, because there are many notable social <b>networking</b> sites. That page also has a lot more statistics and information than a mere category could display. What I was saying is that if <i>this</i> article (being <i>the one we're voting on</i>) could be improved to the same level as <i>that</i> one (which, again, I'm not sure if it's possible - are there really that many notable social <b>bookmarking</b> sites out there?), it'd be worthy of keeping. What I was saying was not hypocritical, because I fully support the other article in its state, which is why it's in my watchlist and also why I help to edit it regularly. <a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 16:48, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but this is bullshit. TELL ME HOW this is any different from scientology. All they do is guess, NO HISTORICAL OR SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT. Just because they got mentioned on the news does not instantly make it a valid religion.

<li>Good lord, how many times do I have to tell you? Its up above in my answer, I've written it twice on the article's talk page. I've sent messages to several of you guys independently. Stop trying to pretend that no-one has told you how this is different. Scientology has been reported on by reliable media sources. That reporting is what Wikipedia covers. Dodgyism has not been reported anywhere. Whether it is true or not is <b>irrelevant</b> - the only issue is has it been reported? Can you cite sources showing it has? Given the answer is "no" then it cannot have a Wikipedia article. Simple, straightforward and now I've told you a total of <i>six</i> times.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the previous decision was over a year ago, and involved only 5 voters, so I hardly think it is definitive. Yes, 3.5 million tuckets is a lot, but no-one is arguing the circuit is non-encyclopedic, obviously it is. Perhaps a few competitors are - perhaps a combined article on its vehicles, or even a list.

To Aoratos' comments above: there are only roughly 100 competitve monster trucks in the world currently. They are vehicles but can also be considered personalities much in the same vein as (I hate to say it) <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling.html" title="Professional wrestling">professional wrestlers</a>, of which there are <i>hundreds</i> on Wikipedia of varying notability. While I myself believe some trucks are inherantly unnotable, ones that compete on a regular basis with the largest promoter of monster truck shows in the world should qualify as notable. I just worry that this is a slippery slope that would lead to the deletion of articles like that of <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Slinger_%28truck%29_1ebf.html" title="Gun Slinger (truck)">Gun Slinger</a>, which, although not a champion, is well known by literally millions of fans in the United States. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EArenacale_187c.html" title="User:Arenacale">Arenacale</a> 15:37, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If they are individually notable and popular, why no fan sites? Why can I find no discussion of 'Archnaphobia', not even on bbs? Why no media interest? Why the Google blank? I'd wager I could find all of that on most professional wrestlers. I'm willing to set a fairly low bar on notability, but I see no evidence that this particular truck even gets of the ground. One plastic toy, is that it? My local church badminton team has its own printed mugs.

<li>Try searching for "Arachnophobia" and "Monster truck". There's quite a bit of links there. Still, there doesn't seem to be a website dedicated to the truck. The idea of having an article on a particular truck still seems a bit absurd to me. Where we do we stop? Do we include articles on individual NASCAR race cars too? Formula 1 cars? I'd like to see that this truck was used in a number of victories, or at least one particularly noteworthy victory.

<li>As to "where do we stop?", I'd like to see some specific guidelines laid out for monster truck notability. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grave_Digger_%28truck%29_0e10.html" title="Grave Digger (truck)">Grave Digger</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot_%28truck%29.html" title="Bigfoot (truck)">Bigfoot</a> are obvious for their notability (and status in pop culture), but I can see where someone doesn't know much about <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eradicator_%28truck%29.html" title="Eradicator (truck)">Eradicator</a> and why exactly it is notable. Unfortunately, Wikibofh and I have been doing most of the work on the Monster Truck articles, and have been somewhat hampered by <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeystuff_da79.html" title="User:Joeystuff">User:Joeystuff</a> who has been creating new articles that only say "<b>(This truck)</b> is a monster truck on the USHRA circuit." The Archnaphobia (sic) article is one of those, and neither of us have gotten to it yet. Whether or not this article is deleted, I'd like to see some more people helping with the Monster Truck category (maybe start a WikiProject), which would at least allow us to establish agreed upon notability standards and organize the category better.</li>

<p>Googlecruft? Like many web sites, Google does funny things on April 1, and for the effort they put into them it is well worth mentioning that in a short section on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>, and providing a list of URLs to these jokes. But this article is absurd, and it borders on copyright infringement for us to not just discuss, but essentially duplicate these jokes here on Wikipedia. On <a href="http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, Google expresses a desire for their holiday logos to not be used on other web pages, and I think it would be fair to assume they feel the same way about their April Fool's Day material.

<p>This is a page about a researcher, but it doesn't state what the outstanding importance of this researcher is to be included in an encyclopaedia; that is, it seems non-notable.

<dd>I fear Prof.Witten must be seriously worried of your love for Prof.Nappi. Jokes apart, your additions to the article are useful (at least now it's more clear what are the research fields in which she works). However, I'm personally still not convinced: <i>One of the major contributions of Dr. Nappi to modern astrophysics was the use of the Yang-Mills theory’s Yangian symmetry to D=4.</i> - can you explain to people not in the field why is this a <b>major</b> contribution?&#160;; <i>Dr. Nappi was deeply involved in finding a relation between approaches to integrability in the Superconformal Yang-Mills theory</i> - did she found this relation? why is simply working on this relation important (Thousands of researchers work on protein folding, a basic problem of molecular biology, but this doesn't make all of them notable.)? The same questions apply for the other contributions listed.

<dd>You really need a good psychologist.. so to talk about your personal problems.. and the fact that you die of envy for those who, in their life, have succeeded, while you obviously haven't. Perhaps.. if you spent less time in front of a PC and more in a Lab doing some research, you too could become famous.. what do you say? BTW: today it's sunday.. you dont have friends to go out with? oh.. I see.. that's why you hate the whole world.. Go out, in the real life, and make some friends!

I don't mind that much about it (it just makes me laugh to hear "get a life" from someone that spent the whole day editing the wikipedia page of an astrophysic professor), but it's bad for Wikipedia to have users personally harassing other users. It's a waste of time and energies (mostly yours). As for succeeding in my work, I'm pretty happy given my age and career, thanks. As for my real life (despite it shouldn't be your concern) I'm happy to tell you today I'm at home because in the two preceding days I had even a bit too much real life&#160;:D.

<dd>Question: the fact that you, "not in the field", might not understand in what proportion the scientists who worked on the Quantum theory, Relativity and the M theory singularly contributed to the creation of these cornerstones of modern physics, means that we must delete the pages of all those people?
<dl>
<dd>A lot of people worked on these three fields. Many are notable; many more are not. There are surely borderline cases -the world is not black-or-white. If I go, for example, reading the page about <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Witten_3887.html" title="Edward Witten">Edward Witten</a> is obvious to me why he's on our encyclopaedia, even if I'm not in the field. This is true for also other less known scientists. For prof.Nappi, this is far from being obvious instead (IMHO). That's why it should be extensively explained, if really she's that outstanding contributor to physics. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclopia_3946.html" title="User:Cyclopia">Cyclopia</a> 23:32, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"I'm personally still not convinced".. and who cares? who are you to judge and censure a page? even more if you understand nothing about astrophysics.. why do you criticize? I am scared of people like you.. the day you are given a little bit of "power", you use it to feel powerful and destroy everything that you dont understand or that you feel might make you feel uncomfortable.. People like you are dangerous.. because you know that you "mean" nothing to the world and therefore, as soon as you get some power, you use it to destroy the others..just to feel a little bit important.--<a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_mcandrews_eaae.html" title="User:J mcandrews">J_mcandrews</a>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with Cyclopia. You could make this kind of "Keep" argument for virtually every single university professor in America. The entire point of being a professor is that you get paid to do research into your specialty, which usually means that if you're any good you come up with new findings. This is only encyclopedia-worthy if your new findings have a great impact on society, not if you're just making a slight tweak to some theoretical framework. — <i><a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a></i> 22:14, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is nothing I see in their profiles hinting they can be sockpuppets. I won't comment the additional fact you're not <i>even</i> an English wikipedia user accusing other people of being sockpuppets... And, oh, I surely "dare" delete anonymous FUD poisoning a civilized discussion on an AfD -<i>this</i> was against the netiquette and the Wikiquette.
