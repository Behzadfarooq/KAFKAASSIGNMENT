<p>No sources have been produced to indicate that this is a recognized genre. So far the article just seems to be based on the fact that some bands have dressed pirate-style at times, or otherwise used pirate themes. See talk page discussion, we have established no way of knowing who is or isn't in this "genre". Adam and the Ants are included since they dressed as pirates during one period, but the sources I've found describe them as "new wave" or "post punk", nothing says "pirate rock" or (worse yet) "piratecore". This may be an attempt to define a new genre rather than document a recognized one. <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Wilbury_5dcd.html" title="User:Ned Wilbury">Ned Wilbury</a> 15:20, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That looks like a blog by a guy involved in some of the bands. I guess the question isn't whether some bands have called themselves "pirate rock" or a similiar name, but whether this is a genre recognized by independant sources. Bands may call themselves many things, but that doesn't make a genre, neccessarily. See Stout Irish Rock. <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Wilbury_5dcd.html" title="User:Ned Wilbury">Ned Wilbury</a> 16:37, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, it's a self recognized genre that a number of notable bands consider themselves to be a part of (e.g., this isn't the 1-band genre that "Stout Irish Rock" is). If notable bands call themselves "pirate-rock", but no one <i>you</i> would consider an "independent source" does, it doesn't mean that the genre doesn't exist or lacks notability.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 16:52, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> neologism for a non-existent sub-genre. If no "independent source" has labeled these bands as <i>Pirate Rock</i> then what they choose to consider and call themselves is irrelevant. If my band and 5 other bands decide to call our version of Zappa-inspired experimental/noise rock "Christian Inspirational Mood Music", that doesn't create a genre of that name referring to our style of music. When the music press picks up on it and starts classifying bands of a certain style with a certain name, that is when it becomes a genre. The bands exist, but the genre does not.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:08, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I never said there were not band dressing as pirates, singing about pirating. It doesn't matter how notable they are... The issue here is that there is no evidence that the term "Pirate rock" has any general usage in relationship to a genre of music. I found a handful of uses of this term in relation to this style of music &amp; many uses was self-referential. Most were printed in local college or entertainment newspapers. There is just no evidence provided at this time that this term has any general usage as a genre. Don't get me wrong... the world needs more pirates to <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism_4df0.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monsterism">stop global warming</a>, I'm just not convinced of this genre.

I don't think we can turn a few references to pirates or "pirate rock" into a <i>genre</i> called "pirate rock" unless we can find references to it as a genre in reputable music press.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is unacceptable. I'm in a Pirate-Core band, and a pretty darn fine one, too.

I'll scan the articles and post them for verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been keeping tracks on the genre since all other bands in it are my peers. As long as there has been punk bands there have been punk bands dressing up as Pirates. The Hard-Core scene is literally littered with Pirate Acts. Then there are pub-rock pirate bands and more kid friendly/Ren Faire pirate acts. There are scenes going on In Washington, Baltimore, Alabama, New York and Texas. You cannot delete this entry. As someone else stated, it will just need to be put back up once one of these bands breaks big.I understand Isotope23's statement that a self given genre lable lacks the legitimacy of the title being bestowed by the press, however if this is such a problem then the article simply needs to be re-named, not deleted.Unkiedev 7:39 EST March 11, 2006</p>
