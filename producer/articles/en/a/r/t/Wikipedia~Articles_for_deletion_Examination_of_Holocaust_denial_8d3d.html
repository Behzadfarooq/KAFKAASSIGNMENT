<p>Sorry, but I can only see this as a soapbox.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article was first expanded from the original <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_Denial_7a44.html" title="Holocaust Denial">Holocaust Denial</a> article because the article itself was focusing too much on the arguments against denial, and not on the aspect of holocaust denial itself (its history, repercussions, etc.). It has existed on Wikipedia for over two years, and since that time its POV has <b>not</b> seriously challenged until now, with this AfD. As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Examination_of_Holocaust_denial&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Examination_of_Holocaust_denial&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history of the article itself</a> shows, nearly all of the disputes involving the articles POV have been from anonymous (or short-lived) users who popped up to declare the article biased -- because it supposedly didn't present detailed equal time "questioning the Holocaust." The issue here is that this article is inherently biased against Holocaust deniers -- which is as it should be. Why? Not because of POV or my own or anyone's despising of Holocaust deniers (deserved or not); rather, because Holocaust denial is itself a hate-spawned, primarily anti-Semitic belief based on wild conspiracy theories. This is not a statement of bias, but rather a statement of fact -- one that has been proven again and again over the years. It <i>is</i> NPOV to state this, because it is a proven fact, backed up by considerable arguments against denial that vastly outweigh the feeble arguments presented by deniers. Consequently, I believe the article <i>is</i> NPOV, because debunking of Holocaust denial as a lunatic fringe belief <i>is</i> a historical fact. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 01:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the article history as illuminated by Modemac.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though possibly re-title - <i>Criticism of Holocaust Denial</i> (as suggested elsewhere) sounds good to me.

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a useful and interesting article and looks well on its way to being well referenced. The <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">holocaust denial</a> article focuses on the movement, personalities involved and the history, this article is about the claims made by the movement and the evidence rebutting them. Seems a significant enough movement that one article isn't enough to cover it. NPOV is good but does not mean giving equal time to fringe theories while leaving them unrebutted. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 02:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This article is Original Research and POV. The nature of this article wishes to argue something, and is mostly argument with some sparse quotes. According to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, "an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source" is Original Research and is not encyclopedic, thus must be removed. So must POV. Even if there is POV on other related cites, that doesnt justify creating more POV to balance it out. Rather, introduce the relevant information in the relevant objective article and change the prose so that it reflects a neutral view point that wishes to present all the facts. <a href="../../../x/l/e/User%7EXlegiofalco_57d2.html" title="User:Xlegiofalco">Xlegiofalco</a> 06:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> with indifference to renaming. Although a decision for or against merging here wouldn't be binding, I'll opine that merging doesn't seem viable due to the length of the two articles. I read the nomination as being that the article is too detailed for an encyclopedia. Maybe... However, Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, which gives us the opportunity to have more depth of coverage on important topics, not just more topics of marginal importance. This much content is not too much in my opinion. (And I note that to the best of my knowledge we don't have any community standards for what constitutes "too much information" on a topic of agreed importance.) I also don't see the original research concern as being real; my read of the article is that the refutations are generally cited to a prior source that used them the same way, which makes the analysis not original. Could more be quoted and cited - sure, but the article wouldn't need to change significantly. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 06:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>. This article is better written than 90% of the articles on Wikipedia, and contains vast amounts of valuable information. While it doesn't make use of proper Wikipedia inline citations, that is easily remedied. I noticed that it uses Lipstadt's book on Holocaust denial as a reference, a book that I happen to own. If the consensus is to keep, I will gladly spend a few days properly wikifying the article. As to the claims above of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, I must respectfully disagree. I know a lot about this subject, and everything I read in this article I have also heard or read elsewhere. In closing, I would like to add that Holocaust denial is a longstanding concern of mine. I think it is vitally important for this project to provide articles that debunk this movement. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 08:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>MERGE</b> and <b>DELETE</b> - Very well written and researched. Fascinating! However, the article does have quite a bit of overlap with the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> article and covers most of the same issues. As the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> article is most likely the more commonly read of the two it would be a shame for readers to miss the material contained in this one. Therefore I recommend merging it with the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> article and then deleting it.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlXII_267e.html" title="User:KarlXII">KarlXII</a> 15:38, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b>. The article is sound, although it is in desperate need of inline references to clearly demonstrate that it is not OR, e.g. that it is a summation of arguments made in other contexts to refute the claims of Holocaust deniers. To that end, it should also be renamed. <i>Examination of Holocause denial</i> suggests that this is an article that will examine and refute certain claims; it would be more neutral to call it <i>Criticisms</i> or <i>Refutations</i> instead. - <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/o/User_talk%7EEronMain_52bf.html" title="User talk:EronMain">Talk</a></sup> 17:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b>. In light of recent comments I am changing my opinion to one of <i>keep</i> and supporting a rename to <b>Criticisms of Holocaust denial</b>. But it should be stressed that the article needs considerable work to reference the content and avoid POV and OR criticism. Contrary to what has been said above, Wikipedia should not set out to <i>rebut</i> notable theories, however objectionable- that sets editors up as critics, something to be avoided. However I accept criticisms of Holocaust denial are widespread and well founded and do deserve to be covered <i>neutrally</i> by Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 17:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article certainly helps in the clarity department.<a href="../../../m/k/6/User%7EMk623SC20K_8362.html" title="User:Mk623SC20K">Mk623SC20K</a> 18:21, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and rename</b> to Criticism of holocaust denial or edit <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> down to a reasonable length and incorporate arguments for and against, or edit down further and incorporate in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, which is where it belongs. Strong feelings have created verbose sprawling and not very encyclopedic articles. The reference style is poor; convert to inline references linked to a reference section. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Edison, the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> article is already 166 KB, and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> is 67 KB. To merge the three together would be an impossible task, without sacrificing important content. It has already been agreed that the referencing needs work; I have said earlier I am happy to undertake the referencing as a project if this article is kept. It seems logical and important to me that this article remains distinct from the denial article, since they, though related, are on decidedly different facets of the subject. To make an analogy, the articles on <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28film%29.html" title="Halloween (film)">Halloween</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_2.html" title="Halloween 2">Halloween 2</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_3.html" title="Halloween 3">Halloween 3</a> are all featured articles, yet some people could easily say to save space they should be merged into one article about the series. This subject is at least as deserving of bandwidth as a series of articles about teen slasher flicks.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and clarify. Merging isn't an option, as both this and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_Denial_7a44.html" title="Holocaust Denial">Holocaust Denial</a> are quite long already.

<li><b>Keep</b> and change the name to 'criticism of...' It should not be merged into <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> because that is about a political movement, and the 'Examination of Holocaust denial' page is an analysis of pseudo-historical claims.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've already made my decision to merge if possible, but still, criticism is still POV. We strive to make things neutral, and to show both sides, not to make an argument for one like a thesis. For example, I could write up a whole article against <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastafarianism.html" title="Pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</a>, and since it most obviously isn't real, could be included into Wikipedia. A few sections in the main article in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> article would suffice to show what others think. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="black">bibliomaniac</font></a><a href="../../../b/i/b/User_talk%7EBibliomaniac15_e27b.html" title="User talk:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="red">1</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">5</font></a></b></i> 06:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
