<li>Noting the post below this one, he does indeed appear to go by Bill rather than William. However, I pretty carefully studied the first 60 of the 181 unique hits I found using this new Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bill+christison%22+9/11+-wikipedia+-answer.com+-%22National+Family+Farm%22+-%22Missouri+Rural+Crisis+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=190&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bill+christison%22+9/11+-wikipedia+-answer.com+-%22National+Family+Farm%22+-%22Missouri+Rural+Crisis+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=190&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which eliminates a few false positives and puts 9/11 into the search (hard to imagine many articles about this gentleman which wouldn't also have that term). I found nothing I would think of as a reliable source that implied notability. The only thing I did find was that he was an interviewee in a film (<a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm1591463/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/name/nm1591463/" rel="nofollow">imdb profile</a>) on the 9/11 conspiracies. I also searched a number of newspaper archives and found nothing but a mention of him as appearing in the foregoing film in the New York Times (<a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&amp;res=9D05E4DD1F3FF933A1575BC0A9629C8B63&amp;oref=slogin" class="external autonumber" title="http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&amp;res=9D05E4DD1F3FF933A1575BC0A9629C8B63&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).

<dd>Take out 9/11 and put in CIA; this will also filter out the farm stuff. The guy is mentioned on the CIA's own site, he is quoted in an Ottawa newspaper; he is cited in Counterpunch, he is in a film that is reviewed by the New York Times. I realize he's not <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> or something, but he's clearly notable.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 02:27, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How does this meet WP:BIO? The only basis I can see that we can try to fit him in is: <i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works.</i> He's not the primary subject of the film, nor of counterpunch nor of anything else cited. What we find is a walled garden of 9/11 conspiracy sources citing him, but when we get to reliable sources, we find almost nothing and what there is, is peripheral. I Simply don't think he meets the criteria.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 02:46, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think some folks might want to reevaluate their votes. Sure, there are a lot of junk sites in the hits, but there are also plenty of notable sources including the CIA's own website.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:44, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If we furthur refine the search by eliminating results with the word "farm" to get rid of the family farm advocate with the same name that number comes down to 94,000 out of which 206 appear to be unique.

<dd>I'm with you to 94,000 - can you demonstrate why 206 are "unique"? My "Bill Christison" + CIA search below gets 77,000 hits. Thanks.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:24, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if you click on page ten or so you'll see that Google omits search results after a certain number (last time I checked it was 206, now its 400-something) - if you display those results you'll see that there are pages and pages of counterpunch articles where Chrisiston is not mentioned but an article of his is linked to in the sidebar. For example if he published an article on January 1, every article after that will link to his until there are enough to push him off the sidebar. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 12:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- if you are relying on the strength of the VIPS article to support inclusion here, that's a poor choice, as the VIPS article is poorly sourced itself (blogs like Commondreams for example). Conspiracy-theory articles are fine, so long as they rely upon mainstream reliable sources and summarize those sources and not the wild fantasies of CT'ers who come to Wikipedia to promote grand illusions of controlled-demolition-the-Jews-did-it-and-10,000-federal-employees-colluded-with-Haliburton-Peak-Oil-Cheney-is-a-Reptillian-Humanoid-LaRouchian-fantasy ideas are slapped together here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton devonshire</a> 00:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed, VIPS is a bad article, but the organization is certainly quite notable, it has been cited in numerous print newspaper accounts, and of course its members have testified before Congress. Again it's not just VIPS for this particular article, however, it's the CIA's own website, as well as over 77,000 google hits. I totally agree with you about people promoting their own bizarre conspiracy theories through wikipedia, but that is not what we have here. Due to a bad google search above (this guy goes by "Bill"), I think a lot of people jumped on the deletionist bandwagon.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
