<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists are not superseded by categories, despite the efforts of some to claim that this is some sort of Wikipedia policy. The fact that an article is a troll magnet is irrelevant to whether it's kept or not (otherwise we'd be deleting <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, for example). However, it should be restricted to those who have been convicted of an offence (as the title states), not just those charged with one (as the intro says). There are no "legal ramifications" to listing those convicted of an offence under the law of any country. Conviction is a fact, not a POV. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:54, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Reply to above: Wrong. Many countries have legislation that deems a conviction 'spent' after a period with no other offending, i.e. it is as if the conviction never occured and the convict ceases to be a convict. It would then be a criminal offence to claim that the person was an offender. See, for example, Rehabilitation of Offenders Act in the UK (unfortunately not covered in Wikipedia). There are similar laws in other places. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 14:52, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What absolute twaddle. The fact of a person's conviction is in the written record. What are you suggesting? That all newspapers have to expunge the stories about a conviction from their archives on pain of criminal charges against the editors? That librarians have to go around with a black pen and cross out the records of the trials from the law reports? A spent conviction merely means you're not legally obliged to declare it (and even then, you would have to in some circumstances, such as applying for a job with children or as a police officer). It doesn't mean you haven't been convicted or you're not a previous offender. It certainly doesn't mean people can be prosecuted for saying you were convicted of such and such a crime if that statement is true. In any case, convictions for serious offences are never spent. A conviction can only become spent if the sentence was a maximum of 2½ years in prison. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 22:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>From <a href="http://www.lawontheweb.co.uk/rehabact.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lawontheweb.co.uk/rehabact.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "The Act makes it an offence for anyone with access to criminal records to disclose spent convictions unless authorised to do so..... <i>It might be possible for a person with spent convictions to sue for libel anyone making allegations about spent convictions, if he or she can prove that the allegation was made with malice.</i>" <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:32, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh come one, of course it's an offence for <i>anyone</i> with privileged access to sensitive information to make it public unless authorised to do so, and criminal records are privileged information. That doesn't mean that information that's already in the public domain doesn't stay there. Convictions are always in the public domain since trials are public and reported in the press. If someone has been convicted it therefore <i>is</i> in the public domain and remains so. It isn't removed from the public domain after their conviction becomes spent. Therefore it is not libellous for Wikipedia to report it. Neither does that webpage say it is, if you actually read it properly. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 13:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The 'anyone' means anyone, not people with privileged access. Of course newspaper archives etc aren't blanked out, I never suggested they were. The point is that a complainant who claims that <i>disclosure</i> of a spent conviction was malicious has a case and the only defence is 'in the public interest'. This exercised the minds of journalists when the Act was passed as you can imagine. Whatever, an interesting side discussion. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:42, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, the list is completely unsourced. Also, Wikipedia is not a sex offender list, especially given the sheer number of sex offenders. Think of WP having a list of people convicted for GTA. Not going to happen. On the other hand, you shouldn't delete lists because a corresponding category exists.

<li><b>Comment</b> The list itself is not libellous, but by having this easily editable list, it is as though Wikipedia is "inviting" vandals to add names of targetted individuals, such as disliked teachers, celebrities or public figures. On the contrary, if the only way a name is to appear on a list is to have a correctly categorised article for the person (if it can survive the new pages review which is far better patrolled than recent changes) then it is far less likely to contain libellous statements. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleOldMe_333b.html" title="User:LittleOldMe">LittleOldMe</a> 11:03, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it does have an article, then it can go in the equivalent category, so the list entry is pointless.

<dd>So what's the point of featuring names in a list if they don't have an article? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 18:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To encourage articles to be created. You seem to be under the misapprehension that everybody who is notable enough to have an article already has one. This is patent rubbish. If that were the case then why are we bothering to edit at all? The addition of new articles and the expansion of existing ones is the whole point to us being here. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:55, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you have a name and a reference, you have enough material to write a stub and categorize it. If you don't have enough material for a stub, why are we including it in wikipedia? We're not a directory of every criminal. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 21:12, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Darn it, Gyr made my point before I could get back to make it, and after I did all the hard work setting it up, too. Bah. To make it anyway - You have a name, and you want to put it on this list because you havea burning need to point out this guy is a convicted child sex offender. There's no article for this heinous person, so you can only put the name on such a list with a reference (as frankly, if you didn't, someone will block you). So, you find a reference. If you have found a reference, you can write a stub. If you have written a stub, you can put the stub in the category. If you have the stub in the category, the list remains pointless trollbait. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 23:05, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Remember the <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragnet.html" title="Dragnet">Dragnet</a></i> disclaimer of "The names are changed to protect the innocent"? Suppose Wikipedia carries such an exhaustive list. What do you suppose would happen if an innocent person with the same name as one on the list is found? What would happen if something illegal happened to that person as a result of that Wikipedia listing (after all, are we going to list addresses, too? I'm sure that would be illegal in some countries)? This is one HUGE <a href="../../../c/a/n/Can_of_worms.html" title="Can of worms">can of worms</a> that we need not open. I repeat and emphasize: <b>delete and salt</b> as keeping it could have huge problems for the Foundation. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 03:10, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Whatever may be the crime, this list would be somewhat vindictive, even without the considerations raised by B.Wind. A category holds articles that hace to be documented. A list can have red links,which is this case would be altogether unfair.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 05:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, also some these people are still alive hence falls under an extra strong dangerous dose of <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues. ANY <b>Vandalism</b> of this page for even a second will make Wikipedia liable for a ton of libel damages as pointed out above. Insane to keep this list. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 14:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because the page will inevitably be vandalised and then we are smack in the middle of a slander lawsuit. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 01:26, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Another good example of a worthless category but a potentially valuable list. What this needs is annotation to make it a useful resource for readers. Also, those users concerned with lawsuits and the like are way off base, since for the time being the identical category exists. What prevents someone from adding Mother Theresa or Walt Disney to the category? Nothing...or I should say the same thing that prevents names from getting added to this list: user oversight. Learn to love it because that's what makes wikipedia work. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
