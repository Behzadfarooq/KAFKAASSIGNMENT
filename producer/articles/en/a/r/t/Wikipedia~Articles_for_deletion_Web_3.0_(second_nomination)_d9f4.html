<p>Neologism without fixed meaning. it's continued recreation should be grounds for deleting and protecting, not recreating as a placeholder. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 23:16, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Clarification:</p>
<p>It's the 2dn nomintaion for deletion for this specific version of the Web 3.0 entry.</p>
<p>There had been <b>9 previous instances of deletions and recreations</b> for the Web 3.0 entry itself (not any specific version) over many months and by different people.</p>
<p>Per metavoid:</p>
<p>"The Web 3.0 entry has been created and deleted over 9 times already. The definition of insanity is trying the same thing again and again and expecting different results.</p>
<p>In other words, the article gets created then it gets deleted, in an infinite cycle.</p>
<p>There will never be a complete concensus on what Web 3.0 is just as there is no complete concensus on what Web 2.0 is.</p>
<p>One way to end this cycle of create-and-delete for this entry is to let the definition emerge spontaneously from contributions that can be validated against widely quoted references."</p>
<p>User Artw states "it's continued recreation should be grounds for deleting and protecting"</p>
<p>What does "deleting and protecting" mean? I can't help but notice that it does sound like censorship even if that is absolutely not the intent.</p>
<p>Given that the Web 3.0 entry (not the current version) was created and deleted 9 times already by different authors at different times, I conclude that it is a clear enough sign that there needs to be a Web 3.0 entry (or 'an entry about Web 3.0')</p>
<p>Marc fawzi 01:52, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what the "deleting and protecting" refers to either. I will leave a query about this on Artw's talk page. It seems to me the case for the article's existing is now self evident. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 02:17, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The namespace should be closed to prevent the creation of futher iterations of the article, all of which will fail <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and require deleting. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 04:35, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>...and that's only if we concede that the continued recreation of the article has any menaing at all. I guess we could equally just decide that though every so often people will increment Web2.0 by 1 and mistakenly think it encyclopedic we're are perfectly happy playing whack-a-mole with it. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 04:47, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If an entry is recreated by 10 different people 10 separate times over the course of many months then one conclusion would be that the Web 3.0 article versions are thus far failing the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> (note: no way to conclude same regarding Web 3.0 article versions in the future unless you have been to the future and can verify) but the flip side of such argument is that the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> itself is failing. If the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> was absolutely self-consistent and self-sufficient then, statistically speaking, it would not be challenged so many times, by so many different authors, on so many occasions, over so many months.</dd>

<dd>Oops. Sorry about that, imisinterpreted the talk page (where 9 deletions are mentioned). Anyone know how to fix that without mangling things further? Also apologies for the rather short and cryptic write up for the deletion nomination - It got edited before I could finish writing it, and I ended up not having time to recreate it properly.

<li>You should have clicked through the technorati results before mentioning them. Most contain "30" not "3.0". Besides, it's not enough to have numbers. With a term like this, there's no reason to assume people are using it consistently.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> You are incorrect. I cited Mark Fawzi, and I created the latest incarnation article (not him), as per comments above. There are other references too - including Tim Berners-Lee, who is quite notable I think. This is starting too look like a witch hunt to me. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 10:01, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have verifiable records of email exchanges with an IEEE contributing editor at Stanford U. regarding an offer to publish that blog entry in the IEEE Transactions on Internet Computing, which I had ultimately declined on the basis that I'm not interested in exposure or coverage by themselves. The reason I'm supporting the creation of a Web 3.0 article at Wikipedia has to do with the educational benefit I believe it would have, epecially as far as Wikipedia's role in the future of the Web.

<dd>That's a long-winded way of saying "it's a blog entry", Where it might/maybe/could be published is of no interest here. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 12:11, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are many Wikipedia articles where blog entries are cited references. What makes this one the exception? Marc fawzi 13:57, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's always a poor hand to play - in most cases it means that nobody has got around to removing them. Generally speaking blogs by joe blownobody are not used as sources and if you see any - feel free to remove them. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 15:49, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Wikipedia policy regarding references concerns the significance of the reference itself. If the reference is widely quoted then it is a significant reference. Marc fawzi 16:40, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
