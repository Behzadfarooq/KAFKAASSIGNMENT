<li>OK, but, first, I don't understand why an infobox constitutes an encyclopedia article. Second, as far as availability of information goes, the info in the infobox came from somewhere (probably on the Internet), and it would be just as easy for users to find that info on the Internet as on a WP article. Why not do something like the following: make the names of the asteroids listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a> link to an external webpage where the info can be found, instead of a WP article that copied the info from that webpage? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:38, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are plenty of external web pages that contain the same information as in <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Italy_c5fa.html" title="Geography of Italy">Geography of Italy</a>. That is no reason to simply link from that article to those web pages, rather than having the information in the encyclopaedia article. We are here to write an encyclopaedia, not to make a collection of external links. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:20, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But we should question the value of a WP article where, as here, <i>everything</i> can be found in a single external link. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 18:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>First: That's true of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Italy_c5fa.html" title="Geography of Italy">Geography of Italy</a>. You haven't put forward any qualitative differences between the two.

<dd>(1) The qualitative difference is in their notability. I'm not suggesting that the "single external link criterion" should solely determine whether a WP article should be deleted.

<li>I would add that info in the infobox doesn't address the question of notability. That the asteroid's eccentricity is x and its perihelion is y are details that simply aren't any more compelling than the size and weight of rocks in the Grand Canyon. <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">Asteroid</a> is a notable topic, and should have its own article. <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%28geology%29.html" title="Rock (geology)">Rock (geology)</a> has its own article. But neither individual asteroids nor individual rocks on Earth should get their own articles, unless there's something notable about them. For example, the asteroid with the largest, or smallest, known eccentricity could get its own article. But having an eccentricity of 0.0294383 just doesn't assert notability. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:58, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's because your concept of notability is entirely subjective. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. We don't include or exclude articles on the basis of what individual editors personally find "compelling". That is a sure route to chaos. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:20, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, I have to <s>point out</s> argue that my concept of notability is in line with the consensus concept of notability that is central to many policies at WP, such as <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and articles are deleted all the time on WP because of lack of that notability. <s>And the fact that the WP community has come to a consensus on what's notable and what's not in many categories (such as businesses), is evidence that notability is not entirely subjective.</s> Second, conceding for the sake of argument that the my concept of notability of many topics and facts is subjective, I would simply disagree that the data at issue <i>here</i>--numerical values of certain physical properties of a given asteroid--is even arguably notable. Such information has no relevance, or even potential relevance, to anybody (unless for example the asteroid is hurtling towards Earth, in which case I would certainly agree it's notable). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 18:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The concept of notability embodied in our guidelines such as WP:CORP is <i>not</i> the concept of notability that you are employing. I repeat: <i>Your</i> concept of notability, based around what you think is "compelling", is entirely subjective. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. Your argument that the data have no potential relevance to anybody is unsubstantiated, and I'm sure that there are astronomers who will disagree, just as there are entomologists who will disagree with those who, like you, might state that articles on obscure species of beetles have no potential relevance. We aren't here to judge knowledge. (The concept of notability employed by WP:CORP et al. doesn't involve Wikipedia editors making personal judgements, notice.) We are here to collect and to summarize it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:58, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for clarifying your earlier statement about notability, and if I had properly understood your earlier statement, your clarification wouldn't have been necessary. I apologize for that, and I have amended my response above appropriately. I submit that the concept of notability I am applying to 1826 Miller, is not subjective, but in line with the concept of notability embodied in WP:CORP and other established guidelines. Those guidelines rely, as you write in your essay, on the axiom that "A subject is notable if the world at large considers it to be notable," and the world at large doesn't deem data notable about an obscure asteroid, per my earlier points and the following replies to your response re: potential relevance, astronomers, and entomologists:</dd>

<dd>Re: potential relevance, I would argue that the burden is on the other side to demonstrate the potential relevance of data about an asteroid, one of &gt;100,000 listed here at WP. Re: astronomers and entomologists: It's the job of some astronomers to catalogue and publish data about asteroids, but even they wouldn't consider (would they?) that data "notable" in the sense required here. Likewise, it's the job of workers at government and other bureaucracies to compile and publish data about local businesses, but even they wouldn't consider (would they?) that data "notable" in the sense required here. In the latter case, WP:CORP has already spoken: that data's not notable. Likewise, a WP article containing nothing but the information about the classification of a species of beetle, should be merged with a list of beetles. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The subject of notability is indeed important. But a comparison between rocks in the Grand Canyon and asteroids in orbit around our sun is not a solid comparison. Listing the individual rocks on <a href="../../../1/8/2/1826_Miller_5c48.html" title="1826 Miller">1826 Miller</a> would be the same as listing rocks in the Grand Canyon (or any other part of earth that has rocks. Each asteroid has a unique set of properties, orbital period etc. That is information that might be looked up by someone. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia of all human knowledge. I would say that each individual asteroid should have its own page <b>if</b> the relevant infobox is fully filled out. I should think we would be well served if someone wanted to put all that information in wiki - because the more facts we have, the better a reference tool we become. I fully agree that if the pertinent information is not filled in, then there is no point in having a single sentence about an asteroid though. --<a href="../../../e/x/o/User%7EExodio_6f59.html" title="User:Exodio">Exodio</a> 20:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The entry for <a href="../../../1/8/2/1826_Miller_5c48.html" title="1826 Miller">1826 Miller</a> or some of these other asteroid entries does not include anything beyond what can be found in an astronomical catalog of data.

(Of course, we would keep any article on Wikipedia that has more to say about an asteroid than just raw data, e.g. <a href="../../../1/_/c/1_Ceres_30f7.html" title="1 Ceres">Ceres</a>.) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am in favor of this. George J. Bendo 16:55, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Correction: it seems Cal Tech is private (have corrected above). Guess that means the website is not in the public domain? or maybe even if it was a public university the website would not necessarily be in the public domain. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:01, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Caltech is private, but <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infrared_Processing_and_Analysis_Center_bcac.html" title="Infrared Processing and Analysis Center">IPAC</a> is a NASA science center. IPAC maintains lots of public archives, although some may seem difficult to understand for non-scientists. George J. Bendo 13:25, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a>. It is (theoretically) expandable, but I'd be hard pressed to think of how, and more to the point, if the current content amounts to no more than the elements of a simple listing or infobox, then it belongs on a list, not as a separate article. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:08, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless something can be found to establish that the asteroid is notable. Otherwise there is no potential for this article to grow beyond a stub. Remember there are over 136,000 numbered minor planets, of which most are only known by their orbital elements and a rough estimate of size. We are an encyclopaedia not an astronomical catalogue! <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaos_syndrome_4c06.html" title="User:Chaos syndrome">Chaos syndrome</a> 09:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> per Calton. This is valuable information to Wikipedia, we should store it somewhere. <a href="../../../b/b/x/User%7EBbx_da7b.html" title="User:Bbx">bbx</a> 20:59, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
