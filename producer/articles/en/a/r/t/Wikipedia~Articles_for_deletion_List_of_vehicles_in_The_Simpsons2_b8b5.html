<li><b>Comment</b> This appears to be a bad-faith listing.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to second the notion for a speedy close on this AfD. This has already been nominated twice. <a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 04:28, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. The vehicles are not a particularly notable aspect of the show. Yes, this has been nominated before, but since both times were "no consensus", I see no problem in re-nominating it. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:39, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As I understand it, it is considered bad faith to re-nom an article less than a few weeks after a previous AfD. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 04:47, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> serious abuse of the system to nominate this the day after it gets off AfD. Also concur with CzG. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 04:44, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to vote on this; although I do think it's a bad-faith nom I agree that it's probably unnecessary list-cruft and fan-cruft. BUT. More important IMO is the fact that, as can be seen by the volatility of a lot of the Simpsons articles (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_neologisms_on_The_Simpsons_2683.html" title="List of neologisms on The Simpsons">List of neologisms on The Simpsons</a> is one example), I think all these nominations of articles on Simpsons minutae are a complete waste of time and energy. Because The Simpsons is a current program (in production currently), and has such a large, obsessive and computer-savvy fanbase, it's useless to remove <i>anything</i> from the WP Simpsons World, because every single time an episode airs, dozens of fans of the show (myself included) go to WP with the intention of checking to see if some obscure, listy fact we noticed in the episode was documented in the relevant article(s), and if it isn't, <i>we add it</i>, even if the same fact has been added and removed dozens of times before. This (the Simpsons' AfD nom phenomenon) is at once like trying to exterminate mice with atom bombs (wasteful, destructive, and, ultimately, useless) and trying to hold back a tidal wave with a sandbag (hopelessly inadequate). I therefore implore the community to just <i>leave these articles be</i> <b>for now</b>, because until the show's run is complete, we're just trying to empty the Pacific Ocean with a bucket, and it's a big waste of time. Just MHO, (hopefully) respectfully submitted. Apologies for all the similes. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 04:59, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy KEEP</b> Had I seen this article earlier, I would have voted to delete, but it is WRONG to pop in this AfD nomination so quickly after it survived a previous discussion. Give the people who previously voted to keep time to improve this article before stalking the thing. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravislangley_ec87.html" title="User:Travislangley">Travislangley</a> 05:25, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: To those who assert this is bad faith nom, I would ask that you please AGF, the only reason I nominated the article was because it was part of a dual listing. It should also be noted that I have remained neutral in this debate. I simply feel that we will benefit from a clear consensus (ie put this issue to bed once and for all) whether that is keep or delete. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 07:09, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I hear what you're saying but I think both your points are without merit. First, if you look at the recently closed AfD, many posters clearly differentiated between the two articles nom'd. Any of those editors could have criticised the double nom, and the closing admin or the nominator could have re-nommed or split the noms if having two together 'poisoned the well' so to speak. That didn't happen. Second, the only way this issue will be 'put to bed once and for all' is if the article is <i>deleted</i>, which IMO indicates a clear agenda on your part. To wit, a 'consensus' to <b>keep</b> would <i>not</i> preclude the article from being nominated again in the future, as can be noted by the numerous articles that are nominated for deletion over and over even after clear conclusions to keep. I respectfully suggest that you chill out on this issue for a bit, and if in 6 weeks or so you still bothered by the 'unclear consensus' of the previous AfD, if in fact you still <i>remember</i> this article&#160;;-) you can submit a nice clean re-nom and no-one will be crying 'bad faith'. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 19:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> If this article had not been at AfD last week, I would vote "very weak keep". Is the article listcruft? Basically. However, it is cruft for one of the most popular, well-regarded, and influential television shows ever, which makes its cruft a bit more notable. However, my vote is for a speedy keep because the article <i>just survived</i> an AfD (albeit through lack of consensus). Do I think this is a bad-faith nomination? Absolutely, 100% not. Yet I still think it's unfair to ask for consensus on an article for which there was no consensus just a few days prior. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:56, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> indiscriminate list of minor trivia which is just the sort of stuff that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">we don't do here</a>, or so policies tell us. The fact that there are no sources cited tells me that somebody sat down with pen and paper and watched the episodes to compile this, making it <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. No rationale (and I use the word loosely) for keeping given even mentions any of the alphabet soup of policies there are to pick from, which argues very strongly that there isn't any basis for ignoring policy here. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 18:41, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
