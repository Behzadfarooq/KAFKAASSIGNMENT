<li><b>Weak keep</b>. All of the articles included are, in fact, Ivy League business schools. Unlike "Public Ivies," "Jesuit Ivies" or other bogus prestige-by-association faux "Ivies," these are business schools that <i>are</i> part of the eight Ivy League institutions. The real question is whether this article has any added value over the existing <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_school.html" title="Business school">business school</a>, and individual Ivy league and Ivy League biz school articles. I think it does have a little, since business schools tend to be compared against their peer business schools rather than the institutions as a whole.

<li>I'm not denying that the article is "factual". The reason for deleting this article is that the topic itself is arbitrary and meaningless, as evidenced by the lack of Google hits. In the world of business schools, affiliation with the Ivy League is devoid of any significance.

<dd>[Off topic] I recently spent more time than I should have trying to trace the provenance of "Penn" and "UPenn"—someone simply kept deleting "UPenn" it from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> article on the grounds that it was "incorrect." It is so widely used that to call it "incorrect" seems... incorrect. But apparently for the past five years or so the University of Pennsylvania <i>has</i> been very assiduously pursuing a conscious branding strategy in which all nooks and crannies of the University are urged to use the proper logo, etc. and Penn is the official abbreviation.

<dd>As a Penngineer I dislike the imperialist Wharton attitude that they "define" the University. It is an extremely prestigious business school at an extremely prestigious university. They certainly are not central to Penn's world-class medical school, multiple Nobel-winning chemistry department, or top-notch psychology department, to name a few divisions of the school that are at the very top of their game.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I dislike it. But I don't see any sufficient reason for deleting it. It's verifiable. By defining it as "Ivy League" you at least have some stable, objective criterion for what schools should be included. The dates of founding are mildly interesting to see together, as opposed to picking them out of the individual school articles. It's mildly interesting to note that two of the Ivy League members don't have business schools. It would be much, much more interesting to have an article on the history of business schools in general, and it would be interesting to have capsule summaries of the different characters and approaches of business schools. I thank whatever gods may be that this article at least does not include any rankings. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:19, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Ivy League business schools are the originators of such concepts as "business school," "business degree," and "MBA," as the article mentions. This may be a useful hub for info on those schools. There's a concern with the responses from MBAGuy who nominated this article for deletion. In his response to one voter, he said the "... Ivy League is devoid of any significance." That seems a bit much. He also said this factual article is "boosterism" for the schools - he didn't demonstrate that. After he nominated this article for deletion, he then edited the article several times to try to make the same negative points in the article that he makes in his vote and vote response. Why? One voter, Dpbsmith, was optimistic about this article since it isn't littered with current rankings. Unfortunately, MBAGuy then dumped rankings into the article. Why? Of the many available rankings, he seemed to pick the only magazine ranking that might support his negative cause. What's up with that? That negative approach doesn't seem to be in keeping with the Wikipedia spirit. If this article is not deleted, then it would definitely help to back out the stuff that MBAGuy added to the article AFTER he nominated it for deletion. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGO_WHARTON_1c0a.html" title="User:GO WHARTON">GO WHARTON</a> 02:27, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Excuse me, sorry, I'm replying to something you left on mytalk pages about my article on Tuatafa Hori being a hoax, and I'm afraid it may have been brought on by another recent event that has occurred. You see, I just logged on to my talk pages today and suddenly I discover that I wrote this hoax about some actor, Aimo Fontennot something or other? I believe it was my brother's doing, he wanted to get me in trouble with the wiki pedia people, since he knows how often I go here and I wanted my first article to be a success. The Aimo one is absolutely rediculous, so I'm sorry if he brought any doubt to your mind about my genuinity for writing articles.</li>

<dd>It's all I could find, but there she is, mentioned somewhere other than here. I don't think the area of Wallis and Futuna has a very high internet presence for there to be many things on her at all on Google, especially since there are only two people on the island of Alofi itself-- what does that say to you? She is also in one of the books on Oceanic culture that I have. I think it's called The Changing Cultures of the Oceanic Peoples in the Nineteenth Century. She wasn't very powerful then, but still mentioned. I can go find out who the author was, if you want. Laceymichelle 22:01, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> I'll comment from a Canadian standpoint. The Green Party has fielded a full set of candidates for the past two elections. The share of the vote for the Green Party is approaching 5%. There is a constituency of people who are interested in knowing more, but are not aware that there are 'green bloggers' out there. Green Bloggers fills that role, like Blogging Tories does for the Conservatives. The rationale for creating this article is because there were a couple of links from Green Wiki pages to Green Bloggers...people were going from Wiki to there, according to my log files. I created the page to satisfy what I believed was an interest in having more than just a couple of links. --Craig.cantin 12:31, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I know I'm bucking the tide here, but I can't see a single thing about this "group" that makes it notable <i>as a group</i>. Correct me if I'm wrong, but all this "group" is about is that they (a) hold to a roughly consonant political POV, (b) each (supposedly) have a blog, and (c) add themselves to the Green Bloggers list. Do they do anything <i>as an organization</i>? Do they have any cohesion? Does anyone actually vette whether they hew to the party line, provided there is a genuine set of environmental tenets to which they all adhere? If someone started a similar blog-list called "Friends of Pokemon," would that make for a notable Wikipedia article? Would my Livejournal friends' list qualify for a Wikipedia article?

<li>Both appear to have ended in no consensus opinions (considering that Blogging Tories was accidentally deleted then restored), which leads me to one precedent: those rendering opinions have a hard time agreeing.

<p>Keep. You need to read the forum pages and take a good look at the content before making such cursory statements such as many of those here appear to be. It is not valid to argue that because certain members have been named because of the usefulness or the otherwise outstanding nature of their contributions ( out of a total membership of some 100, 000 + teachers, university lecturers and educationalits in the UK) the article should be deleted. The forum offers much in the way of information and advice to those dealing with all matters educational.</p>
<p>These people may be using online names but that is irrelevent since most of the individuals posting here are also using similar online names to hide their identities. It is not possible to criticise others where you can be equally so criticised. The views and opinions of those on the forum are as valid and reliable as the views of those people voting here. Maybe more so.</p>
<p>The weight of the Times Educational Suppliment is good enough. This is a paper of considerable note. Many of the individuals on this forum appear to have high levels of qualification and expertise. Valuable expertise.</p>
<p>Much of the forum concentrates on dealing with professional and educational matters . It is a valid and reliable source of information and of advice on all matters educational, all matters dealing with the UK education system, and on many matters dealing with government policy and legislation.</p>
<p>It is an arena of discussion. Sometimes controversial. It is often the cutting edge of policy making debate in education. The TES forum is often used as a source of publication for TES articles. It is probably the largest and most honest collection of educational professionals concentrated into a single place. That has to be worthy of note.</p>
<p>Whilst in its current form the listing is probably inadiquate, I do not believe that the removal of this listing is justifiable under the deletion guidelines. Therefore keep. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lyndylou (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyndylou_bbfc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyndylou">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>This page is to inform the people of St. Louis (an extremely rich soccer town) that a new supporters group is active in the sporting arena where a professional franchise does not exist. Why are you suggesting this page be deleted? We are, to date, the only major collegiate soccer supporters group, and we havent even been to a game yet!

<dd>This article about an apparently non-notable lawyer who teaches at a Canadian school has touched off a flame war concerning his grading policies. Multiple edits have been made to the article over the last few weeks, but no new verifiable information has appeared. "prod" and "verify" tags have been inserted and removed.

<li><b>Comment</b> This looks like a borderline case to me as far as <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> goes. If he is a full professor at a prestigious university, that is a distinction that <strike>would probably</strike> might get him over the line. I've been assuming that the University of Ottawa would be pretty prestigious, but I realise it's not Oxford or Harvard or something, so it's open to argument. Notability is borderline. Article seems irredeemable at the moment.

It is one of the more important Universities in Canada behind McGill and University of Toronto. Second, Yvon Duplessis is a full professor, who has been published in many French journals. Wikipedia should not be biased against this despite the fact that these journals have smaller circulation due to smaller language population. Third, it is true, if you research on QuickLaw or WestLaw (I may not reproduce it here for copyright reasons) you will see that he did indeed litigate the Supreme Court decision Entreprises E.A. Bourque (Québec) Inc. v. Hull (Ville) [1996] C.S.C.R. no 368. Fourth, I have heard from other professors that he does indeed grade on a 120 point scale and the average grade in most of his classes is usually below 50%. Although not enough to be notable on its own, it is an interesting anecdoate and highly irregular. The man is a graduate of Harvard and I have been told he is related to former Quebec Premier <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Duplessis_1aee.html" title="Maurice Duplessis">Maurice Duplessis</a>. This is a <b>Strong Keep</b> not because he is highly notable, but because he clearly passes the de-minimus test to be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/b/User%7EAnber_f9d4.html" title="User:Anber">Anber</a> 07:34, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_minimus.html" title="De minimus">De minimus</a> test? "De minimis, in a more formal legal sense, means something which is unworthy of the law's attention." You're going to have to explain that one to me - I don't follow your meaning in this context. I haven't heard of the case you mention. Is it particularly interesting?

<li><b>Keep</b> It`s borderline but much less borderline than a lot of Wikipedia articles. I agree with the writers who say that the context of a French Canadian professor should be considered when interpreting Wiki rules because there should not be a systematic bias against an equally notable segment of the population at large who just happen to be less recognized on internet sites. Remember the internet overwhelmingly more English than it is French; Mr. Duplessis has been published in many print Media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I noticed that nobody has refuted his involvement in the Hull Supreme Court Case. Coupled with his full status (part of the prof test) and also his bizzare tendencies this seems enough (barely)</p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: A case upon which there are only a handful of unique G-hits and nothing notable off of Lexum; may I ask why you consider this case any sort of a landmark, and why Duplessis was any more notable than the other attorneys involved in the case? So he litigated a case before the Canadian Supreme Court; do you have any notion how <i>very</i> many attorneys do that every session? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 03:24, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Such a user is speculating, or could even be a plant from a rival studio trying to slam the movie (though I would guess the movie is indeed nothing special). Redlinks are AFAIK not a reason to delete an article, nor are bad reviews, etc. I'm not sure if the article should stay or go; WP needs to define by policy in a much clearer way which movies should have articles and which shouldn't. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 14:22, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agreed. This isn't someone's garage movie filmed on a video cam, starring ten people who had never, ever been in anything else. The cast's credits in other works seem to be in bit parts, but those bit parts are in big time movies and TV shows, and the film was distributed by Sony. The degree to which the movie sucked or someone's alleging self-promotion on the IMDB review page is irrelevant. Wikipedia's criteria for non-notability involve no one ever hearing of the subject, not the subject stinking out the joint. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:24, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article would have been accepted into Wikipedia if it hadn't been from all the associated self-promotional spam articles. Yes, the movie is apparently awful. Yes, the high point of the star's career was as a minor character in <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigli.html" title="Gigli">Gigli</a>. But you can order the thing on DVD from Amazon, and it's in IMDB, so it's verifiable. I suggest keeping this article, but deleting all the other Boothspam.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Opinions and personal reviews are valid but not on an encyclopedia. Death Tunnel is a notable horror film released world wide distributed by Sony Pictures domestic and foreign, Paramount Pictures in Spain, ArtPort in Japan, Imagine Entertainmnet in Australia, Movie Bank in Netherlands. This is also on IMDB. Please keep this in mind. The website has over 4.4 million hits within a year and a half.

<li><b>Comment</b> Reading on in the article cited, we see this: <i>"in 1977 Adams left the band. He was replaced by Chris Booth. <b>Adams's departure signaled the end of the band.</b> Prest left shortly thereafter to work with the Rocket Norton Band, to be replaced by Grant Gislason, but this version didn't last long and they called it quits in 1978."</i> This may not qualify as notability for Booth. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 21:33, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Argument in favor by the author</b>: As I am the person who has created this, I would like to make the case why it should stay as is.</li>
<li>It is a cut-down version of the complete list, it only includes cities and major unincorporated areas. As is, it just becomes useful as opposed to the complete list which contains practically every location in the U.S. bigger than a hot dog stand.</li>
<li>Where do you draw the line? If you want to set some population figure, say, 50, 100,000 or whatever, fine. But what is the criterion.</li>
<li>There is the possibility of cutting it by county (borough/census area in Alaska, parish in Louisiana) but I for one am not up to the task of creating circa 3500 separate pages. Now, if you only create separate sub pages if there is several items in a county, but you're still going to have large pages.</li>
<li>Most of the bloat comes from having to code them for HTML. I think I could try changing them to flat text and they would be a lot smaller. Actually I wish I had thought of that. I'll see if there isn't a way to have both.</li>
<li>I think this is exactly appropriate for an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia should provide, well, <i>encyclopedic</i> content, which I would think means it should provide very broad coverage of a subject or an issue. This also includes providing substantial reference material.</li>

<li>I am looking at reformatting the pages. I use a program to create them. I think if I use a wiki table format instead of HTML I can cut the page sizes by about 1/2. But the data within them is still substantial; take a look at a test version I have reformatted for Minnesota and it went from 380K down to 140K. I can see some places for improvement.</li>
<li>The creation of these tables was a start, and was subject to improvements later on as I - and others - had more experience in how to work with them.</li>

<p>Will someone please tell me WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE? People are saying they think these sub pages are not appropriate to this encyclopedia, so I decided to mark them for deletion. Now I'm being told that what I'm doing constitutes vandalism and I'm going to be blocked! I had the impression nobody wants these pages because they're too long, they're not encyclopedia content and they constitute original material. I disagree with all of these but I decided not to fight the issue.</p>
<p>If the material doesn't belong here then it needs to be marked for deletion. I'm sorry I wasted the effort.</p>
<p>23:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All right, you bastards, you win, I give up; it's not worth the fight. I wanted to make this encyclopedia better and improved its content, but you don't want the content. Fine; I now close the subject and the issue ends. I have deleted the links to the subsidiary pages. Whether you keep or delete the subsidiary pages doesn't matter. I'll null them since it's clear people don't want the fucking things and this will solve. It The original page is simply a table of state entries. Since my contribution is unwanted, I have removed the contribution so as to get rid of the problem.</p>
<p>You may now go about your business on whatever else you want to bother with. I have removed the "Request for Deletion" off the original page as the issue is now closed and the entries are now destroyed.</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I've spot-checked four of the references provided and they all seem quite reasonable. References seem to have been in place since the article was created. Hopefully the editors will keep the article on their watchlist and make sure that only items meeting the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy are included. Provided the list is kept honest with respect to verifiability, I see no reason to delete this, even though I think it's silly, and even though I think a category would do just as well, and even though I will shed no tears if it is deleted. By the way I <b>really like</b> the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2207493.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2207493.stm" rel="nofollow">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> reference... check it out.

<li><b>Keep</b> Regarding issues of speculation, the article was always intended to be entirely referenced with claims of the noteworthy people themselves acknowledging that they have indeed had plastic/cosmetic surgery. This would address any issues of maintnance, POV, and subjectivity cited as reasons for deletion. Also it is not that all individuals with plastic surgery in the world should be on this list, only those who merit a Wikipedia article and have acknowledged that indeed they have had this procedure. This is all outlined in the initial paragraph of the article. Perhaps a better article title would be List of people who have claimed to have had plastic surgery.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If in <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_surgery.html" title="Plastic surgery">plastic surgery</a> we can list people who have had it done to them, I don't see why a seperate article list, fully referenced, does not belong. Additionally we have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_breast_implants.html" title="List of people with breast implants">list of people with breast implants</a>. The subjects of both of these articles are surgical procedures. Again, if fully referenced and details for inclusion are made more clear, such as moving to list of people who have claimed to have had plastic surgery, I don't see why this should be deleted. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurieeto_060a.html" title="User:Kurieeto">Kurieeto</a> 13:36, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A Pakistani academic with 2500 Google hits under his romanized name, with no one here knows how many under a native language search, can safely be said to presumptively meet notability requirements. Nominations like this are bad practice, and the resulting deletions damage the Wikipedia project. We have gotten to a cultural state where "Gee, I never heard of this" seems to be a good enough excuse to nominate something for deletion, RATHER THAN raising legitimate issues on the talk page first to see if anyone can help improve the article. In this case, the nominator should have said "Gee, I never heard of this professor, and I looked in Google and found only n listings for him, so I wonder if there's a problem here. Then, pop a note on the talk page. "Hey everybody, I don't know much about Pakistan, but I never heard of this guy and had trouble verifying the information. It's probably my own lack of searching skills, so I wonder if anyone can help me out here. Is this article as good as it could be?" The problem is particular acute with regard to non-Western subjects, particularly when new, non-Western users are involved who are reporting information regarded as common knowledge in their own communities. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:32, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Just for future reference, I am a student of Middle Eastern and South Asian history &amp; politics. You also do not know my personal background so please do not attempt to judge it. Please remember <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a>; it seems that you have a serious problem following these policies but they are not just good policy, they are decent practice as a human being. Further, I nominated the article based on its merits as a Wikipedia article not based on the assumption that users will see an inadequate article on Wikipedia and go to google then search for the individual. I nominated the article because it clearly does not meet the standards set forth by the Wikipedia servers in which it is located. I have notified the user of the AfD and that user has the ability to update the article according to Wikipedia standards by the time this discussion closes. I am sure that users voting would be more than willing to change their vote if the appropriate updates are made to the article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 21:35, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your suggestion Jonas. I feel that the user has an appropriate amount of time to update the article before discussion on the AfD closes but I will keep this in mind from now on.

<p>This page was listed as a PROD, but I am bringing it here for a fuller discussion. Although this is a musical ensemble, its membership includes two notable artists, inclding a notable performance artist, which in my mind, makes this more an article about performance art rather than a "band", making WP:MUSIC an irrelevant standard. <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 14:35, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non-notable, unverifiable, likely hoax. Apparently great musical innovator, yet nothing on google.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the view of Jami (as we knew him)in this piece may give him more ability than he displayed. However he did exist and we well remember seeing him perform at the Black Horse in Hounslow in '79, but his combination of Lute and Reggae could only be said to have been greeted by a mixture of scepticism and sarcasm. It is however still a night we recall with affection.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This guy isn't very famous but that doesn't mean it should be deleted. He has quite a niche following and died in 1986 so it's no surprise that there are no mentions on google. But within a specific segment he made a decent contribution, and had an interesting life which deserves to be noted here. Are you saying that anyone not of the modern era and not on google as a result should be deleted?! If you go read that manuscript listed on the page there's a massive chunk about him.User: rf263</li>

<p>Aajonus Vonderplanitz was created last October by an anonymous user, 212.135.222.212. On January 28 it was nominated for deletion in a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Primal_Diet_ab8a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Primal Diet">shared AFD</a>, along with the related article <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primal_Diet_375f.html" title="Primal Diet">Primal Diet</a> (Mr. Vonderplanitz is apparently the inventor of Primal Diet). The AFD discussion concluded with a delete result applied to both articles, although <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primal_Diet_375f.html" title="Primal Diet">Primal Diet</a> was immediately recreated as a redirect to <a href="../../../r/a/w/Raw_foods_diet.html" title="Raw foods diet">raw foods diet</a> by one of the AFD participants. About 6 weeks after its deletion per AFD, Aajonus Vonderplanitz too was recreated (by an editor who was likely unaware of the previous versions and deletion). This recreation was speedily deleted, and the editor appealed for review at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. In this <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=47804686#Aajonus_Vonderplanitz" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=47804686#Aajonus_Vonderplanitz" rel="nofollow">discussion, which I have just closed</a></span>, a substantial majority felt that the speedy deletion should be reversed (± relisted on AFD for discussion). I am listing the page here as there are good arguments on both sides of the issue, and I hope we may come to a consensus on whether the subject merits an encyclopedic a entry.

<li><b>Keep</b> According to Wikipedia rule the truth of a theory has no importance respect to the presence of it in wikipedia. Aajonus Vonderplanitz has a strong (wide and stable-many years) base, mainly in California, plus his work is influencing raw food diet. Aajonus Vonderplanitz is very well known in raw food circles, and deserve his space on this encyclopedia. Was a major figure in changing the law in California legalizing raw milk and there are plenty of references to his work from his books to interviews he gave (and the legal papers of the previous trial). I also want to point out that there is a serious effort from <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> to keep this article and its sister <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primal_diet.html" title="Primal diet">primal diet</a> article from appearing. While someone else (always a different person!) keeps on making it again. The presence of so many people who independently desire this article should be reason enough for it to be given a fair chance to exist long enough to collect the necessary information--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietrosperoni_fa82.html" title="User:Pietrosperoni">Pietrosperoni</a> 09:03, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a serious effort from me to keep <i>all</i> minor crackpot theories and their proponents from appearing on Wikipedia. I know you take this issue personally, the fact that some people are strongly non-neutral is one reason the articles are problematic in the first place, but do not make the mistake of believing that this particular crank theory gets any more attention from me than any other. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:06, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Aajonus Vonderplanitz is a published author and his name frequently turns up in searches for raw food diet in major search engines. It would seem amiss if Wikipedia did not cover this person. Also there are people who adhere to this raw food diet. This diet is not mainstream and that in itself makes it interesting enough to warrant keeping it so that it can be available to people who want to find out more about it. Admittedly the Wikipedia article on this needs work, references and etc, but more time is needed to do that properly. <a href="../../../g/t/l/User%7EGtlim75_bd75.html" title="User:Gtlim75">Gtlim75</a> 14:51, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Aajonus Vonderplanitz has a valid California nutritionist's license and he has very practical nutritional protocols that work excellently for a large proportion of people with whom he consults. I have been eating his raw food diet for over 8 years and have greatly improved health as a result. His gound-breaking and far-sighted work merits a place in Wikipedia.-=thetasig=- 21:22, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable crackpot. The presence of an article on a marginal theory does not endorse the validity of that theory.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Good thing I checked the article again! No one notified me that it had been relisted. I started the article (apparently for the second time, as I had no idea it had been started and deleted previously), therefore obviously I support keeping. BTW, IMHO while Vonderplanitz certainly might have some unusual ideas (at least from some individuals' perspectives), he is certainly not a "crackpot." Just misunderstood.&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 21:56, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As someone else stated he is a published author that meets the criteria that is listed under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. As the article now stands it briefly tells who Aajonus is and does not promote his diet. It seems quite objective at this time and should be monitered to make sure it stays objective. The person asking for it to be deleted claims that it is a "crank theory." In science, theories are not proven, they are disproven.

<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b>. The reasons given for deletion seem a wee bit hyperbolic, but the article is quite a mess, what with the large number of templates tacked on to this article, practically screaming out for attention.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is virtually a recreation, under a new name, of an article which was just deleted yesterday, Lauren B. Weiner. This brief material does deserves to be covered, but in the Michael Steele article (where it already is). Relatively short articles, such as Steele's, should cover cover important events in that person's life. A brief sub-article, like this, is useful only if the topic warrants enough discussion that it would be unwieldy in the main article. This sub-article is just a couple paragraphs, and there is no real prospect of expansion. It's not a matter of wasting "paper", but of having a coherent organizational structure for articles; it is counterproductive to write a physically distinct article for every minor incident for every minor figure. It belongs in the main article. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 19:33, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I merged the details, sans Weiner, into this article as was stated in the delete log. This sub-article touches on two things that makes a better separate article 1) DSCC practices and 2) Michael Steele. This should be mentioned on both pages and it is just easier if it is kept as a separate article. It is much more difficult to keep up with details across two articles. This is the whole concept of "main article" referencing. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 19:38, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is a very problematic page that violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. Let me state that I am not at all motivated by any desire to censor Wikipedia. There are plenty of sex articles I would never dream of deleting, because they have been properly documented in psychiatric and medical literature. This is different. I'm nominating this because its existence clearly violates policy, and it is a very attractive target to vandals. I also don't like having what are supposed to be factual articles that are filled with speculation, fiction, and outright lies. A couple of days ago, this was added to the article:</p>
<p><i>"The most unique and hilarious variation, however, is the one where it is said that immediately upon being punched, the partner taking it up the ass contracts so forcefully, the active partner's penis is ejected three winks prior to ejaculation. At this critical juncture, a delicate BABY is also evacuated, and it immediately begins to eS the Dee of the repudiated partner to finish him off. If the baby is a good girl, she will swallow. Male babies never never nerver swallow. Good luck to everyone!"</i></p>
<p>I don't know what kind of person it takes to come up with this stuff, but I suspect it's not the kind of person we need to write articles. I've tried to edit out the fiction, but without any success. One user repeatedly puts back information that he really can't be bothered to provide sources for. Other editors have repeatedly removed the information, and it has been put back. One such piece of information is the idea that punching someone hard enough in the back will cause their rectum to prolapse and form a so-called "pink sock." I'm not a physician, but I know that simply being punched does not cause rectal prolapse. I'd like to see this article deleted, but perhaps it and its kind could be put on one page, perhaps titled sexual urban legends, to make it easier to monitor vandalism, to give all these terms context, and to limit the amount of trivial references to movies, cartoons, TV shows, and video games each one inevitably attracts. At any rate, I'm done with this article. Monitoring it and others like it is a thankless job, and no one seems to care anyway about whether it is factual or not. Comments directed at me personally during this discussion will not be answered on this page, and should instead be directed to my talk page where they will be promptly ignored. People crying "censorship!" will not be taken seriously. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G.

<li><b>Delete, Non-notable, vanity, and promotion.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Dale Michael Houstman is non-notable and unknown to be accepted for an article on Wikipedia. Anyone can get their creative work, poems, writings, etc, published for a fee and placed online. Upon reading the article, this Dale Michael Houstman has posted to Usenet newsgroups, does not make him a credible topic for inclusion on Wikipedia either. The article subject, Dale Michael Houstman is so unknown, I cannot find any legitimate reference sources to validate this person or their work. Remember, Wikipedia is not the place for promotion, nor is it to be used as a shortcut to being considered as noteworthy. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 20:33, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but drastically rework. Article is too subjective. Nomination is incoherent and self-contradicting in a number of ways. Statement "[a]nyone can get their [<i>sic</i>] creative work... published for a fee and placed online" doesn't make sense because implication seems to be that publication of creative work is in print form (particularly where this involves fee), so what is the connexion to placing it online? Furthermore, summary dismissal of self-published items (this is begging a question that I think might not be correct in this case) doesn't acknowledge that many prominent works of the past were initially self-published -- this claim (if indeed it is intended to be applied to Houstman, which I'm assuming) needs both source citation and a more rigourous analysis. That Houstman has "posted to Usenet newsgroups" is completely irrelevant to this article, or at least I'm missing the connexion. Also note that Classicjupiter2 has never seen fit to explain what he means by "legitimate reference sources" (he really just uses this as a shorthand for reference sources he likes). --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<p>Where to begin? This article is a highly POV fork of articles such as <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whites_in_Zimbabwe_41d4.html" title="Whites in Zimbabwe">Whites in Zimbabwe</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_South_Africa_8c9c.html" title="Culture of South Africa">Culture of South Africa</a>, packed with unreferenced original research. Much of it is a possible copyvio, lifted straight from <a href="http://ruka.atspace.com/" class="external text" title="http://ruka.atspace.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> - my attempt to clean up earlier today were rv almost immediately without comment. The term <b>Anglo-African</b> itself is a non-notable neologism: no entry in my 1996 Oxford Dictionary of South African English and, while it garners an impressive number of Ghits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-40,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anglo%2Dafrican%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-40,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anglo%2Dafrican%22" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> I cannot find any relevant ones apart from Wiki mirrors and Urbandictionary entries. The article itself states that the phrase "Anglo-African" <i>originated with Luke Jones</i>, who appears to be both Rukaluka (<a href="../../../r/u/k/User_talk%7ERukaluka_f0ea.html" title="User talk:Rukaluka">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rukaluka_c191.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rukaluka">contribs</a>) and 84.69.76.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.69.76.113_786a.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.69.76.113">contribs</a>) and is probably also the user <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Anglo+African" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Anglo+African" rel="nofollow">Ruks</a> who submitted the phrase to Urbandictionary and the owner of the website <a href="http://ruka.atspace.com/" class="external text" title="http://ruka.atspace.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> linked to from the article. So that's original research, advertising, vanity and lack of notability/neologism. - <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 22:07, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> I won't comment on the content/POV issues, as this is not a matter for AfD. Note also that "Anglo-African" does seem to get some Ghits in a historical context. However, the article (as good as it looks at first glance) does appear to be a composite of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORKs</a> and original research (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). It also lacks (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>), plus its forky cobbled-together nature is evidenced by nuggets such as "Ja, I smaak it!".

<li><b>Retain/Keep</b> - Sorry, I'm not sure what the right protocol is. Maybe it's just "Don't delete"?&#160;:) I've just read over the article, and it is terrible - lots of POV, is very badly written in parts. BUT I think it's an interesting topic, and deserves to be tidied up rather than deleted. Unless there's already a better one on English-speaking South Africans?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That sounds fine.

<li>I agree with SP-KP that some contextual analysis could be entered in the entries of the Method Engineering Wikipedia Project, but I see no reason why this whole project and all the articles should be deleted (according to the opinion of Sandstein). Wikipedia is indeed a free web host and a Wikiproject such as the scientific-based Method Engineering helps to reach the much-wanted high quality on Wikipedia. I see absolutely no reason to delete this, just because of the fact that it is a scientific-based project. Written by Dwolfs 12:01, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Most articles at the Wikiproject are indeed not original research, and I've retracted my nomination to delete the project page. The three articles at issue here, however, are <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> insofar as they seem to propose a method for specific business activities in a "how-to" manner, instead of encyclopedically describing a specific notable standard procedure. Maybe this could be amended, but note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> also states that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. In particular, it says that <b>Wikipedia is not for "Instruction manuals</b> - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s." Maybe <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a> would be more suitable than Wikipedia for this content. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:52, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not yet convinced that these three articles deserve separate treatment from the project as a whole. I propose we move the discussion to the project deletion proposal. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 18:42, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That would be a happy ending after all, considering the fact that <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> retracted his nomination to delete the project page. Dwolfs 18:53, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've added a "hold on" comment there though. We still need to work this one through. I'd be interested in your thoughts on the concerns I've raised at the project deletion proposal. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 19:06, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do think that the Wikiproject and its articles (specifically, the three at issue here) merit separate discussion. The Wikiproject now seems (to me) to be a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to organise encyclopedic contributions. As such, it can stay even if many of its articles need verification, cleanup or deletion, as you noted in the MfD discussion. Let's focus on these articles' issues here. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 19:41, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Am I right in saying that the deletion proposal for these three articles can be withdrawn? So we can focus on the points for improvent in style, content or maybe even language? Dwolfs 08:30, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I know that the merger is definitely going to happen (that wasn't my point).

If Stagecoach win the franchise and continue to run it under the South West Trains brand then it would probably make sense to merge it into that article.

<p>You need to cite your claims with independent sources IN the article. Not simply in the discussion. Your article has far more POV problems than simply stating he's not liked by everyone.

<dd><b>Comment.</b> You insinuated that other editors were violating Wiki policy and committed a bad faith deletion in that they did not seek sources to improve the article. You stated "I would be surprised, however, the policy calls for a good-faith attempt to locate sources and improve articles, with deletion as the last resort." Thus implying bad faith. The user apparently found no sources to mark this individual as notable and thus found that there was nothing to contribute and rightfully voted for deletion.

It's a useful disambiguation page, and a redirect to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Peel_dd69.html" title="John Peel">John Peel</a> won't do the job.

<li>Yes it does, but I think really someone typing in "Peel Sessions" ought to be expecting an article about <i>the Peel sessions, radio sessions on the John Peel show</i>. The best way to find the album in this case is to go the artist, because "Peel Sessions" is - in terms of album naming - generic. If the reader doesn't already appreciate or understand that, doesn't know what the Peel Sessions are, we'd be doing them a favour by having them end up at the John Peel page I think. I think what I'll do is put this scheme into place now but leave the AFD tag on, so we can have a look at the end result and see if we want to keep it. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 17:20, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know if it needs its own entry or if it could be part of a list, but it does appear to have fairly wide use, e.g. on usenet <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=ianal&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=ianal&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> going back to January 1990 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.virus/browse_frm/thread/18b7ba618b221854/41b252a30ef3456c?lnk=st&amp;q=ianal&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#41b252a30ef3456c" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.virus/browse_frm/thread/18b7ba618b221854/41b252a30ef3456c?lnk=st&amp;q=ianal&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#41b252a30ef3456c" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 04:55, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, a very common term; this article is an encyclopaedic discussion of what could otherwise be a mere dicdef. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:17, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I just linked to it.
