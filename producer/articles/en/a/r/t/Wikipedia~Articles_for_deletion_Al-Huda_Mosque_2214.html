<li>Why do you think Singapore is special? Or are you planning on having an article for every single mosque on the entire planet?

<ul>
<li>No, I mean if we create articles on every single mosque on the planet, the sheer number involved would mean it was quite likely that the vast majority will not be regularly looked at, and could be vandalised without being noticed. Since mosques don't tend to move around much it would be better to group them together. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 08:02, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think everyone should just go easy on the PC here, the joke was harmless. In any case, how can a joke about Islam be "racist" (if that is indeed what you are trying to say)?

<li>Mocking people’s places of worship is a racist remark and it’s unacceptable. Trying to justify it, don’t change the fact his comment was offensive and racist. I’m certain if this was the case against other faith, it would have raised the roof. - Such remarks is in no way going to encourage people of all faith’s to contribute to the development of such great tool like Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECARPEDIEM_3826.html" title="User:CARPEDIEM">NEWUSER|CARPEDIEM</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECARPEDIEM_e232.html" title="User talk:CARPEDIEM"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:51, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, you're wrong. If anyone were to make a pun on the word "church" (can't think of one right now) no one would raise an eyebrow. In the Muslim world there's an acceptance for abridging the freedom of speech that you won't find in the West, and that you shouldn't find in Wikipedia. Klonimus' comment should stand, and anyone who wants to criticize it should be free to do that.

<li><b>Ding Ding Ding. We have a Winner.</b> I'm glad you got my reference. Mosquito is a spanish diminutive of fly, so a mosquito is a little mosque. I'm not against the inclusion of mosque's per se. But in order to get my vote, it would have to be shown that this Mosque is a notable <b>Large Public Object.</b> On a separate note, it's a bit saddening to see people get so fired up over anything that they conceive as being insulting to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's a good joke, but just for the record it's incorrect. The Spanish word for mosque is mezquita (from the Arabic <i>masjid</i> = "the place of prostration").

<dd>It’s either people are very supportive of insulting Muslim's in the west that some try to come up with new definition to words to justify the racism behind it, or they are just uneducated – as far as the English language is concerned and this is the language used in the topic discussed here, not Spanish or Indian, English, the word used to identify a Mosque is very degrading and insulting to Muslims. <b>MOSQUITO: two-winged insect whose female has a long proboscis to pierce the skin and suck the blood of humans and animals.</b> - <b>Mosquitos: are the members of the family Culicidae; these insects have a pair of scaled wings, a pair of halteres, a slender body, and long legs. The females of most mosquito species suck blood from other animals. Size varies but is rarely greater than 15 mm (0.6 inches).</b> - There’s no justification for supporting racism as some people got out of there way to justify such indecent remark against a place of worship to Muslims. <b>I must have completely failed to see that an INSECT is the WEST is the way to identify with Islamic places or worship – its even more saddening to see others justify such remarks.</b> - I want no association with Wikipedia from this day forward since RACISM and OFFENSIVE remarks are justified and accepted by so called educated-people, rather then being corrected - Good luck to the non racist people. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECARPEDIEM_3826.html" title="User:CARPEDIEM">NEWUSER|CARPEDIEM</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECARPEDIEM_e232.html" title="User talk:CARPEDIEM"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:27, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
