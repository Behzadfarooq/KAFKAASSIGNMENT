<p>There are presently many people who own Nintendo <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wiis</a>, but there is not a suitable box for them. So a valuable way to protect, transport, or store a Wii is to buy a box and make the box yourself. First you get a box of appropriate size, about a cubic 1.5 feet is good. The next step is to get styrophoam and glue it to the sides of your box. Next you must use blocks of styrophoam to create the slots for the various Wii accesaries and hardware. Finally cover the styrophoam in order to protect your wiibox from erosion. Another optional thing to do is cover the duct-tape covered styrofoam with a smooth cloth, such as velevet or silk. This wiibox will adequately protect the wii from scratches and damage and provide a safe way of transporting it.</p>

<p>Derek "Derk" Bray is an American videogame player, particularly noted for his use of the "run and duck" (As opposed to Run and Gun) strategy in the popular Grand Theft Auto expansion, Multitheft Auto.</p>
<p>The instance of gameplay which became Derk's rise to fame came near the Malibu Club during one of the inaugural matches between the notorious Rebellion clan in MTA. One of the gang's members, Robert290 had arrived at the Malibu Club on a motorcycle, followed closely by Derk. After disposing of one of the enemies within the Malibu Club, Robert turned his back on Derk and fired upon him with a shotgun. Derk, upon the first blast, took off on Robert's own motorcycle, rather than stay and fight like a man.</p>
<p>The instance is notable because it was customary for Rebellion members to fire upon each other when there was no other competition. For example, the first time Calvin Lee Fitch (General Lee) joined a match, the first thing he did was attack his good friend, Red_Spyda, AKA Shaun Johnson.</p>
<p>After the instance, Derk quickly became known as a fool within the MTA community. From then on, whenever he would enter a helicopter with any Rebellion member, he was quickly shanked and had his weapons stolen from him.</p>

<p>Eurymedousa is the nurse of Nausicaa in the House of Alkinoos in Homer's Odyssey. She cares for Nausicaa, as well as having been her teacher. Eurymedousa is a figure of benevolence, and she is seen as being a motherly figure to Nausicaa. Nausicaa, who is often noted for being the one who provided for Odysseus' rebirth, became virtuous and good-hearted through Eurymedousa's example</p>

<p>On April 14, 2001, Thapar went to the Groove Lounge, a <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightclub.html" title="Nightclub">nightclub</a> that was hosting a teen night, with several friends only to be rejected at the door because he was wearing a <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patka.html" title="Patka">patka</a>. The bouncer refused to listen to his explanation and gave him the altimatum of either taking off what he believed to be a <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hat.html" title="Hat">hat</a> or to leave. Due to his religious beliefs, Thapar could not remove his head covering so he was forced to leave.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-29_0b2d.html" title="Edit section: HealthQuest">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">HealthQuest</span></h2>
<p>HealthQuest is the New South Wales government medical office, situated at 59 Goulburn Street, Sydney.</p>
<p>On HealthQuest's website it is reported that HealthQuest is a statutory corporation which reports to the N.S.W. Minister for Health. It is said to be a self-funded, not for profit organization providing occupational health services to both government and private sector employees.</p>
<p>The HealthQuest Board is made up of six members:</p>
<p>Dr Ian R Gardner - Occupational Physician</p>
<p>Mr Wayne Cahill - Solicitor</p>
<p>Mr Terrence Hannan - Representative of the Labour Council of NSW</p>
<p>Mr Richard Persson - Chairman for HealthQuest/Administrator Warringah council.</p>
<p>Ms Rosemary Milkins - Health NSW Senior Executive</p>
<p>The CEO of HealthQuest is Alison Viney, Solicitor and now magistrate.</p>
<p>Source: HealthQuest's website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthquest.gov.au/about_us.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.healthquest.gov.au/about_us.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthquest.gov.au/about_us.htm</a></p>
<p>HealthQuest has a troubled history. Set up years ago to replace the Medical and Immunisation Centre, during its better known times it was headed by Dr Helia Gapper, Government Medical Officer, and Dr Helen Jagger. Dr Gapper's qualification consists of a medical degree and a Certificate in Public Health (England). She is not a specialist.</p>
<p>Government departments were required to pay for the services supplied by HealthQuest. As a result, they had an expectation that their wishes regarding the employee would be adhered to.</p>
<p>The June 2005 Newsletter of HealthQuest, which is aimed at employers in the government sector, contains this sinister sounding statement by Alison Viney:</p>
<p>"To ensure you are obtaining the services you need from HealthQuest and to discuss those occupational health issues which just will not go away at all, clients are being contacted to arrange a meeting time with our CEO Alison Viney, please take this opportunity to ensure you are getting the most out of your occupational health provider. In addition over the last 12 months our CEO has addressed larger groups of HR managers. Topics of interest have included Getting the Most from your HealthQuest Referral, What Happens at the HealthQuest Examination and When is the Right Time to Refer to HealthQuest?"</p>
<p>Source: HealthQuest's June 2005 Annual Report.</p>
<p>Over the years concerns were raised by whistleblowers that HealthQuest was being used as a tool to have them dismissed from their employment by means of bogus 'retirement certificates' citing obscure conditions such as 'borderline personality disorder', 'adjustment disorder', 'cognitive dysfunction', 'disthymia' and even in one case, 'schizophrenia'. The false diagnosis of schizophrenia was very common in Soviet Russia. Although Dr Gapper and Dr Jagger had no qualifications in psychiatry they signed these certificates. Neither Gapper nor Jagger ever actually saw any of the HealthQuest victims.</p>
<p>On the following website actual documents issued by HealthQuest can be found:</p>
<p>wbde.org</p>
<p>There was a "Medical Appeals Panel" but when one government employee who had raised concerns in the workplace about safety and was sent to HealthQuest where he was certified with a condition which he did not have attempted to find out who was on the panel, it was discovered there were no panel members. No panel ever met. The victim had no right to appear before the non-existent panel. The "Medical Appeals Panel" was just there to rubber-stamp the HealthQuest decision.</p>
<p>Questions were raised in N.S.W. Parliament about HealthQuest on several occasions. Dr Pezzutti was one member of Parliament who asked pertinent questions about HealthQuest's activities.</p>
<p>In late 1997 a large number of HealthQuest victims had found each other and began to protest outside Parliament and outside the HealthQuest building itself. As well, in early 1998, a protest was held outside the N.S.W. Teachers Federation, which has supported HealthQuest decisions over the years and has given its members misinformation regarding the integrity of past HealthQuest psychologists and psychiatrists. The Public Service Association is another union which has failed to warn its members about HealthQuest in past years.</p>
<p>A very well known HealthQuest activist is Gerard Crewdson, an employee of the Department of Disability and Home Care, who raised questions and concerns about the mistreatment of disabled people in a group home. He was sent to HealthQuest where he was declared to be unfit for work as a means of removing him from the workplace.</p>
<p>For information about the many cases Mr Crewdson has brought to court, being self-represented, over the past nine years see the Austlii website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austlii.edu.au/</a></p>
<p>Mr Crewdson is a graduate of the School of Architecture at Wellington University, an artist and jazz musician. He has been at the forefront of the fight to have the courts make findings favourable to HealthQuest victims and not always findings favourable to the N.S.W. government.</p>
<p>HealthQuest victims organized publicity about their plight through the media in 1997-1998. Coverage was given by the Sun Herald (reporter Sue Williams) and Channel 7 (A Current Affair). Fresh complaints were made to the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Health Care Complaints Commission. Previously these two bodies had rejected all HealthQuest complaints but under pressure and having been exposed by the media, they finally took the complaints seriously. Dr Gapper and Dr Jagger were made to answer questions before an I.C.A.C. inquiry. Hadi Stambouliah, HealthQuest psychologist, whose report was used to certify that one activist had 'cognitive dysfunction', was put on trial by the Psychologists Registration Board. The victim gave evidence but the trial was held in secret. No members of the public were allowed in. Stambouliah was found not guilty. Gapper, Jagger and Stambouliah no longer work at HealthQuest. Dr Jagger has been promoted within the N.S.W. health system. Dr Gapper has disappeared and is probably no longer in Australia. Stambouliah runs a private clinic.</p>
<p>The C.E.O. of HealthQuest, Alison Viney, has been made a magistrate.</p>
<p>The I.C.A.C. oversaw an inquiry into HealthQuest practices and a report was produced called the Lowe Report which basically demanded that HealthQuest become more transparent.</p>
<p>HealthQuest victims had hoped for criminal charges to be laid against the doctors involved in the corrupt behaviour but this has never happened. It seems HealthQuest is untouchable.</p>
<p>As a result of the Lowe Report, HealthQuest underwent some cosmetic changes. But as recently as 2004, a public servant was certified unfit despite certificates of fitness provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. The person appealed to the Medical Appeals Panel immediately. They were not informed how long the appeal would take. This has been a tactic used by the Panel in the past: an appeal could take a week to decide, or a year but the appellant is given no information. The person wrote to the Medical Appeals Panel stating that the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service was organizing an extensive assessment which would be provided to the Panel within three weeks. The assessment, which showed the person was fit for work, was posted to the Panel and on the very same day that they received the assessment, they wrote to the appellant stating that he appeal was over, but that the report had been placed on their file. The current members of the Medical Appeals Panel are not known.</p>
<p>The doctor in charge of HealthQuest at that time was Dr Armand Casolin. He continued to deny the public servant employment by making statements that he found the person 'unfit' although he had never met the person and by refusing a CRS request that the person be re-assessed or that the appeal be re-opened to include the new report. This person underwent several HealthQuest assessments, at all of which they were found to be fit after examination by general practitioners, but Dr Casolin over-ruled the findings.</p>
<p>Dr Casolin left HealthQuest and was replaced by Dr Peter Dodwell. High hopes were held for Dr Dodwell by HealthQuest activists. He had no history of dodgy assessments in his home country, New Zealand. However he continued to refuse to certify that the public servant mentioned above was fit. Under pressure to do something, he stated that a 'proper assessment' including examination by psychiatrists and psychologists would cost around $3,000. There were no reports in recent history that this person had any kind of mental illness. In fact their recent work history had been unblemished. Eventually he did reluctantly find the person provisionally fit but made a defamatory comment about their health which makes them unemployable. He then reported the person to the police for allegedly publishing material detrimental to HealthQuest and requested the Medical Defence Board prosecute the person.</p>
<p>Several complaints have been made to the Health Care Complaints Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption about Dr Dodwell recently. However these bodies have shown in the past that they are somewhat unwilling to make findings against HealthQuest.</p>
<p>It seems that HealthQuest will continue to operate as it has always done, and that nothing ever changes. Neither the Universal Declaration of Human Rights nor the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights means anything in New South Wales.</p>

<p>A Luer LOCK is a standardized connecting system for canulas, syringes and infusion needles in the medical range. The seal is made by a conical construction of the connection parts, the so-called Luer cone. The interior cone of the connecting side is called also "female", that countersinking gel of the opposite side as "male". If the cone is extended for the safety device and/or bolting device of the connection against inadvertent release by a thread with a union nut, one calls the system Luer LOCK. The connection closes and opens with a half turn. The Luer LOCK system guarantees the compatibility between different manufacturers and is internationally recognized. The construction is in the standard DIN EN 1707:1996 "conical joints with 6 % (Luer) cone for syringes, cannula and determined other medical instruments - lockable conical joints" and/or the standard DIN EN 20594-1:1993 "conical joints with a 6% (Luer) cone for syringes, cannula and determined other medical instruments" described. The designation "Luer" goes back to the German, working in Paris under the name "Instrumentenmacher Hermann Wuelfing Luer"</p>

Semaj Booker, a nine year old from Washington State, recently baffled authorities by boarding two flights, one to Phoenix from Seattle and another to San Antonio from Phoenix. Semaj managed to do so without a boarding pass. He was attempting to run away to his grandfather in Dallas. Semaj was picked up in San Antonio when he tried to get onto a flight to Dallas without a boarding pass.</p>
<p>Semaj had run away many times before. The day before the airline escapade, he led the police in a car chase at up to 90 miles per hour. He has a record of car theft, too.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a boarding pass, Semaj told Southwest airlines officials the name of a passenger who was already paid and who had not picked up their boarding pass. He also told them he was 12. The Southwest unaccompanied minor policy runs from 5 to 11. According to Semaj, his mother was waiting for him in the terminal. Also, being so young allowed Semaj to go through security without identification.</p>

<p>Jørgen Mahler Elbang. Danish artist. Born 1966</p>
<p>Elbang creates a subversive universe filled with human figures that grow into their unusual environment. H.R Giger's imagery appears to be an influence in many of the pictures. These nightmare fantasy landscapes are filled with all kinds of weird creatures and ancient architecture.</p>

<p>The SQ-80 was bascially an update to the original ESQ-1 but included more waveforms, a floppy disk drive for storing patches and sequences, and they improved the onboard sequencer. Many ways like the ESQ-1, its 61-note keyboard is full, responsive and has polyphonic aftertouch. The aftertouch can be used to control a variety of modulation parameters such as the LFO. Pitch and mod wheels and plenty of front-panel buttons and a few sliders make accessing and editing fairly easy and hands-on. The keyboard can be split or layered. The pattern-based 8-track multitimbral sequencer is user friendly with several features including quantization, bounce-able tracks, 60 sequence patterns and 20 songs. And they can be saved to disk along with any patches you've created and any SysEx Midi data. Unfortunately, the SQ-80 has no built-in effects. Unfortunately the SQ-80 did not progress far enough in sounds &amp; features leading Ensoniq to quickly follow up with the VFX model.</p>

Dana L. French (1958 - ) is a prominent U.S. computer scientist working in the fields of business continuity, disaster recovery, and high availability. He has designed and written numerous software packages to automate the processes of disaster recovery and high availability. He is most noted for his approach to system administration as an automated process, rather than an interactive one. His work as a programmer and system administrator has influenced the design and implementation of Unix systems in organizations all over the world and is the source of the commonly used phrase "enterprise wide unique". His business function approach to system administration has caused a global shift in the way Unix system administrators perform their work.</p>
<p>He operates several companies that specilize in providing business continuity services to large world wide organizations. These companies provide services that include consulting, disaster recovery facilities, application and business function hosting.</p>
<p>French is well known in the Unix community for his advanced shell programming skills and is a noted advocate of Korn Shell programming. He provides source code for most of his programming work on-line free of charge. One of his most well known shell libraries is "shell curses", which is a shell script implementation of the "C" language "Curses" library. Another is "kshSQL" which is a Korn Shell implementation of a complete SQL database system. French is also the author of "shunix", which is a project to implement all of the GNU Unix utilities entirely in shell script code.</p>
<p>French is also well known as providing a MicroEMACS binary executable repository for a very wide variety of operating systems. MicroEMACS is a widely used programmers text editor. Linus Torvalds, the developer of linux, is a notable MicroEMACS user, and is known to frequent this site. French has provided continuous access to this repository since 1995.</p>
<p>French currently works as a business continuity consultant, and teaches courses in disaster recovery planning and Korn Shell programming. He is an author and publishes articles on these topics regularly.</p>

<p>WOS Portable is the base version that aims to beginners that want to use a portable webserver or a local testing platform. WOS Portable is availabe as package with TYPO3 It is released under the GNU GPL and is free. In the newest version 2 a new piece of software, the so called WOS Mixer, enables the users to create a personalized package consisting of software that the users can choose on their own. They can select on a wide range of free software such as <a href="../../../j/o/o/Joomla%21.html" title="Joomla!">Joomla!</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wordpress.html" title="Wordpress">Wordpress</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drupal.html" title="Drupal">Drupal</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/c/OsCommerce_0aae.html" title="OsCommerce">OsCommerce</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/p/TYPO3_70a5.html" title="TYPO3">TYPO3</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaWiki_8838.html" title="MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moodle.html" title="Moodle">Moodle</a> and many more. These packages are self-installing as soon as WOS is started. That has the big advantage that the often complicated installation process is not needed anymore and even beginners can use and try out the different applications. In between there are even some developers offering their software as a WOS Mixer package.</p>

<p>WOS X is based on WOS Portable and is designed for developers and the use in networks. WOS X makes it possible to remote control the webserver over a webinterface. Furthermore several possibilities to edit configuration files of the server software were integrated and a drag&amp;drop feature to run PHP files as well. WOS X is also free and released under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_GPL_1de6.html" title="GNU GPL">GNU GPL</a>.</p>

<p>WOS Presenter is a piece of software that let's you run a webserver from a read-only media such as a CD or DVD or automatically install a whole webserver package. So developers can distribute software on webserver base to customers. WOS Presenter is still in the beta phase.</p>
