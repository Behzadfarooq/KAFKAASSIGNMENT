<li><b>Comment</b> Education is noble...so is good parenting...my parents have been very good to me, but I'm not about to make an article on them. And <i>every school is "distinctive,"</i> including of course this one, but that isn't a reason to keep an article about it. I remember doing "Lego-Logo" in 6th grade, we made Lego robots do stuff using just our Mac IIe computers. We were standing athwart the future with that stuff. My high school had tons of "notable" stuff going on-Intel competition, "National Recognition" from the Education Department...we were like the mack daddies of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_UN_293e.html" title="Model UN">Model UN</a>. Would my high school deserve an article? <b>Hell no.</b> <i>Delete this article.</i> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 03:24, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Perfectly good stub. 267 school article deletion debates have completed this year, but only 37 articles have been deleted as a result of deletion debates. With a deletion rate of less than 15%, it's pretty clear that the proposition that schools are not generally notable doesn't command a consensus. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:46, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an article survives the VfD process it means no more that that there was no consensus to delete it. Implying notability is a long stretch, considering there is a vocal minority whose opinion is that "notability is no criterion for inclusion". Also see your own statement further up. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:13, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well let me take you through it again, slowly:
<ol>
<li>We don't delete stuff <i>unless</i> there is a consensus to delete.</li>
<li>If there were a consensus that schools are generally not notable, it would follow that there would be a regular consensus to delete school articles, with a few exceptions that were considered notable.</li>
<li>We look at the results--less than 15% of those listed for deletion have been deleted--and we see that this isn't the case.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>My conclusion follows. There is evidently no consensus, at least not over the past eight months, that schools are not generally notable.</li>
<li>I readily agree there is also no consensus that failure to satisfy various ad hoc ideas of notability is a criterion for deletion, but I don't see how that helps your case. It simply deepens the degree of rejection of the futile project to remove schools from Wikipedia on the grounds of non-notability.</li>
<li>And I don't know whether you've considered this yet, but I think I should raise the matter: on any three recent days, more completely new school articles are created on Wikipedia, and are not speedy-deleted, than are listed for deletion or deleted as copyright violations in an average <i>month</i>.</li>
<li>On some days the figure is even higher. Today alone, in just a few hours I have recorded the creation of twenty-two school articles. Twenty-three school articles were listed for deletion during the whole of August, and only four of those were deleted. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:32, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Notability is a sufficient criterion for keeping. Implying notability from the fact that an article is kept is faulty logic.</li>
<li>However, the articles on schools that appear here are not listed because of a lack of notability of the school, they are listed on their own merit (or rather lack of merit) because they typically contain nothing more than basic contact information. I really can't see why the fact that on a sunny day half a dozen such articles are created should prevent anyone from listing them here. There is no counterpart to the "Schoolwatch" project running the "futile project" of expunging school-stubs from Wikipedia, however I can see "Schoolwatch" promoting a degree of very unhealthy factionalism. Wikipedia isn't about fighting a war of attrition. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 17:23, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You say: "Implying notability from the fact that an article is kept is faulty logic." So it would be. Read what I say: "There is evidently no consensus, at least not over the past eight months, that schools are not generally notable."</li>
<li>So please address my point, not the point that you wish I had made instead.</li>
<li>Well it's your <i>opinion</i> that school articles aren't listed on account of non-notability. So let's look at the facts and see if they match. Looking at a randomly chosen lot of deletion listings from August:
<ul>
<li>Notability explicitly mentioned by nominator: Village Preschool of Saratoga, Duveneck School, Palo Alto Montessori School, Netivot Hatorah Day School, York Hill Elementary School, Court Moor School, Jesuit High School (Portland), Widdifield secondary school, North Olmsted High School, Butler school, King Middle School, Sacred Heart School, St. Catherine's School (Twickenham) Charlotte High School</li>
<li>Other:
<ul>
<li>Millburn School, Wadsworth, Illinois. Nominator said it was a duplicate of an item in a list at another article (!) Most delete voters mentioned notability.</li>
<li>Juanita High School. Invalid speedy, nominator made a formal nomination and voted keep. After the copyvio was fixed, delete voters still mentioned notability.</li>
<li>Gleneagle Secondary School. "Little possibility of growing beyond what it is now." Again most delete voters mentioned notability.</li>
<li>Elementary School. "Just another non-famous elementary school with 62 students." Sounds like notability to me.</li>
<li>Kew School. "This primary school no longer exists". Most delete voters cited non-notability.</li>
<li>Portland High School. "Article devoid of content" Actually this was one genuine case in which nobody mentioned notability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You say "on a sunny day half a dozen such articles are created". This is simply false. Today it's 46, more like <b>four dozen</b>. If school articles did indeed pose a serious problem for Wikipedia, then pointlessly listing two dozen per month for deletion, and only getting three or four deleted, wouldn't be the way to solve it.</li>
<li>You say "I can see "Schoolwatch" promoting a degree of very unhealthy factionalism". I think we'll have to differ on that;Schoolwatch lists no school articles for deletion. But I agree completely that "Wikipedia isn't about fighting a war of attrition" which is why I ask all editors engaged in this savage and ultimately losing battle against school articles to consider ceasing it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:43, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I read "non-notable school" as shorthand for "article fails to make the case for itself". For proof, please compare statements here with statements at a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews%27_Free_School_5e19.html" title="Jews' Free School">Jews' Free School</a>.</li>

<li>According to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, lack of notability is not listed as a valid reason for deletion (people excepted).

What I find weird is that this page entirely fails to explain up front the rationale for going to all the trouble of creating an article on every single school in the entire world.

It doesn't surprise me at all that puzzled readers continue to routinely nominate articles on nonnotable schools for deletion, and I can see that a band of devotees prevent many of these from passing.

<li><b>Comment</b> Naturally, I meant it all in the nicest way possible, with no offense intended towards the person/persons involved in this page. However, deletion remains the answer.

<li>Are you seriously suggesting that someone is trying to get deletionists to "shut up"? Oh for heaven's sake, I've handled some weird shit in the five months during which I've engaged in deletion debates, but the idea that the poor deletionists are being intimidated by the nasty inclusionists is frankly incredible. I've endured the most vile accusations for months without any complaint, but this one take the biscuit. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:23, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Tony is absolutely correct. The very idea that it is inclusionists who are the party ceaselessly trying to get the other side to "shut up" is simply beyond the pale. Deletionists <b>chronically</b> insist that inclusionists give up their position that <b>all schools are notable</b> (or variations thereof) in order to reach some deletionist-defined concensus (which does not and will not exist). AfD/VfD is and has been chronically abused by deletionists who nominate school stubs for deletion within days of creation, knowing full well that the article will be re-written, expanded and especially in the case of secondary schools, 99.9% likelihood that it will survive the AfD process. The real question in all of this, is why do deletionists continue to prosecute a war on school articles by nominating them in this way, and then insisting that those who vote to keep the school articles are those who are "not compromising" or "not concensus building"?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 00:07, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please stop insisting one side or the other is being the "bad" party in the continuing debate. Both sides have tried shoving their view down the throats of the other side since this began and it has gotten us nowhere. Tony and I tried to find a middle ground... now I wish the rest of you would as well.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 00:22, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, Gateman. That's exactly what I was getting at. Telling people to quit nominating articles for deletion is no way of achieving consensus or anything of the sort. I've seen editors on both sides of the fence that have blatantly broken <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> on multiple AfDs for schools; in my original vote, which I admit was not completely civil, I was rephrasing a previous voter's quite uncivil keep vote (<i>"Talk about biting the newbies; the nominator should be reprimanded. Or beaten with a large trout."</i>). I've since struck that part out of my vote to hopefully calm down the controversy. Conlangs and webcomics have had relatively recent polls regarding the inclusion of articles on those topics, and now a good consensus on those has been hammered out by means of polling. Why shouldn't we do that for schools as well? --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 20:41, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
