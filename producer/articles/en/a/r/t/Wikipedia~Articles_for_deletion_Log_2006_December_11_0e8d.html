If you follow the link, you read that, "Editors adding new material should cite a reliable source, or it may be challenged or removed by any editor."

<p>I am currently writing the nomination for this AfD with a very heavy heart. The mere nature of this page is extremely difficult to keep an actual encyclopedic entry on it. Also, some of the "slang" listed here is beyond the scope of Boston or even placed upon someone making a joke. I don't think it's really quite possible to keep a list of slang. Maybe articles for Chowdah, wicked, and sweet, but this is not exactly what Wikipedia was created for. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 00:54, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On this latter point, I wasn't providing an answer, I was asking the question; however, my spidey sense has started tingling from reading the arguments in favor of keeping this page. Descriptability ought not be the criterion on which this is judged. Looking at terms like "Toasterville", we can see that the ability to describe a term doesn't make it verifiable or noteworthy. Some individual terms are noteworthy because of cultural knowledge of them (think: the "Chowdah" Simpsons episode). This list simply does not meet the criteria on which wikipedia are judged, and the genre of lists it would create would be an abomination. In a month, we'll all be editing the page created to list Nunavut colloquialisms because someone has taken a personal interest in the Inuktitut language.146.243.4.157 14:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although there are many poorly written definitions, there is a lot of useful information here, I think it just needs some major cleanup and it could be made to be encyclopedic. - <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobogymnast_d894.html" title="User:Robogymnast">Robogymnast</a> 22:05, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>Don't let us lose this one. Only problem--as is common with anything about slang, is documentation. I don't think we need a citation to each use to start out with, but there should surely be some effort--there must be something on the web for most of them, and in some local authors</li>
</ul>
<p>Proving slang is Boston-specific is not easy, but checks against some standard slang dictionaries should help--the criterion has to be slang <b>mainly</b> used in Boston, not <b>only</b> used in Boston.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 05:43, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> realistic refference material. it needs more clean up though.Kaz14 06:28, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep/Merge/Transwiki</b> Any of these options sounds good, although a simple keep would require some rewriting or cleanup.--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrand_Slam_7_b148.html" title="User:Grand Slam 7">Grand Slam 7</a> 12:30, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> Most of the words on this list would have any Bostonian save a handful wondering what was said. The majority of this list has no bearing whatsoever on how we speak in or around Boston. In fact, a lot of the terms have more in common with pan-USA youth slang than any relation to Boston specifically. To admin reviewers, watch for sockpuppets among AfD comment and vote editors. <a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EOBriain_b75a.html" title="User:OBriain">OBriain</a> 13:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I considered posting this on the talk page but decided it was more appropriate here due to AfD reasonings. At the office, I shot this around with several coworkers representing at least 4 parts of Boston and 5 different suburbs plus 3 other hometowns as far away as Cape Cod, the South Coast, and NH.</li>
</ul>
<p>Words, phrases that are unheard of to Bostonians or are general American slang and unrelated specifically to Boston:</p>
<p>as/like balls (general American slang) bazo (unheard of) beat (general American slang) bomb (1) (general American slang) Boston Special (unheard of) Da Broons (just bad pronunciation; infrequent at best) booted (1) (general American slang) booted (3) (general American slang) The balls (general American slang) cleanser (unheard of, possibly a store reference) The Cawmin (unheard of spelling) cocked (general American slang) Dewey (general American slang, the fact that was a Red Sox player not withstanding) Dot (unheard of; at best, extremely obscure) Down East (general American slang) dust (general American slang) dusted (general American slang) East Bumfuck (obvious, not a distinct term) frappe (general American term) G-Vegas (unheard of; at best, extremely obscure) The Gahden (unheard of spelling) greaser (general American slang) H-Dub (unheard of; at best, extremely obscure) JP (an acronym; not slang and rarely if ever spoken verbally) Let's go Southie let's go (Southie is already on the list, not a noteworthy cheer) like a bastard (general American slang) like the shitballs (general American slang) lit (general American slang) Manch-Vegas (unheard of; at best, extremely obscure) Marsh Vegas (unheard of; at best, extremely obscure) Me'fah or Med'fah (unheard of spellings) milkshake (general American term) Mush (unheard of term) my-in (unheard of as somehow different from "mine") maggot (general American slang) No suh (unheard of spelling, general American phrase) The Orange Dinosaur (not slang) Off the Boat (general American slang) Pats (general American slang) pissa (unheard of spelling; should be pisser) Red Sox Nation (general American term) Retarded (general American slang) Rip-shit (general American slang) says (general American slang; just poor English) shanty Irish (general American slang) shiesty (general American slang) Taxachusetts (general American slang) tonic, boss o' (should be listed as boss o' tonic if at all, obscure) townie (latter part of the definition is general American slang) Two'vm (not slang, just a pronunciation which is definitely not specific to Boston) whoosey-whatchie (general American slang, whosey-whatsey is a more frequent spelling) wicked pissa (unheard of spelling; should be pisser) Yaz (general American slang) you's guys (not Boston slang; New York slang)</p>
<p>Many of the location terms are also incidental, not widespread and extremely obscure, or just as commonly used in reference to those places by the general American people.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there are words and phrases specific to Boston slang, the list seriously confuses what is and what is not Boston slang. It would be very difficult to maintain it in such a way as only authentic Boston slang is maintained. <a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EOBriain_b75a.html" title="User:OBriain">OBriain</a> 00:11, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

As well the wikipedia article <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_reform_movements.html" title="Hindu reform movements">Hindu reform movements</a> mentions it as well.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In response to Idont Havaname, I highly doubt that a remedy, should one exist, would not be as simple as you suggest. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of 'best song' lists out there published by various magazines and well-established music critics and all people will have to do is find which ones include their favorites and then use them to source and validate their claims. It is conceivably possible that songs could require a large number of prominent sources, say 8 or 9, to show their universal appeal but I doubt that would ever come to pass. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b>, but I really mean merge, because this list contains some songs that <b>must</b> be on such a list and which are inexplicably missing from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_in_English_labeled_the_best_ever_ffa8.html" title="List of songs in English labeled the best ever">List of songs in English labeled the best ever</a>, unless I missed them somehow.

<li><b>Comment</b> A few more things. First, this is not a valid candidate for speedy keep according to <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a>. I considered closing it anyway, but I think leaving it open for the full five may elicit valuable commentary on why it shouldn't be deleted. Leaving it open also permits a more solid AfD, thereby discouraging future attempts with this reasoning. Finally, I'd encourage people who read this to add the article to your watchlists and revert vandalism and nonsense as you see it. We have a ton of <a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP">recent changes patrollers</a>, but some things get past that net. Concerns like those expressed by the nominator shouldn't prompt us to delete articles, but they also shouldn't be ignored.

The way that precedent was established is <i>very</i> controversial, but now that it's there, I think we ought to keep all high schools of any significance for consistency's sake. Otherwise we get the "my high school was deleted but some and such's high school is still here!" whiners, <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> notwithstanding.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 22:03, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you want to vote delete, then just go ahead and vote delete, you don't need our permission. However, the precedent of a 95% keep rate (by your own math) should make someone pause and consider why this may be. One possible explanation is that schools, by their very nature, cannot avoid being discussed by multiple, independent third party sources - their student performance, their sports, their budgets, their school board elections, and so on and so forth. Just because sources aren't listed doesn't mean they do not exist. With schools, therefore, the issue likely becomes verifiability, and possibilities for merger (such as a particular High School merging with its host district's article). As this school appears to be somewhat independent, merger doesn't appear to be an option. Verifiability seems to be provided by the school's website. If more is needed for verifiability, I'm sure it won't be hard to find. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 22:16, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, I haven't recommended to delete because I haven't checked to see if there are actually sources out there in this case. Second, I would just point out in response to some of your comment, that the multiple third-party sources you suggest exist for schools -- featuring school games, budgets, elections, etc. -- should be considered trivial. They're not enough to show notability or to write a good Wikipedia article -- do you really think that a school article should be a collection of student performance stats, sagas about local football rivalries, and budgets? Of course there are <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillips_Academy_feb0.html" title="Phillips Academy">some high schools</a> that have attracted the attention of the publishers in a non-trivial way and meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. I would hazard to guess that at least 90% of high schools don't meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:50, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, what constitutes trivial per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> are one-sentence mentionings of a subject in a larger article, or the subject being little more than an entry in a larger table or graph. In many cases mentioned above, the school would be a primary subject of the article, which WP:N is very specific about. Of course it would be silly to include budgets and school stats, but other valuable info (school size, history, socio-economic demographics, when it was established, where it is located, if students happen to perform particularly well or poorly in academics or sports, etc.) could be readily available. And <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not say that all such articles or the information contained within must be used as a basis for the article, it simply requires that they exist as a test for notability. (At least that's how I read it. It's kind of vague.) Also, check out the proposed guidelines at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which includes as a footnote at the bottom: <i>Newspaper coverage includes regular coverage in local media (such as complete stories about a school's athletic program).</i> It also mentions "public reports by schools inspection agencies" as being acceptable for notability-determining purposes. Now I'm not from Australia and really don't know how they go about things there, but I guess I like to pick my battles when it comes to deletions, as I can't possibly see the harm in leaving this info. "Wikipedia is not paper" and all that. I imagine that for most, the same logic that tells us to keep all articles about every town and village also tells us that it's perfectly fine to include schools as well. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 23:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In fairness I should mention that another proposed guideline, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools3_b13f.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools3">Wikipedia:Schools3</a> takes a different approach to this, in fact some might say the opposite approach. And they say notability is not subjective... -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 23:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) A series of local articles in the paper about the school's football games, or budget, don't show notability. They should be considered trivial in the sense that we could not use that kind of information to fill up an encyclopedia article. (2) "<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not say that all such articles or the information contained within must be used as a basis for the article" -- WP:N does say that "This requirement ensures that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable encyclopedia article about the topic." If the only published encyclopedic info about a school is on its website, which is a single source (note we require multiple sources) and unreliable (as it has not gone through an editorial process and as it is first-party), then there is no way to write a good encyclopedia article about the school. Wikipedia is not a mirror of school websites. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 12:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've added a reference. Unfortunately my database searches are limited to the past two years of articles. Since Pan Dan will undoubtedly remind us all again of the requirement for multiple sources, let me just say that I would bet money that some very non-trivial articles were likely written in 1986 when this school was founded, or in 1987 when its first academic year began. However, not living in Australia and not being able to frequent their libraries, I have no way of confirming this. I have already wasted enough time on this. My intention in the above discussion was to try and logically deduce why such an overwhelming <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html#Education" title="WP:AFDP">precedent</a> exists for school articles being kept on Wikipedia. Obviously it doesn't fit snuggly into a strict reading of the guidelines, or these AfDs that formed the basis of that precedent would have never been nominated in the first place. I suspect that, instead of trying to brainstorm these reasons only to have Pan Dan pick them apart one-by-one, we can probably just chalk it up to <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIGNORE_187e.html" title="WP:IGNORE">WP:IGNORE</a> and be done with it. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 17:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not certain that that's entirely correct, although I think the nomination here to be relatively insubstantial, such that one might want to expound on his/her <i>delete per nom</i> in order to make clear how the article is deficient relative to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Generally, though, one's supporting <i>delete per nom</i> or <i>keep per Joe Blow</i> is quite fine inasmuch as it means to suggest that the editor so participating concurs in the reasoning and interpretation of policy offered by the nominator or Joe Blow; it is not unlike, I think it fair to say, {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd2_41fe.html" title="Template:Prod2">prod2</a>}}, which serves to inform an admin that at least one other editor has found the conclusions of fact and suppositions of policy of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">PRODder</a> to be correct/persuasive. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Aside from the Carnage controversy being one of the more notable incidents in Australian professional wrestling (I'm surprised it hasn't been included in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_in_Australia_b7ec.html" title="Professional wrestling in Australia">Professional wrestling in Australia</a> article) the promotion is a pretty notable company within itself. When PWA moves out of Victoria at the end of the year it will probably be the largest promotion in Victoria. I think that's notable enough to deserve a keep. <font color="#CD2626">Normy</font><i><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENormy132_a3cf.html" title="User talk:Normy132"><font color="#2020C0">132</font></a></i> 06:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'll add to that by observing that PCW is the oldest active fed in Victoria (formed in 2000) and the third oldest active fed in Australia (behind the only active feds formed on the 20th century - IWA and AWF in Sydney). Additional notability - with source - will be added unless circumstances prevent me (reference result of RFC and my reaction to it).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The argument is neither "absolutely absurd", nor perfectly reasonable. It would be reasonable, if our inclusion criteria had anything to do with what topics "deserve". Since we're not making that kind of judgement, our inclusion criteria have only to do with whether or not citable sources exist. The only question to consider in deciding whether or not to keep the article is whether or not citable sources exist.

<dd>My point - and it was missed by Booyaka - is that the reference make by Wackadoo was to PROFESSIONAL feds, and not backyard. That's why it was a reasonable point. Bacchus, there are citable sources already on the article (the newspaper clipping for example) and I would be happy to cite the tv coverage if I knew how that would be possible beyond what's already there. Not to mention the evidence that is in this AfD entry of newspaper coverage. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurse_of_Fenric_f242.html" title="User:Curse of Fenric">Curse of Fenric</a> 23:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article was created by user User:Afbcasejr, who claims to be a business partner of a person described. I think it is inappropriate to write bios of your business partners, and especially because the article looks like promotion for both person described (Adam Rin) and article author (Albert F. Case, Jr). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuturix_f1b9.html" title="User:Futurix">Futurix</a> 02:41, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is AFBCaseJr responding. 1. I removed all but one reference to myself. 2. If nobody else has written about Dr. Rin, why not his business partner? He was the inventor of the first 4th generation programming language (IDEAL) and a pioneer on the scale of Peter Chen and James Martin as it relates to data modeling. Is there some rule that only people who don't know you can write about you????? 3. If anyone questions the early and significant contributions of Dr. Rin, then check the references that I added to the article, including Marty Goetz's citation of him (Marty was founder of ADR, the fist relational DB company, later acquired by CA). 4. What EXACTLY does it look like the article is promoting? Neither he nor I are "for hire" as consultants, as we are 100% committed to our current project. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.187.109.150 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.187.109.150.html" title="User talk:72.187.109.150">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.187.109.150_60c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.187.109.150">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>If you had bothered to look at the list of linking articles that are supported by that article, you would have seen that it is a sub-page of the article on the US national Guard, and one of several sub-pages performing that task. As such, I would have had no resort but to replace the article with one just like it since it still provides support to a Main Article on the US National Guard. I would recommend that you do your homework properly before you threaten to do a hatchet job on someone else's work. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECORNELIUSSEON_8604.html" title="User:CORNELIUSSEON">SSG Cornelius Seon (Retired)</a> 03:40, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I appreciate your comment; Atlantis Sky Patrol is however a widely acclaimed game and one of the top selling casual games of 2006. It isn't my intent to create an ad page or to help sell it, but I think this title deserves an entry and that wikipedia deserves completeness in the field of emerging casual games. I can delete the external link to the download if that helps. I also intend to create pages for other successful indie casual hit titles, so I will take guidance from this ASP page for subsequent entries. - Orichalque 12:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Delete</s> The only reliable source I see is the game's own website and that of the company that makes it. There's no clear evidence of notability, here.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The more I look at some of these sources, the more I waver. There's this magazine article Sean K references below (though a date and page # would be nice). There's also these three sources form the first AfD: <a href="http://telechargement.journaldunet.com/fiche/4316/2/la_quatrieme_prophetie/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://telechargement.journaldunet.com/fiche/4316/2/la_quatrieme_prophetie/index.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://www.extremia.org/gazette/20001104c-t4c.php3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.extremia.org/gazette/20001104c-t4c.php3" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://www.mondespersistants.com/mmorpg/news/Quatrieme-Prophetie/9657/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mondespersistants.com/mmorpg/news/Quatrieme-Prophetie/9657/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. The first source is from <i><a href="http://www.journaldunet.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.journaldunet.com/" rel="nofollow">le Journal du Net</a></i>, which seems to be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The next two are probably gaming fan sites, but the webhits and number of players (ordinarily bad means of establishing notability, but OK in uncertain cases like this) lead me to opine weak keep.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 05:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I didn't even realize that the original was deleted, or there was one before. I removed the deletion notice as it seemed to be claiming that this was simply a repost of the same Wikipedia article that was up before, without disagreement, and was to be deleted in 10 days if it was not removed. This one was recreated from scratch by me, referenced, and it is definitely notable. I would have referenced articles stating it's popularity if I found that they were important pertaining to the article. All it takes is a simple google search with quotations around it, and you'll find tons of websites on it <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=E2j&amp;q=%22the+4th+coming%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=E2j&amp;q=%22the+4th+coming%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=E2j&amp;q=%22the+4th+coming%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=</a> The game has had many players, well over 100 000, and has been in existence since around the time of Ultima Online, as I have cited. To what extent of notability, I'm not sure some of you know what you're talking about, as there are tons of other Wikipedia articles with far less notability that aren't subject to deletion at this moment in time. Perhaps IGN making reference to The 4th Coming is notable? <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/357/357519p1.html" class="external free" title="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/357/357519p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/357/357519p1.html</a> I apologize if I didn't get the format of this discussion correct. -Merodies (December 11th/06)

<li>No worries about the format; the important thing is that you're participating. I and another editor tagged it as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}} because we couldn't see the older version. An admin (Proto, below), saw they were different and removed that tag. As to your point about other articles, see <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>. Because Wikipedia is open content, it's difficult to ensure every article meets our standards, since new ones are coming in all the time.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 05:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find the large number of hits to be persuasive, even if most are gaming sites.

<li>I have no idea how to use this wikki as i never have used it before, I am an Sysop for The Trilogy server of this game, There are 10 active servers of this current game currently run under the Dialsoft Corperation. There are over 1,000 players it may not be as new as many as the other games but the bias of the wikki is really sad, Considering the wikki is suppose to be a source of information, there are many servers 5 english and I belive 5 are french and there are lincenses currently being sold and we just had a graphics update so that i can compete a little with newer games. There are sites such as <a href="http://t4cbible.com" class="external free" title="http://t4cbible.com" rel="nofollow">http://t4cbible.com</a> that tells of the community and what servers do what, there is also <a href="http://fountianscroll.com" class="external free" title="http://fountianscroll.com" rel="nofollow">http://fountianscroll.com</a> the orginal post had a list of all the currently active servers and how to connect to them. There as stated above there are far lest notable things on here again what's it matter as long as it's an active currently running game I posted sites you can find information then where you can find the game simply because your asking for validation of a community, from those pages if you want to verify the game please check out the list of game sites and choose one to take a look at, the download is free also gamestationstore.com sells the game if people would rather buy it, like UO or WoW and many others. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.65.145.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.65.145.54_625d.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.65.145.54">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Delete and salt</b> For the same reasons I gave in the last AfD. All the current sources do is establish that the game exists, which is not under contention.

<li><b>Comment</b> It sure does. People shouldn't be allowed to nominate an article for deletion if they're unwilling to participate in a discussion about it. Why have none of the people who disputed the games notability responded to my claim of it being featured in a magazine? Sean K 00:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Basically. One person mentions a guideline that isn't even finalized, and like two others respond quickly after voting for deletion because of the same thing. I'm hoping this article won't be deleted because of people blindly voting without even reading the facts that some of us have stated.Merodies 02:58, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

(2) API document generators - already briefly mentioned - are a helpful tool and are built in to some languages.

<li>The first point <em>might</em> be relevant, though I'm not sure (about phone books… I don't think they aren't different).

<dd><i>This theory is not supported by any documentary evidence, such as slave memoirs, Works Progress Administration oral history interviews of escaped slaves, or abolitionist accounts of the Underground Railroad OR extant quilts. It is based solely on a one person's oral history as related in the book, Hidden in Plain View. With no supporting evidence, the secret quilt code, as described in that book, is not accepted by quilt historians as accurate.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The quilt "theory" was bandied about for a while before it was widely publicized in the 1999 book and since then many e.g. black history month programs treat it as factual, but there are few historians who see it as anything but an <i>ex post facto</i> interpretation that can <i>never be proven</i>. The article would have to treat that as a fair POV from the beginning. IMO this is fake history, as much about contemporary African-American culture as anything. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 10:22, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and Clean up</b> I came to Wikipedia looking for information, after dipping into "Hidden in Plain View" and having my doubts about it all.

<p><br />
I don't get it? An unreleased Linux Distribution? I do not agree, off the top of my head I recall reading the wiki page about the Enlightenment_(Window_Manager)-as I'm a user of it. Only a small part talks about e16, yet most of the page talks about software which has not been released officially(eg:e17 &amp; EFL apps) and is only available by compiling from source or being lucky enough to have a package built from the code which is considered pre-alpha.</p>
<p>Elbuntu on the other hand is in the alpha stage and is available to the public if they ask for it (That's how I got it). The developers of Elbuntu build the packages of E17 for this distro themselves and refine the source to allow more stability than the official source code alone.</p>
<p>And by the way, if I interpret 'Delete - 41 ghits. Fails' properly, you searched on google for Elbuntu and got 41 hits. That would seem to add some weight to your argument except for the fact that if you had done some more research you would of realised that Elbuntu has actually changed it's name from Ebuntu and if you're concerned about the number of hits this returns, it's 17,300.

<p>Lol, so you can't get your head around those 2 words 'just starting', don't worry I'll remove them. While doing so I found that this article has a few other things that haven't been updated to reflect the current state of the Distro, I'll update them now now.</p>
<p>I just read those 2 WP page's about guidelines, what I got from them was that there needs to be a primary source of information and the wikipedia acts as a secondary source. But there is already a primary source of information from the Ubuntu wiki page on Elbuntu.

<p><b>DELETE</b> To help our new friends: <i>Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith (for example, if they misrepresent their reasons). Conversely, the opinions of logged in users whose accounts predate the article's AfD nomination are given more weight.</i> per the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Afd page</a>.</p>
<p>This software's article needs to have multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, non-biased, third-party sources cited for it to pass the AFD. It currently has only a link to it's own webpage. Now if someone did find sources, one newspaper or magazine article does not make anything 'notable'. Notability standards usually require citing more than one major news source (normally in wikipeida practice, the unwritten rule is three or more sources). Please look at a few of the Wiki guidelines. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wiki is not a Publisher of Original Thought</a> - Specifically - <i>Original inventions: If you invent the word frindle or a new type of dance move (or software distro), it is not article material until a secondary source <b>reports</b> on it. Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">This still fails WP:V</a> since there is no reliable source cited yet. Notability, as a guideline, usually requires three or more major news sources for verification. There is no newspaper mentioning this software, no peer-reviewed journals...nothing. That, by most standards, is not enough for notability.</p>
<p>Blogs and forums are not accepted by wikipedia standards as Reliable Sources.</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_sources.html" title="Primary sources">Primary sources</a>- <i>present information or data, such as archeological artifacts; film, video or photographs (but see below); historical documents such as a diary, census, transcript of a public hearing, trial, or interview; tabulated results of surveys or questionnaires, records of laboratory assays or observations; records of field observations.</i></dd>
<dd><a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary.html" title="Secondary">Secondary</a> <i>sources present a generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data from other sources.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Where are the sources?</p>
<p>For Tumler: Wikipedia can not be a primary or secondary source. It is a tertiary source. The Elbuntu webpage can not be a primary or secondary source either as it is not an independent, reliable, reputable, third-party source.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In order to avoid doing original research, and in order to help improve the quality of Wikipedia articles, it is essential that any primary-source material, as well as any generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data, <b>has been published by a reputable third-party publication (that is, not self-published) that is available to readers either from a website (other than Wikipedia) or through a public library.</b> It is very important to cite sources appropriately, so that readers can find your source and can satisfy themselves that Wikipedia has used the source correctly.</i></dd>

<p>And....</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>..That is, any facts, opinions, interpretations, definitions, and arguments published by Wikipedia must already have been published by a reliable publication in relation to the topic of the article..."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Where are those published works by reputable third-party publications? Again, Blogs and forums do not count as they are self-published. See "<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Reputable_publications" title="Wikipedia:No original research">What counts as a reputable publication?"</a> and "<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable sources</a>" for discussions on how to judge whether a source is reliable. Reading those will show that blogs and the discussion forms do not count as Reputable publications nor Reliable Sources.</p>
<p><b>HERE IS THE KICKER</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The fact that we exclude something does not necessarily mean the material is bad — <b>it simply means that Wikipedia is not the proper venue for it.We would have to turn away even Pulitzer-level journalism and Nobel-level science if its authors tried to publish it first on Wikipedia.</b> If you have an idea that you think should become part of the corpus of knowledge that is Wikipedia, the best approach is to arrange to <b>have your results published in a peer-reviewed journal or reputable news outlet, and then document your work in an appropriately non-partisan manner</b>.</i></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Deke Sharon is widely regarded as the most important and respected arranger in contemporary a capella, and that's just the beginning of his contributions to this musical genre. This clueless attempt to delete him and the Jacks is flat-out vandalism. CASA, Kid Beyond and Wes Carroll are also worthy of inclusion, IMHO, but omitting Deke and the Jacks would make Wikipedia's coverage of contemporary a capella woefully incomplete. Those pages need more info, but should not be deleted. Anyone who can't find hundreds of significant articles about these two subjects has no idea how to use Google. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.101.144.8 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.101.144.8_9321.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.101.144.8">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 67.101.144.8 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.101.144.8_9321.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.101.144.8">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The issue is whether they've been "the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works whose sources are independent of the subject itself." I offer some concrete evidence. The <a href="http://www.rarb.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/" rel="nofollow">Recorded A Cappella Review Board</a> publishes album reviews independently of all the nominees. RARB has published extensive reviews of <a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/group-148.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/group-148.html" rel="nofollow">two House Jacks albums</a>, three BOCA albums (<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/236.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/236.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>,<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/191.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/191.html" rel="nofollow">2</a>,<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/135.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/135.html" rel="nofollow">3</a>), and two compilation albums published by CASA (<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/193.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/193.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>,<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/190.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/190.html" rel="nofollow">2</a>).

<dd>Actually, myspace is the myspace of college a cappella. RARB reviews are written independently by its highly exclusive staff. Groups don't get to contribute to their own reviews, which is apparent in the negative reviews, which you wouldn't find in a PR puppet.

<li>Publication frequency is achieved by having a team of writers. Each person spends two weeks on each album. At least three writers contribute to each review (each having spent two weeks). Every review has at least two more people edit it, and they end up around 1500 words on average. It's not somebody's blog about their cat. --Infotrope 18:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The "crap load" of google news articles is just twelve: some of which are satire or blogs and the rest of which are trivial references.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm not sure I have a voice in this forum, but I'd like to point out a few things: 1) The article is no longer a conflict-of-interest because it was completely rewritten by Snowmanradio. Thank you! He didn't even use any of my screen shots. 2)The Virtual Wall doesn't sell anything and we don't accept donations, so the article isn't advertising. 3) The Virtual Wall gets 6000 to 7000 unique visitors a day; probably more than most brick-and-mortar memorials. 4) The Virtual Wall will be 10 years old in March, it isn't just a flash-in-the-pan.

<p>This list is woefully subjective and the term "frivolous" is impossible to fit with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy. List has a long history and we can see quite a lot of reverts on the list with the reason "not a frivolous party". Is for instance the comedian party <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Political_Party_%28Norway%29_2552.html" title="The Political Party (Norway)">The Political Party (Norway)</a> a "frivolous" party when it can garner almost 1% of the vote? Absolutely no criteria listed for discriminating parties between the "frivolus" and the "small, eccentric, but sincere", hence no good justification for having a list of this nature. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Most of what is said above is correct, but this article brings together some fascinating articles. There does need to be something that helps people to find these articles. They are fun. I'm not sure what is for the best. Maybe lists can be subjective as long as the articles they point to are notable, NPOV and not OR. I'm inclined to say <b>Keep</b>. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 12:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While the definition may appear too subjective on first glance, the need for the criteria Sjakkalle mentions doesn't seem to arise. Very few parties go for "ambiguously serious", and those listed are firmly in the whacko corner: the kind of people who wish to repeal the law of gravity, support human rights for viruses, challenge militaries to pillow fights or run "<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parti_Citron_a311.html" title="Parti Citron">for a bitter Canada</a>" under Pope Terence the First. The list works wery well as it is. If it needs criteria, go ahead and try to add some. No attempt to do so has been made, and I don't think we can dismiss their feasibility out of hand.<br />
If we cannot call the Mad Hatter's Tea Party or <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party%21_Party%21_Party%21_2aa7.html" title="Party! Party! Party!">Party! Party! Party!</a> frivolous, our interpretation of NPOV has gone too far. There is very little reasonable or other kind of doubt that it would be an appropriate word for these parties, least of all from their members.<br />
Sjakkalle asks if garnering more than 1% of the vote makes the Norwegian Political Party nonfrivolous. That tells you more about Norway than about the party, I'm afraid. Notwithstanding one notorious event where a brand of foot powder won mayorship, definitely silly parties <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Beer-Lovers%27_Party_494c.html" title="Polish Beer-Lovers' Party">have</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Conscientiously_Work-Shy_Elements_1675.html" title="Union of Conscientiously Work-Shy Elements">won</a> both larger percentages of the vote and actual parlamential representation. He points out that the article is a good target for vandalism. It is. So what? This vandalism is dealt with, the article is upheld, and this should only be an issue if the situation is insufferable or if we're appeasing vandals, which it isn't and we aren't. Merge if you wish, rename if you wish, but do not delete. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 17:55, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There really isn't much potential for ambiguity. If you look at the history of entries reverted for lack of frivolity, none of them were close calls. Their insertion was very clearly deliberate vandalism, and there was no protest at their removal. The number of votes a party attracts is no measure of its seriousness; a large number of voters may choose to get in on the joke, but it remains a joke. The distinction is clear: a serious party seeks to influence public policy, no matter how little support it actually has; a frivolous party doesn't <i>care</i> about public policy, its purpose is entertainment or advertising. <a href="../../../z/s/e/User%7EZsero_14cb.html" title="User:Zsero">Zsero</a> 19:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. "Frivolous" is definitely non-NPOV. What to one person may be a joke, to another may be a protest vote. Americans do not vote for the Libertarian, Green, or Socialist parties in presidential elections because they seriously expect their candidate to win the election, so to some people, these parties could be considered "frivolous". --<a href="../../../p/s/i/User%7EPsiphiorg_3dff.html" title="User:Psiphiorg">Psiphiorg</a> 23:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep,</b> with reservations, but also <b>rename</b> since the use of 'frivolous' is hopelessly POV. The actual criteria for the list seem pretty clear and the actual list seems to be far less POV than the title would indicate. However, it still needs better sources: find the actual political science term for the parties, if there is one, source it and use it (and I'm sure there is). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> actually this list and the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Category%7EJoke_political_parties_ae31.html" title="Category:Joke political parties">Category:Joke political parties</a> are quite consistent and have not been troubled by the edit waring Sjakkalle expects, except for some vandalism. The definition used on <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke_political_party.html" title="Joke political party">Joke political party</a> (a political party which has been created for the purposes of entertainment or political satire) is simple, elegant and clear. Every party on the list meets that criterion. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 17:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Given that the nom is pretty poor, want to make a better case. Even the nom admits that the list distinguishs between frivolous and non-frivolous parties (without using enumerated criteria) and everyone's who's read the list can see there's no ambiguity about whether a party is frivolous or not (like <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>, it's hard to define, but <i>A rhinocerous as party president</i> is one of those <i>giveaways</i> that makes it easy to know when you see it. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:06, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As WilyD said, the list distinguishes quite effectively between frivolous and serious parties. This is a well-recognized phenomenon and quite definitely real.

<p>I'm concerned that the Alopekis may be another hoax dog breed, or at least extremely non-notable, like the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tamaskan_Dog_7b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tamaskan Dog">Tamaskan Dog</a>. The warning signs are all there; it's unrecognised by any kennel club, it's a 'rare' breed and it was once considered to be the same as another breed (which we don't have an article for). The article makes some grand claims regarding the history of the breed, but there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. There is no Alopekis club in Greece or any other country; compare this to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_Lundehund_24a9.html" title="Norwegian Lundehund">Norwegian Lundehund</a>, another rare breed.</p>
<p>Google hits are initially encouraging <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=I1i&amp;q=alopekis&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=lr%3D" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=I1i&amp;q=alopekis&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=lr%3D" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, but most of the hits are for Greek streets with that name. Compensating gives a far weaker result: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=u3i&amp;q=alopekis+-wikipedia+dog&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=lr%3D" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=u3i&amp;q=alopekis+-wikipedia+dog&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=lr%3D" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. The bulk of the hits seem to be for advert-filled dog sites that allow anyone to submit content. The two external links are sites of this type. One, <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/alopekis.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/alopekis.htm" rel="nofollow">dogbreedinfo.com</a> contains pictures of very varied looking dogs, all apparently examples of 'Alopekii'. --<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 12:07, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The dogs shown on dogbreedinfo are actually about as varied as one would expect from an unstandardized, pariah-type dog. They're all similar in type, if not coat texture, coat colour, and ear carriage. That being said, I'm very interested and knowledgeable on rare dog breeds, and I've never heard of this one in my life. --<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharaoh_Hound_a2fe.html" title="User:Pharaoh Hound"><font color="#D55B12">Pharaoh Hound</font></a> <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPharaoh_Hound_0c71.html" title="User talk:Pharaoh Hound"><small>(talk)</small></a> 12:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think this is an <i>intentional</i> hoax, if indeed it is one. The two major contributors are dog fanciers from Canada (not commercial breeders) who've made a lot of contributions to dog articles. Any rate, I added an adw tag to their talk pages, hopefully they'll turn up and clarify some of the details about this breed.... oops, she beat me to it! I wonder what <i>Alopekis</i> means in Greek? Maybe "wild dog", "mutt", or "Beat it, pooch, stay out of the agora!"? If this is basically a feral or dingo type dog in its homeland, then that might explain the lack of "owner's clubs". <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 13:07, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> her name into the articles on her father and cousin, who are mentioned in the one sentence article, if this hasn't been done already and then <b>delete</b>. While I normally tend to agree with Smerdis of Tlön's view when it comes to historical persons, this woman seems particularly non-notable. The article even states that she is an "unknown woman," which I take to mean that the only known info on her is her relationship to the two individuals mentioned in the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article represents <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original reserach</a> in that the "Tesla effect" is not a standardized term. While pseudoscience in-and-of-itself is not a deletionable reason, lack of coherent explanatory references is.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is no Tesla Effect to describe. If this article is trying to describe the social phenomenon of 'People who incorrectly believe there is a Tesla Effect' it is way too sketchy and has no reliable sources. While trying to uphold the banner of normal science, the article does not succeed in giving a clear statement of what Tesla actually thought. It sounds as though he must have disbelieved Maxwell's equations.

<p>The notability of this article is doubtful. I can't really find guidelines for notability of matches, but this match didn't really have big implications, unlike, for example, <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruguay_V_Brazil_%28World_Cup_1950%29_ed90.html" title="Uruguay V Brazil (World Cup 1950)">Uruguay V Brazil (World Cup 1950)</a>, so I don't think it's notable enough to have a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaurisil_2734.html" title="User:Thaurisil">Thaurisil</a> 15:08, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> no precedent for such level of detail. The over 1994 WC article is quite enough, and the report is available and linked externally. We don't need to replicate that in WP. So although the event was real, verifiable, and attracted a crapload of non-trivial media attention, I think we should delete it nevertheless. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 16:30, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>This AfD Should Sleep With The Fishes</b>. Oh, come now. If we can have articles on every model of battlesuit that had so much as ten seconds screentime on Mobile Suit Gundam, we can have an article on a character provoking one of the most famous lines in cinematic history, one that's entered the public vocabulary.

<li>As stated below, the only significant contribution from the character is the quote. Which can be discussed in <i>The Godfather</i> article.

<li><b>Keep/Merge/Redirect</b> I think there's enough on this page to warrant a seperate article. It's not like anybody is arguing for the information to be outright removed.

<p>Just because the character is notable does not warrant an entire article to based upon him. The question is, how would <i>keeping</i> this article improve Wikipedia? The only thing the character brings to pop culture is the quote, so the focus of the information should be on the quote, not the person. This information does not deserve it's own article either, so the information should be placed in <i>The Godfather</i> article. So the only notable information that this article could wield does not even belong in the article.

<dd>The only reason given is that he is "somewhat iconic" or "important". These are not grounds for an entire article.

<p>KEEP - Luca's role is more important that his limited appearance in the novel and film; he remains a fear inspiring memory throughout the Godfather.

<li><b>Keep</b> This list is not indiscriminate; it is precisely the opposite. The criterion for inclusion in the list is quite clearly stated and respected. Wikipedia proscribes genealogies of people who are not noteworthy; Charlemagne is very definitely noteworthy, and his descendants are noteworthy as well. In fact, as User:Alf photoman stated, many deservedly have their own articles. This list organizes information about this group of people who are important in European history, and adds information that is not available in a category (such as names of people who don't have articles, names of spouses etc.). Important and encyclopedic. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 07:37, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It is indiscriminate because, as another editor noted, the descendants of Charlemagne are innumerable and not completely known. It is not unlikely that I am a descendant of Charlemagne, but I do not belong on any Wikipedia list. The descendants of Charlemagne can be found at their respective articles, which typically list the subjects wives and concubines and children. Charlemagne and his descendants can be traced through the articles by any intelligent person. Besides, the format of the list is poor and the reseach is solely based on one website. What other articles, by the way, would link to it? Names of nonnotable folks are present in the articles of those notable enough to deserve articles, no genealogy needed. <a href="../../../s/r/n/User%7ESrnec_6158.html" title="User:Srnec">Srnec</a> 03:20, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> There's precedent for having lists like this in an encyclopedia. Given the importance of genealogy in the legitimation of medieval rulers, it's not really fair to say that it's just a collection of indiscriminate information. Citation needs to be religious, though, and notability guidelines should apply or it runs the risk of turning into a vanity page for modern people claiming descent from Charlemagne. <a href="../../../d/p/p/User%7EDppowell_6cfb.html" title="User:Dppowell">Dppowell</a> 17:36, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a place for this type of genealogical information. It will necessarily have to be arbitrarily limited to a small number of generations, as each subsequent generation will multiply in size almost exponentially. Indeed, interestingly enough my mother's family can trace itself to Charlemagne. Almost everyone can trace their family back to important individuals, and the title of this article, at least, appears to aim for being exhaustive. If the relationship of each individual to Charlemagne is notable then have that information in their articles. This, however, is unmaintainable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>A proposal</b> Further narrow the focus by renaming article "Descendants of Charlemagne to the fifth generation." Remove sixth and seventh generations from the list.

<dd>Note: This summary was crafted to be misleading, which is very dissapointing. The statement "the introduction of the article states it was a word in use historically in 2 jurisdictions; as comparison, there are 50 such jurisdictions in the US alone, and there is no record of this so-called "word" after the 1800s, according to the article itself." is both misleading and wrong. The 2nd "jurisdiction" does not operate the same way the US jurisdictions does and comparing it to the US system is very misleading, in the US there are many seperate jurisdictions of Royal Arch Masonry, however the 2nd jurisdiction we have verifiable proof the word was used in is the Supreme Grand Chapter in England which oversees all Royal Arch Masonry in England. Also the statement that there is no record of the word after the 1800's is a blatant lie. The user who wrote this summary in a previous edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jahbulon&amp;diff=72627593&amp;oldid=72513225" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jahbulon&amp;diff=72627593&amp;oldid=72513225" rel="nofollow">here</a> found and introduced a source that shows the word was in use up to atleast February 1989 (Jahbulon is what is referred to as "the word on the triangle" which is shown in the Tydemann source that can be found <a href="http://www.gkf.ic24.net/coe/apx9.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gkf.ic24.net/coe/apx9.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.). People looking at this AFD should look at the statement he made in his summary "there is no record of this so-called "word" after the 1800s" and compare it to his edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jahbulon&amp;diff=72627593&amp;oldid=72513225" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jahbulon&amp;diff=72627593&amp;oldid=72513225" rel="nofollow">here</a> before assuming that the proposed summary was written from a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 19:21, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> - merits minor mention in either Anti-Masonry or Christianity and Freemasonry for the following reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the word itself notable? - It would seem not, it's a synthesised term with a range of potential, but speculative, meanings.</li>
<li>Is there a controversy surrounding the word? - I would hesitate to call it a controversy although there is some use of it in attacks on the craft. Most of these attacks do not themselves source their interpretation, but it seems reasonable to assess that they are all derived from a single instance in the notes to an otherwise unattributed document. The majority of offline mention is predicated on reports by various churches, undertaken in the 80's, and including the explanation amongst about half a dozen other reasons predominantly related to unsubstantiated allegations of inappropriate influence and hierarchies independent of the church. Any media related discussion of these reports concentrates on these behavioural criticisms and neglect to mention the use of the word.</li>
<li>Is there any independent corroboration? - I would suggest not, none of the citations used attribute their interpretation. Whilst I recognise that throwing large numbers of citations at an article might help justify it, the process should use verifiably independent sourcing.</li>
<li>Is it accurate? - No. At least two of the citations do actually refer to what the Royal Arch word actually is.</li>
<li>Does having a separate article about it tend to exacerbate the perception of a controversy? - Yes. We're wasting an awful lot of time and effort on something which is inaccurate (although marginally verifiable) and only a small part of a broader topic which is adequately covered elsewhere. Noting that some will use Google as a means of establishing notability the very process of discussion on the talk page elevates the level of coverage and it's relative importance to Google. Using that mechanism one must recognise the issues with the google search algorithms.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> - The article also has problems with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, in that 1) the bulk of the article is little more than dictionary definitions, (speculative ones at that) and 2) the article is a subtle form of POV Agenda bashing, which goes against the soap box provision.</li>

<dl>
<dd>In the previous AfDs, several editors have expressed the view that "it is the controversy surrounding this word that makes it notable"; however, when I have asked them to explain what this controversy <i>is</i>, they do not respond. There are no citations to independant reliable sources for there being any controversy about this word (while the article is extensively referenced, almost all of the references deal with the etimology of the word and none of them discuss a controversy surounding it.) Without such a citation, we have to assume that any claim that there <i>is</i> a controversy constitues boarderline Original Research.</dd>
<dd>I can only think of two things that could be considered a "controversy": 1) the debate over this word's etymology, or 2) the debate over whether Freemasons do or do not worship Satan. If the the first is the controversy that they are talking about, I do not think this is much of a "controversy" (more a set of competing definitions), and certainly not a notable one. If the controversy is the second issue, I would contend that this is really a sub-argument of a larger controversy between certain Fundamentalist Christian groups and Freemasonry. In which case this article really should be merged into <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_and_Freemasonry_a076.html" title="Christianity and Freemasonry">Christianity and Freemasonry</a> which explores these larger issues in more depth.</dd>
<dd>Another argument that came up in past AfDs was "it's interesting". I will simply point out that "interesting" is not the same as "encylopedic". We make a distinction in Wikipedia between what is mearly "cool" and what is truly encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The debate exists outside of Wikipedia, whatever the merits of the <i>case</i>, <i>references</i>, <i>agenda's</i> or whatever. The fact that much/all of the suppositions and claims are disputed, and the references questioned for lack of provenence, is irrelevant - it is in the public domain, thus it is likely to be searched, and this article is the vehicle to note it. I would <b>comment</b> that this is the third attempt at an AfD within a year, and it appears that the <i>usual suspects</i> are pressing for deletion are the same as previously and that the same anti-deletion names will again vote to keep, and wonder if the 3 revert rule could be applied here? <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 14:04, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per LessHeard vanU. Both the word and the controversy surrounding it exist.

Looking at the talk page archives, the same parties appear to have been arguing about this since March. One can't help but think that this "debate" is intentionally constructed to give the appearance of a dispute about the encyclopedic status of the article. These secret socities and their games give me the creeps. Their goals of keeping certain information secret are diametrically opposed to the goals of Wikipedia. In this case, we need to see through the rhetoric and put the goals of Wikipedia first. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> (<a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">yakity-yak</a>) 15:12, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>comment: The debate is not whether this word exists or not, or even what some people believe about the word... but if a Wikipedia article on it should be deleted. The questions to be asked and answered here are: 1) Is it notable enough for inclusion? 2) If so, why? 3) Does the article have problems with several guidelines and policies or not? The statement about secret societies and their "goal of keeping information secret" is spurious (and quite frankly POV) as the rituals that contain this word have been public knowledge since at least the 1840s ... there is no issue of keeping anything secret. This is not about secrecy, but about notability. If there <i>is</i> some big controversy over this word, then there is notability, If not then the word is not really notable. This is an encyclopedia, and not every piece of trivial fluff is worthy of an article.

<dl>
<dd>Oh yeah I forgot, according to you and a few of the other editors on the page, people claiming that the word is used in a certain way isn't allowed to be included in the article since those people themselves are biased, and actually reading sources instead of just pulling direct quotes out of them is considered original research and therefore inference. If I find a source of some religious group saying that Jahbulon is the name of the Masonic Devil God, and use that source to make the statement "atleast one religious group has claimed that Jahbulon is the name of a Masonic God" it's removed due to the source being biased, which is NOT how wikipedia works, nor how RS works. I have a great idea, my new source for the fact that there is controversy surrounding this word is the Wikipedia Jahbulon Talk page, or the edit history of the actual Jahbulon page where users can see editors removing over and over sourced statements, or where a fully sourced version of the article was removed all at once by you with the comment "tx across replacement article drafted in talkspace in light of recent edit warring. Majority agreed, anticipate continued disruption from non-contributing individual" since obviously if people are disagreeing with the majority that's all the consensus the majority needs to remove sourced material that they disagree with. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 19:51, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, the word is notable due to the controversy established in the "Jahbulon and Religion" section in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jahbulon&amp;oldid=42997323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jahbulon&amp;oldid=42997323" rel="nofollow">this</a> version of the Article. All the sources in there show that enough groups make claims about the word that are disputed by masonic representatives that calling the situation "controversial" under the defination of "Controversy" that reads "contention, strife, or argument" a completly valid claim. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 20:10, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We have gone over this many times. To put in the article the statement "a number of religious bodies asserting that the interpretation demonstrates that Freemasonry is incompatible with their religious philosophies" simply requires sources of religious groups making claims that Freemasonry is incompatible with their philosophies. The fact that the sources are clearly biased is irrelevant since the source is simply being used to show that Group X makes claim Y, where the source (S) is Group X claiming Y, it's not stating Y as a fact using S as a reference. Once you are able to grasp that concept all your confusion will be cleared up. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 22:29, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ALR just because you don't read my posts doesn't mean i'm not answering the question. In the version of the article that I pointed to, in the "Jahbulon and religion" section there are many fully sourced lines explaining that there is a contraversy with links to websites where various religious groups from both catholic and non catholic sources discuss how jahbulon is the name of a seperate god and thus blasphemous. Since they are self published sources, they are being used only as primary sources, and many of them are given since "and as primary sources only with great caution and not as a sole source if the subject is controversial". It meets the requirements of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and is not Original research. I'm starting to feel like a broken record. You keep asking me to "answer the question" and accusing me of avoiding a question, yet i'm trying to answer whatever you ask. If you don't find this to be enough, please restate the question since obviously i'm not understanding it. I'm providing proof of the controversy that's completly sourced in accordance with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> with no original research. I assume that is what you were looking for. Unless of course your attempting to argue that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>'s section titled "Self-published sources as secondary sources" doesn't actually exist, in which case I have some bad news for you. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 18:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anthony, please... this is not about "secrets"... the entire Masonic ritual has been exposed numerous times (starting as far back as the mid 1700s). There are no "sectets" for the Masons to keep. This is about the notability of a word, and if there should be an article about it in an encyclopedia. So please... explain to us what the supposed controversy is about? I notice that (as with the last two AfDs on this article) the arguments are coming down to a bunch of people saying that the word is notable because it is controvercial ... but no one seems able to articulate what that controversy actually <i>is</i>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Particularly as those of us who are Masons appreciate that this word is not in fact used hence cannot be considered as a secret anyway. Lets face it, if there was going to be an exposure of the word it would be much better to actually have the correct one.&#160;:) ALR 19:42, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Lummee (here we go again); Whilst it may well be that the word is a concoction by anti Masonic interests, or a misunderstanding, the point is that the <i>accusation</i> (for want of a better word) is in the public domain. That is why there is a debate; Masons say it doesn't exist (although not formally, see my comment above) and other parties say it does - which some of them use as an example of anti Christian "devil worship". It may be irritating to the point of tears, but the debate exists. The article is the place in which to record the objections/denials.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 14:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I ssincerely doubt that during the late 80's after the publication of Knight that various Masonic authorities considered Wikipedia content guidelines as a reason for not commenting on an issue.</dd>
<dd>However, notwithstanding that, the issue is one of a number (usually between six or eight) which are used by a range of Christian denominations to object to Freemasonry. That's already extensively discussed in another article, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_and_Freemasonry_a076.html" title="Christianity and Freemasonry">Christianity and Freemasonry</a>. Various Masonic authorities do have a position on that.</dd>
<dd>It would be quite reasonable to place the issue in context by including it in that article, hence my <b>Merge</b> suggestion above.</dd>

<dd>Anthony... thank you. Finally someone has answered my question as to what the controversy is. That makes things clearer. The article isn't about whether the word exists or not, nor is it really about what the word actually means, or how Masons use it ... it is about the fact that certain Christian groups think it means that Masonry is anti-Christian. I actually can live with that... as another issue in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_and_Freemasonry_a076.html" title="Christianity and Freemasonry">Christianity and Freemasonry</a> Article. But I still don't think the subject rises to the level of notability for an article on its own.</dd>
<dd>I especially have questions as to whether the article meets the criteria for inclusion stated in <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a>. Can you provide at least one reliable mainstream source (such as a newspaper or an academic journal) that discusses this controversy extensively (even to debunk it), as is required by that guideline? So far, all the sources that discuss this word have come from advocates of one side of this controversy or the other... most are Anti-masonic sources, and a few are Royal Arch Masons. Both sides of which I would contend are Fringe (If I remember my stats correctly, less than 1% of all Freemasons are invovled in any way with Royal Arch Masonry). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 22:08, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Blueboar it should be noted that <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> was created to deal with Science related issues, as an extension of the notability requirement. With part of the justification of it being "anything with a complete lack of mainstream discussions can probably not be written about in a NPOV manner without some sort of mainstream baseline; doing so risks violating the No original research policy". Since the page does use many sources, some primary, and presents the topic in a NPOV manner without original research, then WP:FRINGE does not apply. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 22:36, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> may have been originally created due to disputes relating to science theories, but it has clear application to Fringe theories in other fields, and has gone beyond its origin. If you read the guideline, it clearly is on point in this dispute in two of four sections:
<ul>
<li><i>Any non-mainstream theories should be referenced extensively, and in a serious manner, in at least one major mainstream publication or by another important mainstream group or individual. Even debunking or disparaging references are adequate, as they establish the notability of the theory outside of the small group of adherents. References that are brought about because of the notability of a related subject, such as the creator of the theory, and not the theory itself, should be given far less weight when deciding on notability. Due consideration should be given to the fact that reputable news sources often cover less than strictly notable topics in a lighthearted fashion, such as on April Fool's Day, as "News of the Weird" or during "slow news days".</i></li>
<li><i>The discussion of a non-mainstream theory, positively or negatively, by other non-mainstream groups or individuals is not a criterion for notability, even if the latter group or individual is themself notable enough for a Wikipedia article. If a non-mainstream theory is so unnotable that mainstream sources have not bothered to comment on it, disparage it, or discuss it, it is not notable enough for Wikipedia.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The second criteria is especially apt in this instance. Please provide even one mainstream source that has commented on, disparaged or discussed this word or the theories surounding it. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 00:59, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As I pointed out to you already on the talk page, WP:FRINGE does not apply here, you responded to my point by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJahbulon&amp;diff=92226177&amp;oldid=92171550" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJahbulon&amp;diff=92226177&amp;oldid=92171550" rel="nofollow">stating</a> "But the theory that Jahbulon is the name that Masons use while they worship Satan is EXACTLY what this article is about!", so now i'll toss it back at you, since you are claiming that the page violates <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> why don't you explain to me how you can possibly believe that the page is about masons worship satan.

However as this AFD has shown, the majority of people have replied that the page is about a notable controversy, so good luck convincing everyone. Infact I don't understand why this discussion about <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> should continue since unless you can prove that the page is simply about masons using jahbulon as the name of their satanic god, the argument that the page is about a controversy not a theory, absolutely nullifies <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a>, since the page is about removal of pages about Fringe Theories from wikipedia, and it specifices "Theories". If you can't prove the page is about a theory, <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> doesn't apply at all. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 01:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seraphim - you say: "If the page was all about how Jahbulon is the name of a masonic devil god, then WP:FRINGE would apply"... but that <i>is</i> exactly what the article is about. The theory that (as Anthony said above) Jahbulon is "a Masonic word for God or for a god" is the only thing that makes this word at all notable. So WP:FRINGE surely applies.</dd>
<dd>Anthony, if the information about Jahbulon were to be merged into the article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_and_Freemasonry_a076.html" title="Christianity and Freemasonry">Christianity and Freemasonry</a>, much of the arguing would disappear. A major factor in this AfD is the contention that this word is not notable enough for an article on it's own... a merge would solve that. For another, WP:FRINGE would not apply, as that guideline relates to articles and not to sections within articles. For another, I would agree that, <i>in the context of the C&amp;F article</i>, the debate over this <i>would</i> be notable. The C&amp;F article already discusses several reasons why different Christian groups object to Masonry. this fits in perfectly in that discussion. As that is the central theme of this article, it makes sense to merge it. In fact, a merger would give a much needed context to the debate over this word. Sure, there might be a brief period of back and fourth as we debate how this information best fits into the C&amp;F article, but I truly believe that we could easily reach a consensus on that. The idea of keeping a bad article in order to "fireproof" another is rediculous. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article is only badly cited because the block of users who have been strong arming everyone else out of the article wish it to be. The users who all voted delete on here (specifically MSJapan ALR and Blueboar) have all stated publically that they do not want this article to exist, and they oppose any attempts to improve the article, so when they post their next AFD comments like this will be posted. They abuse <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> with the idea that if a group makes a statement against masonry, then they are inherently biased and therefore any attempt to use the page where they make their statement as a source is immediatly shot down. For example, I find a source S where Group X makes claim Y, I then add a line to the article that states "Group X has made claim Y" and use S as the source. This is completly acceptable as a self-published source being used as a primary source, however the masonic-editing-block will immediatly blanket revert stating that source S is biased and therefore is not able to ever be used on wikipedia as a reference, which is wrong. The amount of references removed from the article is staggering, right now if you look at the article there is no mention at all about the controversy the term has caused between masons and religious groups. This is because the majority group of editors will remove any information added to the article that is not related to the possible defination of the word, inorder to support their claims that there is no controversy and therefore no notability. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jahbulon&amp;oldid=42997323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jahbulon&amp;oldid=42997323" rel="nofollow">this</a> version of the article if you want to see an example of some of the information that they culled from the article. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 21:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you misrepresent the situation, personally I don't believe there is anything particularly notable about a word and a few churches objecting to freemasonry but I've said several times that I'm quite happy for the issue to be properly contextualised amongst all the other objections to Freemasonry by the churches, in the extensive article already written about <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_and_Freemasonry_a076.html" title="Christianity and Freemasonry">Christianity and Freemasonry</a>. That places it in it's proper context, as one of a number of objections and as one of a number of specific things which lead Churches to see Freemasonry as a competitor.</dd>
<dd>I would also suggest that despite my reservations I have sought to work collaboratively to bring the issue to a reasonable conclusion. I'll admit that at times it does feel like I'm banging my head agasint a brick wall, but that's the nature of collaboration sometimes. I'd also say that the other regular contributors who have declared themselves to be Craftsmen have generally done the same and put up with quite a lot of innuendo both to us and about us on numerous talk pages.</dd>
<dd>You'll note that my persistence with regard to actually outlining your views has now resulted in some apparently productive discussion on the talk page, which I hope will continue. However I am concerned that you've now chosen to revert to the previous style of asking us to understand your position by pointing at a legacy version.</dd>
<dd>I'd agree that the article is badly referenced, it's over-reliant on the few credible sources which exist however the more recent information about usage outside Masonry is proving illuminating.</dd>

<dd>We already had the discussion about a possible merger into the Christianity and Freemasonry article months ago, which was ended when sources were found that show some Islamic groups believe that Jahbulon is the name of a masonic devil god. I suggest you read the page's archives, before making the incorrect assertion that it's only an issue between Christianity and Freemasonry. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 22:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's one of the things that we can discuss on the talk page, if you can return to discussing development in a mature manner. The Prescott reference proves quite illuminating that particular front.</dd>
<dd>Also I thought we were making reasonable progress towards synthesising a form of words which could be used, but your more recent actions by chopping in huge chunks which had been previously agreed as inadequately sourced is not particularly condusive to a collaborative environment.</dd>
<dd>I'd very much appreciate if you could return to trying to make progress in a sensible manner.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Not really. It is a topic of contention among evangelical Christians who have online ministries dedicated to turning Masons "away from Lodge and to (their) church". The number of actual Royal Arch Masons is probably less than 10% of the total membership in most areas outside the UK. The "controversy" arises from conflating the Lodge and the Chapter, which are separate bodies. It is the usual problem when the people objecting to something don't fully understand what it is that they are objecting to, and thus anything that could be loosely yermed Masonic, whether recognized by Masons or not, is deemed to be "Masonic". The "controversy" arises from the ease of making a web page and borrowing content uncritically from other spurious sources. It is a question of WP making a mountain out of a molehill. for example, Googling gets us this article as the number one hit. The second is an evangelical website, the third is an anti-Masonic site, and so on and so forth. This is all fringe stuff, and most of the editors arguing against deletion don't know anything about this either. Yet the information from those who <i>do</i> know is discounted. People are more interested in unqualified and unencyclopedic conspiracy theory-type "research" than they are in the truth, because it is simply less exciting. However, this does not make it mainstream, or encyclopedic.<a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 02:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find the phrase "<i>...information from those who</i> do <i>know is discounted...</i>" a little insulting; any editor who is able to provide counterclaim and argument has the opportunity to express same within the article, yet those who proclaim themselves knowledgable about the "truth" (and that is a subjective issue in this matter) wish to remove the article. The claims, however far fetched or even ridiculous/errornous they may be, are already in the public domain, in print and catalogued, and are searchable on the internet. I cannot see why it would suit Freemasonary that the only references should then be on "fire and brimstone" religious sites, even if by countering the arguments it appears to give the matter spurious authority. It is surely better to present your arguments than run the risk of appearing to be attempting to mask "the truth" (that subjective concept, again!)? I'm also a little tired of making these points that nobody has the courtesy to answer.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 13:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I have gathered, the general trend has been that the Fraternity does not respond to criticism for just that reason of lending authority to that which is spurious. Moreover, (and most importantly for purposes of this argument) what one jurisdiction says only applies to that jurisdiction, so any response to criticism is never an institutional or universal response. I would also point out that as far as HD's point below goes, again, as there is no central administration, there is no one interpretation or one usage of <i>anything</i> within Masonry or any appendant body outside of a single given jurisdiction, so there's no one truth to publish; it is merely fire and brimstone sites that make these sweeping and incorrect generalizations about the structure and content of Freemasonry. This is why, for example, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Taxil_8b74.html" title="Leo Taxil">Leo Taxil</a> was obviously wrong to anyone who was a Mason at the time, and why modern day Masons know that the supporting evidence for these various modern claims is wrong, because they know how things work. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 15:55, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, these editors are experienced enough to know that "<i>...information from those who</i> do <i>know is discounted...</i>" is the norm on Wikipedia unless <i>what they know</i> can be backed up with references. If your <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_society.html" title="Secret society">secret society</a> <i>chooses</i> not to publish "the truth" about something, then what you know or claim to know is compeletely immaterial.

<dd>Not my point at all. My point is, you (the Masons) could simply reveal either the actual word used OR the actual interpretation of the word supposedly no longer used or publish whatever the heck you want about it which could then be used in the article. Just because something is secret doesn't mean it's nefarious. It <i>does</i> mean that the people who actually know the facts can't properly clarify them. But that's nobody's fault but their own! —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 18:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but my point is that the question of whether the word does, has, or in what context exist is irrelevant. The <i>allegation</i> is in the public domain, as are subsequent references, and even if it is without a shred of truth (a position I could accept, as I am fully aware of established religions practice of - frankly - lying about organisations they do not care for) and thus deemed unworthy of remark by the Freemasons, it is still a subject that should have an encyclopedic entry. The claim is thus noted, references cited, and the counterclaims / arguments presented, with references. This can be done without requiring any sanction of any authority, by individuals with some knowledge of the matter . Removing the article does not make the claim disappear - rather, it may appear to justify those who remark upon supposed conspiracy.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:24, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is standard practice with disambiguation pages. In fact it is encouraged practice here. Hair analysis is used in widely different manners, and the alternative medicine use has little if any relation to the forensic and toxicological uses, therefore it is better to deal with it in its own article, which should make all advocates of this use pretty happy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_analysis.html" title="Hair analysis">hair analysis</a> article was confusing because it contained widely different elements. Now the aspects related to alternative medicine practices are collected in one article and can be examined there. Anything dealing with the scientific aspects of hair analysis that are relevant to the new article can certainly be added if appropriate.</dd>
<dd>The new article is still open for inclusion of other POV, so it's not a POV fork, and in fact contains the original content. If only one POV had been moved it would be a different matter, but it contains all the relevant content that existed.</dd>
<dd>This complaint seems to be motivated more by the fact that this particular (mis)use of hair analysis has been criticized, and the one complaining doesn't like that fact, hence this AfD is a POV tactic and possible attempt to suppress opposing opinion. This is obviously nonsense because the article is open for more editing, and can present all significant POV.</dd>
<dd>Instead of complaining, I suggest that interested editors start doing their job, which is to edit and improve articles. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 21:29, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This content was originally part of the <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_analysis.html" title="Hair analysis">hair analysis</a> article, but it created confusion because the uses are so extremely different. It's practically like night and day. Therefore this subject deserves its own article where it can be dealt with more completely. In short, while both articles may be "referring to the same act", they are definitely NOT referring to its use for the same <b>purpose</b>. It is <b>only</b> this one that is questioned, and very seriously so at that. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 22:19, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not see this as a POV fork. One article is about use in the science of forensics, the other is about the pseudoscience of alternative medicine. It is similar to the distinction between <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aura_%28symptom%29.html" title="Aura (symptom)">aura (symptom)</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aura_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Aura (paranormal)">aura (paranormal)</a>. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 22:27, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not a POV fork any more than <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> is a POV fork of <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphology.html" title="Graphology">graphology</a> is a POV fork of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questioned_document_examination.html" title="Questioned document examination">questioned document examination</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, a separate concept from forensic hair analysis, article is well referenced. Merging is available as an editorial decision, no deletion would then be permissible. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.176.82.42.html" title="User:80.176.82.42">80.176.82.42</a> 23:43, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Re-Merge</b> with hair analysis or <b>Delete</b>. The "alternative medical" uses are largely investigative <b>environmental toxicology</b> (excess exposures and if one includes deficiency) where the results are not stand alone definitive but may indicate follow up with examination, histories, other tests. I see no need for a separate article to argue "POV platforms" when the initial article is still so information deficient. If the "parent", <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_analysis.html" title="Hair analysis">hair analysis</a>, gets to 60-80kb w/o bloating quotes, then a specialty article might be a discussion and it should split differently along more technical lines rather than a POV subject title. One needs to work the basics first. I was taking it slowly trying to improve the original article by making suggestions, trying to increase technical content, incrementally offering references like the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention_f18d.html" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</a> site, and then slightly balancing text when Fyslee streaks out on his own to re-establish a <b>more</b> highly negative POV article that feeds his other favorite POV references such as at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Barrett&amp;diff=93227641&amp;oldid=93226990" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Barrett&amp;diff=93227641&amp;oldid=93226990" rel="nofollow">Stephen Barrett</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Barrett&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93226990" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Barrett&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93226990" rel="nofollow">again</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orthomolecular_medicine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93226420" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orthomolecular_medicine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93226420" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li>I wasn't aware of that. Do you have something I can read? It is quite telling that alternative medicine's misuse of hair analysis would cause problems for legitimate research, but it wouldn't surprise me. Just look at chiropractic's misuse of spinal manipulation. It meant that the medical world (with a few notable exceptions) was wary of using it, because of the aura of pseudoscience and quackery that has always enshrouded the chiropractic profession. Fortunately the medical researchers (those notable exceptions) persisted and got it to be accepted and used in some situations, but without the misuse and quackery. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 00:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is appropriate to keep alternative medicine topics separate from conventional medical articles. The standards and context are different. In this case <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_analysis_%28alternative_medicine%29.html" title="Hair analysis (alternative medicine)">Hair analysis (alternative medicine)</a> appears to be an NPOV article, not a POV fork. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 00:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Basically agreeing to most of the other arguments: Keeping them separate allows the Hair analysis article to expand while being focused on proven methods and applications, while the alt med issues can continue to be documented in a separate article. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 00:44, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Delete</b> This article contains nothing related to alternative medicine as I understand that term. The "alternative" uses mentioned are in fact commonly considered in standard environmental and forensic exposure assessment where one needs to determine whether a person has had an excessive exposure to a metal such as lead or mercury, for example. The question of whether the method is valid for these purposes is important to any discussion of hair analysis and should be a part of the basic "Hair Analysis" article. <a href="../../../p/z/a/User%7EPzavon_ab25.html" title="User:Pzavon">Pzavon</a> 03:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The only thing that forensics, toxicology, and alternative medicine share in this case is the actual hair analysis. From that point on they divert just as radically as <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, which also share something -- the study of stars. They have separate articles, and so should these. The investigations that have been made of commercial hair analysis labs which primarily service alt medders have shown serious problems, which legitimate labs that only service scientists likely lack, so even the actual analysis is flawed, and the accompanying treatment advice and sale of products is likewise a dubious and unethical situation. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 20:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with the comments that suggest that the altmed use and the forensic use are in quite different contexts and should be kept separate. I think this will lead to less argument on either article and a greater possability that both will develop into good NPOV articles. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 09:18, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorry I do not have much to add, other than if the two were to be merged, there would either have to be consensus among the practisioners (of both 'branches') on basic methodology or one would only be a footnote. I think the mention alternative hair analysis gets is fair in the 'main' article and that any more details on it should be within its own article. But I am willing to be proven wrong if someone can explain to me how the methodologies, results, et al. of the two are bascially the same. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 13:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Forensic hair analysis and alternative medical practicioners' hair analysis are two very different practices going by the same name. Hence they merit separate articles. To do otherwise would be as sensible as putting the mystics' concept of <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_%28healing_or_psychic_or_spiritual%29.html" title="Energy (healing or psychic or spiritual)">Energy</a> in with the homonymic <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">scientific concept</a>. <a href="../../../b/k/a/User%7EBkalafut_629e.html" title="User:Bkalafut">Bkalafut</a> 20:38, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep This Entry</b> - more than a cable access television host due to a vocal and obsessive international following. RGTraynor is absolutely correct about IMDB not listing Lazar's uncredited role, although Lazar is very clearly visible in the film itself as one of the jurors and his participation in the film is well known among viewers of his show. Lazar's other film acting work consists only of dozens of short films shot by local Virginia filmmakers, none of which would merit IMDB's attention. <b>Here's the thing</b>, though: Lazar and his partner attract attention worldwide despite being on a local Virginia television show due to heavy internet traffic in clips and countless discussions in blogs, which is why I believe Lazar is noteworthy enough to rate a brief Wikipedia article (someone surfing the net might see so many references to Lazar in blogs that he might turn to Wikipedia to find out who this is: I'd bet my life this is happening). Lazar has even been animated into a cartoon video by some German fans (and it's quite funny). The reason Lazar's partner's entry in Wikipedia was removed was not because of lack of interest but because of <b>too much</b> of the wrong kind of interest: repeated vandalism of the site. Lazar's entry, however, hasn't suffered that fate, and I think that his international following merits an entry for Lazar, particularly since Wikipedia literally can't have a site for his partner. If the attention garnered by Lazar's television work were limited to Virginia, I'd say delete the article, but Lazar and his partner have a surreally vocal following in Europe, which I think makes the difference and makes Lazar's entry well worth keeping. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoryliner_f8c1.html" title="User:Storyliner">Storyliner</a> 23:28, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Unfortunately, the assertion that this fellow has a vocal international following or "countless" discussion in blogs falls pretty flat when you only have 23 Google hits for him, the assertion that his role in that film was genuinely important bucks against that the IMDB entry lists about a dozen uncredited actors, none of whom are Lazar.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I never said that Lazar's role in the film was important, it's an uncredited nonspeaking role (the very definition of unimportance), I only pointed out that he certainly is in the film and quite clearly visible; it's germane only in that Lazar occasionally discusses the experience on his show. What I do think is noteworthy, however, is the sheer <b>multiplicity</b> of blog references to Lazar in both Europe and the United States, as well as the animation I mentioned. Perhaps part of the purpose of Wikipedia, in the current digital environment, is to provide an online reference for people to look up a television entertainer if they keep seeing that person repeatedly referred to in many blogs and online video clips being posted across the world.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoryliner_f8c1.html" title="User:Storyliner">Storyliner</a> 20:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>DON'T DELETE---It's the internet, stupid! one blogged entry on ask.com or google is as reliable as your best friend's band's website or ex-girlfriend's list of recent dates with all their negatives! cyberspace is ethereal...and that's just about how much of it is verifiable. Thus, Kaye Lazar is no better or worse than any other performer with a limited number of listings. This is reminiscient before I got tenure, when I had to go to the dean and present to him all the books I wrote. Even though, the faculty was impressed with the stack and my photo on the back cover, they had no intention of ever reading my books. Let Kaye Lazar's entry remain on Wikipedia.---nospeedlimit</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - If I understand the argument correctly, you beleive that nothing on the Internet is reliable so this means that the entry for Kaye Lazar should be kept since verifiability shouldn't be a concern.

<p>As I repeatedly pointed out on talk, there is no definition of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_city.html" title="Holy city">Holy city</a>. As a result, people add to the list all sort of trash (mostly capitals and sites of monasteries or other local shrines) <b>they</b> consider important and then revert war about it. Some especially clueful editors even arrange the sites according to their relative importance.</p>
<p>Some examples may be helpful. As a practicing Russian Orthodox Christian, I don't regard <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> as a holy city, rather as an abode of corruption. Neither do I regard <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergiev_Posad_edd2.html" title="Sergiev Posad">Sergiev Posad</a> as a holy city. Holy is the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troitse-Sergieva_Lavra_7098.html" title="Troitse-Sergieva Lavra">Troitse-Sergieva Lavra</a>, not a town that has grown nearby centuries later. The same applies to <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasna_G%C3%B3ra_ff1e.html" title="Jasna Góra">Jasna Góra</a>, which is a monastery, not a city. <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> is not a holy city either, because the East Slavic Christianity was born in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korsun.html" title="Korsun">Korsun</a>. And how do you call <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Athos_214d.html" title="Mount Athos">Mount Athos</a> a holy city if it is not a city at all? I'm not competent to review other religions, but I'm doubtful that <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samarkand.html" title="Samarkand">Samarkand</a> is a holy city for Muslims "because it was <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timur.html" title="Timur">Timur</a>'s capital".</p>
<p>I pointed out all these inaccuracies months ago and received no feedback as to why such unsourced list is useful for Wikipedia and its readers. In its current form, the list is simply unmaintainable. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 18:11, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> per nom. The problem starts with the lead: "This is a list of cities that various groups regard as holy. Cities may be either considered holy in themselves (as Vatican City for the Christian), important sites for worship or study (swamithoppe for Ayyavazhi), or the high seat of particular religions (Moscow for Russian Orthodox, Mecca for the Muslim)." I tried to add Jerusalem for Jews as a city holy in itself but was reverted. Basically, i doubt that Vatican City is holy in itself but it's exactly the high seat of particular religion.... and Mecca is not a high seat but IS a holy city in itself. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 18:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b>. No attempt made to create a criteria for inclusion- terms of ref extremely nebulous.

<li>The central administration of religous bodies e.g. the Vatican</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b>: Hello, gentlemen. I think I see the point of Ghirlandiao. I also saw the previous posts and there were indeed a lot of edit wars. I do think that some of the entries are more of pilgrimage sites than de facto holy cities. But I do have to point out that the definition I entered is the dictionary definition. Therefore we should work within that definition. The definition is broad such that "cities" may actually be cities enclosing sacred sites so there is a lot of freedom to work with as far as the standard definition is concerned. IMHO, to cite a few examples: the only "traditionally accepted and referred to" as holy cities are: for Judaism = Jerusalem; Christianity = Jerusalem, Rome; Islam = Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem; ancient Greek religion = Olympia (as the most significant but there are more to list for the ancient religions as they are more or less well-defined) - therefore the rest could be disregarded, esp. the Protestant list since Protestants themselves will probably balk at the list under Protestantism. We cannot overly be restrictive of the criteria, Shinto religion is one such example.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we should be careful to admit that the term "holy city" may not necessarily equate to the boundaries of the actual cities containing them. Case in point: Rome. The boundary of the "holy city" of Rome during the Republic did not enclose the entire course of the city of Rome. Not all of the seven hills of Rome were within the sacred precinct.</p>
<p>Let me conclude that although the list may not strictly follow the limits to everyones satisfaction, we could remove some entries in the list and put it under another topic: "List of pilgrimage sites" since the topic "Holy cities" is severely more limited in scope. But I still think the topic is of legitimate interest and historical importance (needs more of a trim than an expansion). <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_mindbender_0123.html" title="User:Dr mindbender">Dr mindbender</a> 22:22, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's inevitable that wikipedia will be reporting on opinions. The key in those circumstances is to cite who says that city X is a holy city for group Y. This article needs specific citations for specific claims. That means it needs work, not that it needs to be deleted. How many times have you turned on the news to see violence in a holy site for sect Y? This article has the potential to be a very encyclopedic, worthwhile addition if it can sort its informed cited opinions from editor opinions. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 22:41, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT: HELP OUT IN DEFINITION</b>. I added an invisible criterion in the definition. I don't know if you agree. I added that in the strictest sense, it should only be listed as a holy city if there are habitual references to it as a holy city. If this strict criterion is followed, the following examples would get in: Jerusalem, Rome, Mecca, Medina (as far as western religions are concerned). As per example of WJBscribe, Bethlehem, although of religious importance to Christians, have not been traditionally assigned the name "holy city" - so that's out of the picture. Same goes for Vatican - I haven't encountered it being referred to as a holy city; Holy City however is synonymous with Rome as is widely used by the media and generally accepted synonym. It becomes an important site of pilgrimage though, but not a holy city. Nazareth too, Geneva, Wittenberg. If atheists had a "holy city" (I'm laughing at the irony) it would undoubtably be Moscow - the communists would be pissing their pants though because of the contradiction, lol - throw in Pyongyang - what the hell. What do you guys think? Should we clean up the list and put the others in List of pilgrimage sites?

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Inherently POV and unmaintainable. In order to keep the list in any semblance of order one would have to define criteria for inclusion, which would amount to OR. Also, it would have to account for holy cities of all religions, which itself would get out of hand given the number or world religions. Particularly problematic is the shear number of cities that could be considered holy. As an example of this problem, Central Asia has long been home to a rather interesting form of Islam that blends in more mystical views and they have a huge number of important 'saints' whose graves are considered quite holy and can be found in a rather large number of towns across nations like <a href="../../../u/z/b/Uzbekistan.html" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>. This same problem applies in regions all across the world and across religions. I see no way to develop an objective, non-OR set of criteria that would allow for a fair, equitable, well-defined and maintainable list of holy cities. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:24, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you're a bit too pessimistic. Nevertheless, I have a feeling that, assuming this thing gets deleted, somebody will resurrect it back again, if not a Christian, most probably a Hindu or a student of ancient religions. The topic is inherently significant in its own right. Although a majority here might want it removed, its intrinsic value as a legitimate point of study, no matter how murky, will always get attention. The imprecision of the topic is inherent since it is a subject of the humanities and not the sciences. But just because you think the Mona Lisa is overrated doesn't mean it can't be discussed to death. Isn't this fun! LMAO. Hey, I disagree with some of the songs in MTV's Most Awesomely Bad Songs, but hey, it's what makes us human. We like to classify things and smack silly anybody who disagrees. ROFLMAO.

It is easy to verify the ones that are included, but it is obviously not possible to comprehensively verify what is not included. How were you proposing that a comprensive list could be made? The obvious way for WP is to have interested editors adding and checking, which is true of all WP lists that do not have a specific basis, such as List of kings of X. Since the weakest part seems the Christian portions, which is also the part I know something about, I will try to add a few.

<li><b>Keep</b>-Even though I see the valid points as to the lack of definition of "holy city", etc., I do see some significant usefulness in this page. Like all Wikipedia pages, it should be edited accordingly. The accepted definition of a holy city would be a place that served as a center of a faith group or as a place where a major event transpired. Rome is clearly a Christian Holy City for a variety of reasons. Akka in Israel is clearly a holy city for Baha'is. The list allows people to see a consolidated list of the world's religiously revered cities. Before we go about deleting this, I think we should insert that it is required that the reason for a holy city's listing be included. For example, "Shiraz, Iran--birthplace of the Bab."

<li><b>Keep</b> Ego depletion is a key concept in social psychology. It is is primarily discussed in relation to the topic of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-regulation.html" title="Self-regulation">self-regulation</a>. Ego depletion is relevant to the study of why people fail to achieve their goals, such as people who are dieters or who are trying to quit smoking. The cited articles are primary source material for this concept. R. Baumeister is one of the most prolific modern social psychological researchers. This concept is based on his work.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I strongly disagree with deletion. This is an article about someone who made their mark on the world before the age of the internet blossomed, so they are not going to have a ton of information out there about them. But if you google "I Was a Teenage Serial Killer" and "Sarah Jacobson" you get 120 results and if you google "Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore" and "Sarah Jacobson" you get 270 results. Are you telling me that every article on wikipedia that garners less activity than that should get deleted? Then half of wikipedia needs to get deleted. And just because you never heard of the film doesn't make it "virtually unknown".

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. Sarah Jacobson is definitely notable. Her first two film won awards and were extremely popular at film festivals throughout the U.S. and Canada. She is a low budget independent filmmaker who should be regarded in the same light as filmmakers such as <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivienne_Dick_259d.html" title="Vivienne Dick">Vivienne Dick</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Rice_83c6.html" title="Ron Rice">Ron Rice</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Kuchar_0dd1.html" title="George Kuchar">George Kuchar</a>, to name just a few extremely independent filmmakers working well outside of "the industry". Just like those filmmakers, she shouldn't be judged by her recognition in mainstream media but rather by the impact her films made, and will continue to make, within the communities she affected, such as the filmmaking community, in which she won several awards, the 'women's community', where her films were lauded, among others. Such is also the case when one considers her contribution to the film fanzine, <i><a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanie4Jackie_8a82.html" title="Joanie4Jackie">Joanie4Jackie</a></i>, which is of considerable importance to various women's artistic communities and would not have been as important without the contributions of directors such as Sarah Jacobson.-Intheshadows 10:04, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am not sure if the above is aimed at me or not (mine was not aimed at anyone but a comment on Wiki subcultures) - I did add a source to the page in the meantime. However I did think we were trying to build an encyclopedia not demolish one. If there are links to the page from other articles (which I verified), that seems sufficient.

She and her work are known internationally, not just in the U.S. She has without doubt received recognition in her specific field and her work has been championed by film critics such as <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> and Amy Taubin, filmmaker <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allison_Anders_3683.html" title="Allison Anders">Allison Anders</a> and musician <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Gordon_9970.html" title="Kim Gordon">Kim Gordon</a>, among many others. She has been written about by Wheeler Winston Dixon, one of the foremost authorities on "Underground" film, and cinema in general. Upon her death memorial screenings were held in cities across the U.S., including New York, San Francisco and Austin and even as far away as Switzerland. As we see, Sarah Jacobson meets the guidelines for inclsion in every way as they are outlined in "Guide for inclusion" on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> page. -Intheshadows 20:17, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have since looked at the project page and at a few of the articles; the better ones are quite detailed, and manage to squeeze some notability out of their subjects. I think the dangers are making lots of unsupported statements about why a mall failed, and also encouraging people to post articles about every failed mall they can find, regardless of how interesting or notable its story is. If people see an article on a failed mall, they will assume that every failed mall should have an article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 00:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The mall is not failed, but is weak and the accounts on white flight are very accurate in regards to southern DeKalb County and this mall. Every attempt was made to avoid racism, and the information here is common local knowledge. Only the date that mall opened is not certain. I have personally visited this mall on more than one occassion and can confirm the information. JCPenney did indeed leave the mall when the Mall at Stonecrest opened five years ago and sat vacant until very recently. The mall was never expanded, and was not updated since the 1970's until very recently when it was renamed this.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I have noticed throughout that it is Brianyoumans here leading the discussion to remove major regional malls from Wikipedia. These are not strip malls but significant regional centers that have had an impact on the state for a number of years. This was a four-anchor 26 year old mall that simply fell on hard times in recent years, and I have compiled the information from personal visits as well as different accounts online such as archives from the Atlanta Business Chronicle and advertisements. There are malls that are less significant on this site, and considering the nonsensical content often found on Wikipedia, I feel that there are a loud few that seem to have a vendetta on documenting major regional malls on this site. I did not personally post the pictures on the site, so the content is obviously significant to a number of people. I also feel that the users that want this mall deleted have a bias against older malls in largely African-American areas, because I do not see the delete requests posted for the newer and larger malls in the area.

<dd>If you feel the other malls are the same in notability, feel free to nominate them for deletion also. We don't let bots nominate for AFD (except the one that only completes partial nominations).

<li><b>Comment</b> Drinking games are very often created on the fly. Considering the fact that people search for drinking games when they don't know any I feel is reason enough to keep it. You may not be able to give it a bibliography entry, but you'd have to track down the originator to do that. I think it should stay on the grounds that games can't always be tracked. Find the originator for hide and seek, red-rover, or tag and then we'll talk. Laurie 20:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure about the "sources are independent of the subject itself" criterion.

<p>This seems to be a 'number' from a single episode of a not espcially notable (although rather good) television seires.

<p>Externally unverified neologism. Originally prodded, because I can't find any secondary sources for this term from a brief Google search of this word, although I find a domain name and an email address among the <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=Creatorragia&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=Creatorragia&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">8 unique/33 total hits</a>.</p>
<p>The prod was removed with the hidden comment that <i>"Although being a neologism, there is a movement that's growing and real. It shouldn't be a long time before the name becomes spread and therefore reffered to more often. It is not taken out of the blue, that is for sure. Therefore, please, there shouldn't be the need to delete it. Thank you for your consideration"</i>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I believe that <i>until</i> the term is talked about in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">externally verifiable</a>, third party fact-checked <a href="../../../r/d/_/WP%7ERD_c7a5.html" title="WP:RD">reliable sources</a>,the article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and should be deleted -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 22:55, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Deletion of this should not take place because Put the Rifle Down meets the notability standard as defined by Wikipedia at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28music%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28music%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28music%29</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Music notability criteria 1 states: "A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: 1. It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable."</p>
<p>Put the Rifle Down has been the subject of several non-trivial published works, in the form of newspaper articles from several reliable sources: <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chart_%28magazine%29.html" title="Chart (magazine)">Chart Magazine</a> (Canada's Nationally distributed music trade magazine), Celery Magazine, <a href="../../../n/o/w/NOW_Magazine_218b.html" title="NOW Magazine">NOW Magazine</a> (no online version of the section they were featured in, but article appeared in the August 18, 2005 issue), <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Varsity_%28newspaper%29_d584.html" title="The Varsity (newspaper)">The Varsity</a>, The Arthur, and <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavelength_%28club%29.html" title="Wavelength (club)">Wavelength</a>'s magazine.

<p><br />
I now understand the argument being posed. The Wikipedia article creation process is a sort of Catch-22 as in order to get anaclopen into the realm of usage it must be published in a noticeable place (read: Wikipedia), yet Wikipedia does not allow such neologisms. I suppose a solution is to publish the term anaclopen in a journal and reference myself?</p>
<p>On a side note, I used Google to find any instances of "anaclopen," "aclopen," or "anticlopen" without success. So certainly this word is unique by virtue of the fact that Google knows all.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to point out that a possible argument against anaclopen is to use the phrase "not clopen." If one is versed in basic logic, however, they will quickly note that "not clopen" is not logically equivalent to "anaclopen" since not clopen implies not closed OR not open whereas anaclopen implies not closed AND not open: a subtle but significant difference.</p>

Publishing the term in a journal is fine provided the journal itself is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, but because WP:NEO needs the usage to be widespread, that may not be enough.
