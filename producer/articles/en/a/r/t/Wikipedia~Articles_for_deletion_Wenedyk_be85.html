<dd>hi. i dont have any criteria and i dont see criteria proposed anywhere else. as i understand this, one person initiates a vote for an article and others simply vote delete or keep. because there is no criteria, i am asking the interested to think about such things. my question is: <i>What constraints are there for the inclusion of conlangs in an encyclopedia?</i>. a related question is: <i>Are all conlangs eligible in for inclusion?</i>.</dd>
<dd>so, my answer is a question. whatever answer there may be will a community-based answer. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 01:25, 2005 July 24 (UTC)

<dd>With all due respect, but you use two arguments in your VfD. First that the article is about a conlang (as if that proves its irrelevance), and secondly, that you believe it is not notable. And now you don't seem to have any idea about what could make a language notable. Personally I'd only issue a VfD when I am véry seriously convinced that there is no place for a lemma in the wiki, not merely because I have some hunch. But anyway, I do not think all conlangs are eligible for inclusion, and yes, I've voted "delete" at multiple occasions. I believe IALs can be judged by their success (number of actual users, now or in the past), while artlangs by the acclaim or appreciation they receive. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 18:40, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>the first sentence is not an argument, but an indication of the content of the article.</dd>
<dd>i believed then and i believe now that the article is not notable. i have a hunch and i seriously believe that this is so.</dd>
<dd>my idea of what is notable is primarily based on my expectations of the content of similar encyclopedic materal. if there was an article on Wenedyk in some similar encyclopedia-type book/media, i would feel that the editors were not making wise editorial decisions. – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 20:09, 2005 July 24 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Renata, I'm sorry - the "no harm" argument is cropping up again and again, but IMHO it's totally wrong. I suggest to redefine the criterion under which articles are kept or deleted, from "harm" to "use". In other words, rather than keeping everything unless it's explicitly proven to be harmful, let's simply delete everything that is of no apparent use. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 18:51, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Observation</b> Though it may not be the case here, my understanding is that when an edit count is noted in VFD, it's often as an implicit accusation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sockpuppetry</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 19:39, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I know, and this is the case in Spanish wikipedia where I am more active, a minimun of proven contributions is required in order to be elegible to vote (and the vote to be counted). This should rule out sockpuppetry or, as I see here, calling for votes outside regular wikipedia community. Personally I thing other criteria should be used... when I see these VdD I had 38 edits using my registred user in English wikipedia... however I would have near 50 with unregistered editions including a few before March (when I registered), and I am much more active in <a href="../../../../es/c/o/n/Especial%7EContributions_Chlewey_7c51.html" class="extiw" title="es:Especial:Contributions/Chlewey">w:es:</a>. It was anyhow too easy to get the 50 edits before I voted... and I do not mean idle edits but edits intended to improve Wikipedia. — <a href="../../../c/h/l/User%7EChlewey_faa9.html" title="User:Chlewey">Carlos Th</a> <a href="../../../c/h/l/User_talk%7EChlewey_4a64.html" title="User talk:Chlewey">(talk)</a> 22:02, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, let me clear this up. <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a> says that it is "sufficient" to mark the edits of very new users accordingly, <i>rather</i> than to accuse them of sockpuppetry, so that allegation is not being made. It is a common practise in VfD and other places so to mark new user's votes/comments; it just makes the closing admin's life a bit easier. However, I personally would not usually mark someone with 50 edits; I reserve that for a handful of edits with a clear agenda. Just because your vote may have been marked does not mean it will be discounted. That is for the closing admin to judge. Generally speaking however, if a new (or fairly new) user comes along to a VfD and clearly pushes an agenda, their vote will be discounted. I'm not making any judgement of whether that is happening here, just clarifying usual procedure. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Like I mentioned elsewhere, I am fully prepared to discuss the notability issue with you and with anybody else. Sorry for my reaction. I'm a bit tired of these discussions, since the same thing is currently going on in the German wiki. We've had it on the Dutch wikipedia too (for the record, it easily survived the VfD there).

<li><b>Comment</b>. Jan, as I said above, personally I think your idea is interesting and intellectually intriguing for anyone interested in Indoeuropean languages and history, I really admire the effort you put into this, and the last thing I want is to offend you. However, if you are honest with yourself, you will have to agree that this is essentially a private hobby of yours and very few others, with no relevance to the "real world". I assume that the number of people who learned about Wenedyk from Wikipedia in the first place (like me) is infinitely higher than the number of people who have heard about it somewhere else and then turn to Wikipedia to learn more. In the end, this just isn't what an encyclopedia is about, paper or no paper.

<li>I must disagree móst strongly in part: conlanging is not so much a "private hobby" as it is an artistic form. While poets take existing words from an existing language (usally) to create something of artistic beauty and even if no one understands what they mean by it; conlangers simply take of the foundational material of Language itself to create something of artistic beauty. Even if no one understands what they mean by it. As for "relevance to the real world", I can easily name two dozen artists who wasted their time on things that were not at all "relevant to the real world". We can start with JS Bach, work our way through Michaelangelo and end up near Zamfir. Art ìs irrelevant to the "real world" -- you can't eat it, can't sleep under it, it won't keep you warm in Winter (usually) and won't alleviate your arthritis. That doesn't mean art is without its own merit. That said, while I will later vote for the article's deletion, it should be noted that Wenedyk has as much relation to the "real world" as any other work of art. Elemtilas</li>
<li><b>Answer</b> - Thanks for your kind words, Thorsten, I take no offense whatsoever from what you wrote. And I understand your point, too. Even better, I agree with you that <i>we</i> (wikipedians) should not be absorbing the minutiae of fictional worlds or of any other works of art. For that purpose I maintain a website, which contains all there is to know about Wenedyk. But we are not talking minutiae here, we are talking about an encyclopedic (or perhaps rather, wikipedic) entry. And this entry should nót contain a descriptive grammar of any kind, only something along the line of: <i>Wenedyk is a language constructed by ... for purpose of ... with ... as its distinguishing characteristics ... and its significance is ...</i>. The same goes for Ill Bethisad: the details are in the IB wiki (with currently more than 1,200 articles), a number of websites and a mailing list; while the wikipedia entry consists of nothing but a short encyclopedic description of what IB is. From this point of view, I think the articles in question are far more justified than biographies of individual <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> characters and the like. But if lemmata on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a> are acceptable, I don't see why a lemma on <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> wouldn't be.</li>
<li>Furthermore, I'd like to note that I have learnt about a lot of things through Wikipedia, things I'd never have known about without it. That's what I like about Wikipedia in the first place. But FWIW: most reactions I got about Wenedyk were not from people who knew it through Wikipedia, but from people who had read an article about it in a Polish magazine.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia is not about the non-fictional universe; it's about the human universe, including things like <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botchan.html" title="Botchan">Botchan</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, mainly to Jan and Splash. - <i>"it's about the human universe, including things like <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botchan.html" title="Botchan">Botchan</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>"</i>. Nobody disputed that the world of fiction has a place in Wikipedia. Fiction is a part of the human world. But that does not make <i>any</i> peace of fiction eligible for its own article. To use your examples, according to the article <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botchan.html" title="Botchan">Botchan</a> is <i>"one of the most popular novels in Japan"</i> which <i>"[m]ost Japanese read [...] during their childhood"</i>; and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> <i>"became one of the most popular and well-known comic book icons of all time.</i>". I do not think quite the same can be said about "Ill Bethisad".</dd>
<dd><i>"From this point of view, I think the articles in question are far more justified than biographies of individual <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> characters and the like."</i> I couldn't possibly agree more; but two wrongs don't make a right, and one can only deal with deletion candidates one at a time. Also, it would be very difficult to convince trekkies that they should learn to live without an article on the x-language spoken by the y-species in the z-galaxy - although its "existence" may have been brought to the attention of millions of square-eyed couch potatoes - when at the same time we decide to keep hobbyhorses like these.</dd>
<dd><i>"if lemmata on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a> are acceptable, I don't see why a lemma on <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a>"</i>. Frankly, if I had the choice between watching an episode of Star Trek or Babylon 5, or reading a spin-off book, and reading a book about or watching an episode of <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> (in that universe's languages with subtitles...) I would almost <i>definitely</i> go for the latter. The fact remains, though, I simply do not have that choice. And since you mention it, the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> article is already borderline for me. The best case that can be made for is that it's one example of the intellectual standard an internet-based counter-culture to mainstream entertainment can achieve, so I'd vote a weak keep. If so, the article should naturally give due mention to Wenedyk and the other languages contained within the universe. But to outhouse its countries, their languages etc. - that is what I meant by "minutiae" - to separate articles is definitely over the top for me. By the way, in spite of what you said about the division of labour between Wikipedia and the IB Wiki, the fact is that <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenedyk.html" title="Wenedyk">Wenedyk</a> contains way more (although not the same) information than <a href="http://ib.frath.net/w/Wenedyk" class="external text" title="http://ib.frath.net/w/Wenedyk" rel="nofollow">Wenedyk</a> does.</dd>
<dd>On a final note, it is hardly surprising that the idea of Wenedyk appeals more to Polish speakers with a knowledge of Romance languages (or vice versa) than to others; but this does not really disprove my point. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 11:12, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If, um, "millions of square-eyed couch potatoes" are aware of it, I don't see any reason not to have an article on it. We have articles on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee%2C_Oklahoma_a95c.html" title="Cherokee, Oklahoma">Cherokee, Oklahoma</a>; I fail to see why something of cultural significance to millions of anyone, no matter how much contempt some people have for them, would be unimportant. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 21:43, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. As a conlanger, and much as I would like to make public the art of conlanging to the greatest extent possible, I really don't see the need for grammatical treatises and descriptions of individual conlangs here on the Wikipedia.</s> There is already a good Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>, which should serve as a central locus for this particular art form and has already got a quite a long list of conlangs there. I think it vèry meet and right for conlangers to link to their own pages or to some other conlang oriented source, if they wish to do so. I wouldn't create a Wikipedia article for any of my conlangs, even though at least one of them ìs "notable" per these <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_Conlang_0956.html" title="User:Almafeta/Conlang">criteria</a>, and if I found one, I'ld delete it for the reasons stated. Elemtilas</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> -- having found and read the deletion policies, I have to reconsider my opinion. I still don't think most conlangs warrant individual articles, but they are works of art and as such should not necessarily be removed simply because some people don't get the artform or can't think of anything better than personal attacks against the artists that create languages. Anyone who wants to create such an article on a conlang should be responsible enough to really consider whether this piece of artwork warrants an individual and unique article of its own. If possible, this article should be merged with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_languages.html" title="Constructed languages">Constructed languages</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_languages.html" title="Artistic languages">Artistic languages</a> or <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It would be a harm to Wikipedia were there no article on a subject a reader might look up, and none is done if there is.
