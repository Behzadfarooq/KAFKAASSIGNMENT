<li>You may like to re-read the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>. Notability is something to be established on AfD; simply failing WP:MUSIC is not a reason for speedying. The article says that he's released an EP, and we have an article on that very EP. I can't just go about speedy deleting any article that you think is non-notable; what if we're wrong? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 02:53, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes indeed, fair enough but I know the criteria as well as anyone and the point of AfD is to give opinions based on interpretation of said critera and nominated articles... Having read the articles it is IMO obvious that this is vanity by someone whose music catalogue is theoretical to say the least. I accept there are two articles here, the second of which might not technically be eligible for speedy but contains the words "recorded in his bedroom". I'm not an admin so I don't make final decisions and if my opinions are considered outwith WP guidelines then by all means ignore them... <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 03:08, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey people, if you feel it is non-notable and all your other wiki-lingo terms to say it should be there, feel free to delete it. I may have misunderstood the 'free space' idea behind wikipedia, I have my myspace to promote from. I wasn't in wikipedia for promotion at all, I thought I could just do it. I'm amazed you're all so tight arse, for want of a better term, about it, just delete it. And don't call me a 'spod', whatever it is, name-calling is neither big nor clever. And my music is not experimental, if you look at the influences there is no mention of Pink Floyd, or drug-induced melodies, it is simple acoustic rock/emo. Also, with regards to 'bedroom recordings', you'll notice that Jonah Matranga, Willy Mason, Blink-182 and Foo Fighters have all released records that have been recorded, at least partly, in bedrooms. You people jump to A LOT of conclusions, I mean, aren't you a bunch of geeks that spend all day on the internet, you'd have noticed my ISP or whatever its called is different to that of a 'Christopher Marshall Mason' (Ha, he has the same middle name as Jimi Hendrix, we'll have to meet up for a drink)</li>
<li>Yep It has to be said he has a point, at least he's in some way talented eh?</li>

<li>Simon, respect for your response there which is fair comment. The AfD arena can be a nasty place and once an article ends up here it's open season. The trouble is, it largely comes down to one word - notability. If an article is clearly unnotable (think about what is found in a paper encyclopedia and read the WP guidelines) then there's not a lot that can be done to save it and and when unsigned comments appear saying "Oh, I've heard of him" it looks crap. I apologize for calling you a spod / experimental, the sentiment was directed towards "Christopher" or whoever wrote the unsigned comment. Signing your own comments would also help, we don't all go around detecting IP addresses for fun. I still think that putting "recorded in his bedroom" looked a bit crap on the EP article... Good luck with the music, I look forward to seeing you here in the future - having your vanity article deleted is a right of passage for many WP users (yup, me included) but in the meantime why not stick around and contribute to some pages featuring music and artists you care about. If you're serious about spreading the word I'd be genuinely interested to hear some of your stuff, if you have any mp3's then get in touch via my talk page. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 13:40, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To be honest Deiz I thought writing my entire name was signing it enough SIGNED CHRIS MASON!!!!</li>

<ul>
<li>This is possibly just inexperience with Wikipedia then, to sign your name (or IP if you aren't logged in) and the time then hit 4 tildes or in other words ~ ~ ~ ~ with no gaps. That's a WP signature and when dealing with sockpuppets (as you may imagine, this happens a lot with deletion debates, the creator of the article saying "I've heard of him" while claiming to be someone else) opinions signed by WP editors with a track record of edits are taken seriously, unsigned comments or comments by users with very shallow edit histories are not treated with the same respect. But anyway Chris, by now I'm sure you've perused Wikipedia's guidelines about signatures, notability of musicians and lots more besides. ++<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 19:09, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
