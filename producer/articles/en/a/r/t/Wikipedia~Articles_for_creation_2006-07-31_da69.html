<p>"Mr. Softy's Balloon Race" is a very unknown song written by the Gorillaz. It is not on any album and "extremley difficult to access" as many people have said before in chat boards. Not much is known about the song except the lyrics. They are as follows: Walking through here Never one will appear Where do we go from here? Where do we go? If the last one isn't there And it's all gone If the last one wasn't there It all be wrong</p>
<p>Sometimes you turn around Sometimes you're lost and bound Where do we bother saying When we go</p>
<p>If the last one isn't there And it's all gone If the last one wasn't there It all be wrong.</p>

Florida State Road 55 is the unsigned name of US 19 which runs from Memphis,Fl (the southern termini) at US 41 to the Florida-Georgia border.</p>
<p>US 19 remains independent of I-75, even as the routes converge on Tampa and St. Petersburg, Florida. The route is co-signed with US 27 between Capps and Perry, Alternate U.S. 27 between Perry and Chiefland, US 98 between Perry and Chassahowitzka, and Interstate 275 over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge over the mouth of Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>An "Alt 19" exists in Florida, beginning at the intersection of US 19 in Holiday, Pasco County, Florida, it runs for 34.6 miles west of US 19 near the Gulf coast ending at the intersection of US 19 and 9th Avenue North in St. Petersburg, Florida. It used to continue east of this along 9th Avenue North, to the intersection with US 92. The planned St. Petersburg-Clearwater Expressway, or Pinellas Beltway, would have followed the current alignment of "Alt 19" from I-275 to Clearwater, Florida. The intersection of Seminole Boulevard and Bay Pines Boulevard is a remenant of this proposed road. The beltway road was proposed in 1974, but dead by 1980.</p>
<p>Currently, US 19 between Clearwater(State Road 580) and Pinellas Park(Pinellas County Road 611) is getting a freeway-style upgrade, due to the cancellation of an extension on Interstate 375 in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Statistically US 19 is the most dangerous road in the United States. A Florida Highway Patrol test period beginning in 1998 and ending in 2003, as mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, showed the strech of US 19 from Pasco County to Pinellas County to average approximately 52 deaths a year, or 262 deaths in the 5 year duration of the study. 100 of these deaths were pedestrian related making US 19 the #1 worst road to walk on in these two counties.</p>

<p>LHA offers an experience unlike any other at GSR. Campers, aged 13 to 60+ get to hike around the reservation to various outposts. The outposts cover a variety of activities, such as rock climbing, kayaking, and mountain biking, as well as historically themed (interpretive) outposts such as Civil War, Mountain Man, and Lumberjack. On Trail, crews have the opportunity to earn various awards. Our main draw is the Trailblazer, which involves a crew hiking a minimum of 20 miles and two of the five peaks. We also offerthe Wilderness award, which is a step up from the Trailblazer. It requires crews to practice die-hard Leave No Trace camping and to only visit one other camp while on trail. Crews must also talk to first year campers about High Adventure and backpacking.</p>

<p>Sir Ostein MacOrferr was a Scottish Knight of the Haggis Table. He lived in Constantinople (now Istanbul), made and played bagpipes, and was known in Germany as a Constantinopolitanischerdoodlesachsfeiffenmachergesellschaft, simply meaning “bagpipe-maker of Constantinople”. A depiction shows him looking like any other bagpipe player. However, underneath his looks he was the worst bagpipe player in the world, receiving his knighthood as one of the bagpipe players who scared off the French at the Battle of No Jocks.</p>

<p>Bang Em Smurf is a rap artist. He is a queens native, which ended him up with hip hop artist 50 Cent. Smurf joined the now world reknowned "G-Unit" group, being one of the original members alongside 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks and Sha Money XL. Unfortunately, there were problems within the group and Smurf had to leave the Unit. Since then there was a beef between Smurf and 50 causing diss tracks back and forth and disrespectful coments. Smurf now has a record label entitled GF Records. He states that 50 Cent allegedly came to a video shoot and threatened Smurf, and to date there has been an ongoing dispute.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection is a three disc DVD set covering some of Ric Flair's greatest matches and promos. It was released in November 2003 and was one of the fastest selling DVDS in WWE history.</p>

<p>A chapter starts with Ric Flair talking about an opponent and a notable match then follows. This was the first WWE DVD to feature matches as part of a feature as opposed to standard extras. Extras include promos and segments leading up to and in some cases after each match. Some promos and segments stand by themselves with nothing to do with a match on the DVD. For example, in one promo, the Four Horseman talk about the Road Warriors. Another extra is from WWE Confidental dealing with Flair's plane crash in 1975.</p>

History: As the dust settles on a new century and the tomstones rise on the Sydney rockabilly scene. Comes a group of misguided gravediggers with nothing better to do but but start a funeral parlour combo. Children of the Cramps and misunderstood victims of the Karaoke generation, ZOMBIE GHOST TRAIN play live music for the un-dead. Starting out in March 1802 it hasn´t taken long for these three sinners to find a home in the world´s music jungle. A sonic junkyard, blending psychobilly, garage punk, Egyptian folk tunes and voodoo rhythms. Featuring Stu Arkoff on Guitar and Vocals, Captain Reckless on Slap Bass/screams and Azzy T on Drums and Percussion.</p>
<p>Live Shows: Zombie Ghost Train´s live shows are a stand out. Attracting audiences that like their music original and exciting. ZGT's heads are firmly in roots music, they break down genres with their entertaining live shows combining their love of monster movies with their love of 50s trash culture imagine The Misfits meet Eddie Cochran.</p>
<p>Influences: ZGT create a wild world of b-grade horror and sci-fi/monster madness on stage with a penchant for theatrical makeup fresh from the morgue and choreographed rock moves that would put 80s hair bands to shame.</p>
<p>Releases: A now rare EP "Monster Formal Wear", a debut album "Glad Rags &amp; Body Bags" and are currently in pre-production for a new album.</p>
<p>Tours: USA in 2005 in a series of live shows that gained them many new fans that call themselves "ZGT Deadcats". With tours of Australia, USA, and Europe booked for 2006/2007 make sure to exhume Zombie Ghost Train before they die (again).</p>
<p>The Bone Daddies: ZGT have been known to play low-key secret shows as "The Bone Daddies", in these gigs the band play only rockabilly covers and its said they ditch the make-up and ZGT theatrix. These shows are rare.</p>

<p>Harrisville, Mississippi (zip code 39082; area code 601)is a small town located south of Florence, which is about 25 miles from Jackson. It sits mainly on Highway 469 and connects to D'lo and Pinola. The two main churches are the Harrisville United Methodist Church and the Harrisville United Baptist Church. Not having many places of attraction, the population is surprisingly large. Although the town may seem like a loosely set town with houses far apart and many dirt roads and side roads, the community is close nit and is a cherished part of this town. Some businesses in Harrisville are the Jennings Service Station, the only gas station, and the Bridge's Fish House, recently opened after being remodeled from a grocery store to a restaurant. There is one Fire Department in the town, and a baseball field which holds regular games. The once locally famous grocery stores such as one once run Richard Sebren are an interesting spectacle for those interested in seeing what towns in Mississippi once were.</p>

<p>Muscle spit, A muscle spit is a form of spitting that uses only muscle force and not air force. The way this happens is that a certain movement of the tounge forces the saliva gland to force out a spray. The spray in question is ussaly a line of droplets. The force of the spit can vary due to hydration factors.</p>

<p>Stoopid Ugly Stik is a Post Hardcore/Metal band, also referred to as nintendocore due to the lyrical content describing games like Chrono Trigger, Contra III the Alien Wars, Splatterhouse etc, and also the extremely dominant synth and keyboard lines contained in the music. The band was formed in late 2004 with only SX and former guitarist StapleZ as the lineup. They both wrote guitar and SX played all the necessary keyboard and did all of the drum programming. StapleZ left the band around March 2005 and guitarist Kenneth Smith (aka 7734) was picked up as well as Lolly as a bassist. A couple of shows were played here and there and SX and 7734 started writing the debut "Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right A B Start". The dedication level was low al al parts for a while and then Lolly also left the band but stayed on as a tech and photographer while SX and 7734 continued to play shows alone. The debut CD dropped December 25th 2005 as a free download online to anyone (you can get it at either one of the links in the sources section). Tony Archiga was picked up soon after he heard the CD as the new bassist and the three have been playing since then, they are currently writing a new and much more progressive CD called "The Key to Unpause".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-31_da69.html" title="Edit section: Profile of Luton Town Football Club Goalkeeper Zac Barrett">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Profile of Luton Town Football Club Goalkeeper Zac Barrett</span></h2>
<p>A young goalkeeper hailing from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, Zac Barrett joined Luton Town as an 11-year-old after being spotted playing for Letchworth Garden City by a scout from the East Anglia Representative side.</p>
<p>Progressing through the club's youth ranks, Barrett made his debut for the U-19 side at the age of just 14 against Peterborough United in February 2003 - making him the Hatters' youngest-ever U-19 representative. He went on to play for the U-17, U-18 and Reserve sides before the age of 18.</p>
<p>His progress was rewarded by manager Mike Newell with a debut senior appearance in a pre-season friendly victory at St. Albans City in July 2004. In October 2004, he was handed the squad number 35 and named in the first-team squad for a 3-0 home win over Hartlepool United.</p>
<p>In November 2004, he amazingly scored from a long goal kick in an 8-0 FA Youth Cup win over Whitstable Town at Kenilworth Road. In 2005, he captained the Youth Team at Upton Park against West Ham United in the FA Youth Cup and in February 2006, he was the only final year scholar to be offered a professional contract.</p>
<p>Signing a three-year professional contract on June 29th 2006, Luton Town player/goalkeeper coach Marlon Beresford said, "I'm really pleased for Zac. He's worked hard and it's good news for him, particularly with so many of the young lads leaving. It's a shame we couldn't keep more on, but that's the manager's decision at the end of the day.</p>
<p>"Zac's got great potential, which is obviously why he's been taken on, and hopefully he'll go on to fulfil that."</p>
<p>Further pre-season appearances followed at St. Albans City and Swedish side Näsets SK in July 2006 and, at the age of 18, he goes into the 2006-07 season as third-choice goalkeeper for Luton Town following the departures of Robert Beckwith and Dino Seremet and wearing the number 34 shirt.</p>

<p><i>Daffy Bunny</i> is an animated cartoon series which made its debut on April 2, 1934, featuring an ugly rabbit who had the habit of knocking himself with a hammer every other minute. He was soon joined by other animals to knock down, some of whom actually became his friends. It became one of Hollywod's longest-running cartoon series. In the 1980s, the character switched to television, where he remains until this day with amazing ratings. Daffy Bunny has a tendency to make audiences mad, but in a likable way. Four live-action movies have been made, but all with different actors, as none of the cast members survived more than one film.</p>

<p>Just like his contemporaries Little John and Little Harry, Billy Boyo was still in his teens when he emerged in the early eighties. At that time a new era in Jamaican music had begun as roots reggae had become dancehall. Then one of the most prolific and influential producers in dancehall music was the late Henry "Junjo" Lawes. He more or less launched dancehall as a fully developed musical style and records on his "Arrival" and "Volcano" labels dominated the dancehall market for years.</p>
<p>With the powerful Roots Radics Band and the innovative young engineer Hopeton "Overton" Brown aka Scientist working on the majority of his releases, "Junjo" Lawes began voicing a dazzling array of talent including Michael Prophet, Barry Brown, Frankie Paul, Wailing Souls and Johnny Osbourne. Quick to spot new talent he also employed rather unknown names like for example a young boy who called himself Billy Boyo. In 1982 "Junjo" Lawes recorded this talented youthman deejay together with Little Harry for a two artist "clash" album entitled "DJ Clash Volume 2", released by Greensleeves Records. Billy Boyo also became part of Junjo's famous Volcano sound system and performed alongside Burro Banton, Little John, Toyan, Josey Wales, Lee Van Cleef, Yellowman and others.</p>
<p>In 1983 Billy Boyo (together with Little John and Ranking Toyan) went to London where he linked up with producer Silver Kamel. The latter took him into the studio and recorded tracks for Boyo's second album. Due to various reasons the project got put on hold and it took almost twenty years before the album, "Zim Zim", was unleashed. Silver Kamel recalls... "What I liked most about Billy Boyo was his easy style and infectious ear-to-ear grin that would break out just about anytime. In the studio he was all-pro. He knew how to work the mike, what he wanted as a sound, and was prepared to experiment. Ridin riddim and stabbin toasts at the drum and bass... all the sessions were fast and fun-packed."</p>
<p>All in all Billy Boyo wasn't a prolific recording artist as he did not record much before or after the tracks for the aforementioned two albums. His musical career was short-lived and little was heard of Billy Boyo since the second half of the eighties. Although many rumors state that he had been shot, he actually died of a brain tumor in 2000.</p>

<p>One of the most famous bands in Cairo. They perform live in Sakiat el Sawy, After eight... Their songs are really interesting.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-31_da69.html" title="Edit section: Sources">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sources</span></h3>
<p>In 1999, two guys got together, formed a band, joined by 6 others, and started the dream. That’s the basic story behind the Wust El Balad band.</p>
<p>Eight talented guys from all across the country joined together in Downtown, i.e. Wust El Balad, Cairo, forming one of the most successful bands in Egypt now. Being from different musical backgrounds, each guy brought his own flavor to the group.</p>
<p>Their story is as compelling as the music itself.</p>
<p>Their first appearance as Wust El Balad was at Al Mashrabeya Gallery, followed by their first paid performance at the Berlitz Language Center. Ever since that moment, Wust El Balad was a regular performer at all galleries, cultural centers, bars, special events and hotels, and even abroad.</p>
<p>Their vision then was to reach the average person that can't afford hearing them in bars or galleries. And so they were the first band to play in the Egyptian street, experiencing one of the most amazing concerts, playing in Al Alfi Street to the local community during the French festival "Les Francais aiment l'Egypte".</p>
<p>Wust El Balad, an amazing blend of sounds, combining traditional Arabic music with a modern and western twist, is successful in making their music as accessible as possible, not just in Cairo, but beyond. Wust El Balad means real world music in the best sense of the word.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
Adham El Saeid, Born on April 6, 1969
</pre>
<p>Inspired by his grandmother's renditions of songs from the villages in Upper Egypt, and his uncle who engaged him in the country's oral traditions, Adham brings the traditional oriental sense to the group, counterbalancing the dominant western influence. History department graduate, Adham El Saeid knows how to sing a good “Mawal” that attracts all Wust El Balad Audience, Foreigners before Egyptians</p>
<pre>
Hany Adel, Born on September 20, 1977
</pre>
<p>The "attractive one" as called in many occasions. It was Omran's and his idea to put together the group of Wust El Balad. Beside composing some of the songs, Hany is a whole show himself, his great presence combined with his lively guitar playing, and his energetic, sensitive voice brings the band to its maximum energy level.</p>
<pre>
Ahmed Omran, Born on November 15, 1977
</pre>
<p>The Not-Always-Present member of Wust El Balad. Though being one of the two founders of the Group, Omran is not always available at all concerts, but when he is, you will listen to one of the best Oud players around. Omran is the only member in the band who has a formal musical background. Playing Oud and Flute, sometimes composing some of the songs, Omran completes the Wust el Balad image.</p>
<pre>
Mohammed Gamal Al Din, Born on February 10, 1982
</pre>
<p>Kids, who grow up in families of musicians, always end up wanting to be musicians themselves, that's the case with Mohammed as he is the grandson of a very famous composer. As one of the most important percussion players in Cairo, Mizo always lightens up the stage with his conversational-like performance with Bob.</p>
<pre>
Ismail Fawzy, Born on April 8, 1978 
</pre>
<p>Off all the musicians in the band, the most interesting and intriguing is Ismail. Though the band is a group of extraordinary musicians, But Ismail's talent and attitude added a joyful taste. Always smiling, totally energetic, Ismail brings a lot of energy and strength to the band. He is a computer science graduate, who composes some of the songs for the band. Ismail pays great attention to the lyrics, his favorite song, Magnoun, is a pure evidence of a singer who believes in what he sings.</p>
<pre>
Asaad Nessim, Born on November 20, 1966
</pre>
<p>Watching and listening how he masters the guitar, one would think that he started playing a long long time ago. In fact, Asaad first played the Piano for over 6 years, before figuring out that Spanish guitar is his main destiny.And it can be said, that he is now one of the best Spanish guitar players all over Egypt. Extremely calm, very sensitive andconcentrated, playing with a very difficult technique, Asaad knows how to get the attention while playing one of his brilliant Solos whithin his role as the lead guitarist of Wust el Balad.</p>
<pre>
Ehab Abdel Hameed, Born on November 6, 1976
</pre>
<p>Ehab or Bob began his real career with the Wust el Balad band, after many rehearsals with Modo, the Senegalese singer, and Ismail Fawzy. Still a law student, but yet to be considered one of the most wanted percussion players in Egypt, Bob is one of the first who played with "Cajun", the famous Spanish instrument. No one can ever mistake the enthusiasm in which Bob always performs. Bob and Mizo are the most famous Percussion Duo in Egypt</p>
<pre>
Ahmed Omar, Born on September 28, 1977
</pre>
<p>Born in Egypt to an Eriterian father, certainly affected his sense of music. Omar joined the music scene more than 4 years ago, starting with singing, playing guitar and then moving to his current instrument, bass guitar. Omar, believing that music is the most important issue in life, resigned from his former job as a teacher in german. His "Eritrean" melody reflects a true sense of imagination and creativity</p>

<p>Andreas Huebner is an Evangelist and Tele-Evangelist who has reached millions of people with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, especially in Third World Nations, such as Pakistan, India, Indonesia, many nations of Africa and even Cuba, where he has held an evangelistic conference in 2001. Tens of thousands are flooding to his crusades. He is the founder and president of the international missionary work "Jesus To The World Mission". He has personally met and prayed for numerous political leaders and diplomats from many nations of the world, especially Africa. He is frequently visiting the United States and Canada. Andreas Huebner is traveling around the world conducting "Mass Miracle Crusades". He is also holding faith conferences to encourage the believers to reach the world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Especially Andreas Huebner's crusades in the Third World are accompanied by supernatural "miracles", including the healing of the blind, crippled and those impaired of hearing. Many of his crusades in Africa were broadcast on national television. Andreas Huebner claims that God fulfills the promises of the Bible if people confess them with their mouth and believe them with their heart. He proclaims that by his death and resurrection, Jesus Christ has made healing possible for all those who believe. Although his teachings often sound like those of famous Word of Faith teachers like Kenneth E. Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Frederick K.C. Price, Creflo Dollar and others, Andreas Huebner is conducting his crusades in co-operation with churches from all biblical denominations. Many people compare his style of preaching to that of german evangelist Reinhard Bonnke.</p>
<p>On His website, Andreas Huebner encourages his visitors to send him their prayer requests, but he also states: "Do not stop taking medicine or undergoing treatment before your physical healing has been verified by a medical doctor."</p>
<p>Quotes by Evangelist Andreas Huebner:</p>
<p>"There are no religious denominations in heaven. God is not interested in the name of your church, but rather if we have received Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and follow him with all our heart!"</p>
<p>"I refuse to think in low dimensions. I refuse to pray in religious modesty. God does not call this kind of prayer 'humble' but rather 'of little faith'."</p>
<p>"If I do not expect anything from God, I will not be disappointed – but I will not be blessed either."</p>

<p>Thomas Richard Sales was born on November 4th 1986, in Quesnel B.C. Born as the middle child with two older brothers, one younger and a baby sister. With a big family it was hard to be noticed, and even harder to be appreciated. Thomas also referred to as TRS by his close friends attended Lakeview Elementary School. The Lakeview boys referred to themselves as ILP or Insane Lakeview Posse, this was co-founded by Tommy and his friend Daniel David Hunt. After years of ruling the small school, it was time for junior school, grade 8-10 which was attended at Maple Drive Junior Secondary. This is where Tommy really started his growing up. After three awkward years of first hairs, dates, kisses and other irrelevant matter it was time to go to actual highschool for the last two years. This is when Quesnel Senior Secondary or Q.S.S. comes in. Tommy started there and really enjoyed it, there was lots of new people and he was feeling more like a grown up everyday. This is where he met his girlfriend of about 2 years, Alexandra Kimberly Green. Alex was a nice girl whom Tommy enjoyed but his growing up was never complete yet. He was not the best boyfriend and would begin to regret it in the future. After graduating in 2004 moving to Prince George, and breaking up with his girlfriend, he became overwhelmed with sadness. Tommy was growing up so fast and didn't know what he wanted to do with his life yet. After a year of boring business school Tommy decided that wasnt the way to go. He decided that he was probly in the top 1% of cool people and gifted people in the world. So why not work with that, right now he is in Kelowna writing a story about how you can be stress free. Not by having a huge ego, but by having confidence, and how far that confidence can take you. Maybe some people will get mad, mostly annoying girls that you wont have anything to do with because you cant stand how people can be so dumb. Outsmarting people and having the confidence to do so and not care, and a good way to become succesful, and stress free. As Tommy is becoming after watching and studying many different people when different events effected them. So this is the start of the Tommy Sales saga right now, but there will be much more to come, and people will remember this name. TRS...</p>

Zuckerbaby was born in the mid-nineties, a pop band in the true sense of the word, out of a city and a music scene dominated by country &amp; western and punk-rock. In the wrong place at the right time the Calgary, Canada based band quickly became one of that citys most popular live acts. The group was probably best described as, a rock band that plays pop songs. A guitar driven four-piece not afraid of melody, Zuckerbaby began to turn heads outside of their home turf. After playing Vancouvers Music West Conference in early 1996, the band found itself being courted by several U.S. and Canadian labels. By years end, Zuckerbaby had inked a deal with Mercury/Polygram and plans were made to record their self-titled debut album. The record came out in May 1997 and spawned three singles, Andromeda, Heavy, and Shampoo. All three tracks were received favourably at Rock Radio across the country. Andromeda peaked on the Much Music Countdown at number thirteen. Each one of these songs showed a different side of Zuckerbaby, always proud to wear their influences on their sleeve. The album was recorded and produced in Calgary by guitarist/songwriter Reed Shimozawa and Krisjan Leslie and mixed in Vancouver and Los Angeles. Five tracks were mixed by Jack Joseph Puig (Jellyfish, The Black Crowes, Weezer). Along with the accompanying videos, the boys hit the road hard in support of the album that Canadian industry magazine, The Record proclaimed to be the best pop debut of the decade. The late nineties proved to be a stormy time for anyone in the music industry. Company mergers, mass firings, bands dropped from rosters. Zuckerbaby would steer themselves through all of those things and much more to release their second major label effort, Platinum Again in the Fall of 2000. Two singles were released from that album, Overexposure and Holiday. Platinum Again was recorded in Vancouver with Reed and John Maclean (Limblifter) producing and mixing. The band once again toured hard in support of the record, playing small venues on their own and as well as touring with well established, chart topping groups like Collective Soul. In addition to national airplay and videoplay, Zuckerbaby began to place songs other arenas like television and soundtracks. After a lengthy break, Zuckerbaby have found themselves, against all odds, ready to release a new album. The core of the band remains unchanged. The commitment to melody is still the focus. The ability to write and record different songs from distant influences and somehow keep the plot going is still what makes this band an undeniable pleasure for anyone who takes their music seriously or just who simply love to sing along in the shower or the car.</p>

<p>Artisian is a London based mid to fast paced Black Metal project. Originally set up in June '04 by Iain Miro. Two new band members, Ash (Bass) and Franco (Drums) joined at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Steve Banks of Meggido is responsible for all recording, engineering and mastering.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this project was drawn from a deep misanthropy, crushing sorrow, severe depression, emotional and physical pain and frustration resulting from dealing with the average person.</p>
<p>Utter disgust and hatred for modern society and government, the flawed infrastructure in which it rests, a rejection of the politically correct hypocrites that turn a blind eye to Nazi style mob censorship and the wailing ignorance of minority groups that claim to be a majority and cry discrimination when they don't get what they want.</p>
<p>Modern society has produced a yearning for; self sufficiency and solitude, the collapse of all organised religions and a return to paganism. We came into this world alone, we will leave alone.</p>
<p>We are here to survive, sink or swim. People can have a prejudice purely because another draws breathe</p>
<p>...............This is my response.............This is my outlet..............</p>
<p>Influenced by a very cold and harsh sound, this of course, is my own interpretation of the genre but staying within the traditional parameters of stylisation and minimalism</p>
<p>The Debut album was released on Halloween '05 on limited release with Grindethic records (www.grindethic.co.uk) with subsequent signing to Copro records on full worldwide 2006 release of 'Lament for the Eternal Frost'.</p>
<p>Artisian have already started recording the follow up release 'the beast out of the earth' which is due out in October 2006.</p>

<p>Lyrics to <b>Where is She?</b></p>
<p>A police car, was outside your house today I havent seen you, in a couple of days They knocked on your door, and then they went away Your mother looked scared, but she didnt cry She didnt cry</p>
<p>On one hand, I've got myself to blame But on the other, it's always the same Follow suit shake your head, tell me that its a lie I don't want you for dead, but I want you to die Without a good friend, on a sunshine I know I want survival, but you dont why</p>
<p>Where is she? Where is she? Where is my baby girl Oh I've seen you, your crazy What have you done with my whole wide, world?</p>

<p>Storno was a Danish company, founded in 1946, for the manufacture of 2 way radio equipment. By the 1970's Storno was name synonomous throughout Europe for the mobile communications equipment used by Police, Fire and Ambulance services. Storno was also the chosen supplier for two way radio equipment used by the gas, water and electricity utilities. Although Storno was bought by their American competitor Motorola in 1986 and the Storno name dropped soon afterwards, their name still lives on with many Storno radio schemes still existing in 2006.</p>

<p>Cowboy Dog Nigel Cox To be published by Victoria University Press</p>
<p>Forthcoming - due November 2006 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0 86473 544 8</a> paperback 204pp, 210mm x 138mm rrp NZ$29.95</p>
<p>"When I was eighteen I came into my anger. It had been buried deep, along with my gunbelt, my spurs and my coiled whip. Now I climbed the mountainside, dug, and there it was, as red-eyed as a Gila Monster. It got its teeth into me. I buckled the guns onto my hips and stood with my face to the gritty wind."</p>
<p>Chester Farlowe was twelve when the coward Stronson shot his daddy down. Chester left the vast cattle ranches of New Zealand’s central Volcanic Plateau for the badlands of urban Auckland. There he was given shelter by Henry Stroud, proprietor of the I Fry takeaway wagon, and re-christened Mr Dog. There, too, he met the girl, Spoons.</p>
<p>Now, six years later, he is back in those lands where the pylons march across the sky, and looking for revenge. Stronson is waiting, and there must be a showdown. But first there are others to contend with – Boss Lennox, Cook, the Sultation Kid, the seductive and inscrutable Miss Peet.</p>
<p>The Cowboy Dog is a stunning extension of the series of novels in which Nigel Cox reconfigures New Zealand experience through the most resonant myths of our time.</p>

<p>Francesco de Petrarca was one of the greatest 14th century Italian poets. Born Francesco Petracco, he was ushered into history in Florence in 1302 having been indicted as a lawyer for falsifying a legal document. He refused to stand trial, but was convicted and banished from Florence. He and his young wife escaped to Arezzo, where he changed his name to Petrarca. In 1312 he moved his family to Pisa, then by various assignments to Avignon on the Rhone, Carpentras, Montpellier, and Bologna where he turned his thoughts away from law, and toward reading great classical works, who inspired him to write, so that by 1326 his entire devotion was to romantic poetry. When he first saw a woman named Laura in 1327, in the church of Sainte-Claire d'Avignon, it awoke in him a lasting passion, and the result was a series of over 200 sonnets. They had little contact and she refused any of his advances since she was married to Count Hugues de Sade (ancestor of the infamous Marquis de Sade). His writings won him recognition in cultured society as he traveled and continued to impact the literary world. In fact, he is considered the "Father of the Renaissance."</p>
<p>One of the sonnets follows with an explication appended.</p>
<p>It was the day the sun's ray had turned pale with pity for the suffering of his Maker when I was caught, and I put up no fight, my lady, for your lovely eyes had bound me. It seemed no time to be on guard against Love's blows; therefore, I went my way secure and fearless—so, all my misfortunes began in midst of universal woe. Love found me all disarmed and found the way was clear to reach my heart down through the eyes which have become the halls and doors of tears. It seems to me it did him little honour to wound me with his arrow in my state and to you, armed, not show his bow at all.</p>
<p>Explication:</p>
<p>The poem is addressed to "my lady", some time after the speaker’s experience, a simple glimpse of a woman, the object of his love. Petrarchus alludes to “Good Friday“, the day the sun darkened “for the suffering of his Maker”. Whether the speaker’s experience was literally on this day of religious observation, or whether it was used as a poetic device, his choice is appropriate to his mood. The church may refer to it as “Good” Friday, but it was the day of sorrow, woe, and literal darkness upon the earth, before Redemption was complete. The speaker's focus remains constant on the suffering, dark aspect of Good Friday. He was “caught” and he made no resistance as her eyes had captured him. The metaphor is that of a bandit or surprise attack. Would it be too conventional or pedestrian to identify the attacker as Cupid? Any attacker will do for the metaphor. But her eyes are what bound him, leaving him frozen, vulnerable.. He admits to making no resistance, continuing the metaphor of the Friday of Christ’s sufferings, because it “seemed no time” to be offering resistance, or being “on guard against Love’s blows.” Christ offered no resistance to the blows he suffered, and in keeping with this attitude, the speaker remained passive. He goes on his way, “secure and fearless” while expressing that all his misery, appropriately, ironically began in the “midst of universal woe”. Love, the attacker personified , found his weakness: his eyes (because he simply beheld the woman of his passion) which have now become metaphorically “halls and doors” of tears. Eyelids and doors open and close, halls and tear ducts are avenues. His attention turns back to the bandit--who had no honor in attacking a man in such a weakened condition. He was no worthy foe, indeed. She was “armed” and with her great beauty, rendered him defenseless. The bandit had not even the decency to reveal his weapon. Such is the profound defeat of the speaker in this poem! Charles David Land, B.S. Ed.</p>

<p>Bosco Adventure is anime TV serial, made by Nippon Animation in 1986. It consists of 26 episodes, and was shown in many European countries (France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Germany, Russia, Estonia, Poland, Hungary, Greece...), in America (Canada, Mexico, Chile) and other. It was based on book series Nel storie del Bosco by Italian writer Tony Wolf. First episode aired in Japan, on October 6th 1986 on Yomiuri TV. The story is about a young elvish princess Apricot, whose kingdom got attacked by an evil monster Scorpion and his aides. He ordered Hoodman, a mysterious cloacked person, and his accomplices (rather clumsy and incompetent Jack and Franz) to take Apricot far away and prevent her from returning to the Fountain land on Solar Eclipse, because she would release a great power of water that would destroy Scorpion. Apricot in the first episode meets Frog, Tutty and Otter - good, brave and trusty habitants of Bosco forest. With help of princess' trusty mechanical bird Spiky, they help her to escape from Hoodman with a flying ship called Bosco and start travelling to Fountain land, before it's too late... Supporting characters are: Edner, messenger from Fountain land, Damia, Scorpion's right hand - young, intelligent and dangerous woman, Koumori (a bat, messenger of Scorpion), habitants of Bosco forest, other.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-31_da69.html" title="Edit section: Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca</span></h2>
<p>Turkish poet, born in 1914 in İstanbul.</p>
<p>One of Turkey's most prolific (he has written more than seventy poem books) and frequently translated contemporary poets, Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca received a military education but began publishing poetry while still in middle school. His poem "Yavaşlayan Ömür" (Slowing Life) brought him to the attention of the reading public in 1933. As a career officer he lived in various parts of the country until his resignation from the army in 1950, after which he worked in the Directorate of Press and Tourism and then in the Ministry of Labor for another ten years. He spent some time in France in 1952. Together with a friend he founded "Kitap" (Book) Bookstore and Publications in İstanbul which he managed until 1970. Since then he has concentrated on writing poetry. He currently lives in the district of Kadıköy, İstanbul.</p>
<p>Dağlarca was selected as the best Turkish poet by the International Poetry Forum meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1967 and received a golden wreath in August, 1974 at the Thirteenth Struga, Yugoslavia, Poetry Festival. If Dağlarca sometimes neglects the refinements of image or form, his verse is generally accepted as some of the most vigorous Turkish poetry of the mid-twentieth century. If Dağlarca constitutes, in the words of critic Doğan Hızlan, "a school unto himself", his patriotic themes are firmly bound to Turkish nationalism:</p>
<dl>
<dd>We are Turks, Ataturkists, free from earth to heaven</dd>
<dd>It's crystal clear, the sea is ours, the soil, the sky,</dd>
<dd>Anew we'll build the mountain, stones, the plains</dd>
<dd>Our heart, which beating says, `modern civilization.'</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dağlarca's delibarate use of assonances, reinforcement of concepts by repetition and a mixture of the literary ``purified language with the spoken tongue have been admirably conveyed in a number of English translations. But Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca is not all driving rhythms and strident themes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I draw my world in the air with a flower</dd>
<dd>And look with wonder at this dreamlike form.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some of his books include</p>
<p>Havaya Çizilen Dünya (1935), Çocuk ve Allah (1940), Daha (1943), Çakır'ın Destanı (1945), Toprak Ana (1950), Aç Yazı (1951), A^su^ (1955), Türk Olmak (1963), Haydi (1968), Horoz (1977), Nötron Bombası (1981), Uzaklara Giyinmek (1990), Dildeki Bilgisayar (1992).</p>
