<li>This band did actually chart on GarageBand.com.

<li><b>Comment</b> What does charting on garageband.com assert? It certainly provides no indication that they have an impact inside of their genre or community in any real way. Looking at the rating given to the group's single on the site (rated at 2 stars) puts them somewhere down the line after #140 (out of some 1800). We'll need a little more than that to go on.DeathThoreau 03:54, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>"It certainly provides no indcation that they have an impact inside of their genre or community in any real way." - Is it fair to imply that because they are not a household name like U2 or Coldplay, their existence doesn't matter?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Hey, I made this page for this band because the concert that I saw them in was unreal. All bands come from relative obscurity. Who's to say that they will not be the next big thing. I have personally had conversations with the drummer Bix Jackets and he gave me his permission to make such a page documenting there history. User:Kaox02</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not just saying they will be the next big thing, I am simply stating they are a real band, and deserve recognition of such here in the Wikipedia. The band Motion City Soundtrack has not "hit it big" but they are in the Wikipedia. So why not Chumbly Biscuits? User:Kaox02
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_City_Soundtrack_f6e8.html" title="Motion City Soundtrack">Motion City Soundtrack</a> has more than five albums released, and have appearantly been signed by a label. Chumbly Biscuts can make neither claim. They don't meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and thus, Chumbly Biscuts has no place here yet. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a> 01:17, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - you can't delete something just because the rest of the world has yet to take notice of it. get out of here with your conservative attitude, i just want other fans of this band to know who they are and where they come from.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Harland sanders was 68 when he founded KFC. He had been making his origional recipe chicken his whole life and finally went public in his silver years. I bet your faces will be red when you delete this entry and they become the next George Michael.

<li><b>Comment</b> - First off, if you read the top of your <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">WP:NMG</a> you will see that it states very clearly "these are guidelines...not policy". But if you would like me to explain to pick one, which the article clearly states I need not do to keep a page from being deleted, I will do so. "Has established a tradition or school in a particular genre. " - This could not be more true of this band which if you listen to them, you will know they are more pioneers in music than most bands today. There are tons of bands out there that have a huge fan base but you may not have heard of them, so don't delete this page based on that.User:Kaox02
<ul>
<li>Which traditions or schools have they established and are there verifiable third party sources confirming this? As well, a bands with a "huge fan base" would meet the Wikipedia music criteria by having a charting album or single or complete a national tour or generate significant media. If we had evidence of any of those things, I would change my vote to keep. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:02, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't even want to argue this anymore. I've put a lot of work into this page over the last couple day's and I plan on continuing this in the future. If you had a band you were very passionate about and you wanted others to know about them and LEARN about them, which is what the Wikipedia is for, then you would know why I feel so strongly. Just don't delete it, it won't be good for anyone.User:Kaox02</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Most of the keep votes come from either anon 216.0.142.29 and User:Kaox02. There are, therefore, at most, two votes to keep. I suspect that these two might be the same person, and thus represent one person trying to stuff the vote in bad faith. Can anyone verify? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a> 01:21, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Just so you understand something, by my count, I show 5 votes to delete, and 5 votes to keep. One of them is mine, and if I wanted to "stuff the ballots" as you so call it, I would have a hell of a lot more votes than 4. Not to mention, you voted to keep this page! As for the record label, I believe they are part of Eagle Records, but because I don't remember, I didn't want to put it in there. But they are legit CD's, I can get you one for 10 dolla.User:Kaox02</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. No allmusic entry, no google hits except from garageband.com. Sorry, Kaox, but we can reinstate the article when they do get big -- after all, encyclopedias don't predict, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. <i>Note: I cleaned up a spurious signature by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a>, but didn't touch his vote.</i> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 03:59, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. You can check my IP to verify that I am not the guy stuffing the ballot here. I understand that your buisness is to verify info, but the way you're treating this guy is not all together fair. As an innocent bystander of the situation, I've visited garageband.com, read their story and believe what I see. Wiki's purpose is not to predict the future, that much I agree with, but I believe it has a responsibility to report facts big or small. Maybe they don't have the large budget of U2, but they do exist as shown by the garageband.com entry and downloadable music from them. If I were voting, I'd vote keep.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. By the way, for all of you that are using the "Wiki is not a crystal ball" arguement, please read the info on that rule provided by the hypertext. You are suggesting that Chumbly Biscuits has not existed in the past, when clearly they have released material, with songs provided on garageband.com and diskography dates given. Please stop using this as your basis for voting them off. I vote KEEP.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>KEEP! - "after all, encyclopedias don't predict ..." - True. Encyclopedias state that which does exist or has otherwise been theorised to become established experience. I think this band has proven that they do in fact, exist by virtue of its garageband.com entry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> - So when do I find out if my page will be deleted or kept? I want to know if I should keep adding all that I know about the band?</li>
