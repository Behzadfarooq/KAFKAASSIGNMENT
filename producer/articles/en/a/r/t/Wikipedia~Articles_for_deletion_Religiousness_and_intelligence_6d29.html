<p>This article is a piece of <b>patent nonsense</b>. It could also be a disruption of Wikipedia to make a point.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The source the author provides looks respectable enough, and he claims that he quotes studies featured in <i>Nature</i> and <i>Scientific American</i>, so I have difficulty believing that this is a piece of <b>patent nonsense</b>, even if you personally disagree with the findings. While the tone could certainly be made more diplomatic, a valid correlation between these two important elements of society <i>is</i> encyclopediac, in my opinion, especially when one considers the prominance of both religion and intelligence in encyclopedias individually. Finally, with regards to the possibility of disruption of Wikipedia--my feelings are that we should embrace these challenges, not ignore them. --<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrostyservant_ca78.html" title="User:Frostyservant">Frostyservant</a> 13:30, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is, of course, simply <i>amazing</i> to me that Thomas Aquinas, Augustine of Hippo, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Liebnitz, Bernard Spinoza, Soren Kierkegaard, C. S.

<li><b>Delete</b> as this should be qualified as <b>original research</b>. Reason: the studies cited here report a correlation between <i>level of education</i> (not <i>intelligence</i>) and religious standpoints. They were made within a narrow group of people (both geographically and historically), however, and extrapolating such data to any wider context lacks justification. <small>My opinion: this correlation among the american scientific community may be the byproduct of deeply rooted <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_realism.html" title="Scientific realism">realism</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_reductionism.html" title="Scientific reductionism">reductionism</a>.</small> <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 16:30, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. In response to what has been stated above, let me just say that: 1) a scientific question by definition can't be "inherently POV", because it deals with the reality, and in reality the answer is either <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, 2) the article doesn't claim causation (i.e. that high IQ <i>causes</i> less religiousness), only correlation, and reasonably backs it with references. Still, I must add that I'd rather see it merged someplace... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">GregorB</a> 20:14, May 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This brings us to the essence of this dispute: should we have articles solely about <b>correlations</b>, aside from the question wether and how well they are documented? (I think everyone agrees that this article states correlation, and not causation). So, let's ask ourselves if we should have articles on other equally intensively studied, but perhaps not as popular correlations, such as Aggresiveness and obesity, Annual income and emotional quotient, and my personal favorite, Mental illness and time spent online. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 20:50, May 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is in fact a very good point... My personal hunch is that religiousness is negatively affected chiefly by <b>education</b>, not intelligence, and that the well-known high correlation between the two obscures that fact. Still, we don't know the answer yet, and the mere correlation is fair game for an article if it's important enough, and I think this one is. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">GregorB</a> 12:11, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> POV, junk, unsafeable, since the article does not even remotely come close to contraining what the title advertises; it would even be lousy if it were titled "religiousness and education" since it only talk about a very small part of the educated people in the word; namely, todays US scientists. One would probably even get vastly different results when checking other societies, or other fields of education, and as already pointed out above, let's not even mention different times. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 20:21, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, but we would not let an article stand, either, that would claim that widespread infanticide is unlimited in time and/or place. Furthermore, false analogy - infanticide is a fact that stands on its own, this article is about a correlation, and the degree if that correlation is the question here.--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 14:48, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is clear that this article is about a real thing: an area of intelligence research that has shown a correlation between variables (though the studies and their results are debatable, similarly to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a>). Beckwith's article presented 43 studies from this area that supported the correlation. This discussion is not about the degree of the correlation. Such a discussion would have to be based on a review of this area of intelligence research and these studies, not a review of a week-old stub.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>; The subject matter is controversial, perhaps, but I can certify that studies of this nature are common among economists and social scientists. However, most studies concentrate on more objectively quantifiable identifiers, such as education. There may be no link between education and intelligence, and whether or not there is is not the subject of the article, which concentrates on the undisputed statistical fact that there is a correlation between levels of education and overt religiosity. (Theists do not satisfy the 'overt religiosity' thing, I suspect.) The article is not POV as it stands, but the title may be. Unusual situation. Maybe change to "Religiosity and Education/Intelligence" and keep.<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:47, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

I know I am not, and the same goes probably for the majority of those who voted "delete". The question may or may not be scientific, but unless there are works to be cited that actually deal with the subject (and not "religiousness and 'hard science' academics in the USA at the beginning of the 21st century") the article is not only an invitation for edit wars, it is also probably original research. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 12:10, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Still very US-centric, and the term "religiousness" seems to be quite problematic, too - as it could cover everything from a belief in a god or some "higher plane" with not particular effect on a person's life or work, to a reborn bible-thumper. SAT, btw, also does not quite measure "intelligence", the latter being subject to quite a few controvercies itself. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 14:48, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This area of intelligence research is mostly conducted in the US because religion, like race, is a bigger deal in the US than in other developed countries, as the article points out. <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> is, similarly, also pretty US-centric.

<dd>The studies clearly define their measurements of religiousness. Races can also be difficult to define, but that doesn't mean researchers should throw up their hands and give up. SAT tests do test cognitive ability and are correlated with IQ scores. Controversiality is not grounds for exclusion.

<dd>Leave intent and origin of opinion out of this, its unnecessary. I'm been accused of herecy more often than fundamentalism, and I am quite tempted to vote delete based on disruptiveness.

The article misinterprets its sources - the Nature and Science articles only show correlation between occupation and religiousness, while the Terman study only deals with those with IQ &gt;140.

<li>Well, I think this is the key: <i>I am skeptical that there are no views presented in opposition - surely they exist if the topic is notable</i>. There has been a huge debate on Race and intelligence, for years, and it's produced a notable literature. This just isn't at the same level.
