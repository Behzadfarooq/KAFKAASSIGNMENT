<li>Delete: Something's up, here. I believe that there is a Peter Morello (although the spelling of the last name is up in the air) who is a noted <i>author</i> on Mafia relations. He's a journalist in Philadelphia, I believe, and contributed to <i>Slate</i> a year ago. At least I think that's the case. Delete for lack of verifiability. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:35, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I'm sorry I thought the article's notability was clear when I had originally written it. Morello was a leading member of the Morello crime family, arguably the first Mafiosi crime family in New York, and the last leader of the Morello's before it was absorbed into <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Masseria_9f27.html" title="Joe Masseria">Joe "The Boss" Masseria</a>'s organization where he remained his top advisor until his death during the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castellammarese_War_640a.html" title="Castellammarese War">Castellammarese War</a>. I apologize if I forgot to add my references and I can certainly add several websites. I believe, as he is often confused with Giuseppe Morello (as seen here <a href="http://www.onewal.com/maf-art05.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onewal.com/maf-art05.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), which might explain the lack of information online. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.197.html" title="User:152.163.100.197">152.163.100.197</a> 11:36, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Few google hits, but what I've found looks convincing, notability wise. There does seem to be some confussion between Giuseppe and Peter, "...Giuseppe Morello (aka Peter Morello...", but that's a content issue, not a notability one. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 04:13, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Func. That's exactly why I didn't add Giuseppe's details in the Peter Morello article. While I seem to lean towards Thomas Hunt's theory, which makes sense as Nicolo changed his name to <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Morello_5603.html" title="Nicholas Morello">Nicholas Morello</a> following the conterfeiting scandal, although until Allen May or another historian can respond to this subject it's still just a theory. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.197.html" title="User:152.163.100.197">152.163.100.197</a> 16:53, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It seems, at least in my opinion, that many organized crime related articles, from particularly well known mobsters such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Morris_Bioff_78dc.html" title="Willie Morris Bioff">Willie Morris Bioff</a> to less documented organizations such as the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratva.html" title="Bratva">Bratva</a>, are often nominated for deletion. While this is obviously understandable, especially when no resourses are given, I wonder if an Organized Crime Project page might be helpful in verifing these articles&#160;? <a href="../../../2/0/9/User%7E209.213.71.78.html" title="User:209.213.71.78">209.213.71.78</a> 19:41, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Mikkalai. While there is certainly confusion between Giuseppe and Peter Morello (of which there are both conflicting sources over weither Peter is an alias for Giuseppe) to include all the Morello family (an article I'm planning to add later this month) would be quite large and might be better served by seperate articles considering the different careers of all the Morellos (Antonio's partnership with Lupo The Wolf's Black Hand operations, Nicholas's leadership of the family during the Mafia-Camorra War, as well as Vincenzo and Ciro Terranova's later role during the rise of the National Crime Syndicate to name a few) however merging Giuseppe and Peter into one article might make more sense. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.197.html" title="User:152.163.100.197">152.163.100.197</a> 04:18, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. These hood entries are getting as out of hand as the Street Fighter stubs. Low Google hits indicate a lack of notability. Leanne 10:22, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Leanne. With all due respect anyone who is the least bit knowable on organized crime history would at least admit Peter Morello was a notable figure in pre-Prohibition organized crime. Besides being a member and final leader of one of the earliest crime families in the United States, Morello was the top advisor for Joe Masseria. It was his murder that would lead Marranzano and the other American mafiosi to begin the Castellamarese War. Unless it is official policy, I don't believe a lack of Google hits should be qualifications for deletion or verifiability, as opposed to no google hits, however the external links provided should establish his notability and I suggest for anyone voting on the article to at least read the refernces provided to judge weither or not this article is indeed notable. Many of the articles I have contributed on this subject have been high level mafiosi on an otherwise less documented period of organized crime that unfortunatly have little website hits on popular search engines such as Google. I had thought that with these articles significant subjects like these might have more Google hits and that by writing, at least a small article, that someone on Wikipedia who is a bit more knowable on the subject might be able to contribute a bit more to the article. If this topic is inappropriate for Wikipedia then I apologize however I should mention that, while I agree articles such as Street Fighter, Pokemon, Star Wars, etc., article may not interest myself as much as another fan it doesn't make the articles less significant to those with an interest in the subject. I should also point out that the majority of organized crime articles, at least of which I have found, are reasonably well researched and certainly notable topics (certainly not any I would classify as "hoods") of which very few are stubs. While you are obviously entitled to your opinion I would appreciate any Wikipedian with a knowledge of organized crime to offer their opinion on the matter. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.197.html" title="User:64.12.116.197">64.12.116.197</a> 17:10, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Please indicate more clearly the source of your informatiojn. In particular, whether Sifakis is in fact "Reference", rather than "Further reading". If your surce is a book, it has more credibility that a website. Unfortunately many websites tend to have very low credibility. Usually I treat them as a source of further, more solid references. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:44, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Honestly I think it would be a shame to delete this article. It seems the main arguments for its deletion are notability (based on low google hits) and verification. These look like they've been provided and, while my own opinion is inconsequential, Peter Morello was an important mafiosi both before and during Prohibition and an important figure in the Castellammarese War. The article could use some expanding, possibly merging Giuseppe and Peter Morello, or the Morello crime family. <a href="../../../2/0/9/User%7E209.213.71.78.html" title="User:209.213.71.78">209.213.71.78</a> 19:21, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
