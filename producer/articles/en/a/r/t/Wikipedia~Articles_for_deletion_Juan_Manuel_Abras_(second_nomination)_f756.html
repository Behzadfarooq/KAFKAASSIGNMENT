<dd>Those pages tell us he's a postgrad student. He's taken lots of universty courses (surprise). He's studied with some notable professors, but that doesn't make him notable. He's directed some ensembles that are anonymous (in the English link) or that no-one has heard of (second link). He is a member of a composers' assocation (no evidence that any notability is required to become a member). He's founded lots of groups (big deal). As a composer, has his music been performed by musicians who are themselves notable? Has it been published by a major music publishing company? As a conductor, has he conducted a notable orchestra or ensemble? Are any recordings of his conducting or compositions available commercially? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 05:50, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>All comments by <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> are erroneous and false. Abras is not a postgraduate student anymore (besides, you can achieve notability even while being a student). Not everybody is accepted -as Abras was- to take university courses at the prestigious institutions he attended (where legends like Karajan, Abbado, and Mehta, for instance, studied too: University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, Austria, just for naming one). The ensembles Abras conducted (I checked them one by one) are not anonymous at all; they are simply not listed in this article. The Argentine Composers Association -Abras is a member of that institution- was founded in 1915 as "National Society of Music" and is one of the oldest and most prestigious composers associations of Latin America (of course, not everybody is accepted for becoming a member). Some of Abras scroes and CDs are, indeed available commercially (this was checked too). Abras was designated conductor of two of first-class Argentine Orchestras (this was verified too). Conclusion: all comments by <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> may be product of the evil, non authoritative, jealous and envious mind of, maybe, a frustrated musician that possibly doesn't even know how to read a music score.

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear Wikipedia authorities: Yesterday I have been told that Juan Manuel Abras, a notable young Latin American composer, internationally aclaimed by the Argentine and European media, has become the victim of an evil, envious and unjustified attempt of discrimination by a Wikipedia user named <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a>, who posted false and erroneuos information about the subject in order to support his wicked action, while attempting to confuse fresh comments written by new users with sockpuppets. Having created this account, named Perelli, I checked the truth of this statement and I energically demand from Wikipedia administrators to protect the mentioned article from deletion and not to avoid further activities by <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> or other users that show similar behaviours, activities that are not only totalitarian and against the claimed Wikipedia conventions and policies but also violate the many human rights defined in international law and covenants. This activity will be properly denounced and prosecuted if serious actions are not taken. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerelli_f0de.html" title="User:Perelli">Perelli</a> 20:31, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Music Master, you have made many personal attacks. You have broken the laws regarding libel. Go read WP:NPA immediately. What the hell are you talking about human rights and international law? No one has the RIGHT to an article here. Also, this isn't a vote. 1 edit newcomers and anon editors don't get a sway here. Their comments are taken with very little weight. Stop making socks, OR stop defending them. If your not involved you have no idea if they are a sock or not. Oh yeah, threaten me legally.
