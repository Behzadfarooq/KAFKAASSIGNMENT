<dd>Note: I am aware that there are "Criticism of [Religion]" articles. The present article confuses Jews and Israelis, etc. Needs a fresh start. The waffle about circumcision is laughable. If that is a criticism of Judaism, where do we stop? I will minimally support a merge with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Judaism_7579.html" title="Anti-Judaism">Anti-Judaism</a> (which covers the same subject matter), possibly backwards (because "anti-" seems to be a POV term nowadays. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 09:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have issues even with the other Criticism of ... articles. They all need to be recast, imho. This is because such criticism takes so many different forms, have different agendas, are directed at different things, and in the end bear no resemblance to each other. My guess is that every imaginable critique is contained within other articles - it's hard to see what we'd accomplish by trying to lump it all together. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 23:26, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - if the current content is arbitrary it should be rearranged, the legitimacy of an article for "Criticism of &lt;insert any major religion&gt;" seems obvious as there should be enough encyclopedic content for all articles of that form. And a criticism of Judaism is not the same as anti-Judaism which seems to be a particular brand of Christian theological anti-Semitism. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFrikle_e149.html" title="User:Frikle">Frikle</a> 03:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Merge</b> the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Judaism_7579.html" title="Anti-Judaism">Anti-Judaism</a> with this article per <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreasysteve13_b782.html" title="User:Greasysteve13">Greasysteve13</a>. I created this article. Here is the rationale for my doing so: I was working on the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_bdda.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a> article and someone asked on the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECriticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_54d5.html" title="Talk:Criticism of the Catholic Church">Talk Page</a> why there wasn't also a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Judaism_ff29.html" title="Criticism of Judaism">Criticism of Judaism</a> article. After some discussion, it became evident that there should be such an article and I so created this article. See <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECriticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_54d5.html#Criticism_of_Judaism" title="Talk:Criticism of the Catholic Church">Talk:Criticism of the Catholic Church#Criticism of Judaism</a> for the full record of the discussion. There is a partial consensus that <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_bdda.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a> is for "legitmate, debatable" opposition to the doctrines, practices and actions of the Catholic Church whereas <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">Anti-Catholicism</a> was to be for the more "rabid, irrational" hatred of the Catholic Church "along the lines of anti-Semitism". Thus "Criticism of Judaism" is intended for "legitmate, debatable" opposition to Judaism whereas <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> is intended to describe "rabid, irrational" hatred of Jews and Judaism. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 06:01, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

What this "article" is attempting to do, is to twist the views expressed in other articles and depict them as some sort of normal "criticism" of Judaism from outside the faith which is nothing less than hatemongering and is hence totally unacceptable.

<p>Generally it looks as if the "Anti-.." articles deals with <i><a href="../../../b/i/a/Bias.html" title="Bias">bias</a> against a religion.</i> (Cartoons depicting stereotypes would be appropriate in such an article, IMO, as would any expression of irrational, emotional feelings.)</p>
<p>The "Criticism of.." articles (should!) examine the more scholarly criticism of a religion through the ages. What other (religious) scholars write about Judaism would be very relevant and appropriate in this article. <a href="../../../h/s/h/User%7EHshhh%2C_I%C2%B4m_not_really_here_da16.html" title="User:Hshhh, I´m not really here">Hshhh, I´m not really here</a> 19:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. Generic mullahs ranting against the 'Jews' or Falwell ranting against the Muslims would be addressed in the 'anti' articles. Scholarly criticism of particular religions should go in the 'criticism' articles. Since religions make such broad (and frequently exclusive) claims on the human experience, it is all the more important that good-faith criticism of them not be stifled. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 20:35, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have looked at some of those articles and I think each one has its own approach, so that none of them really are "precedent" for the existence of an article on "Criticism of..." anything else.

<li>I think <i>Criticism of</i> for any major religion is a lame concept. Any religion that's been around for a thousand years has its theological ducks in a row. All the criticism boils down to hateful nonsense, misunderstanding, or a different set of pre-logical choices. Parcel out the content to the appropriate articles, redirect the title to wherever; maybe to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, or maybe we should just have one page, Criticism of other people's beliefs. And yes, I do support this approach for all the other <i>Criticism of...</i> pages. Except <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Family_Guy_c905.html" title="Criticism of Family Guy">Criticism of Family Guy</a>; we should keep that one. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 00:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Tom, why criticism, by nature, is a bad thing? Some criticisms can be quite helpful (but not all of them of course). All our progress is because of criticisms. But aside this, the articles like "criticism of ..." save many people's time who are trying to find such unbiased religous dialog. And also, it is a reality after all. Tom , I believe our understanding of a religon will not become complete unless we see how people have criticized it. There is a lot of hateful nonsense, misunderstanding there. True! But there is a positive side to the matter as well. Some people criticize another religon to satify their own hateful feelings. But there are some who are willing to hear the criticisms just to make life happier for themselves and others. <i>As long as a page supports conversation among people from different religons, I will strongly support it.</i> All this world needs is a place in which people <i>talk to each other</i> and share their view points with each other. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:45, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Writing such an article could be a great exercise for the writers. The replies to the criticisms would be the best part. It might also be an effective format for the presentation of basic facts about each religion. Although they all have answers, I guess rational criticisms do exist; and different people will be persuaded by different answers to those criticisms. I guess I can imagine how high-quality articles like what you describe could add a lot to our coverage of religion. I have doubts about our ability to do that here, but I think your approach, deleting most of it and starting over, is a legitimate way to go. If not that, maybe it could start as a section, <i>Replies to common criticisms</i>. It could lead to good results. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 01:39, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I usually assume good faith… its just I’ve had nothing but experiences regarding Macedonian and Greek biases… so forgive me for wanting some outside input.

<dd>I fail to see how I've assumed bad faith regarding the creator of the article or the reasons why he created it.

As far as your desire for "outside input", I'm not exactly certain to what you might be referring. "As seen above"? Please provide a relevant diff that supports your point. Regarding your apparently completely unrelated "point", what does this have to do with Macedonian or Greek biases?

<dd>That's a valid argument to make. One may argue that there is not yet enough criticism to warrant a separate article, or that perhaps the criticisms should better be incorporated as pieces into other articles. What I'm objecting to is the argument that 'criticism' articles are wrong on principle. An article 'Criticism of X' is no more pushing a POV than is the 'X' main article pushing the POV of X. The only thing that an article named 'Criticism of X' is advocating is the fact that there is enough notable criticism of X to warrant a discussion of it. That's all. In this particular case I find it extremely hard to believe that over almost 4000 years of history there has not yet been generated enough notable criticism of Judaism to warrant an article on it, which is why I think that despite the article currently being mostly a stub it deserves a chance to live.

<dd>PS: The most "notable" criticisms of Judaism have occurred in the last 250-300 years, and this has nothing to do with the length of time for which it's been around. They are in fact, criticisms and disputes by groups <i>within</i> Judaism, see <a href="../../../h/a/s/Haskala.html" title="Haskala">haskala</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform Judaism</a>. --<a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatamtig_bfdb.html" title="User:Batamtig">Batamtig</a> 06:16, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just want to point out that while there are some citations, as of right now the article says almost nothing. In an apparent effort to whittle it down to statements that approach "scholarly criticism, it has been reduced to eight sentences, and they aren't very long sentences. Even some of those probably don't make the grade of "scholarly criticism." Also, I have a strong suspicion that all of this information is already in other articles. This article just doesn't serve any purpose. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 03:15, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b> and expand. Responding to 6SJ7 - but that's what wikipedia is for. Someone starts an article and someone else runs with it. And someone else edits. And in a while, we've got a mature article. It's the village raising a child theory.&#160;:) If we have all the other criticism articles per Hshhh, I´m not really here, we should have this article... else, we come across as biased in the other direction. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanet13_ca5f.html" title="User:Janet13">Janet13</a> 05:37, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly. The question of whether an article should exist is a separate issue from whether or not it needs work.
