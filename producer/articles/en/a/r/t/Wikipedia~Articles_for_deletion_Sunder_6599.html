<li>I agree with this; that's why I say you have some non-Sunder edits. Chronosphere, on the other hand, has no evidence of signing up for Wikipedia for any reason other than to work on the Sunder page. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 15:00, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've been on wikipedia for a while, though not much of an editor - i'm a lurker by admission. Though I would imagine that shouldn't have any weight on the matter - my logic and reasoning should count over why I am here. And this is something that I have knowledge and a vested interest in. Isn't a passion for a subject matter the way many articles get written on wikipedia? If we had a ban on people writing or commenting on articles they have a vested interest in, nothing would get written!&#160;:D I want to see entries on online gaming organizations in this Wiki - its not a fad, its not some small thing, and I believe its notable enough to deserve an entry on this Wiki. I orignally voted a weak delete on this article due to it being a blatant advert, saying that I would change my vote if it was edited not to be. It was edited corespondingly, though I still think it could use some work - so I also changed my vote. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronoSphere_7774.html" title="User:ChronoSphere">ChronoSphere</a> 16:07, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b> Apparently, they have over 200 members, which is above the example low threshold of interest. A similar page exists for Sturmgrenadier. Oddly enough, Sunder is made up of former members of Sturmgrenadier. Together they <i>claim</i> a thousand members. Perhaps significant, perhaps not. Maybe an article on multi-game online gaming units should be created that contains information on all such groups? --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 18:28, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Even if the 200 members claim is true, 200 members isn't nearly enough for an encylopedia entry by that criterion alone. Plenty of newsgroups, forums, lodges, and local organisations have thousands of members. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:43, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Further comment: Also, neither of the two Sunder URLs given in the article have any Alexa rank at all: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=sunderhq.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=sunderhq.com" rel="nofollow">SunderHQ</a> and <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=sunderradio.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=sunderradio.com" rel="nofollow">Sunder Radio</a> (Alexa ranks the top approx. 7 million sites on the web). This is startling for a group whose claim-to-fame is its online activities. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:55, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Maybe we should give them a chance to change it to an encyclopedic article instead of outright deletion - there's already a notice about NNPOV there. Though I have to admit they themselves wrote it and would probably not like having to gut the article to put it as NPOV. <s>If nothing changes there before the delete timer runs out, I'll vote for deletion.</s> In the meanwhile, I'll add a notice that its a candidate for deletion - its not on the page at the moment. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronoSphere_7774.html" title="User:ChronoSphere">ChronoSphere</a> 21:31, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> <s>Its an Advert right now. If it gets edit to be non-advert, NPOV, I may change my vote.</s> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronoSphere_7774.html" title="User:ChronoSphere">ChronoSphere</a> 00:48, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said, the new edit makes the page more factual instead of NNPOV - and please keep in mind that both myself and Habap have been reverting vandalism of the sunder page. We both feel that online gaming organizations are not a small thing anymore, and feel that they deserve a mention within Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronoSphere_7774.html" title="User:ChronoSphere">ChronoSphere</a> 23:07, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> with a larger article about online organizations. It's unreasonable to expect something that's been around for less than 6 months to appear on Alexa. There are also a number of equally prominent gaming organizations that don't have entries in Wikipedia, such as Conquest www.conquest-guild.org, Afterlife www.afterlifeguild.org, and Fires of Heaven www.fohguild.org. All of the aforementioned organizations have been around longer than either Sunder or Sturmgrenadier, and have had a much larger impact on gaming in general, regardless of their memberbases. Frankly, this dispute seems to have erupted out of a vendetta against Sunder on the part of Sturmgrenadier, as both users Habap and ChronoSphere are current members of Sturmgrenadier. It's notable that both have voted to delete the Sunder entry, but to retain the Sturmgrenadier entry, in spite of the inherent similarities of each organization and each entry. --Vyrus 18:20, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My apologies. I am clarifying my point in my earlier comment. Retain, along with the half-dozen other such pages for Maza, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/g/Sogamed.html" title="Sogamed">Sogamed</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjas_in_pajamas.html" title="Ninjas in pajamas">NiP</a>, Theafers, and Phaze II among others I didn't find in a quick search. I've got nothing against <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunder.html" title="Sunder">Sunder</a> and, since I don't play WoW, hadn't heard of it until the editing of the SG page. As one can see on the Talk:Sturmgrenadier, I have been campaigning to keep information that indicates Sturmgrenadier is not "perfect". I have created a stub for <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_Gaming_Organizations_8487.html" title="Online Gaming Organizations">Online Gaming Organizations</a> and have posted on the <a href="../../../o/n/l/Talk%7EOnline_Gaming_Organizations_15e4.html" title="Talk:Online Gaming Organizations">Talk:Online Gaming Organizations</a> page that it might be appropriate to list, but not describe these organizations there. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 18:41, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The similarities between the Sturmgrenadier article and the Sunder article are superficial - Sturmgrenadier is larger, older by almost 5 years, is ranked on Alexa <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=sturmgrenadier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=sturmgrenadier.com" rel="nofollow">Sturmgrenadier.com</a>and has been mentioned in mainstream press by USA Today on June 24th, 2003. And as you may note by reading the text next to my vote above, my rationale behind voting was because the article was a blatant advert - not because I am a member of SG. Please take care to read the discussion in its entirety before making declarations on editors intentions. Please also note that I had changed my vote as a result of the subsequent edits to the article, as I said I would, since I had originally voted a weak delete, contigennt on the article remaining the way it was originally written. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronoSphere_7774.html" title="User:ChronoSphere">ChronoSphere</a> 20:12, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify the origins of the issue, it appears to have started in the 29th of May when an unknown person added the paragraph on Sunder to the SG page. Neither Chronosphere nor I was the one that VfD'd this article.
