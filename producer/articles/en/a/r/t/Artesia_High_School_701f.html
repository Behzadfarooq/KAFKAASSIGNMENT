<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artesia_High_School_701f.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>As Lakewood and surrounding areas became the hub of the rapid <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_California_3bf5.html" title="Southern California">Southern Californian</a> development, construction of Artesia High was completed in 1954, making it the oldest high school in the ABC Unified School district. The school mascot is the Pioneer, symbolizing brave exploration into the unknown.</p>
<p>Recently, as part of a $137 million school district modernization project, Artesia had undergone significant upgrades in its buildings and equipment. As of 2007, Artesia High offers 14 <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_5c2b.html" title="Advanced Placement">Advanced Placement</a> courses and numerous 'Honors' level courses in a far and wide reaching curriculum.</p>
<p><a name="Clubs_and_Athletics" id="Clubs_and_Athletics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artesia_High_School_701f.html" title="Edit section: Clubs and Athletics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clubs and Athletics</span></h2>
<p>Artesia has a number of clubs and on-campus organizations covering a wide range of activities. Every club varies in its nature, from the mountain hiking Wilderness club, to the serious mathematicians in the Calculus club. The clubs are required to choose their own leaders, though they must have a teacher supervisor. All clubs are responsible for their own funds and its usage. This results in the school clubs having a great space of independence and autonomy from the ASB (student government) and teacher staff. The list of clubs is always growing, with several to-be clubs receiving their charters every year. Artesia High is also a part of the MESA (Mathematics Engineering and Science Achievement) schools program, and is under the direct guidance of <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_University%2C_Long_Beach_67aa.html" title="California State University, Long Beach">California State University, Long Beach</a>.</p>
<p>Artesia High School is well renowned for its competitive sports teams, and the boys basketball team has been distinguished for ranking 1st in California during the 2005-2006 season, where they won the CIF Division III championships with a record of 33 wins to a single loss. The 2006 win makes it the second time in the school's history that it claimed victory in the California Basketball championships. The school is also well known for its football and baseball teams.</p>
<p>Artesia High competes in 13 sports categories: Basketball, Baseball, Football, Volleyball, Soccer, Cross Country, Track, Swimming, Wrestling, Water Polo, Softball, Tennis and Golf.</p>
<p>Notable sports figures are Ed and Charles O'Bannon. Both played at UCLA and in the NBA. Jason Kapono who currently plays for the NBA Miami Heat. Derek Glasser who is currently point guard at the Arizona State Sun Devils. And currently highly recruited basketball players James Harden, Renardo Sidney, Jason Pruitt, and Malik Story.</p>
<p>Artesia is also known for scandal with importing Basketball players from other countries. One notable player Jon Steffanhausen played in the NBA for the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
<p><br />
Famous football alumni include Kansas Wesleyan University (NAIA) wide receiver Aaron Aska, Kansas State University running back Joe Hall, and Oregon State wide receiver Kenny Farley.</p>
