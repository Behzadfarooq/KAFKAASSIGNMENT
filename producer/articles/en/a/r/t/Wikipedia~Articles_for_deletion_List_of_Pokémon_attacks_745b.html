<li><strike><b>Weak delete</b>.</strike> I don't think that a list of attacks in Pokémon (which would start with the 100 or so in the games, and then could end up including the hundreds of one-off called attacks in the anime, manga, and card game) is encyclopedic material, and it borders on an unmaintainable list. Furthermore, I don't think that such an article would lend much to understanding of Pokémon either as fiction or as a social phenomenon, given that in nearly every context the attacks will appear in, their effects or attributes will be immediately apparent or immediately explained. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 05:49, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> (disclosure: I created this page). As noted above, more than one person seemed to share the sentiment that, while individual pokeattacks did not merit seperate articles, the information should be kept <i>somewhere</i>. Thus, this article. I'm not sure why an article on common attacks in the pokemon universe, which would surely be of interest to quite a few people, is unencyclopedic. AS for concerns about the list being too long, criterion can be selected so that the number of attacks is limited to the more common ones. As for concerns about the individual write-ups on the attacks being too long, those can be shortened (I've already shortened them some). <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_oojah_611f.html" title="User:Wandering oojah">Wandering oojah</a> 07:37, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have an excellent place for descriptions of common or signature Pokémon attacks: in the articles for the individual Pokémon involved. The fact remains that there aren't many (none that I can think of) common Pokémon attacks that aren't plainly obvious, and the uncommon ones don't bear mentioning (for the same reason that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_characters_c18c.html" title="List of Pokémon characters">List of Pokémon characters</a> doesn't include every single Pokémon trainer in the games; there are hundreds and most are more-or-less interchangable). Anyone with a basic grasp of English or a dictionary understands that Flamethrower is going to be a blast of flame, Water Gun is going to be a jet of water, and that Thunderbolt is going to be a blast of electricity.<br />
As for attacks that aren't as obvious, in both the manga and the anime (where the effects of the attack are extremely fluid, depending on the needs of the plot) they are immediate explained, in all but the oldest games they're described in the game, and, most importantly, it's exceedingly unlikely anyone without access to those primary sources will ever have cause to look up further information on Wikipedia (unless that information was specific in a technical way, a la GameFAQs, which isn't Wikipedia's thing anyway).<br />
I just don't see how this sort of list could contribute to an encyclopedic understanding, instead of being a random list of loosely-connected trivia. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 07:55, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The very fact that we even have a list of (notable) Pokémon charachters is, in my view, a good argument for keeping a list of (notable) Pokémon attacks. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_oojah_611f.html" title="User:Wandering oojah">Wandering oojah</a> 08:06, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point is that they aren't notable, on top of being obvious. Most of the characters on that list aren't notable; that's why their only presence on Wikipedia is one-sentence mentions on that list. These attacks are even <i>less</i> notable than those characters who are only bullet points on a list, and are comparably notable to the interchangable one-off Pokémon trainers who form the starchy parts of the Pokémon games and anime. Any list of the attacks would be statements of the obvious, information better off placed in the individual Pokémon species articles, or trivial minutia (most likely in the form of raw data) that doesn't serve to create understanding (e.g. "Charizard uses Flamethrower in episodes X, Y, and Z. Charizard learns Flamethrower at level Q.") - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small>
<ul>
<li>My thought on that is, an individual article about a single pokemon attack would probably be obvious and none too interesting, as you say. But, in my view, an article listing various pokemon attacks provides some useful information...such as the names of various attacks, and which pokemon use them. It also just provides a good general overview of the ways in which Pokémon attack each other. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_oojah_611f.html" title="User:Wandering oojah">Wandering oojah</a> 08:56, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would definately not want this page to turn into a list of <i>every</i> attack in the universe but many are notable, if not in their own articles. Vine Whip and Thundershock for example (Yes, I know they're not there yet). And also, I dislike the fact that this is running cross-purposes to the other AfDs. People have said on there that they wanted it merged somewhere so that's what was done.

<li>I'd be inclined to possibly change my vote if you added a rough list of the attacks you consider worth including, at least as a temp page (maybe over on <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_T_4710.html" title="WP:PCP/T">WP:PCP/T</a>, even).

<li><b>Keep</b>. As I understand some attacks are used by several different species of Pokemon, so listing them within the articles on individual pokemon would create too much duplications. This list is much more preferable to listing all attacks in seperate articles and thus I consider it to be the best solution. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:43, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Wiki is not a repository of random information. Fan-to-fan you may indeed say this is a notable attack, this is not.

<li><b>Keep</b>. 200 items in a list is nothing much, and large amounts of data can be synthesized in tables--see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> for a good example of many hundreds of entries containing complex information being listified.

<li><b>Keep</b>, it's creation will discourage new stubs for individual attacks, and if they're made anyhow, they can easily be merged/re-directed into this, without going through countless AFDs.

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I dislike Pokémon, it was a worldwide phenomenon, enough to have its own encyclopedic entry - and I guess the same could be said of everything affiliated within the phenomenon, perhaps this list or article could expand to include other aspects of the Pokémon universe so as there isn't so much Poké-clutter. I agree with the above statements. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 14:19, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: We already have another, more complete although less descriptive list of Pokémon moves, Pokémon moves by type. Also, if there is going to be a list of this sort, I think it should have a title with 'move' in it rather than 'attack' - move is the catch-all term used in the games that includes non-attacking techniques, such as Recover and Withdraw. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky_the_Seventh_Chaos_dc6c.html" title="User:Sparky the Seventh Chaos">Sparky Lurkdragon</a> 04:52, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That list is inaccurate, out-of-date, and incomplete, to the point of being misleading and useless. I have redirected it to this one, as this list, if kept, will be rewritten based on primary sources. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 06:36, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. While we had accepted beforehand that Pokemon is an encyclopedic cultural phenomenon, there's way too many Pokemon attacks, and the alternative is having an article for each one of them. It's a lesser of two evils thing for those who viciously hate Pokecruft. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a> 06:21, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a false dilemma. Another alternative is to have no articles about the attacks, collectively or individually, and mention them where relevant in the species and character articles/lists. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 06:36, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
