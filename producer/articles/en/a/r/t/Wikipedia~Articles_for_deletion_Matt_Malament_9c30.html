<li>I am a colleague of Matt's. While he isn't as well known as say a Michael Porter, he is deinfitely a leading strategic thinker. He's fairly humble, so he won't jump into this fray, but I think to delete his page would be a black mark on Wikipedia. 00:41, 24 January 2006 (UTC) S.

<li><s><b>Weak keep/delete if not cleaned up</b></s> - Someone with more information might be able to comment on whether winning the "It's Academic Super Bowl" is more than a local phenomenon. If it is, I guess that's weak grounds for notability. However, the rest is entirely unencyclopedic (captained the varsity football team?

<li><b>Comment</b> 65.202.106.114, <b>do not</b> attempt to edit this page in any way that would distort the general content of the discussion. It is considered very rude to edit anyone <i>else's</i> comments. If you are the same person as <a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmx3_0d46.html" title="User:Dmmx3">User:Dmmx3</a> and find that the discussion is becoming embarrasing or unpleasant, then log in here as Dmmx3, say so, and request that the article be deleted and the discussion terminated early. Our due process requires that the discussion must stay open for at least five days, but in this case and given the obvious consensus to delete, I'd honor a request by Dmmx3 for speedy deletion <b>if</b> nobody objects. It's not nice to insert bogus articles into Wikipedia but it's not a big deal, it happens <b>a lot.</b> You pulled a dumb stunt, you got caught, it happens.

I don't actually doubt the veracity of the biographical details provided for either; but when stripped of the unsupportable grandiose claims, they don't amount to encyclopaedic notability or even notoriety any which way you slice it. If truly a "giant in the field" other than in his own lunchtime, there would be commentary and recognition of the same from a variety of independent notable sources — but these are completey lacking. Being an employee of, or a consultant to, Fortune500 companies is not an automatic qualifier for mention here.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 03:48, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
