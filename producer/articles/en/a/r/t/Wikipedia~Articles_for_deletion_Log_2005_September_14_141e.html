<li><b>Delete</b>. Article is on a an utterly non-notable, non-encyclopedic phenomenon. It should be deleted, but within process. Deleting this article the first time was out of process since that AFD debate had been closed with a reasonable "no consensus" judgment call. It was a fair call by Tony Sidaway to undelete, and bring this back to AFD. VFU is not yet the place to dispute "keep" results (it might be in the near future), and just deleting it so that it can go to VFU (where about 50% to not delete is required) instead of AFD (where about 33% to not delete is required) is not really right either. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:44, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the argument is intended to make clear that the vote "<i>Merge and delete</i>" is indeed a valid one to make, Redwolf24. It is sometimes held that it is not valid because keeping author attribution is required by GFDL, whereas a page delete would seem to remove trace of it. However, this is not so. One can merge an article into another and still preserve author attribution in one of two ways: by performing a history merge, or by listing the authorship(s) in the Talk page. The history merge method is somewhat disliked by admins, because of it's laboriousness (and, I'm given to understand, its irreversibility). However, the operational difficulty of one method is no argument that the "<i>Merge &amp; delete</i>" vote is <i>invalid</i>. If Ryan wants to vote that, he is perfectly eligible to do so. Kind regards‚Äî<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">·Ω≤Œ≥Œ∫Œ≠œÜŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩ</font></a>&#160; 12:41, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Yes, technically he can vote "merge &amp; delete" but those alternative means of preserving attribution history are all laborious and error-prone. Unless someone makes a very strong case for <i>why</i> I should go to all that trouble, many closing admins (myself included) are going to ignore the "delete" side of that vote. A "vote" unadorned by comment or explanation gets low weight. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:59, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh yes, I'm quite aware of that Rossami‚ÄîI did read <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_January-February_2005_c0f2.html#Merge_and_Delete" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/January-February 2005">this</a> comment that you'd linked from that discussion I linked for Redwolf. I was here concerned mainly to dispel the notion that it is invalid or disallowed; it is not. Incidentally, and I'd understand if you'd like to take this to a talk page, it seems to me that the decision to disregard the delete part of the vote is one that is usually possible only because the vote is rare; I imagine that if I were closing a hypothetical AfD and was faced with 10 clear M&amp;D votes and nothing else, and all specifically asking for a history merge, I'd be bound to honor those wishes, however unadorned the votes (as I would be if, say, they were all unadorned keep votes). Not that this has practical relevance here, of course.‚Äî<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">·Ω≤Œ≥Œ∫Œ≠œÜŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩ</font></a>&#160; 00:50, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Trolling is basically online by definition, and that's why I think the redirect to Internet troll is better, given the title we're redirecting from.

<li>I don't really understand what the people voting delete here have against a merge being performed. Very few people are arguing to keep the article in it's entirety, a merge normally does not keep the article intact in it's entirety, the worthwhile bits (e.g. the bridge incident) gets kept whilst the other parts get cut down, I don't see why people are objecting to this. -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 23:31, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry to hear the bad news about Redwolf24. Of course there is no speedy criterion "has not been merged yet as required by AfD". The deleting sysop had the option of either performing the merge himself or allowing someone else to do so, or at most relisting on AfD as a disputed AfD close. I decry this recent habit among some sysops of simply speedying articles, without even making any attempt at discussion, because they disagree with another sysop's close. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:35, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This page and pub are definately notable, especially to locals of the area. The pub has been there for a very long time, dating back to when the area was still farmland, more than 70 years ago. It has been a second home many generations of locals, including students, even my father in his earlier years (around 30 years ago now). It is a very traditional pub which is still family owned, and contains no pokies, and even though it still looks the same now as it did 50 years ago, it still packs in the locals for lunch, dinner, and late drinks. Even 3AW, the states highest rating radio station has written about it (<a href="http://www.3aw.com.au/pub_of_the_week/Notting_Hill_Hotel.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.3aw.com.au/pub_of_the_week/Notting_Hill_Hotel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.3aw.com.au/pub_of_the_week/Notting_Hill_Hotel.htm</a>) with a few intersting facts, including that the female owner has been around the pub for over 70 years, and that she may be the oldest continuously licensed publican in Melbourne. The fact that what was written about the pub has been considered a 'load of dreck', does not mean that the pub is not worthy of noting. --User:Anon 19:48, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let me also note that the nominator is undergoing an RFArb right now, that, when passed, will ban him temporarily, because of a legal dispute with Wikipedia, and would be banned indefinitely from Church of Scientology-related articles. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 05:37, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>There is no legal dispute. The arbitrator User:Fred Bauer has demonstrated his incompetence once too many times. He claims I have a legal dispute, but that is based on his misinterpretation of my statements and possibly his confusion thinking that I am Barbara Schwarz. I have asked him to be removed from the RfA.

<li>No we don't. As explained below, the role of a disambiguation page is to disambiguate. Links to HMS <i>Plymouth</i> should be taken to a list of all ships of that name, regardless of whether or not those articles exist or not. That avoids creating link from an article which was intent on mentioning one vessel being taken to a page on an entirely different vessel. See <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllpages_HMS_d125.html" title="Special:Allpages/HMS">allpages/HMS</a>, and you'll find lots of redlinks to ships that haven't been written about yet. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">‚ò∫</a> 18:33, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This needs to be either a redirect or a disambiguation page.

<li>There are no other articles on other ships or submarines in WP. But that is irrelevant.

And honestly I can't find a rule that talks about "impact on the masses" or something like that, either. Quite on the contrary <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> states in <i>Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</i>: "This means that there is no practical limit to number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page." I really don't see why an empty <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkstar_One_1e3b.html" title="Darkstar One">Darkstar One</a> page should be preferred over a page that actually provides some information, without violating the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> rules. 84.61.30.153 03:13, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>As of a couple of months ago, "Wikipedia is not a gamer's guide" was <i>explicitly</i> part of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I don't know when it was removed, but I didn't see any discussion of its removal. (That page gets edited daily or more, including non-consensus changes which are often reverted.) "Wikipedia is not a web guide" is another point that has been removed, and is relevant. Regardless of where or how it is communicated, <a href="../../../i/_/_/WP%7EI_cd77.html" title="WP:I">Wikipedia:Importance</a> still applies. There are disagreements about how to apply it; but the only reason that Pokemon characters, for example, are kept is that editors demonstrate that vast numbers of people in many countries pay attention to them, <i>not</i> merely because they're something verifiable on the internet. I agree with Dpbsmith's proposed wording for future stuff: "Information on unreleased products, software, games, or movies may be appropriate when the plans for the product are so notable that they are affecting many people in the present." Can you demonstrate verifiably that this is the case for Darkstar One? If so, I will change my vote. Otherwise, not until the program actually achieves the sort of status usually shorthanded as "notability". If a professor (someone with influence on human lives far less trivial than a video game) is required by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to be "more well known and more published than an average college professor", why should games get a free pass from WP's general standards? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:09, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamicization.html" title="Islamicization">Islamicization</a> Is the common european term for a variety of phenomena. I wish WP would work out a satisfactory way of reconciling the different usage that exists in the u.s. and europe, often the assumptions of similarity made by u.s. contributors can have the result of making whole entries unreliable to european users. In this case someone looking for info on a legitimate word will not find it if the page is deleted, even though the content may exist under Islamization. Seems we really are divided by a common language - I would like to see an alternative to disambiguation for cases such as this (a word which in itself sounds strange to european ears where 'clarification' has served as a good verb to counter 'ambiguity' for many years) - any ideas on how to go about suggesting such a process? 80.0.168.8 12:10, 15 September 2005 (UTC) not logged in usual username is ttifrap</li>

<dd>But Islamicization and Islamization are not necessarily the same thing. Islamization is a philosophical process - so, for instance, you can Islamize the study of physics. Islamicization is more geopolitical in meaning (e.g. the "creeping Islamicization of the inner cities" was a phrase I read recently in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Telegraph_eab7.html" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>). <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 14:37, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose <i>islamization</i> covers both meanings, with <i>islamicization</i> being an alternate spelling (very unfriendly to the tongue).

<li>And Google says: Islamization (215,000) plus Islamisation (153,000) = 368,000. Islamicization (18,700) plus Islamicisation (629) = 19,329. I think that the geopolitical use of the word is probably far more likely in English-language media than the philosophical process, but "Islamiz/sation" is the word that is being used, not "Islamiciz/sation". <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 15:17, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree. "Islamicization" may be a neologism, but it means the same thing as "Islamization", which certainly isn't.

<li>Google gives no results on him, so I guess he's either an amateur player (therefore non-notable) or non-existant, which also means we should put this article up for <b>deletion</b>.

<li>Well, the <i><b>original</b></i> speedy deletion was "CORY DOWNES RULESSSSS YEHHH THIS PAGE IS DEDICATED TO THE COOLEST GUY IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", so the fact that this version actually had something in it means that it is not a recreation. <i>However</i>, the originator of this version also blanked it.

<p>This list seems to have been created simply to include a reference to the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Hundred_and_Thirty_Five_Years%27_War_311c.html" title="Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years' War">Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years' War</a>, an anomalous diplomatic situation between the Isles of Scilly and the Netherlands. This 'war' seems only to be known by that name on Wikipedia and its mirrors, and to fail more or less every criterion for being a war. As the article on the war notes, Guinness Superlatives have not recognised it as such. I think the '335 years war' article is on very shaky footing (Scilly and the Netherlands were united in a personal union during the reign of William III, which makes it unlikely they were at war, to put it mildly.) Creating a list to hold a reference to this scarcely-notable non-event is pointless. 'Peaceful war' seems oxymoronic. I'd like to suggest that the 335 years' war article be deleted too, but that may be a bit too Bold. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 15:02, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The title in itself causes potential POV problems. It's also very vague. Would the Cold War count?(overall, not the ancillary wars such as Korea or Vietnam) Does that include non-military "wars" or rivalries? How about War Games? I could go on.

<li><b>Delete</b>, for many reasons. First, what Karmafist says, especially regarding vagueness (is this only declared wars, for one thing? Do deaths from non-military action such as blockades and embargos count? <i>Are</i> there enough non-violent declared wars to make a list worthwhile?) and hard-to-escape POV issues. Plus, even if such a list were worth keeping, it's hard to picture what useful, brief annotation one could put beside each peaceful war, and it would thus probably be better served by a category.

<li><b><a href="../../../b/j/a/Wikipedia%7EBJAODN_bac2.html" title="Wikipedia:BJAODN">BJAODN</a></b>, I guess, because it's <i>far</i> too brilliant an idea to just delete it.

<li>I'm not sure what to do with this. First off, the whole concept of a peaceful war is difficult. This leads me to think that renaming to something like "Bloodless Wars" might be a workable idea, but that doesn't really cover the fact that some of these were part of wars that were far from bloodless (Civil War, Crimean War, WW2) and the others were mostly minor border conflicts. I guess that leaves me with no option but to go with a <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../a/p/y/User%7EApyule_9559.html" title="User:Apyule">Apyule</a> 05:53, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> The idea of a peaceful war isn;t so strange. For example, during the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden declared war on Britain to keep Napoleon happy but told the British privately not to worry about it, they weren't serious about it. However, I'm not certain whether or not a category is better than a list in this case. A list potentially could include a brief one line explanation of why the war was peaceful. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 11:13, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just don't know that any brief one-line explanation could do the reason justice. It would obviously be explored in the article, but the reasons are likely to be somewhat complicated. Although I admit that the Swedish-Napoleonic-Wars thing could probably be briefly explained in a line since, well, you just did. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 16:35, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Simply needs more wikification. The article currently uses some Fullerisms ("omnihumanity", "comprehensivist", etc.) and Fulleresque prose.

<li><b>Delete</b> A large number of scientific publications shows, that Synergetics is the interdisciplinary field started by physicist H. Haken (1969). See the Springer Series in Synergetics - or any other scientific publication on Synergetics (try Google...). 17:07, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>yes, on second thoughts it is not computer generated. I came accross this because I wanted to link to it from an article I was writing, and pressed for time I only skimmed the synergetics article. But the article seemed to me so bizarrely off the point of what synergetics actually is (and it is not about omni-humanity, nor is it a self-discipline, whatever those things are) that I imagined that some algorithm had plugged in some synergetics terms and people to a random post-modernist bit of text. On a proper reading, it does not seem as bad as I first thought. However, it is still *terrible* and if it remains, people will be miseducated by it, which is bad. Even worse, serious scientists who might be interested in haken's work might gather the impression that it is quasi-philosophical fluff, which it is not. So, delete, and since I work in an institution where most faculty were taught by haken, I will try to put together something better when I can. Here, for completeness, is a course description fro the center for complex systems and brain sciences at Florida Atlantic university:</li>

<p>Synergetics</p>
<p>An introduction to Synergetics, the theory of self-organizing structures, will be given along examples from biology, chemistry and physics. Deterministic and stochastic models will be studied, e.g. Laser equations, Navier-Stokes model, Ginzburg-Landau systems, Fokker-Planck theory, master equation.

<li>Thanks for your re-appraisal, Duracell, a better option than deleting maybe to put a fix it/contested information notice on the page until your good self and/or other editors can do a good re-write. What does apply to the usage by Bucky can be severely pruned and included in a seperate section, as it is, as you say, philosophical. We need to de-fluff and un-quasi that bit so at least readers can understand what's going there. I would venture that a true encyclopedic entry would have it's scientific <i>and</i> philosopical values equally well explained. I would need some time to review Bucky's side, as you and others would Haken's. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 20:27, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've had a chat with someone who has been working with Haken for a long time, and it seems that the situation is: synergetics is indeed the study of self-organisation in physical systems. And of course, we can use this theory to study other (related) things such as neural dynamics (which is what I'm starting out in right now). *But*, it is also the case that haken himself, as well as BF, used the concepts they devised to promote a braoder philosophical outlook, as well as specific conceptual applications that go beyond physics, and even beyond experiment. I read a nice article last year actually in which Haken took the notion of an <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordance.html" title="Affordance">affordance</a> and suggested that there is a (somewhat mysterious) "cognitive gradient" (because the organism *needs* something*), after the manner of a thermodynamic gradient, in which the brain self-organises to detect the affordance. I'm all for this stuff, I really am, I was just a bit shocked by the aparent randomness of the orginal article on here. I go along with the idea of two articles, one for the well defined physics stuff and one for broader "world view" type stuff - and I think both Haken and Buckminster-fuller would agree.<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDuracell_acd8.html" title="User:Duracell">Duracell</a> 22:26, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Certainly the existing page needs much work. Note that there seem to be two separate uses of the term "synergetics" ‚Äî perhaps that is why there is an apparent dispute.

<li>I do have a strong sense of the Nobility as if you refer to your deletion to the Maltese Nobility, there is an essence of recording history. Dr CA Gauci biobraphy does need to be cleaned up especially with those titles, but I dont agree his biography should be deleted at all.In future you should place a cleanup tag and note reasons for the clean up, then make communications with its author, and if its not to the satisfaction of Wikipedia, then proceed to deletion. I find this very unfair that you simply strike something rightaway to deletion when this biography was simply published only a week ago.

<li>Given the size of Malta and the number of Maltese nobles, having an article for every Maltese noble in Wikipedia would be like having an article for every city councilman for every medium size city in the world, and the Maltese nobles don't even have any real power. None of the accomplishments listed in any of the links provided above strike me as notable. At most, authoring a directory about Maltese nobles merits linking to his website from an article about the Maltese nobility and including his name in the description of the link. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 05:07, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> (Hopefully my last) I see three claims to notability that Dr. Gauci and his supporters are making</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>He is a Maltese noble. Problem: Simply having a noble title is not sufficient to make someone notable.</li>
<li>He is the leading expert on Maltese nobles. Problem: The number of people interested in Maltese nobles (at least in an English encyclopedia) is almost certainly below the 5000 person threshold to make that notable enough for Wikipedia. Probably would be enough to justify an article on the <a href="../../../../mt/p/a/%C4%A1/Pa%C4%A1na_prin%C4%8Bipali.html" class="extiw" title="mt:Paƒ°na_prinƒãipali">Maltese Wiktionary</a>, but there doesn't seem to be one there. (Which I readilly admit doesn't mean much since there are less than 1,000 articles on the Maltese Wiktionary, but perhaps if the gallant defenders of Maltese nobility would make an effort there would more articles there.)</li>
<li>He is a notable practioner in pain management. Problem: While I can't speak of his second textbook, I can find a great deal more information on the co-author of the first J.R. Wedley (who happens to have first billing on that textbook by the way) than I can on the Dr. Gauci. Unfortunately for Dr. Gauci, what I can find on him indicates that he is not any more notable than an average professor. Now if Dr. Gauci has developed a bold new technique in pain management that has become a standard approach in that field, that would certainly make him notable, but it's not in the article and I haven't found any indication that he has.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In short, I stand by earlier view of this article, that it is a non-notable vanity article and should therefore be deleted. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 14:43, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>I was searching the site when I came across this articly, and I must say I was quite impressed by it.</p>
<p>How come that this Lt. Colonel Dr Charles A. Gauci, a totally irrelevant person to Malta is featured here? I find it to be a very misleading article as readers who are not familiar with Malta are inevitably induced into believing that he is somehow to be considered important, whilst in fact he can be considered anonymous!</p>
<p>I don't think that this person, whoever he is [with due respect], should be mentioned here, and thus this article should be removed.</p>
<p>Maria P.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi there Maria., you failed to provide Facts to why Dr Charles Gauci shouldnt be listed here. Charles does come from a very historical and influence Maltese family. His sister (Mrs Zammit Cordina)only just received the Highest Order in Australia for her work in Malta and Charles will soon receive one of the Highest orders by the Republic of Malta for his efforts to Heraldry and Genealogy. Please be sutle and respect those who have achieved. This gentleman does deserve the honour of being listed on wikipedia. If not then we might as well delete all Maltese biographies including former Primeministers. Maria you also failed to provide a User name and also proof of membership. On that account your words are meaningless. Maltesedog has always failed in his attempt to provide FACTS other then a reduction to Dr CA Gauci's biography. .<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 07.00 17th September 2005 (EST)
<ul>
<li>That his sister may be notable, does not make him notable. That his familiy may be notable does not make him notable. That he may receive an award, may make him notable once he has received that award if the award is notable and that fact can be verified. The onus of demonstrating notability is on those claiming that he is notable as if he is notable, that fact should be easy to show. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 03:42, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Tancarville has created a bunch of troublesome articles on persons who are allegedly Maltese nobility. Against Wikipedia norms he signs the articles, and they are generally taken directly from web pages Tancarville authored. Original research, verifiability suspect, notability unclear.

<li>Thanks for your support Farmbrough., Dr Charles Gauci does have a legitimate noble title, though I do agree that his biography should be shorten. But I dont agree that it should be taken down.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Caerwine said it all. Just because you're noble is not reason for retaining an article. Tancarville, you should understand the scope of wikipedia.
<ul>
<li>Just to be clear on my point of view, I feel that <i>modern</i> nobles, who have no political powers deriving from their status are not by default notable. Charles Gauci is just such a modern noble, and as such the fact that he is modern noble does not make him notable. It doesn't preclude him being notable on other grounds, but none of the other facts presented about him are sufficient to warrant him being called sufficiently notable to have an article of his own in a world-wide English-language comprehensive encyclopedia such as Wikipedia. A brief mention that he is the sole and current holder of a particular noble title would be appropriate in an article about that title, assuming he has such a title. The text of the article makes it sound like his brothers and sons (if any) also qualify to concurrently hold those titles that he does possess. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 18:24, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with Caerwine that noble Titles are not sufficient for someone to have a biography on wikipedia, though has any one read what Dr Gauci is, other then his noble connection?? He is one of the world specialist in Pain management. Does the annoying <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">User:Maltesedog</a> understand this or is it as silly as the dog is? At the end of the day, common sense should prevail, not studipity because one has a disliking to those who were born with a silver soon. Please view Dr Gauci's biograpghy from the first two paragraphs and comment on that please. With respect Dr Gauci is connected to a title which I am also connected to <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vassallo-Paleologo_8013.html" title="Vassallo-Paleologo">Vassallo-Paleologo</a> which is extended to all descendants through the male and female lines. This does give those the right to style the title of Count or Countess. HM, Queen Paola of the Belgiums is also a descendant. Importantly, only a small faction really style themselves a title, as there are descendants all over the world and can run into the thousands of living descendants. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 14.15, 21 September 2005 (EST)

<li>I already addressed the other points raised as arguments for Dr. Gauci's notability in my comments of 14:43, 16 September 2005 and 17:51, 20 September 2005 and said why I found them lacking. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 09:54, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Very mild intimidation - ignore it. Argue solely on the merits of the case. I'm interested in knowing more about these "founts of honour" - they seem worth documenting. Furthermore if titles are legitimate enough for Burkes Peerage, they should probably be on Wikipedia. If not, then there is a good chance we should document the various "founts" of these titles, in order to clarify for users their relative obscurity and unimportance. What, for example is a Hereditary Patrician of Rome &amp; Messina? Is it a title in an disetablished nobility? Or is it a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Shield_stamp_7688.html" title="Green Shield stamp">Green Shield stamp</a> title like some <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_manor.html" title="Lord of the manor">Lord of the manor</a> titles? Or is it a bunch of people who have found what they believe is a legitmate way to confer honours on each other? It appears that there are several categories of "Maltese noble". Firstly and secondly those whose title stemmed from the Maltese state/kingdom, living either before or after the titles were disestablished. Thirdly those whose titles are from some other court. The number recognised by the state as legitmate forms for "social use" seems small enough to document exhaustively, the last group is less certain, and may not be bounded, depending on the answers to other questions psed earlier. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a></i> 15:22, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

All this 'mud-throwing' going on in here in an attempt to dirty the other side's reputation and make him seem less credible is really childish. Unfortunately, those in favour of the article seem to have picked on <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> and haven't really answered the comments of the other Wikipedians who are opposing the article. But I digress. The article, IMHO, should be deleted for all the reasons stated by <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a>. Being mentioned on a website or publishing a study doesn't make you notable; and neither having a title with no particular significance. We've got renowned specialists as well in Malta apart from Dr. Gauci. But are they notable? Of course not. Maybe if they took part in some ground-breaking research or came up with something original and innovative it would be a totally different story. Unfortunately Dr. Gauci doesn't seem to fall in any of these categories. --<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERoderick_Mallia_21d7.html" title="User:Roderick Mallia">Roderick Mallia</a> 16:09, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is getting rediculous. Both Maltesecount and Zepplin are brand new accounts with 3 edits each, to this AfD and their user pages. Wikipedia is not a democracy, so creating new accounts to flood this discussion will not affect the outcome as any competent administratior will discount both of these "votes" as per Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 20:59, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Aparently there is some foal play over here. Most interesting is the talk page of Maltesecount. "Born with a silver spoon my desires are to ensure the Maltese nobility are given a fair play in this wonderful world we live in.". The underlying meaning within this user is to prevent deletion of this article!!

<li><b>Comment</b> Keep in mind that this is no election. This is just a discussion amongst Wikipedians where anyone can voice his/her opinions in a civil way. But we have all noticed (and I hope the admins have too) that there have been three users who are supposedly 'noble' who have registered and whose first (and possibly last) posts where made in this discussion. Coincidences don't happen that easily. Also please do keep in mind that we're all equal in here so forget the titles, whistles and bells you're accustomed to. Being of noble descent doesn't entitle you to any privileges like flooding a discussion (which in a way is vandalism). --<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERoderick_Mallia_21d7.html" title="User:Roderick Mallia">Roderick Mallia</a> 07:00, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems that Roderick Mallia and Maltesedog have teamed up to fight for the deletion of Dr CA Gauci, but it doesnt seem ok for others to support it? Even if they logged on to support such works?? Wikipedia is about democracy, not socialism or communism, which you both seem to argue deletion!!!!. I really believe that Wikipedia should take a strong look at Maltesedog and Roderick Mallia as they have demostrated foul play in a constant arguing about everything other then the subject we are here to discuss, which is Charles Gauci. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 18:23, 22 September 2005 (EST)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not a democracy as Caerwine said. You have to abide to the rules. Did you read the wikipedia rules on Biographies? Nobility does not fit under the category. Btw, I have not teamed up with anyone. I just suggested deletion of the article, and 7 persons voted for deletion. This is no democracy, however if you beieve there is democracy, there is always the majority rule.

<li><b>Comment</b> Preziosi, I'm not implying that you can't use your name and surname or title; it doesn't really make a difference to me or to anyone else. I'm just saying that I find it strange that all of a sudden the Wiki is being overrun by Maltese nobility. And please stick to the facts and to what I stated instead of attacking me personally. Other people who share my opinion have stated this fact before me, and yet it seems like I'm the only one who said it. And even if there was only one person who said it, you still haven't got a right to attack him like that. Tancerville, I haven't teamed up with anybody. I'm just another Wikipedian who, while doing some interwiki work between the en.wiki and the mt.wiki (of which I'm an admin), happened to stumble on this discussion (if you can call it so) and decided to leave his two cents. I just stated an opinion, which I'm entitled to of course, as have all the people here. Why you're attacking me and Maltesedog personally when there are others who oppose the article is still beyond my comprehension. And what is all this talk about foul play? If I have committed any wrong in stating what I think, I honestly invite the admins to take actions. Tancerville, you seem to preach so much about democracy and yet you can't accept an honest opinion or point of view from anybody else if it differs from what you think. You really should get *at least* a crash-course in manners, etiquette and Wikipedia policy before posting anything else. --<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERoderick_Mallia_21d7.html" title="User:Roderick Mallia">Roderick Mallia</a> 11:51, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't know much about this type of language, but I have to say that: 1) a book was written about it; 2) it has received considerable attention in the popular/scientific media, 3) there has been quite some discussion about the language (independent of its author); 4) definitely has an established notability inside (and probably also outside) the conlanger community; 5) the language has inspired other conlangs; 6) it takes the 66th place in Langmaker's Conlang Top-100 (2005; 31th in 2003); 7) the language definitely scores also in the field of uniqueness (which according to some can also contribute to notability). It's true that the number of Google hits is not impressive, but keep in mind that the language was created in 1950, long before the Internet ever existed (Weilgart himself died in 1981). All in all, the language surely is notable. If anyone votes for deleting, it should be for the stubby character of the article, not for the non-notability of the language. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 05:58, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note this was originally located at Elvis Presley/Homosexuality. If at all important it should've been mentioned in the main article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First of all, there's a link on the page for a preview of the movie. The page actually has pictures from the trailer. The Amazon review page for <i>Lilo &amp; Stitch 2'</i> is linked because it makes reference to the trailer which is a part of the <i>Lilo &amp; Stitch 2</i> DVD. As for that crystal ball claim, that's what the future film tag on the top of the page is for. I do agree that we should set guidelines about when to add a page about a film, if at all. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 02:22, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would allow an article on a future movie as soon as there's a confirmed cast and crew, a known storyline and as soon as it started filming.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - It seems to me that making an announcement about the film on the Lilo &amp; Stitch 2 DVD, showing a trailor, and describing a plot is enough to warrant an entry about the film. Even if the project is scrubbed or delayed, the very mention of <i>the plot that might have been</i> establishes continuity as the conclusion of the Lilo &amp; Stitch series. Besides (and I know this isn't the best reason given) nearly every Lilo &amp; Stitch-related article in Wikipedia now makes a referance to this movie. The disclaimer at the top of the article makes it clear enough to any reader that the information provided is not from first-hand experiance but rather from a series of trailors and press releases until the movie debuts. -- <a href="../../../z/y/t/User%7EZytron_6150.html" title="User:Zytron">Zytron</a> 03:55, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
