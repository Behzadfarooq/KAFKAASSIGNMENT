<li><b>Merge content and Delete</b> - This is a definite <b>fork</b> article. It has been and still is an edit war magnet. In its present form it is singularly antiukrainian and prejudiced. If one wants legitimately treat the subject of Ukrainian German collaboration, than there should not be an exclusive focus on Holocaust, there should be at least an attempt to look at other forms of collaboration including non-military. In its present form it is "How Ukrainians murdered Jews". If this is an objective of the author, than there should be an article about how "Jews murdered Ukrainians". This is not a legitimate or in any way serious treatment of the subject. These events are already covered in a number of articles. It should be merged with History of Ukraine and these events could be covered and expanded there.--<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 05:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Yarillastremenog. Additionally, the fact that it is a pov or edit war magnet doesn't mean that there shouldn't be such an article. The rationale for deletion really seems to boil down to "I don't like it". Individual national collaboration with the Germans in WWII are each worthy of articles, if someone has the time and expertise. Books have been written on the subject, you know.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 12:14, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment. Because of the extent of Nazi activity in Ukraine during WWII, and the notoriety of some Ukrainian collaborators, there is enough material for an article. There <i>are</i> similar articles for state-level collaboration in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_France_a8eb.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/d/Nedic%E2%80%99s_Serbia_0746.html" title="Nedic’s Serbia">Nedic’s Serbia</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_State_of_Croatia_a8ec.html" title="Independent State of Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a>, etc, (linked from <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-German_cooperation_with_Nazis_during_World_War_II_647c.html" title="Non-German cooperation with Nazis during World War II">Non-German cooperation with Nazis during World War II</a>) and the article ahould be named consistently with these. I'd suggest <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskommissariat_Ukraine_0b51.html" title="Reichskommissariat Ukraine">Reichskommissariat Ukraine</a>, but (a) that is a large and badly organised article already, and (b) it's about the Nazi civil admin rather than Ukraininan collaboration. I incline to <s><b>weak keep</b></s>, partly because there seems to be edit warring and accusations of POV pushing, which should not be resolved by AfD. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 14:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is more than sufficient material to keep it as a separate article. The title is a neutral description of historical events; collaboration took place in Ukraine, just like elsewhere in Europe. The lack of separate articles on collaboration in different countries is a problem that must be addressed through content writing. Deleting this article is not a way of solving this problem. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 15:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> — It's a legitimate topic. But the article should spend more coverage on the failure of Germany to better exploit the mentioned national divisions, which is considered one of their key strategic errors during the invasion. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 17:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Encyclopedic topic, and worthy of its own article. The article is referenced. If it is an edit war magnet, it can be semiprotected, and disruptuve editing or 3RR violations can be dealt with appropriately other than by giving in and deleting the article. The title seems appropriate and NPOV. Lack of the other reedlink articles is perhaps a reason to create same, but hardly a reason to delete this one. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> partly per <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a>. This is a hopeless grabbag, typical of a POV fork. Parts of the content are encyclopedic, and would seem to belong in <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskommissariat_Ukraine_0b51.html" title="Reichskommissariat Ukraine">Reichskommissariat Ukraine</a>, which itself needs major work. It is actually two distinct topics, littered with POV fluff confusing the picture: Ukrainian military, police, or guard units that served the Germans, and Ukrainian local populace collaboration. The two overlap at the Holocaust. But there is nothing convincing that these are the same topic. Perhaps I would be more inclined to keep an article on participation in the Holocaust by non-German populations in the east. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 06:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge content and delete</b> There are valid issues and facts contained in this entry which have a place in Wikipedia, but not as a separate article which so specifically singles out Ukrainians, and certainly not under this inflammatory title. It should be noted that until <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam Carr</a> moved it, the title was the even more incendiary <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Nazi_Collaboration_during_WW2_2011.html" title="Ukrainian Nazi Collaboration during WW2">Ukrainian Nazi Collaboration during WW2</a>. By its very nature and uniqueness, it posits as a given fact that large numbers of non-Jewish Ukrainians behaved in such a heinous fashion towards Jewish Ukrainians that they deserve an article which would serve to direct more condemnation against them than against any other German-occupied national group. This is the very point raised by <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> in his opening comment and reiterated even more strongly by <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">User:Hillock65</a>. Reasoned examples of articles about other countries under German occupation are provided by <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a>. All of those countries had collaborators and militias which rounded up Jews and transferred them into German hands, to be sent off to death camps, but the titles of those articles are neutral—<a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_France_a8eb.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/d/Nedic%27s_Serbia_9af5.html" title="Nedic's Serbia">Nedic's Serbia</a>, etc. Squiddy notes that the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskommissariat_Ukraine_0b51.html" title="Reichskommissariat Ukraine">Reichskommissariat Ukraine</a> entry is primarily about German administration of occupied territory, not the Holocaust, but the same can be said about the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_France_a8eb.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a> entry, and yet no one has spun off a separate article about French-German collaboration in the Holocaust. French police chief of <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyon.html" title="Lyon">Lyon</a>, Rene Bousquet, who personally ordered and supervised the delivery of thousands of Jews to the Germans, doesn't even have an entry. The proposal by <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> of combining this Ukrainian entry into a broad article on the entire region's culpability makes the most sense. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomanspinner_a058.html" title="User:Romanspinner">Romanspinner</a> |<a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomanspinner_3dc6.html" title="User talk:Romanspinner">talk</a> 16:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge content and delete</b> per Humus Sapiens and Romanspinner. I don't consider this ukrainophobia, but the entry is not balanced and can better serve its informative role under an appropriate title, such as mentioned above (e.g. <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_France_a8eb.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a>, etc).</li>

<dd><a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a>, although we differ in our political views, when it comes to working on wikipedia subjects, we usually find common ground.

Further, on your User page, you have a picture of Stalin (!), allegedly in protest of "nationalist xenophobia", yet Stalin's murder count rivals Hitler's. Remember the Gulag? the artifical famine during the 1930s? the deportations to Siberia of Poles, Ukrainians, Tatars? the "dekulakization"? or the murder of Don Cossacks? So who are you to make comments that Ukrainians worship the Nazis, when you so admire Stalin?!--<a href="../../../r/i/u/User%7ERiurik_844b.html" title="User:Riurik">Riurik</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/u/User_talk%7ERiurik_f270.html" title="User talk:Riurik">(discuss)</a></sup> 17:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If my disclaimer could not be more clear...actually Stalin was the person who signed the order to reestablish the Cossack hosts in 1936 and kept them going until his death... However what are we talking about here?

<li>Like Piotrus has already stated, the fact that the article is badly written in so many ways is not a reason for deletion, but rather one for improvement. The fact that there are no corresponding articles does not "serve to direct more condemnation against them [the Ukrainians] than against any other German-occupied national group" like you claim Romanspinner. Wikipedia is not for about directing condemnation against anyone - it is for describing historical truths, for example. And the fact that a lot of Ukrainians collaborated with Nazi Germany is such a historical truth. Croatians, Lithuanians, Albanians also did that and that should be mentioned too - in the correct articles. A higher level of detail on the Ukrainian collaboration only goes to show that there are more Wikipedians interested in writing about it than about the Croatian collaboration, for example. We should encourage more people to write about those topics rather than deleting information about topics with better coverage.</li>

<li>If Wikipedia was to follow your logic, Romanspinner, the majority of all US-related articles would have to be deleted, because the country definately gets undue weight on Wikipedia currently compared with other countries with comparable sizes.

<li><b>Merge</b>, although I think most of the reasons for deletion given in this discussion are wrong. It should not be deleted because the quality is poor, or because there are no corresponding articles for other nations. Deleting the article for that reason would be completely absurd, since that would justify deleting large parts of Wikipedia. And Wikipedia articles are not designed to place blame as has been mentioned by several editors, but rather to inform. I do, however, believe that starting a History of Ukraine in World War II article first and then splitting information related to collaboration into its own sub-article once there is a lot of it would be more helpful. For one, those Ukrainian nationalists, who start to cry and add irrelevant information about resistance just because they can't bear the thought of having crimes committed by Ukrainians mentioned by themselves, would be satisfied (I hope). Further, I just believe it would be more easy to write good, informative articles about this topic if a general article about Ukraine in World War II is written first and then other articles are split off once there is enough information.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 20:04, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
