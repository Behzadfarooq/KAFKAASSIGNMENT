<p>To <i>feed the meter</i> is the act of placing more coins or purchasing more time at a municipal parking meter after one's previously purchased time has expired. It also refers to the act of initially depositing money in the meter. For example, if you place ¢25 for an additional thirty-minutes of parking, just after the previous thirty-minutes you purchased has expired. This is illegal in many municipalities, as a person could conceivable take up a parking space indefinitely as long as they deposit money in the parking meter. Usually parking meters are placed in areas where the high turnover of vehicle parking is desired, such as a crowded or busy street, or a downtown commercial area. This is why enforcing time-limited parking is desirable for municipalities, and why parking meters are usually only found in major cities or busy-downtowns. This differs from commercial or municipal parking lots, in that in those you are charged a fee for the total duration of your parking stay irregardless of how much time you stay parked. Time-limited parking will usually be denoted by a sign stating the parking meter time limit and the time period that limit is in efect.</p>

<p>Tatsu Do is an eclectic system of martial arts devised by Hanshi William Cavalier. He was born on July 31, 1940 in Rochester, New York. He began training in Chito Ryu Karate in 1957. In the spring of 1958, he moved to Florida, where he trained in Yoshin Ryu Ju Jutsu and Shito Ryu Karate under the direction of Sensei Mattson. Upon reaching black belt status, Hanshi Cavalier returned to New York State and continued to train in various styles of Karate, Ju Jutsu and Kung Fu, both in the United States and Canada. Sensei Mattson referred Hanshi Cavalier to Kyoto Durant, who at first would not accept him as a student, until he had proven himself. After three years, Master Durant finally let him join Goshin Jutsu Kyu Jujo, where he studied Karate, Ju Jutsu, Aiki Jutsu and Kobudo. He also studied the sword styles of Omori Ryu and Katori Shinto Ryu extensively. In 1976, Grand Master Durant gave Hanshi Cavalier permission to form his own style of Karate, Aiki Jutsu, Kobudo, and Iai Jutsu. Hanshi Cavalier attributes all of his knowledge to Grand Master Durant and has certificates signed by Grand Master Durant, as well as Master Hohan Soken, Master Fuse Kise, Master Daniel K. Pai, Master Glenn Premru, Hanshi Mitsuhiro Saruta. He received the highest ranking in Goshin Jutsu Kyu Jujo given to any one by Grand Master Durant, personally, that of Eighth Degree Black Belt. Today, Hanshi William R. Cavalier, Jr. is the head of the Tatsu Do Yudanshakai and President of the Traditional Martial Arts Association. He holds the rank of Tenth Degree Black Belt in Tatsu Do. He was inducted into the International Karate Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio in 1988, the Eastern U.S.A. Martial Arts Association Hall of Fame in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania in 1991, the Goshin Justu Hall of Fame in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1993 and the World Martial Arts Association Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio in 1995. There are seventeen schools in the Tatsu Do Organization throughout New York State.</p>
<p>Hanshi's primary teacher was Gerald Durant, known as Kyoto in Japan. Kyoto Durant was a Frenchman born in Japan around 1930. Given his privledged birth, he was permitted to learn the ancient arts of Karate and Aikijitsu. His teacher was Murikami, a Samurai Prince who introduced Kung Fu to Japan. Hanshi Cavalier has not only been a leader and pioneer in the martial arts, but has produced a number of students who went on to become champions and establish their own martial art styles. Hanshi's most prominent student is Shihan Carl McClafferty (<a href="http://www.auburnkarate.com/photos.html" class="external free" title="http://www.auburnkarate.com/photos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.auburnkarate.com/photos.html</a> who went on to establish an Aikijujutsu form known as Aiki Tatsu Ryu. For this accomplishment, Shihan McClafferty has been given the honor of being listed in the Goshin Jutsu Hall Of Fame.</p>
<p>Hanshi Cavalier and Shihan McClafferty are the 2 highest ranked swordsman in the world, living outside of Japan. They are ranked 2nd and 3rd in the world, surpassed only by the current Soke Murikami, the great-grandson of Kyoto Durant's teacher.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Lindheimer was a 19th Century German-born botanist who spent his working life on the American frontier. Lindheimer was born May 21, 1801 in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt%2C_Germany_cd42.html" title="Frankfurt, Germany">Frankfurt, Germany</a>. He studied law in Germany. As an adult, he left Germany after his participation in the failed Frankfurt Putsch insurrection in 1833. In 1834, Lindheimer arrived in Belleville, Illinois, whence he traveled by boat to New Orleans. Lindheimer and several companions began traveling to Texas, but were diverted to Mexico where he lived and worked for more than a year. Late in 1835 he departed Mexico as the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Revolution_278c.html" title="Texas Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> was beginning and was shipwrecked on the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> coast near Mobile. Lindheimer headed to Texas and arrived at the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jacinto_81aa.html" title="San Jacinto">San Jacinto</a> battlefield the day after the final battle of the Texas Revolution.</p>
<p>During the late 1830's and early 1840's, Lindheimer collected botanic specimens in Texas, part of this time for Dr. Asa Gray of Harvard University. In 1844 he met Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, who was making final arrangements for the settlement of a German colony in Texas, which would be known as <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Braunfels%2C_Texas_b333.html" title="New Braunfels, Texas">New Braunfels, Texas</a>. Lindheimer lived the remainder of his life in New Braunfels. In 1852, Lindheimer founded the German-language newspaper known as the Zeitung.</p>
<p>Lindheimer died in 1879. He is known as the Father of Texas Botany, with over 20 species and one genus bearing his name. His home in New Braunfels is preserved as a public museum.</p>

<p><b>Krystle Russin</b> is a young political figure in <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a>. She is known for being published in the Illinois media from a young age. She was press secretary of the <b>Illinois Teenage <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republicans.html" title="Republicans">Republicans</a></b> and makes political web sites like ChicagoMinutemanProject.com through her company, PhotoAirbrushing.com.</p>
<p>Russin was born on June 26, 1987 in Quincy, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>. She began at her junior high school writing in the newspaper. Afterward she took a chance, when it is difficult already for older freelance writers to be published, and Russin's first published piece was an interview with Missouri first lady Lori Holden in Woman Speak Magazine.</p>
<p>From there she wrote often for The State Journal-Register in Springfield and was in Voice of the People in the Chicago Tribune. Russin's work was most known on the conservative web site Illinois Leader. Since the Register, Russin has interviewed famous politicians all the way up to U.S. Senator John Kerry.</p>
<p>In 2003, Russin left Illinois Leader. Rumor said she was fired by Fran Eaton by telephone because of a personal web site but there is little proof. That summer she hosted Illinois Stories on PBS.</p>
<p>In 2004, she was featured in the Capitol Fax column in a photo with Charlie Johnston. The [column <a href="http://capitolfax.blogspot.com/2005/01/charlie-sez.html" class="external free" title="http://capitolfax.blogspot.com/2005/01/charlie-sez.html" rel="nofollow">http://capitolfax.blogspot.com/2005/01/charlie-sez.html</a>] asked to identify the "woman". From that point she became more known for her other news than her writing in Illinois politics. Russin created ReaganReview.com that year, a conservative web site that strangely mimicks the Illinois Leader style, for young people.</p>
<p>Critics have called Russin lucky. They say she does not deserve the chances she has earned because there are more talented and experienced journalists available.

<p>DMC International is a European Direct Marketing service provider, specialising in facilitating full service solutions to high-end, international orientated clientele. DMC is headquartered next to Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with an office in London, UK.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the services are divided into two main groups – Business to Business and Business to Consumer.</p>
<p>Business to Business</p>
<p>DMC International provides two key services to the B2B sector (That is, companies with data requirements about the business sector)</p>
<p>Data Acquisition Acquiring and enabling use of data about potential markets; the company always tried to differentiate itself based on the full service aspect, taking a semi-consultative approach, to provide clients with a tailored solution. Some services includes • sourcing lists – data sourcing service that is based on long term understanding of the business • managing data and advising on best uses • advising on local trends and sources • putting data together • data cleansing and enhancement • Consultancy service – how, when, and where to use the data.</p>
<p>Database Management A relatively new service, it is based on a platform developed by DMC International, the service enable large organisations to consolidate their entire database cache (including all address books and contact listings) on one centralised data base where the data is being kept under mint condition – all data entered is compared to make sure there no double entries; entries’ validity is checked against other resources (including postcode verifications), etc. The main feature of the system is one that allows extracting data out of it – at a precise aim.</p>
<p>The B2B services have always been popular with the IT and telecoms market, where DMC handles many lucrative blue-chip brands. Being a premium service it is mostly popular amongst high-end, blue chip companies.</p>
<p>Business to Consumer</p>
<p>On the B2C sector, DMC is focusing more on facilitation and arrangement services, as most companies who sell to consumer can’t justify the setup of a separate operation in a different country; DMC is providing a unique, full service facilitation options that allows a company who sells product in one country to sell them in another without setting foot there. This includes • Translation – coordinating translation of all marketing material to the required country’s language • Graphic production – adapting the graphics, making sure they appeal to people in that country • Printing, packing, etc. – by local suppliers to reduce costs • Postal – DMC has postal agreement with the major European postal authorities, enabling the mailing camping to be mailed locally, giving it a local look advantage. DMC also handles all returned mail and manages the data accordingly. • Order hotline – facilitating local order hotline; DMC is linked to various call centres with telephonists speaking all major European languages • Payment facilitation – DMC can handle all financial transaction in local means, and transfer the money to the client’s account • Warehousing – DMC can store all the products locally and ship them quickly when ordered • Legal – legal advice on how to deal with the different laws in different countries • Any anything else the company may require – DMC has a vast network of partners in all areas who can help with whatever is necessary</p>
<p>Over the years, many of DMC customers were a US based mail-order companies, who wanted to sell their products in Europe but couldn’t justify executing the logistical side on their own.</p>

<p>The Braque du Bourbonnais has been described for the first time during the Renaissance (Natural History from Aldrovandi, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris). It is a dog of rustic and healthy appearance, born with a short tail, with a coat ticked with liver or fawn. In danger of disappearing, it strived again after the First World War, with the creation of the first club, in 1925. Alas, after the second word war, the number of birth decreased, the club became less active, until it ceased to function. From 1963 to 1973, there were no dogs registered in the LOF (French studbook). In 1970, Michel COMTE decided to look for the last dog that had some Bourbonnais blood. He found only not pure breed dogs, which had some characteristics of the braque du Bourbonnais (size, shape of the head, short tail). After some more or less inbreed litter, he registered his first Bourbonnais on the LOF (under Titre Initial procedure) in 1973/1974/1975; From then, several breeders joined him, who, from those dogs, created their own lines, and the number of birth increased. In 1981, the Club du Braque du Bourbonnais was recreated, Michel Comte was its president until 2001. From this moment, the successes of the Bourbonnais in filed trial made the breed strive.</p>

<p>Dimitris Kokolakis is an adult film director, producer and occasional star who has produced hundreds of films in the "gonzo" genre of pornographic films (faux reality-based adult material), and is considered one of the foremost in the business. After making several appearances as a supporting actor in the late 1990s, including a role in an early "Buttman" gonzo video by Achilleas Keramidas, Kokolakis adopted the popular gag name Kokona as a pseudonym and began producing his own videos.</p>
<p>During 2001-02, Kokolakis was the focus of an obscenity-based court case, People of Agia Paraskevi v. Dimitris Kokolakis, et al. over the depiction of double vaginal fisting in his 1999 video Tampa Tushy Fest. Although common in European-produced porn, the act of fisting is considered taboo in the Greek industry. Kokolakis pleaded not guilty to violating Greek Penal Code Sections 311.2(a), "production, distribution or exhibition of obscene matter"; and 311.5, "advertising or promoting matter represented to be obscene," better known as "pandering obscenity." Kokolakis reached a plea agreement before trial, in which his company pleaded "no contest" to "creating a public nuisance", and paid a 1,000 Euros fine, in exchange for all other obscenity charges being dropped against the defendants. This result actually led to a short-lived increase in fisting being shown in Greek productions.</p>
<p>Since 2003, Kokolakis's life has been the focus of Showtime's popular reality program Family Business, in which he openly goes by his real name. Appearing with him are his male lover, Kostas Gousgounis , and his 60-year-old female lover Kali Feri (a.k.a. "Cousin Stevie"), both of whom help Dimitris run the eponymous "family business" of the series — the Dimitris Kokolakis porn "empire". During production of Family Business, Kokolakis made reference to the court case, and used this as a springboard to mount a successful Internet-based telethon to raise money for freedom of speech causes. The series also focuses on his efforts as a single father of his son Charilaos, a child he fathered by a porn actress . The series is now approaching its fourth season which started April 21, 2006.</p>
<p>Kokolakis's videos are known for featuring actresses with whom, in real life, he has become emotionally involved. Most notably, these include</p>
<ul>
<li>Achileas, who at one point was engaged to marry Glasser,</li>
<li>Kali Ferri, the mother of his child,</li>
<li>Stami,</li>
<li>and most recently, Mike F whose relationship with Kokolakis blossomed before the Family Business cameras.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kokolakis confirmed via his website's message board in February 2006 that he and Mike F have parted ways and that he is not currently in a serious romantic relationship.</p>
<p>Kokolakis grew up in Agia Paraskevi where he currently resides. His mother said in Family Business that she hoped for her son to find a female wife.</p>

<p>ANTHONY was born at Sallent, Spain, in 1807. He was a missionary in Catalonia and the Canary Islands for ten years, giving missions and retreats. His zeal inspired other priests to join in the same work. In 1849, he founded the Congregation of Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The institute is known by his name as "the Claretians."</p>
<p>Father Claret was appointed Archbishop of Santiago in Cuba. His work for the church was cut short by men who tried to take his life. Here he founded the Teaching Sisters of Mary Immaculate.</p>
<p>At the request of Pope Pius IX, he returned to Spain and devoted himself to missionary work and the spreading of good literature. In the course of his life he is said to have preached ten thousand sermons and to have published two hundred books or pamphlets for both priests and lay people. He spread devotion to the Blessed Sacrament and the Immaculate Heart of Mary by his preaching and writings. God rewarded Anthony with the gift of propecy and miracles.</p>
<p>St. Anthony died in a Cistercian monastery in France on October 24, 1870. He was canonized by Pope Pius XII.</p>

<p>Lloyd Green - Biographic Information</p>
<p>Lloyd Lamar Green was born on October 4, 1937, in Leaf, Mississippi and began taking music lessons on the Hawaiian Guitar at the age of 7 under teacher Alma McCoy. He completed his musical training at the age of 14, but already started playing professionally when he was ten years old. He graduated from Murphy High School in Mobile in 1955 and attended the University of Southern Mississippi from 1955 to 1957.</p>
<p>He first arrived in Nashville in January of 1957 and soon found steady work as a road musician with Faron Young. He stayed with Young's band for two years and then free-lanced with well-known artists like Ferlin Husky, Hawkshaw Hawkins and Tex Ritter, in addition to playing with numerous artists (incl. Jim Reeves) on the famous Grand Ole Opry. During those months, he appeared on one George Jones side, "Too Much Water Under The Bridge" (1957) which was the only regular studio recording session he played before he started working permanently as a studio musician in April of 1964.</p>
<p>In 1964, he began working as executive assistant to Roy Drusky at the newly opened SESAC office (one of the three music licensing firms).</p>
<p>He achieved a major breakthrough in his career with the brilliantly innovative steel guitar styling on Warner Mack's No. 1 hit "The Bridge Washed Out" in 1965.</p>
<p>From that time on, Lloyd became the number one session player in the Nashville studios, appearing on records of virtually every major country artist of the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's, like Charley Pride, Faron Young, Gene Watson, Don Williams, Tammy Wynette, Connie Smith, Crystal Gayle, Bobby Bare, Johnny Paycheck, Lynn Anderson, Mel Tillis, George Jones, Hank Snow, Roy Drusky, Ronnie Milsap, Ricky Skaggs and numerous others. His playing is featured on none less than 116 No. 1 Country Hits, from Del Reeves' "Girl On The Billboard" in 1965 to Alan Jackson's "Remember When" in 2004.</p>
<p>Lloyd Green also worked with pop and Jazz artists, including J.J. Cale, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Henry Mancini and Earl Klugh, as well as with the Byrds on their seminal "Sweetheart Of The Rodeo" album in 1969. He also recorded a total of 17 instrumental albums with some songs hitting the charts, including instrumental versions of the pop tunes "I Can See Clearly Now" and "Here Comes The Sun" in the early 1970's.</p>
<p>His enormous impact on the Nashville music business was honored several times: He received the "Most Promising Instrumentalist" award by Record World and Cashbox in 1967, was one of the top five finalists in the Country Music Association's "Instrumentalist Of The Year" award in 1973 and 1974 and received the "Most Valuable Player" award by the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences (N.A.R.A.S) in 1978 and 1979. He was elected into the "Steel Guitar Hall of Fame" in St. Louis, Missouri in 1988.</p>
<p>In the late 1980's, before an ear infection forced him into semi-retirement, Lloyd Green did session work with artists like Ricky Skaggs, Lorrie Morgan, the Whites and Nancy Griffith, and performed occasional concerts and Steel Guitar Shows around the country.</p>
<p>In the last three years, Lloyd made a phenomenal musical comeback which was not only enthusiastically acclaimed by the Steel Guitar community but also very welcome by those audiences who appreciate the individual style and musical inventiveness in comparison to the technically perfect but "uniform" sounds mostly coming out of the Nashville recording studios these days.</p>
<p>The comeback included appearances at the Grand Ole Opry as well as the production of an instrumntal video, together with Grand Ole Opry staff player Tommy White ("An Evening Of E-9th") and his fantastic new CD album "Lloyd Green - Revisited" in 2003. He also returned to session work in the studio, playing for today's top stars like Alan Jackson and Steve Wariner. Especially his hauntingly beautiful playing on Alan Jackson's "Remember When" brought back memories of the days when the personal creativity and style of a musician made the difference between a record soon to be forgotten and one that is likely to become a classic.</p>
<p>On February 18, 2006, Lloyd was the first member of the famous Nashville "A Team" of studio musicians and session players, to be featured in a new series of events, hosted by the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee. The presentation featured Lloyd, talking about his amazing career as well as providing examples of his magic playing.</p>
<p>Lloyd Green has played Steel Guitar and Dobro on more than 10,000 recording sessions. This means, on an average of three to four songs per session, he can be heard on more than 30,000 songs, thus making him one of the most recorded steel guitarist in the history of the instrument.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-05_b591.html" title="Edit section: Bodytalk system">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bodytalk system</span></h2>
<p>Australian Chiropractor and Acupuncturist, Dr. John Veltheim, developed the BodyTalk System in 1995. Since then it has been taught to over a thousand practitioners worldwide. Graduates include medical doctors and specialists, psychologists, chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, physical therapists, osteopaths, nurses, licensed massage therapists, and laypeople.</p>
<p>The basic premises underlying The BodyTalk System constitute a new paradigm for synchronizing and balancing the bodymind that can be implemented in conjunction with any health care system. The body is a very complex ecosystem involving a delicate balance between physiological biochemical functions, emotional and mental interactions, environmental influences, hereditary and genetic restrictions, and the need to synchronize all these factors into a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>Until now the majority of health care systems have tended to take a Cartesian approach and have focused on isolated parts of the bodymind equation. The whole picture, incorporating all the variables, has been placed in the 'too hard’ basket. This is because the human mind, even with the help of modern science and equipment, is incapable of thinking on such a comprehensive scale.</p>
<p>The BodyTalk System recognizes that within each and every one of us there lies the innate knowing of who we are and what makes us tick. This innate wisdom carries the answer to our health care dilemma. This is addressed in the following way:</p>
<p>1. The BodyTalk System facilitates communication with the innate wisdom of the body by using neuromuscular biofeedback. This feedback provides the practitioner with a 'yes'or 'no'answer to any question that is asked of the body. The innate wisdom thus provides BodyTalkers accurate guidelines with regard to the bodymind's requirements for optimum health.</p>
<p>2. By following a comprehensive protocol of questions, the BodyTalk practitioner can establish exactly what balancing the body needs in order to harmonize bodymind function. This involves finding out which organs, endocrines, or body parts need to be connected to heal communication between them at the physiological, biochemical, circulatory, nervous, emotional, and/or energy levels.</p>
<p>3. The patient and/or practitioner touch the parts that need repair and the practitioner then uses his/her fingers to gently tap the head of the patient in order to focus the brain toward repair. BodyTalk 'tapping’ is based on an old Hatha Yoga technique and experiments with biofeedback apparatus show that when this tapping occurs while specific parts are being touched there is a major increase in brain activity in relation to those parts.</p>
<p>4. The practitioner then lightly taps the chest to store the changes in the heart energy complex, which ensures that the new balance is held in deep memory and is, therefore, lasting.</p>
<p>Clinical results have shown that once the communications systems of the body have been reestablished and the bodymind complex synchronized, the body is capable of healing itself at a deep and lasting level.</p>
<p>This is something that modern health care systems have tended to forget, or ignore. The trend has been to want to play "God" and intervene in the body’s natural processes even though it is clear that allopathic health care training provides only a glimpse into the complex interactions of the bodymind. Of course, there are times that natural healing is limited. The typical emergency such as a car accident, where the body is in crisis, attests to the need of skilled intervention in the form of modern medicine. Nevertheless, BodyTalk practitioners are seeing the incredible healing power of a 'balanced' body in the daily results obtained in practice. The functions of every part of the body and mind are improved. This means that the immune system will start to eliminate chronic and acute viruses, bacteria, parasites, and toxins. Reestablishing of the mind/body balance reduces allergies, emotional and psychological disorders. It also improves posture and coordination, digestion and elimination, brain functions, learning disorders, and states of distorted consciousness in the form of negative belief systems and attitudes.</p>
<p>The BodyTalk System does not rely upon diagnosis and the BodyTalk practitioner does not prescribe, use invasive techniques, or do anything that can cause harm to the body. This makes it one of the rare health care systems that can be classified as totally safe and truly holistic in its approach to reestablishing the optimum health of the patient. It is complementary to all other health care systems and can be used as a stand-alone system or be integrated into any other health care practice.</p>
<p>Bodytalk is a combination of the wisdom of advanced yoga and advaitic philosophy, the insights of modern physics and mathematics, the energy dynamics of acupuncture, the clinical findings of Applied Kinesiology, and western medical expertise. It is an astonishingly simple and effective form of therapy that allows the body's energy systems to be re-synchronized so that they can operate as nature intended. Each system, cell and atom is in constant communication with each other at all times. Through exposure to the stresses of day-to-day life, these lines of communication become compromised, which then leads to a decline in physical, emotional and/or mental health. Reconnecting these lines of communication then enables the body's mechanisms to function at optimal levels, thus preventing disease and rapidly accelerating the healing process. BodyTalk can be used as a stand-alone system to treat many health problems, or seamlessly integrated into any health care system to increase its effectiveness and promote faster healing.</p>
<p>BodyTalk's major assets are its simplicity, safety, and the speed of its results. It is non-invasive, objective in application, and works effectively on humans and animals alike. Even if a BodyTalk technique is performed incorrectly, it simply means that there will be no result or change. It will not make things worse.</p>
<p>The body has built-in mechanisms to initiate the healing process. If we cut ourselves, the body immediately sets up a process to start healing the wound. This occurs at several levels - physical, emotional, and mental. Although this is obvious to every one of us, most people do not fully realize just how wonderful the human healing mechanism actually is.</p>
<p>The problem facing the body is in the way our lifestyles interfere with the natural processes of the body. Today, most people in society are routinely exposed to the following:</p>
<p>• The physical stresses of day to day life including physical injuries.</p>
<p>• Emotional traumas and issues that arise from time to time (e.g. extreme anger, fear, worry, sadness, grief, guilt or jealousy that we experience but cannot process and release effectively).</p>
<p>• Chemical substances contained in the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air that we breathe.</p>
<p>• Exposure to artificial energy fields that exist within our society and the electronic devices that we use on a daily basis (e.g., power plants, overhead electrical wires, phones and cell phones, pagers, computers, TVs, VCRs, stereo equipment, microwave ovens, lights, clock radios, other electrical appliances).</p>
<p>These factors compromise the communication networks or energy circuits of the body. It is critical that these systems be perfectly balanced for the body to effectively coordinate the billions of synchronized activities per second that are necessary to maintain optimum health. The body only fails in its job because its communication systems have been severely compromised through the external stresses of life. In essence, the energy circuits are "blown" in a similar manner to electrical circuits in our house that "blow" when they are overloaded. By re-establishing good communication between the various parts of the body, they once again are able to "talk" to each other. The body is then capable of healing itself very rapidly and effectively.</p>
<p>The BodyTalk system works by first identifying the weak energy circuits that exist within the body. The practitioner relies on the innate wisdom of the body to locate the energy circuits that need repair by using a form of biofeedback, which is a subtle muscle testing technique.</p>
<p>For every malfunctioning energy circuit that is found, the practitioner or client contacts the corresponding "points" with their hands. The practitioner then lightly taps the client on the top of the head, which stimulates the brain centers and causes the brain to re-evaluate the state of the body's health. The result is that the general energy balance of the body is greatly improved.</p>
<p>The practitioner then taps the client on the sternum to "announce" the corrected energy flows to the rest of the body. This is beneficial because the heart is responsible for communicating the state of the body's health to the rest of the body. Stimulating the heart by tapping the sternum forces the heart to store the corrected energy patterns in the body's cellular memory. This means that the body will remember these changes after the treatment.</p>
<p>The BodyTalk treatment protocol is very straightforward and does not require any diagnosis. The practitioner relies on the guidance of innate widom, through muscle testing, to not only locate the weakened lines of communication in the body but also to find the proper order in which they are to be addressed. Just as the body heals a wound with a particular sequencing of chemical reactions, the body wants to address all healing in a certain order. This priority is paramount in the balancing process to initiate the body's ability to heal itself. The healing process usually follows rather quickly.</p>
<p>BodyTalk has proven to be very effective in addressing many common diseases such as dyslexia, chronic viruses and infections, allergies, poor immune system functioning, sugar metabolism disorders, arthritis and general musculo-skeletal disorders, emotional and psychological problems, and many others. Current areas addressed by the BodyTalk system are as follows:</p>
<p>• Overall breathing patterns, left/right brain co-ordination, energy blockages associated with birthplace, energy imbalances within the brain cortices, general and localized hydration, and health problems associated with internal and external scarring.</p>
<p>• Specific balancing of the twelve major body organs, eight endocrine systems, and other body parts.</p>
<p>• Correction of genetically and/or environmentally influenced cell disorders.</p>
<p>• Clearing the body of viruses, infections, parasites, food intolerances, environmental allergies, and accumulated toxins.</p>
<p>• Balancing the 36 surface energy points that often impact a person's energy level, mood, overall structural integrity, muscle tension, and digestive system. These surface energy imbalances are also a cause pain in specific parts of the body.</p>
<p>• Clearing past and present emotional blockages including specific phobias and fears. These sessions have been very effective in correcting a number of psychological disorders.</p>
<p>• Cleansing the lymphatic system including all the body lymph glands and the lymph ducts.</p>
<p>• Addressing energy blockages associated with the nervous and circulatory systems.</p>
<p>• Balancing the various energy systems within the body including the traditional acupuncture meridians, the chakras, and general bioenergetic energy flow. Blood sugar balancing also comes under this category.</p>
<p>• Releasing parts of the musculo-skeletal system that may be "locked". This includes the spine, pubic bone, cranium, sacrum, ribs, joints and muscles.</p>
<p>• Restoring energy imbalances between the patient and certain aspects of the environment.</p>
<p>Any of the above mentioned areas can have a profound impact on the overall health of the body. Over the last few years, BodyTalk has been used to successfully address a wide range of psychological and physiological diseases. In addition, BodyTalk's application within other health care modalities is the subject of much research at this time. Because the basic principles of BodyTalk are scientifically sound and far reaching in nature, we expect BodyTalk's scope to be expanded considerably in the future.</p>

<p>The island of Vaipin in Cochin (Kochi) was the last place where a sort of creole Portuguese was spoken till the middle of the twentieth century by elders of the Anglo-Indian community who are descended from the Portuguese. The creole was a mixture of 16 century Portuguese and Malayalam. The last person who knew this unique language was Fracisco Paynter, himself of Portuguese-British descent, who died in 2002. However, he has left behind a collection of Creole songs.There are many elders in the island who still recollect their parents conversing in Portuguese creole and some of them still sing the creole songs, some of which are devotional.</p>

<p>Free At The Dee is a bi-annual music event organised by Aberdeen based radio station, Northsound. It's origins date back to 1997 when the stations first such event, "Free At The Quay" was staged and broadcast by Northsound 1 to coincide with the visit by the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race to Aberdeen. The headline acts were Norths And South, Frankie Oliver and Kavana. A similar event was held the following year, 1998. This time it was held indoors at Aberdeen's Amadeus nightclub and performing on stage were Clock and Billie Piper.</p>
<p>The next Northsound concert in this style was held at the beach front, Aberdeen - again staged by Northsound One - and featured Mikey from Boyzone, Jamelia, Louise and Heather Small.</p>
<p>The event took a major step forward by the time of the 2001 show. It relocated to Aberdeen's Duthie Park, it was organised and broadcast by both Northsound One and Northsound Two in associatiation with Aberdeen City Council, and the scale of the event dwarfed previous years' shows. Performing this time were Gareth Gates, Blazing Squad and Darius amongst others.</p>
<p>Free At The Dee shows have subsequntly been staged at Duthie Park Aberdeen in 2003 and 2005.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjabi_Prison_Match_e07d.html" title="Punjabi Prison Match">Punjabi Prison Match</a> is a wrestling match in which the wrestling ring is surrounded by a steel cage wrapped with barbed wire (typically at the top, as most prisons do). In some Punjabi Prison Matches, barbed wire is layed on the outside of the ring as well, in order to keep the participants in the ring to contest the match. The steel cage will be slightly different than the typical steel cage used in pro-wrestling, but will be made of the same material. There will also be 'weapons' in the ring for the paticipants to use. The rules or ways to win are not yet confirmed, but it is assumed that the match will end only by pinfall or submission.</p>

<p>The house is named after its first owners, Thomas and Mary Harmony. Thomas died in battle of Stones River during the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">Civil War</a>. Mary, along with her daughter Noel and a groundskeeper were taken hostage by a group of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union.html" title="Union">Union</a> defectors in the Harmony House. The groundskeeper was beheaded in front of Mary and her daughter. Mary was raped and tortured for several days before the defectors decided abandon and burn the house. Mary died due to smoke inhalation but Noel escaped. Only a portion of the house was destroyed. Mary’s sister then became Noel’s guardian and restored the house. This set off a chain of events surrounding this house and the family that owned it throughout the years. According to local legend, the house was the sight for several grisly murders and unexplained deaths. The House itself has been speculated as being the culprit for the disappearance of several local children in the late <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800s.html" title="1800s">1800s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900s.html" title="1900s">1900s</a>. The house is located approximately ten miles from any civilization. It cannot be viewed from any highway or local roadway. The house has had many owners and has been passed from generation to generation. In each generation, one family member died either inside the house or on the grounds. Because of the location and the culture of the people in the area, none of the deaths were reported to any media. However, family and friends of the owners know the truth about the house and it was documented in 1934 by Alton Stephenson, the homeowner at that time. The document was discovered in 1982 by Stephenson’s descendent John Henry Franklin. Franklin attempted to contact local authorities but his accounts were dismissed as a mental illness. Since 1982 the house has been abandoned but still draws locals to it for ghost hunts.</p>

<p>Perhaps because the city has only one working comedy club within the city limits, or because of the influence of Chicago's improv, sketch and theater traditions, the city has a thriving alternative stand-up scene on the North Side of the city, much like that of the New York alternative scene in its Lower East Side. The longest-running of Chicago's alternative showcases has been "The Elevated", which was started by Cayne Collier in 1996. Previous successes have included "The Midnight Bible School", which was held at Second City's e.t.c Stage. Currently, the most popular of the alternative showcases have been "The Lincoln Lodge", which is held in the back of the Lincoln Restaurant and "Chicago Underground Comedy", which is held at indie rock club, Gunther Murphy's. Much of humor is a result of the fusion of strait stand-up with character-based performances, usually found in sketch comedy. Other blurring of the sketch and stand-up lines can be seen at shows like "Don't Spit the Water" and "A Demon Who Never Appeared!", which are held at the Playground Theater, as well as Online digital formats like those found on Blerds.com.</p>

<p>The Give It A Name Festival orginaly took place at the London Earls Court in London. The idea of the festival was to have the best of US and UK rock bands all play together at the same venue. More recently the Give It Name '06 Festival, which took place over the 29th and 30th of April, expanded to cover Manchester (at the Manchetser Evening News Arena) with <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lostprophets.html" title="Lostprophets">Lostprophets</a> headlining the Saturday Manchester Show and Sunday London Show, whilst <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Chemical_Romance_545a.html" title="My Chemical Romance">My Chemical Romance</a> headlined the Saturday London Show and the Sunday Manchester Show. Performing alongside Lostprophets were <a href="../../../t/a/k/Taking_Back_Sunday_066d.html" title="Taking Back Sunday">Taking Back Sunday</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angels_%26_Airwaves_1877.html" title="Angels &amp; Airwaves">Angels &amp; Airwaves</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldfinger_%28band%29.html" title="Goldfinger (band)">Goldfinger</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Are_Scientists_61d4.html" title="We Are Scientists">We Are Scientists</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/d/Aiden.html" title="Aiden">Aiden</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silverstein.html" title="Silverstein">Silverstein</a>.

<p><b>The Good News Magazine</b> is a bimonthy magazine published by the United Church of God (headquartered out of Cincinnati, Ohio).</p>
<p>The Good News Magazine content focuses primarily on world news, social trends, biblical doctrine, archaeology, science, and Christian living. "A Magazine of Understanding" is the subtitle of the magazine.</p>
<p>The authors of the magazine are primarily ordained ministers of the United Church of God. Occasionally the magazine will include an interview with an expert on a topic that is not a supporter of the United Church of God. The managing editor of the magazine is Scott Ashley.</p>
<p><b>The Good News Magazine</b> is unique because it challenges many doctrines and beliefs of mainstream Christianity and warns of the moral and political degneration of the English speaking peoples which, the magazine proclaims, will result in its destruction by a coming European superpower. The major mission of the magazine is to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom of God--a world ruling government that Jesus Christ will establish after his return to earth. Many of the articles in the magazine in some way point the reader to this "millenial" rule of Jesus Christ and immortal spirit-born Christians on the earth. The magazine proclaims that at that time all the worlds problems will be solved.</p>
<p><b>The Good News Magazine</b> is written and printed in the tradition of the old <b>Plain Truth Magazine</b> that was published by the Worldwide Church of God under the late Herbert W. Armstrong. Shortly after Herbert Armstrong died, the Worldwide Church of God changed many of the doctrines he published in the Plain Truth for years. The focus of the magazine was taken off of world news analysis, a coming kingdom of God, and a challenge of the traditional beliefs of mainstream Christianity to a more traditional Christian approach. Today the Plain Truth publishes articles that teach against the former doctrines and themes that it used to proclaim to over 6 million people monthly during the era of Herbert Armstrong. The United Church of God was formed by ministers who disagreed with the doctrinal and empahsis changes of the Worldwide Church of God and wanted to continue to publish the themes and doctrines that were proclaimed in the Plain Truth under Herbert Armstrong. The United Church of God was founded in the spring of 1995 and released its innaugeral edition of the Good News Magazine in October of 1995. It has been published bimonthly ever since.</p>
<p>Today the Good News has a worldwide circulation of over 400,000 and is advertised through direct mail advertisements, supermarket brochures, internet advertisements, and the radio and television program <b>Beyond Today</b>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-05_b591.html" title="Edit section: Transfersome">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfersome.html" title="Transfersome">Transfersome</a></span></h2>
<p>A Transfersome (a registered trademark of IDEA AG) is an at least bi-component, most often vesicular, aggregate. The main functional characteristic of the aggregate is the extreme flexibility and permeability of its bilayer-like membrane coating. Its basis is the interdependency of local membrane shape and composition, which makes the bilayer self-regulating and self-optimising. The bilayer is thus capable of stress adaptation, via local and reversible bilayer component demixing. All this makes a Transfersome into a nano-robotic device suitable for non-invasive and targeted drug delivery, for example across intact skin.</p>
<p>The unusual ease of Transfersome deformation enables the vesicle to trespass even minute openings in a semi-permeable barrier, such as the skin, with diameter much smaller than the average vesicle size. Another beneficial consequence of high bilayer flexibility is the increased Transfersome affinity to bind and retain water.</p>
<p>Ultradeformable Transfersome vesicles put in a dry environment therefore seek to find water richer region. This forces Transfersomes applied on open skin to penetrate the skin barrier in a search for adequate hydration. The resulting vesicle migration is a consequence of continuous bilayer adaptation and deformation, but must not compromise unacceptably either the vesicle integrity or the protective skin barrier properties in real-life applications.</p>
<p>A basic Transfersome is composed of one natural amphiphat (such as phosphatidylcholine) that tends to self-aggregate into vesicles. The latter are then supplemented by at least one bilayer softener (e.g. a biocompatible surfactant). The vesicle-like Transfersome thus normally possesses an aqueous core surrounded by a complex, very fluid and adaptable lipid bilayer. In its basic organization broadly similar to a simple lipid vesicle (so-called liposome), a Transfersome differs from the latter by its more flexible and permeable, "softened" bilayer membrane. A Transfersome vesicle can consequently change shape readily and easily by adjusting relative concentration of its two components in the bilayer to the local stress experienced by the complex bilayer. This can be observed indirectly by studying stress- or deformation-dependent vesicle bilayer elasticity or permeability. In a single experiment, the same goal can be achieved by determining the pressure dependency of Transfersome suspension-flux through a nano-porous filter (with the pores considerably smaller than the average vesicle size). The rate of resulting transport must grow with driving force (head pressure) non-linearly (often sigmoidally) until maximum flow is reached. For an ideal Transfersome, experiencing no friction in pores, the maximum flow is equivalent to the flux of the suspending liquid measured with a similar trans-filter pressure, and the minimum pressure required to attain good transport is a measure of bilayer flexibility. The observed functional dependency of suspension flux vs. pressure can therefore be used to derive bilayer elasticity / flexibility as well as permeability, based on theoretical description of the underlying enforced transport, viewed as an activated transport process.</p>

<p>International Circuit is an online travel guide that provides travelers with current, reliable, and comprehensive travel information along with a number of interactive features including consumer generated hotel/restaurant reviews, postcards, and a hotel booking engine. The website is a hybrid of popular competitor models offering both professional travel reviews and user generated reviews.</p>
<p>International Circuit was founded by Larry Gurreri after returning from a backpacking trip through Europe in 2003. Mr. Gurreri recognized the importance of having with current, reliable, and comprehensive information readily available, and the lack there of. The original website, as well as the first 7 destination guides, were created by Larry Gurreri out of his 1-bedroom apartment in Phoenix, Arizona. Today, the company operates out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As of July 2006, International Circuit had amassed 80 destination guides and over 60,000 pages of content. Founder, Larry Gurreri, anticipates that International Circuit will soon be one of the most highly visible travel websites on the net; therefore, challenging some of the largest internet companies in the world for market dominance.</p>

<p>The villagers of Skopin in the Ryazan region were renowned for their pottery as early as the 12th century. The pottery produced in the village was called “sinyushka” due to the bluish tint the clay took on during the firing process. The mainstay of the village potters was utilitarian ware such as bowls, pots and platters. However, according to Ovsyannikov, a neighborly rivalry developed between the potters in Skopin with each trying to outdo the other in the cleverness of their design or the splendor of the piece, leading to fanciful sculptures of lions and other beasts as well as an entire roof of a cottage being tiled with individual scenes. Skopin style pottery sculpture is taught in art schools across Russia. Although the fired clay is more red than blue today, Skopin continues to be a center for pottery production both in the ceramic factory (est. 1640) and in the individual studios of potters, such as Tanya Loshishina.</p>

<p>Oliver Partridge was born Hadley, MA, June 13 or 15, 1712.</p>
<p>He graduated from Yale in 1730, subsequently studied law, and became a successful practitioner at Hatfield, MA.</p>
<p>He was High Sheriff of Hampshire County, MA.</p>
<p>He was a delegate to the congress that was called by the British government and met in Albany, New York, in June, 1754.</p>
<p>In 1765 Oliver Partridge was one of the delegates from nine of the 13 colonies who met in response to the levying of the Stamp Act by King George III. He was a delegate from Massachusetts. The others were James Otis and Timothy Ruggles [about both of whom there are articles in Wikipedia]. Drawn together for the first time in organized opposition to British policy, the attendees adopted a Declaration of Rights and Grievances and wrote letters or petitions to the King and both houses of Parliament. The Stamp Act Congress is viewed by some as the first American action in or as a precursor of the American Revolution. They claimed entitlement to the same rights as the residents of Britain and protested the colonies' "taxation without representation." As a member of the Stamp Act Congress, Oliver Partidge voted in favor of the actions of the body. It met in New York City’s Old City Hall, a building later called Federal Hall.</p>
<p>From 1769 to 1774 Oliver Partridge was judge of common pleas for Hampshire County.</p>
<p>When hostilities with the mother country were impending, he was at first opposed to revolution, but soon embraced the cause, becoming a colonel commanding a division against the British and Hessian troops during the 1777 Battle of Ticonderoga in the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>Oliver Partridge died July 21, 1792.</p>
