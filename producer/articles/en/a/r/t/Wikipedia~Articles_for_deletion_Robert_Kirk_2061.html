<dd>'<b>Commment</b> I don't know about his publications, but emeritus is neither a notable award or honor.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually at many universities there are two status, emiritus or retired, the first is an honor with benefits, the latter is not. I know of many professors that never had the benefits of emeritus status, and a few that do. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 16:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that may be so, but it doesn't change the fact that simply being emeritus is not especially notable.

With a directed Google search to weed out similarly named professors of economics and art, there are only 624 hits, and even there a lot of them are for other people; I don't get a sense here that he's all that much of a pioneer as all of that.

The first criterion is that they are a significant expert. Where is that backed up? In the article you prove that he published and was reviewed by other academics in academic journals.

<p><b>Comment</b> For the benfit of contributors from the US who may not be aware, in the UK the title 'professor' is far more important than an American professor which seems to be synonymous with any university teacher (we would call that a lecturer). A UK professor is usually equivalent to head of a university department (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html#Most_other_English-speaking_countries" title="Professor">Professor#Most other English-speaking countries</a>) So, being a professor is notable, and the award of emeritus, granted by fellows, is more so. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 13:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh, we're aware of it. Nothing in <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> accords automatic notability to department chairs, either; it just isn't notable in of itself. Really, the issue at stake here is simple: is he widely regarded as a significant expert in his field? If so, it should be easy to provide sources backing that up. If sources attesting to his notability <i>don't</i> exist, then it seems he isn't all that widely regarded after all. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:26, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> probably a borderline case but I want to note that being an emeritus professor or having written a bunch of reviews (!) is clearly not sufficient. The key question, which supporters have failed to address, is whether there exist sufficient third-party coverage of his work to built an article in line with <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../j/s/t/Jstor.html" title="Jstor">Jstor</a> shows that Kirk has written a number of journal articles, not just reviews. He has also written a few books, and it is a priori extremely unlikely that somebody publishing books with publishers such as <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarendon_Press_9e4f.html" title="Clarendon Press">Clarendon Press</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/u/Routledge.html" title="Routledge">Routledge</a>, as Robert Kirk has done, will <i>not</i> be reviewed in the leading journals. Jstor also finds some reviews:
<ul>
<li>Kirk's <i>Raw feeling: a philosophical account of the essence of consciousness</i>, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994), was reviewed by Earl Conee in <i><a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_%28journal%29.html" title="Mind (journal)">Mind</a></i>, New Series, Vol. 104, No. 415 (Jul., 1995), pp. 645-650, by Joseph Levine in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Philosophical_Review_2aa0.html" title="The Philosophical Review">The Philosophical Review</a></i> Vol. 105, No. 1 (Jan., 1996), pp. 94-97, by Michael Tye in <i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i>, Vol. 57, No. 4 (Dec., 1997), pp. 968-971, by Lynn Stephens in <i>The Philosophical Quarterly</i>, Vol. 46, No. 184 (Jul., 1996), pp. 417-421.</li>
<li>Kirk's <i>Relativism and reality: a contemporary introduction</i> (London: Routledge, 1999), was reviewed by John Greco in <i>The Philosophical Quarterly</i>, Vol. 50, No. 201 (Oct., 2000), pp. 552-553, and by Gerald Doppelt in <i>The Philosophical Review</i>, Vol. 111, No. 1 (Jan., 2002), pp. 142-147.</li>
