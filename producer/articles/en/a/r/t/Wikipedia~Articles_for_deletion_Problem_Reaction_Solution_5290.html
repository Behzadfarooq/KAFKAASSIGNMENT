<dd>You mean its not notable since its used " almost exclusively in the context of cranky 9/11 conspiracy theories"? So, does that mean that <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fard.html" title="Fard">Fard</a> is also non-notable since it is used exclusivly by Muslims?

<li>Well, there are a <i>lot</i> more Muslims than 9/11 conspiracy theorists. That's why an Islamic concept such as <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fard.html" title="Fard">Fard</a> can be of significance to a great number of people, even non-Muslims. Problem Reaction Solution, on the other hand, seems to be a neologism used only within a small circle of persons with no discernible impact on the broader discourse (on 9/11 or anything else). See <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> (or maybe, considering the seriousness of all this, rather <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>&#160;:-).

<dd>It being <b>prominently</b> used among the 9/11 truth movment makes it notable, it is not a neologism, it was used surely more than 20 times in 1999 by <b><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">David Icke</a> when in <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a></b> Only that in it self makes it notable. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 14:50, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, even then it warrants at the most a well-sourced <i>brief</i> mention in the main 9-11 conspiracy theories article, and not its own article. Even so, what you call the "9-11 truth movement" is objectively the viewpoint of a small fringe minority (and for most others it's somewhere between paranoid silliness and downright offensive). All those articles of yours might be seen as being designed to give this fringe more weight than they are due - or, in other words, as POV-pushing.

<li><s><b>Reluctant keep.</b></s> <b>Striver's often divisive and inflammatory, and openly admits that his views are waaay outside the norm. I think it's because of these things that this article is getting deep-sixed. This term has been used in news sources, and is in use all over the web. Yes, often in tinfoil-hat-style conspiracy diatribes. But it's in use. (Striver's also right about <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_worship.html" title="Ass worship">ass worship</a> -- wtf is that about?) This also seems a lot like an extension of the "Rally 'Round the Flag" effect, which seems to be the academically accepted version of this same concept (i.e., no shady government conspiracies, lizard men, Illuminati, space Nazis, etc.). If that article had been written, I'd suggest merging this content over there. In fact, as it stands, if this article survives (doesn't look promising), I'll probably move it to Rally 'round the flag and rewrite it... muahhahhahahahaha. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 18:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</b> Ehh, nevermind.

Guys, you are confusing notability and verifaiability with.... i dont know...

<ul>
<li>Still <i>delete</i> as one-liner neologism dicdef followed by a couple of pages of non-encyclopedic 9/11 conspiracy theory cruft and a laundry list of individual peoples' opinions (now complete with <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf</a>!). <i>An article that professes to talk about something, but in reality is an opinion pushing piece about something totally different.</i> Updating the page by adding even more cruft doesn't make the it better because the cruft <i>is</i> the fatal flaw in the first place. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 15:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No. I vote delete as one-liner neologism dicdef (incidentally followed by a couple of pages of biased chatter). Is there a real article waiting to be born?

<p>Something is NOT a neologism if it was used in the 1990. It is notable, 25 000 google hits.

<dd>You are right, I do have an agenda: make Wikipedia a reliable source of information. It is my opinion that this article has a snowball's chance in hell of being a positive contribution to the quality of Wikipedia. This is due to what I perceive to be fierce resistance to making it anything but a laundry list of anti-SomeCountry propaganda and 9/11 conspiracy theorizing. I will be happily surprised by being proven wrong! And I will now be waiting quietly for that to happen, because anything I say will just probably make the resistance dig in deeper in its trenches.

<p>I would like to inform the readers that Weregerbil has made zero (0) atempts of editing this article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Weregerbil is under no obligation to attempt to edit an article before joining its AfD discussion. And <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">WP:GD</a> makes it clear that when an article's POV issues are considered extreme enough, an AfD is a perfectly acceptable alternative to "editing and talk": <i>If the text in question is a passage or section within an article that is otherwise satisfactory, it is usually removed by simply editing it out of the article. <b>If, however, all or most of the article is problematic, the page itself may be removed.</b></i> --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 22:43, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Conspiracy theorists' speak? Yes. And why not? From what I've seen in the comments above, it is as if some people think that keeping this article on Wikipedia would be tantamount to saying that Bush orchestrated 9/11. This is not so: understand that it is perfectly acceptable to create articles about viewpoints that we find unappealing and/or downright wrong. This article doesn't do it in the best of ways, but this only means it should be <i>improved</i>. Yes, one could rightly stick NPOV/copyedit/cleanup/whatever notices on this article. But I see no good reason why it should be deleted as a matter of principle. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">GregorB</a> 20:50, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as per GregorB. It is not a good article, but that is no reason to delete. David Sneek 17:03, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> ... unfortunately. Basically like everyone else said. Yes, it's conspiracy-cruft, but it's referenced enough: the term is widely used enough that we should have an article on it. And we can't just redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thesis%2C_antithesis%2C_synthesis.html" title="Thesis, antithesis, synthesis">Thesis, antithesis, synthesis</a> because Hegel used TAS to mean many things, while PRS its really only used to mean "conspiracy"; the meaning is related, but not the same. However, I would be much in favor of shortening the article by quite a lot. It should be something like three paragraphs long: one paragraph defining the term, and referring to Hegel, one paragraph about the term's creationg by Icke, and one list of references, one line per reference, not one paragraph per reference. If the thing is kept, and no one else will do it, I can do that. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 14:41, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Striver, please, you could at least try to make it a halfway decent article. As it stands, it's spectacularly bad. Personally, I think that we absolutely don't need it and should put all the "please improve me" templates we have on top of it. But unfortunately, I see no reason to delete it after the update. I'm tempted to abstain from my vote, but I guess that would be too much of a cop-out... Striver, I think you should cut the article in half at the very least, and try to layout it in a way that doesn't hurt my head. Please note that I don't have an agenda beyond keeping crappy articles out of Wikipedia as far as possible. I don't care about your conspiracy theories, as long as you clearly label them as such and keep them to a maximum of a few sentences here and there. That's about all consensus will give you, so don't fight it. You are entitled to an opinion, but NOT to valuable space in articles that should cover views that are way, way more subsantiated than yours.<a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMstroeck_3315.html" title="User:Mstroeck">Mstroeck</a> 21:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
