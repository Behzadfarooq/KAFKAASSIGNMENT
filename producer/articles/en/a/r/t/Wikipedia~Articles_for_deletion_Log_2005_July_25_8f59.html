<p>This article is basically original research.</p>
<ul>
<li>It relies on assuming that <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a>'s statement about a "Gospel of the Hebrews" was accurate</li>
<li>It is an almost universal opinion amongst academics and non-academics that Jerome's statement was an (innocent) error caused by lack of information, and that the "Gospel of the Hebrews" that he refers to were in fact 3 seperate texts -
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Nazarenes_878c.html" title="Gospel of the Nazarenes">Gospel of the Nazarenes</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Ebionites_858f.html" title="Gospel of the Ebionites">Gospel of the Ebionites</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It contains an <b>opinion</b> of why people might have wanted the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> to exist</li>
<li>It presents an extremely POV view of the origin of the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, which is totally inconsistent with either the conservative religious view of their origin, or the critical academic view involving

</ul>
</li>
<li>It bases all of this on a totally non-sequitur argument that as Eusebius said that "matthew wrote in hebrew letters", there is an entirely different gospel for the hebrews which is not dependant on Mark, and forms the basis of Matthew, and that this must therefore mean that the above 3 gospels (Hebrews/Nazarenes/Ebionites) are in fact 1 gospel not 3 despite the near unanimous opinion amongst academics and non academics to the contrary.</li>
<li>The origin of the Gospel of Matthew should be, and is already, discussed at <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a></li>
<li>None of the references actually support the argument of the text but instead either adhere to the standard critical academic view, or propose an entirely different argument altogether.</li>
<li>The article is even written as an essay/thesis, with introduction and conclusion.</li>
<li>The author of the article added detail to all articles relating to this area of the bible supporting the POV of the article.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The earlier version of the article had extensive duplication of source texts which are already on Wikisource - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=18807366" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=18807366" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - when this was removed, it was restored by editors with very few edits indeed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The author of the article has gone to extensive lengths, including RFAR (failed), to preserve it, and there have been many sockpuppets (many of which were admitted to be so - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAuthentic_Matthew&amp;diff=19342484&amp;oldid=19340805" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAuthentic_Matthew&amp;diff=19342484&amp;oldid=19340805" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).</li>

<li>Delete: The amount of tinfoil hattery around the early Gospels is extreme. This article ignores everything from Higher Criticism on to weave together a wishlist view, arguably to support a further POV (not in the article but which the article will be used to support) for one heretical view or another. Honestly, these schemes and arguments are thick as flies in history. There can be no merge, as that requires equally merging in <i>all other</i> variant readings of the origins of the Gospel and non-Q sources, and we would indeed run out of not-paper doing so. There is no keep, because there is no support for this view that makes it representative enough to need explication, and it obviously isn't just "true" or "accepted as true" by the wider community. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:52, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Simon, the argument here is not whether this theory is correct, or even possible. It is whether this is a position being argued by any notable scholar, in a way that WP can record.

<li>A few comments:</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Someone above said the Knights are "using us as some sort of promo ad". I have no idea where they got this idea from. We are not promoting <i>anything</i>. The Knights Errant are a friendly group of bloggers who are all trying to get better in chess by following a certain chess training program (mentioned in the entry). Look at the blogs in my sidebar (<a href="http://chessconfessions.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://chessconfessions.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://chessconfessions.blogspot.com</a>): we are a bunch of schlumps trying to get better at chess. Nothing more.</p>
<p>2. As for how "important" we are as a group in the blogosphere, this is the key point. Ask anybody in the chess blogosphere about the "Knights Errant" and they will know who we are. The question is whether anything from the chess blogosphere is worthy of inclusion. This is a fair question. I would propose it is at least as important as, oh say, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Branch_Pecatonica_River" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Branch_Pecatonica_River" rel="nofollow">East Branch Pecatonica River</a> in Wisconsin. Let the Knights Errant entry stay up for a while and then see how many more hits they get than the more obscure entries.</p>
<p>3. When I started learning chess, and was trying the Knight's chess improvement program (without actually knowing about them), it would have been <i>great</i> for me if this had come up at Wikipedia. I searched the web for terms that would have come up, but they didn't come up in Google back then. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.16.225.228 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.16.225.228_1e0b.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.16.225.228">contribs</a>) 23:38, 25 July 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Garret is just going around to every warcraft custom map and saying "cruft" (whatever the hell that means) with no reason for deletion whatsoever. The fact of the matter is that these maps have earned their place in history and have received enough recognition, fan writing, and website support that they deserve their place in Wikipedia history.
<ul>
<li>Every? Well, this is only the second, but I can't guarantee it will be the last.

<li>Delete: Any item in an encyclopedia should be referred to by a group outside of its own participants. If an item is referred to only by its own participants, then it is jargon or argot or slang or cruft. However, when a subject appears in <i>multiple referential contexts,</i> it will need discussion and explanation. Hence, fanfiction, fanmaps, etc. are not appropriate encyclopedic fare unless some context other than fans (e.g. getting on the 6 o'clock news for being scary), it is inappropriate content. On the other hand, there are specialist-oriented sites on the Internet that thrive on such material.

<li>Oh dear. Perhpas we may stretch the speedy A7 criteria? This is a group of people with no claim to notability, so it really isn't too different different from a person with no such claim, is it?

<li>There was a proposal to add a speedy criterion for bands that didn't meet at least one of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria. It got about 68% yes votes and was held not to have achieved consensus.

<li>Speedy criteria should NOT be stretched. Looking at the debate around the latest proposal, people have very strong feelings about this and many, if not most, expect the rules voted on to be followed strictly. Bear in mind that the margin by which A7 passed was not very large. A7 explicitly talks about articles about "a real person" and can thus <i>not</i> be used for articles on bands, books, intersections, fan fiction characters, high school debating clubs, user-created computer game maps, or pieces of furniture at the Hogwarts school of magic. Which might be unfortunate, but that's the way it is.

<li><s><b>Comment</b>. Bernie Hayes is an Australian musician.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Incidentally, is there really a little plastic thingy attached to sheep ears called a "sheep tag"? I've only ever seen sheep at the state fair and at petting zoos. Oh, and cooked, as in gyro or leg of lamb, and worn, as in wool. I'm getting pretty close to violating WP:POINT at the moment, so I'll make a comparison: articles about custom maps and gametypes for video games have about as much worthiness for an article as a rambling essay about my experiences with sheep.

<li>OK, <b>keep</b> and <b>sort out</b> (although redirecting would have been OK, since it can easily be undone). I didn't really want to get into this here, but the situation is even more complicated. There are also 4 Korean surnames spelled "Chang"/"Jang," of which only the most common is the one covered in <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhang_%28surname%29.html" title="Zhang (surname)">Zhang (surname)</a>... two more Korean surnames are spelled "Chang/Ch'ang."

<li>Done. If <i>that's</i> an assertion of notability, than there is no point to the policy. IMHO, an assertion of notability is not just "CanadianCaesar is notable," but "CanadianCaesar is notable because he has won six national amateur checkers tournaments in a row!" (ie, without a reason, there is no assertion). Then it's up to VfD to decide if the assertion holds up. Here there was nothing to judge, so no assertion made. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>¬∑<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:44, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article starts: <i>Twins P. Shane and D. Wayne Mitchell are the leading figures in youth theatre education in the state of Alaska.</i> This is a PoV. PoV can of course be neutralized, but here the linking of the two people seems intrinsic to an article having this title. How are they claimed to be leading? Primarily in TBA Theatre (Anchorage). But in <a href="http://www.tbatheatre.org/staticpages/index.php?page=20030810145323709" class="external text" title="http://www.tbatheatre.org/staticpages/index.php?page=20030810145323709" rel="nofollow">TBA's own staff intro page</a> (temporarily unavailable; I got it through <a href="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:kgeqfKKrBhkJ:www.tbatheatre.org/staticpages/index.php%3Fpage%3D20030810145323709+tba+%22shane+mitchell%22+anchorage&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:kgeqfKKrBhkJ:www.tbatheatre.org/staticpages/index.php%3Fpage%3D20030810145323709+tba+%22shane+mitchell%22+anchorage&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">Google's cache</a>), they're named as two of four directors. What else is there about Shane or Wayne? Very little that Google can find me.

<li>Aside from the fact that the one sentence in the article is untrue (what flavour of <code>init</code> is being used and whether one is the superuser are two important factors), this is an exceedingly poor title for an article. (It's the <code>kill</code> command with two arguments.) The title isn't even necessarily itself correct, as 9 is not necessarily the number of the <code>SIGKILL</code> signal. Nothing to merge anywhere, and a title that is inherently misleading.

<li>Delete. The articles do assert notability, but I assert otherwise. Being an officer in various political organizations does not make someone notable. Aspiring politicians and minor political organizations are a dime a dozen. The Young Republicans are well-known, but does that make their <i>assistant treasurer</i> notable? Not quite. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 06:20, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. Not only because non-notable but because BHG and his supporters (or sock puppets) have shown themselves by their behaviour unworthy of being in Wikipedia. JasonRecore vandalised this VfD page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Brian_H._Graham&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19715063" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Brian_H._Graham&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19715063" rel="nofollow">thus</a>.

Zebolany (who, strangely, has not voted here) removed the VfD notice from one of the articles and then, when I re-instated the VfD tag, Zebolany vandalised several pages that I have created. And they could not even manage to link properly to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Republicans_96d7.html" title="Young Republicans">Young Republicans</a> - which might have helped. (Incidentally, did you know that "Brian ‚Ä¶ has raised over ,000 in less than one year for the Florida Federation of Young Republicans". <a href="http://www.afyr.org/custom.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afyr.org/custom.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>) -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 03:52:35, 2005-07-28 (UTC)</li>

<li>another <b>comment</b>. I am not sure why poor old Brian was singled out for the VfD grilling - possibly just cos his article was a bit too stubby. If he gets voted off, then it casts doubt on the other articles created so far for the YR officers: Nicolee Ambrose, Tim Kolpien (copyvio), Zack Scrivner, Glenn Murphy and Heather Harlow. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 07:06:59, 2005-07-29 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> not eveyone is as skilled as others with this site. That does not mean they do not use this site and certainly doesn't mean this article should be deleted. 66.157.230.18 20:55, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is the first time I have ever made a comment. If that makes what I have to say worthless, I wanted it to be out there on the table. However, I often use Wikipedia! It is my number one source of free information. It seems as if this has become too personal on both sides. I have added some of the information I have found on the web. Clearly when a 21 year old man is publisher of a major newspaper, he is worthy of an article. He's been endorsed by every major political figure in the South and has been recognized by numerous organizations for his ability to raise large sums of money. I am nearly 3 times the age of this young man, and I have not accomplished half what he has. 68.218.158.180 21:29, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Keep this article but <b>move to Brian H. Graham</b>. Notability has clearly been established. My only concern is how common the name Brian Grahamis. Changing it to Brian H. Graham is the best solution. 68.154.239.90 21:42, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> I made an error so I had to edit my previous comment. Since that seems to create some sort of controversy, I wanted to apologize for not being perfect. 68.154.239.90 21:42, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If Graham is vote off then there are hundreds of other people that need to go too. There are <b>many</b> barely notable people on Wikipedia. In fact, that is one of the reasons Wikipedia is so popular. If we take that away then this site will be seriously lacking. 68.218.133.3 03:00, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Nother note. IP addresses for all the anons that have contributed so far are all registered to: BellSouth.net Inc., Atlanta, GA. Note to Citely above. I am a staunch supporter of the apathy party - I do not actually give a [expletive deleted] about BHG. I do however get very annoyed when people vandalise articles and try and make what is probably just one person, look like a crowd. Members of a political party, should act like grown-up responsible citizens. You are not presenting a very good image of the GOP. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 09:19:10, 2005-07-30 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> Vandalizing articles is completely unacceptable, but so are the insults. Both sides are wrong on this issue. I do not know Mr. grahm and do not really care what you do with the article. I am very disappointed in the "keeps" as much as the "deletes". If I were the gentleman we're talking about I would not want anything to do with this site. And for all we know, he may not have a clue about the site. As for Ragib's insult.

<li><b>Delete</b> ad; but not necessarily nn. It's technically notable for automating acceptance tests in a format accessible to non-programmers (Ward Cunningham's FIT framework), and then organizing those tests in a Wiki format (Fitnesse), and it's generating interest by being featured in the "Apprentice" series of articles in <i>Software Development</i>. I'd suggest adding a reference as an external link to the extreme programming page, similar to JUnit and NUnit links elsewhere.

<li><b>keep</b>: Wow, what an interesting battle going on here! As a studier of Chinese, I am particularly interested how Chinese has merged into other languages...the three most common being Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese. The names of these countries in their repective languages all come from the Chinese...does that mean that they are not real Vietnamese, Korean, or Japanese words? Of course, the assimilation of Chinese into English is a bit different, being that we deal with romanization. Therefore, the word meaning "energy" that is described in the list would at one time have been known as Ch'i, or Chi, has become Qi in the official <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> system. This word is becoming more common in English usage as more and more people become interested in Asian culture. Other good examples are Qin and Qing, the names of two Chinese dynasties. Perhaps, though, these problems could be solved by naming the article instead, "List of Words in English containing a Q not followed by a U". The current title does lead the reader to believe that the words listed will be of English etymological origin.<a href="../../../i/l/u/User%7EIluvchineselit_4810.html" title="User:Iluvchineselit">Iluvchineselit</a> 18:23, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think renaming would be a bad idea, but I'm not convinced it's strictly necessary either. Nevertheless, there is hardly such a thing as English etymological origin. Almost every word in English ultimately originates from another language, so it's just a question of how recently they migrated. Still, the article has benefitted greatly just from being on VfD, and a lot more people have read it than otherwise would have done, so really it's all good. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 18:33, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am the author so obviously I will vote <b>keep</b> but let's discuss this reasonably. I think this is more than a dictionary entry, because it attempts to explain how we end up with such words in English when most people believe they do not exist. Admittedly this bit needs expansion but that's exactly what I'm working on at the moment. After Uppland added the transwiki tag, I posted my reasons for keeping it on Wikipedia to the Talk page. Ten days later, neither he nor anyone else had replied, so I assumed that everyone was satisified with my reasoning - apologies if that was not the case, and I'm quite happy to have the transwiki debate again. To address some of the above concerns: they are mostly loan words, but are considered naturalised according to at least one major dictionary (Collins). As a list of words, it is no worse then any of the other articles in the 'Lists of English words' category. As I say, I'm sorry if I caused any confusion by removing the transwiki tag, but this article really doesn't deserve to be deleted. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 20:10, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry for missing your talkpage comment. I just feel that the connection between these words is trivial, basically just the result of certain conventions for transcribing from various other languages. It might be worth <i>mentioning</i> somewhere (in the article on <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_spelling.html" title="English spelling">English spelling</a> or in a general article on loanwords in English, which might exist somewhere under some title) that there are words in English with a Q not followed by a U, that this is a result of borrowing, and proceed to give an example or two from each language with an explanation of why this or that particular phoneme has been represented by a Q in English. I just don't see the need for a comprehensive list. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 20:28, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Whether a particular list of words are connected in a trivial or non-trivial way is totally a matter of opinion, so if you disagree on that then fair enough. I hadn't noticed that the parent cat is up for transwikiing; thanks for the info. If a judgement has been made that these articles belong on Wiktionary then by all means move them, but I don't think deletion is the answer, and would be disappointed as I have put quite a bit of time into this article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 20:36, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>They are naturalised in English, at least according to the Collins dictionary. In that sense they are as English as any other word lifted directly from other languages, i.e. the vast majority of English words.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Mainly because the vast majority of these are loan words. There is much scope for differences in spelling anyway because the Q is only used to approximate a particular letter sound in other languages. In the New Oxford English Dictionary at least, they are nearly all listed differently anyway, without a lone Q (some with K, QU, CH, etc). I also agree that "tranq" should be removed from the list whatever happens because it is just a shortening (the OED spells it "trank" anyway). However, it is an interesting article, hence the "weak" and I might yet change my vote because it would be relatively "harmless" to keep. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbis_377c.html" title="User:Bobbis">Bobbis</a> 21:12, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>My criterion was for them to appear in at least one major dictionary. The NODE is considerably shorter (fewer than half as many words) and less permissive than Collins, so I suppose it is not that surprising that the alternative spellings are not specified in it. Regarding Tranq, it is a shortened form, but it is not an abbreviation; it is written without a dot, just like 'vet' which I think most people would agree is a word in its own right. Glad you found the page interesting though, and I hope I can resolve your issues with it. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 21:23, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello. I am the editor of the paper. None of the members of my staff put the page up. It was done by a member of the school community. It is not a national paper, but is important, and has a regional audience. It is neither fair nor right to delete it. It is informative and adds to the value of wikipedia.
<p>This page should not be redirected or deleted. The editors of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> simply want the title to themselves, which is selfish and antithetical to the goals of wikipedia. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.134.html" title="User:205.188.116.134">205.188.116.134</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.188.116.134.html" title="User talk:205.188.116.134">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.188.116.134_b2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.188.116.134">contribs</a>) 2005-07-26 02:10:10 UTC.</small></p>

<li>This is an underused definition of patent nonsense; a lot of the time it is cited as having to be specifically unintelligible when the criterion is slightly broader than that. However, few are the articles which it iss impossible to make "head [n]or tail of" which are not also unintelligible; it also unclear, to me at least, how we are to interpret the vernacular phrasing. I wonder if this kind of article would be a good test-case: delete it right now on those grounds, deliberately take it to VfU on grounds that it is <i>not</i> patent nonsense and see what happens.

<li>Obviously untrue claims like the one in this article could rightly be speedily deleted as vandalism, but many people are uncomfortable with this, for some reason. Usually it takes a bold admin to just come and wipe it out. (That would definitely be a WP:POINT, BTW. If this legitimately ended up at VfU after a speedy, well, that'd be rather amusing.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 04:25, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> but not speedy. This is obvious Fiction or Hoax, but not speedyable under the current CSD. I have no problem "making head or tail" of it. In fact if the firest sentance were changed to "In the james-bond-like novel <b>Dr SoandSo</b> the character <b>Gus Roberts</b>..." I'll bet it would have a consenssus to keep (assuming that such a novel existed). If this were speedy deleted unde the present rules I would be inclined to put it on VfU.

<li>That is an interesting idea. But I don't see anything on the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>. page that says that a hoax is a type of vandalism, although it might be implied on the grounds that it is a bad-faith edit. However I would be opposed to making (or considering) a hoax as a reson for speedy deletion , because there ar too many false positives. i have seen several articles nominted for VfD listed as "hoax" where it turns out thet they are accurate but unusual. For example, see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Elizabeth_Foulstar_4d3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Elizabeth Foulstar">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Elizabeth Foulstar</a> where someone incorrectly thought the page might be a hoax. Too many pages are inaccurately identified as hoaxes for this to be a safe reason for speedy deletion -- let them come to VfDF where several people can give vbiews, and if somehting is infact not a hoax, a citation will no doubt be provided. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 17:50, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That said, I would not object to a new reason for speedy deletion the specified using wikipedia to publish fiction, which i think might cover this case, but I don't think that A3 as currently written will cover that. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 17:50, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>From <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>: <i>Users will sometimes create joke articles or replace existing articles with plausible-sounding nonsense.</i> That's what this is, aside from the "plausible" part. "Gus Roberts is known as the most dangerous person in the history of the world" is patently ridiculous, a far cry from the example you cite. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 18:11, July 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I see your point, and I missed that phrase. I agree that this case is far more obvious that the one I cited, or than most hoaxes.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_The_Minuteman_project_df86.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The Minuteman project">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minuteman_project_9d31.html" title="The Minuteman project">The Minuteman project</a></span></h3>
<p>I believe that this article (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minuteman_project_9d31.html" title="The Minuteman project">The Minuteman project</a>) has a bunch of issues. Someone considered merging it with the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minuteman Project</a>, which is a different page. (Also, note "The Minuteman Project" with a capital P redirecits to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minuteman Project</a>),</p>
<ul>
<li>As some of you know, and as you can see on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minuteman Project</a>, it was a group of American citizens that began in 2005 opposing illegal immigration</li>
<li>The article at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minuteman_project_9d31.html" title="The Minuteman project">The Minuteman project</a> starts talking about a "Minuteman Project" as a group of "American farmers" opposing illegall immigration.</li>
<li>It says that "The group became infamous during 2000, as The Neighborhood Watch Ranch". When I searched "Neighborhood Watch Ranch" in Google, I found no results outside of Wikipedia/related articles.</li>
<li>I could not verify any of the other information about the alleged illegal activities of such a group.</li>
<li>The article then jumps to the 2005 T-Shirt incident. This seems to be talking about the recently created "Minuteman Project" as written in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minuteman Project</a>.</li>
<li>The reference link at the bottom of the page only talks about the Minuteman Project in 2005, it makes no mention whatsoever of a 2000 group called "The Neighborhood Watch Ranch" or any similar activities.</li>
<li>The article is laden with extreme POV and unsourced accusations.</li>
<li>In conclusion, I think that most of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minuteman_project_9d31.html" title="The Minuteman project">The Minuteman project</a> page is a complete fabrication made up to slander the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minuteman Project</a>. The 2005 t-shirt incident is the only information with sources to back it up, and it's already covered in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minuteman Project</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minuteman_project_9d31.html" title="The Minuteman project">The Minuteman project</a> should not be merged with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minuteman Project</a> as requested by a user.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Appears to be either a POV fork or an accidental duplication. Either way, the claims made aren't referenced, and I can't find anything on Google, either. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minuteman_Project_f147.html" title="The Minuteman Project">The Minuteman Project</a> presents a good POV description of this group, AFAICT. If there's any verifiable, useful info in this article (which I doubt), merge it into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minuteman_Project_f147.html" title="The Minuteman Project">The Minuteman Project</a>; otherwise, <s><b>Delete</b></s>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 00:53, July 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Err, yeah, I meant <b>Redirect</b>. Really, I did.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minuteman Project</a>, appears to be a dupe. ‚Äî<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrologFan_b860.html" title="User:PrologFan">PrologFan</a> <small>{<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrologFan_74e4.html" title="User talk:PrologFan">Talk</a>}</small> 01:08, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to the above page, since it is a duplication.
