Youth ministry does interact with society in many ways, but this section is POV garbage. This section should focus on the conflicting views of youth ministry and critisisms of it being a point of brainwashing for youth into their parents evangelical backgrounds (or whatever we have sources for). <s>It should also be noted on the top of this article that the youth ministry described here is entirely Protestant.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please note the possibility of moving this article to a namespace more specific to protestant youth ministry and creating an entirly new article incorperating youth ministries from a variety of faiths as discussed on <a href="../../../y/o/u/Talk%7EYouth_ministry_36ea.html" title="Talk:Youth ministry">Talk:Youth ministry</a>. This article is inherently POV because it describes "Youth ministry" in the sense of a promotional phrase used by Evangelical churches to expand their young membership, and not "Youth ministry" in the literal meaning of the term: the active practice and education of a particular religion or faith toward young people. We can easily move the article and write a new one withouth going through AfD. Also per SynergeticMaggot.--<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 05:54, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Make <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_ministry.html" title="Youth ministry">Youth ministry</a> a neutral, inclusive article, which does not focus on any one faith's form of ministry for their youth. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellaNorCal_013f.html" title="User:HellaNorCal">HellaNorCal</a> 06:09, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> as empty: the article restates the title and offers no other information. Youth ministry is ministry for...youth. There is no application to any particular practice, any particular religion (although Christianity is assumed). There is <b>no information</b> offered. This is not a stub: it is a dictionary definition with headings. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:55, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Nota bene</b>: An important note, here. My "vote," above applies to the mess that is currently residing at the title this AfD refers to. Apparently, someone redirected the article that everyone above me was voting on, and then someone else overwrote the redirect. Because of this, I cannot speedy delete the vandalized new mess. Apparently, the votes above refer to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_Ministry_%28Evangelical%29_9960.html" title="Youth Ministry (Evangelical)">Youth Ministry (Evangelical)</a>. This is why <b>you should not do the redirect while an article is under AfD consideration</b> because someone else is likely to screw it up. Also note that the new title violates the naming conventions. Ugh. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:20, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Explanation</b>: I'm sure it was done in good faith this time, but redirecting and then overwriting is a very, very bad move and can be read as an attempt to evade process. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yea, that was me. Before I saw the AfD thing, because it's something I've been meaning to do for so long. Shoulda just done it a week ago. Sorry for the confusion, didn't mean to cause trouble with it. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellaNorCal_013f.html" title="User:HellaNorCal">HellaNorCal</a> 06:10, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Major rewrite</b> would be necessary at the new title, including a change of name. The article is highly POV, and I don't mean the point of view of "evangelicals." First, that particular term has been hijacked in the last 30 years or so, so what this article is about is a single tradition of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregationalism.html" title="Congregationalism">Congregationalism</a>, which is not all of the evangelical churches. There is not nearly enough objectivity in the present article. That said, it is not a deletion policy violation <i>at a proper title.</i> Note that "proper title" means "Youth ministry (Evangelical)" (miniscule second term). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:25, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with Geogre that the text of the article should not have been moved while under AfD, particularly to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_Ministry_%28Evangelical%29_9960.html" title="Youth Ministry (Evangelical)">Youth Ministry (Evangelical)</a> which is not even capitalized correctly ("ministry" should be in lower case). I would prefer that the content be restored to what it was before, then if the AfD ends with a keep result, add information about non-evangelical youth ministry to the main article, breaking out the evangelical content to a separate article only when the article gets too big. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 14:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a major headache, but the move should probably stay as it is, other than the naming conventions. I specifically noted to HellaNorCal that it shouldn't be moved during AfD, anyway. I would be in favor of renaming the article to match naming conventions for now. In the long run, the two articles should probably be merged and the POV content of the current one deleted. I have changed the title of this AfD to (hopefully) prevent more confusion.

<ul>
<li>Hello UU! I probably did generalize a <i>bit</i> too much there with "inherently", but the term is overwhelmingly Christian in application. UU congregations/non-Evangelicals do sometimes use the term, but I'm not yet convinced that the differences are so great that it requires two separate articles. I'd be happy to discuss this further if/when the article is kept, or on my talk page if it is not. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 17:13, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>As would I. I've seen the term used most recently, by the UUA, in the Consultation on Ministry to and with youth.

<li><b>Rename to Youth Ministry and keep</b> - This article <i>definitely</i> needs a rewrite (which I hope to get to work on within a few more days), but youth ministry is an hugely important concept across Christian denominations — never mind that it's my field of work. The move (and title itself) were ill advised, as pointed out above; in any case, I disagree that there's enough uniqueness about "Evangelical" youth ministry (which is often a subjective term anyway) to distinguish it from other denominations to the point that it requires a separate article.

<li><b>Comment:</b>The reason for the move of the current article to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_ministry_%28Evangelical%29_0584.html" title="Youth ministry (Evangelical)">Youth ministry (Evangelical)</a> is because that's what the article is about (That's how the article still introduced itself, last time I checked). However, <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_ministry.html" title="Youth ministry">Youth ministry</a> is a much broader concept than just an aspect of christianity. Muslims, Jews, Unitarians, many other faiths all have different ways of ministering to/with their <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth.html" title="Youth">Youth</a>, and Youth ministry should be an overview article, non-specific to any one faith. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellaNorCal_013f.html" title="User:HellaNorCal">HellaNorCal</a> 06:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
