<li><b>Comment</b>: There are a tons of century-old buildings around the United States and they don't all deserve their own encyclopedia entry. In a lot of older, more-established countries, a century-old building barely registers on the radar because there are so many. We can't put every single old building in the world on the site (uh, at least they can't get all their own entries). For the record, I'm not hugely opposed to keeping this entry, I just don't think it's necessary unless they can prove that there's more to it than "the oldest building on campus, once a hospital and now a dorm". That's not much for notability. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevotchka_2455.html" title="User:Devotchka">Devotchka</a> 01:28, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A non-notable hall of residence. (As to old buildings: there are several million buildings at least 100 years old in the UK.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The First Hill page has been up for mere minutes and it already has several dedicated members of the hall (myself included) adding everything we know and love about 1HL's present and past. The article will be visited by many more members of the hall and of the school soon and more pertinent info delving into <a href="../../../n/c/s/NCSSM_62e9.html" title="NCSSM">NCSSM's</a> history will surface. I think this page will ultimately be very interesting and encyclopedic when historical information is brought in. The page will be about the hall and its people, not only the old building we live in. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanmelting_ab56.html" title="User:Snowmanmelting">Snowmanmelting</a> 01:38, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The people who live in the dorm are not notable. Just because something exists doesn't mean that it warrants entry into Wikipedia. If, however, if you have more information on the building itself, (perhaps famous alumni), go ahead and add it. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevotchka_2455.html" title="User:Devotchka">Devotchka</a> 01:43, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm curious then, why pages like <a href="../../../s/a/p/Sapulpa%2C_Oklahoma_f880.html" title="Sapulpa, Oklahoma">Sapulpa, Oklahoma</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devils_Lake%2C_North_Dakota_e074.html" title="Devils Lake, North Dakota">Devils Lake, North Dakota</a> are allowed to sit around. Though the statistics on those pages (and those on the hundreds practically identical to them) are absolutely mesmerizing, I don't think they would "warrant entry into Wikipedia" as they are solely about existence. Pages about small towns are trivial; a 1HL page would discuss the people and events that tie the hall together making the page infinitely more interesting than some of the tidbits that <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">user:Rambot</a> (the bot that creates many of those geography pages) adds. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanmelting_ab56.html" title="User:Snowmanmelting">Snowmanmelting</a> 02:27, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This page would be infinitely beneficial to anyone wishing to know information about their future home at NCSSM. In order to establish confortability in their new envronment, any info at all is helpful in 'greasing the skids' into dormitory life. Not only this, but any outsiders with an interest in the school would find this page informative, even in its current infant state.Master Kenichi 01:46, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As the "SLI" on first hill (and a wikipedia lover), I'll weigh in some. First, take a look at the deletion guidelines, especially, "What wikipedia is not."</p>
<ol>
<li>1 What Wikipedia is not</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   * 1.1 Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia
   * 1.2 Wikipedia is not a dictionary
   * 1.3 Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought
   * 1.4 Wikipedia is not a propaganda machine
   * 1.5 Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files
   * 1.6 Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider
   * 1.7 Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information
   * 1.8 Wikipedia is not a crystal ball
   * 1.9 Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors
</pre>
<ol>
<li>2 What the Wikipedia community is not</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   * 2.1 Wikipedia is not a battleground
   * 2.2 Wikipedia is not an anarchy
   * 2.3 Wikipedia is not a democracy
   * 2.4 Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy
</pre>
<p>Nothing in there except Potentially "indicrimitate collection of information" fits the bill as reason for deletion. Here's that list.</p>
<pre>
  1. Lists of Frequently Asked Questions. 
  2. Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms or persons.
  3. Travel guides. 
  4. Memorials. 
  5. News reports. 
  6. Genealogical entries, or phonebook entries. 
  7. Directories, directory entries, or a resource for conducting business. 
  8. Instruction manuals 
</pre>
<p>In a positive sense, here's reasons to include it. As a random collection of dorm-related information... no, I don't think think that's wikipedia worthy. That would be more a blog or other vanity page.</p>
<p>However, 1st Hill definitely has an unique character that has not yet come across in articles. From our soap-making success/fiasco (1st Hill Fight Club Soap at party) to the assasins spoon game, there's a lot of quirky stuff happening. Is everything quirky worthy of a webpage...maybe. Is everything quirky worthy of a wikipedia entry? Probably not.</p>
<p>But my case would be, given enough interest in writing articles related to first hill, its inclusion would benefit those folks interested in applying to the school of science and math who are interested in its personality and fit as a school. School web pages are not an option... and merging into the greater NCSSM wikipedia is too much of a scope shift - 1st hill has its own flavor, most definitely, and it would be like deleting an entry on chocolate (complete with bean information and histories of creation) to include that material under the general ice cream category. information which may be useful to more people than just chocolate growers would be lost in the subsuming.</p>
<p>There's my weighing in. merge if it becomes poorly added to.Aspiringbodhisattva 04:27, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
