<li>A list of languages may be useful, but I can't see why the ones starting with Y should be in a seperate article.

<li>I find it highly suspect that there are hundreds of languages starting with the letter Y alone. Anyway, there's no point in a list of just one letter, and there already is a category for this stuff. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 15:49, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Accurate and certainly not useless, this list, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_spoken_and_sign_languages_beginning_with_the_letter_Z_393a.html" title="List of spoken and sign languages beginning with the letter Z">List of spoken and sign languages beginning with the letter Z</a>, is a natural spinoff of the much poorer article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_languages.html" title="List of languages">List of languages</a>, which is full of gaps. A single <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_languages.html" title="List of languages">List of languages</a> with 7,000 entries is too large to be useful. Its partial derivation from the Ethnologue falls well within the limits of fair use, as long as it's cited. <b>Strong keep</b>. <s>(But needs <b>cleanup</b> to conform to Wikipedia language naming conventions.)</s> cleaned up. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 18:44, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> — I would love to see Wikipedia have an article (even a stub) on every language on this planet. To list all languages in a single list is too much: it makes more sense to keep the major languages on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_languages.html" title="List of languages">list of languages</a> and spin off the lesser spoken ones into these lists. A deletionist approach here is a triumph for systemic bias and limiting the geographical scope of Wikipedia. As for copyvio: the names of natural languages cannot be copyrighted. SIL/Ethnologue can only copyright its presentation and original information on these languages. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 19:35, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> Why not just have a single list of languages, sorted alphabetically? I don't see how we need articles that consist entirely of rearrangements of existing data.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is what categories are for. Ideally, every language article on Wikipedia should be traceable up to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_9c79.html" title="Category:Languages">Category:Languages</a> by two paths: one through its genetic affiliation (e.g. <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navajo_language.html" title="Navajo language">Navajo language</a> &lt; <a href="../../../a/p/a/Category%7EApachean_languages_9128.html" title="Category:Apachean languages">Category:Apachean languages</a> &lt; <a href="../../../a/t/h/Category%7EAthabaskan_languages_d34c.html" title="Category:Athabaskan languages">Category:Athabaskan languages</a> &lt; <a href="../../../n/a/-/Category%7ENa-Den%C3%A9_languages_de42.html" title="Category:Na-Dené languages">Category:Na-Dené languages</a> &lt; <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_9c79.html" title="Category:Languages">Category:Languages</a>) and one through its location (e.g. <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navajo_language.html" title="Navajo language">Navajo language</a> &lt; <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_of_the_United_States_351b.html" title="Category:Languages of the United States">Category:Languages of the United States</a> &lt; <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_of_North_America_20cd.html" title="Category:Languages of North America">Category:Languages of North America</a> &lt; <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_by_country_a82e.html" title="Category:Languages by country">Category:Languages by country</a> &lt; <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_9c79.html" title="Category:Languages">Category:Languages</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> — <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>, it's nice of you to bring up categories. I noticed that you have removed a lot of languages from top level categories, like <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_9c79.html" title="Category:Languages">category:languages</a>, so that a reader has to know the genetic classification of a language to get to it by category. I just thought it'd be nice if all language articles were in that category as well as in more specific ones. It just looks as if you are really keen on doing a lot of unnecessary housework. I could see your last comment being worthwhile if you hadn't performed the decategorisation. All I can see is a drive to make it more difficult to find language articles, and an over reliance on the often flawed system of genetic classification. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 11:39, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not quite; I've moved languages out of top-level categories so that a reader has to know <i>either</i> the genetic classification <i>or</i> the country where the language is spoken. I think it's unlikely a reader will want information on a language without knowing at least one of those two facts. I also think having all the language articles listed directly at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_9c79.html" title="Category:Languages">Category:Languages</a> will leave the door open to one day having a category with two thousand entries in it, which will be a nightmare to navigate. I have left in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_9c79.html" title="Category:Languages">Category:Languages</a> languages that are the only member of their language family to have an article in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 21:09, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you want an alphabetical list of "X language" articles, feel free to populate a Category:Languages by name category. If you want an alphabetical list of "X language" articles that meet the <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> criteria for being "major languages", feel free to populate a Category:Languages that Gareth Hughes thinks are major by name category. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:49, 2005 Mar 11 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_languages.html" title="List of languages">List of languages</a> does nothing that cannot be done with a Category:Languages by name category (with the redlinks in a "To do" section on the category page or on Category talk:Languages by name) in conjunction with the other parallel categorizations by family and by country. <i>This</i> list has the addition of a few (8) navigational notes (Just in case you thought that Eastern Yiddish might not be covered by <a href="../../../y/i/d/Yiddish_language.html" title="Yiddish language">Yiddish language</a>.), but conversely lacks the classifications.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia isn't a general information base. An information base is a repository in which information is available for querying in a variety of ways. It would be useful to to have a database containing one record for each human language with a wide variety of different attributes given and a query capability by which one could obtain lists of languages with various properties, sorted in various ways. Perhaps this exists elsewhere. I'd be surprised if linguists have not created it somewhere. However, Wikipedia is not this, and it should not try to make itself into a Human Language database by having an "article" for each language, and a plethora of "list articles" giving the results of every imaginable interesting query on the basic data. If it were to have one or a few articles representing queries on the basic data about languages, it is doubtful that a straight list alphabetized by the conventional name of the language in English would be the most interesting, or even interesting at all. All that said, some thought should be given on how to organize all the information in the Wikipedia about human languages. However, this is not it. In fact, it comes across as kind of stupid. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 11:09, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is such a database, of course. It's called <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/" rel="nofollow">Ethnologue</a>, and it's where the language names in this article were copied from. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 12:09, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> — As long as categories by country are done, I can now understand what the reorganisation was all about. I think that there is a question here about the validity of lists on Wikipedia when the content of those lists also appears ina category. This isn't limited to languages, but is present throughout the project. For me, the major use of lists is that they can be used for project building, where categories cannot (they can't have red links unless they are added by hand). Ethnologue is the most comprehensive online survey of the world's languages, but is often flawed and offers poor information. We have been using Ethnologue, perfectly legally, as a starting block for our articles on languages (compare, for instance, the Ethnologue article on <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AIJ" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AIJ" rel="nofollow">Lishanid Noshan</a> and Wikipedia's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lishanid_Noshan_0256.html" title="Lishanid Noshan">Lishanid Noshan</a>). It would be utterly daft to ignore such a comprehensive resource as Ethnologue, but it would be equally daft to rely on it alone (I haven't spoken to any linguist who is a total fan). This list is not just about navigation for readers: it is a recognitions that we have a long way to go before we are providing a good, comprehensive resource for the world's languages. Isn't that an aspiration of encylopaedia building? I see that Category:Languages that Gareth Hughes thinks are major by name is still a red link: I look forward to seeing that one on VfD! <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 16:32, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
