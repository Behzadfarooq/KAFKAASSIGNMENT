<li><b>Keep</b>, as the comic most certainly rests as notable now. At it's previous deletion, the comic was much smaller (holding an Alexa rating of around 470,000), but has since grown to enjoy an extremely large reader base (they're current Alexa rank sits at around 35,000), and is pointed to often by other gaming sites, such as <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joystiq.html" title="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>. It certainly ranks as more notable than 90% of the things on the Wiki's <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">list of webcomics</a>. However, the article does need to be cleaned up and expanded. There is almost no info pertaining to the comic itself in the article. --Nmaster64 21:23, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comparing an article to other articles that exist is not a valid argument against deletion per <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html#What_about_article_x" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT#What_about_article_x</a>.

<dd>Yeah, I know. Nothing that makes sense is a valid argument on Wikipedia for notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> Hmmm... When I looked at this article the first thing I thought to myself was "haven't I seen this somewhere before&#160;?"... And sure enough, there are those comments about re-created content in the AfD debate. But let's focus on the facts: is the subject of the article notable, and is the article adequately referenced&#160;? Notability is not, in my view, proven: it's hard to see how a listenership of just 15,000 can be regarded as significant - there are hospital radio stations with larger weekly audiences - and although it's claimed that the podcast is highly rated by Yahoo no evidence is presented to support this. On balance I feel this is a <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:59, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Currently ExtraLife Radio is Yahoo Podcast's 32nd highest rated podcast <a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/popular?&amp;c=r&amp;pgs=31" class="external autonumber" title="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/popular?&amp;c=r&amp;pgs=31" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/series?s=d8727f91239635e78ace2e2e909caa91" class="external autonumber" title="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/series?s=d8727f91239635e78ace2e2e909caa91" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, which most certainly is notable.

<li>It should be noted that it is the 32 most highly <i>rated</i>, which is entirely subjective and offers no indication of notability, not in the top 100 most highly <i>popular</i> podcasts, which would indicate listenership. Besides that, listing on a directory does not establish notability, per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. - <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir">Ocatecir</a> 09:38, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Currently the total number of podcast listeners is very small. The number of people who have even downloaded a single podcast is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/04/05/pew-backtracks-on-podcasting-survey-numbers/" class="external text" title="http://www.engadget.com/2005/04/05/pew-backtracks-on-podcasting-survey-numbers/" rel="nofollow">less than 6,000,000</a>. The number of <i>regular</i> podcast listeners is probably a fourth of that. This means that with 15,000 listeners ExtraLife Radio captures approximately 1% of the total number of people listening to podcasts, a significant portion of the market. Considering the amount of growth the podcast has seen since this article was last deleted, I think it should be kept for the time being, assuming the show will maintain it's current rate of growth. I also feel that it satisfies the notability requirement based on Nmaster64 above links. The article needs a lot of cleanup, but it should not be deleted. 67.88.66.41 00:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> We should keep <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28web%29_b1bd.html#Podcasts" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)">Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(web)#Podcasts</a> in mind, particularly comments by <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a>. - <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir">Ocatecir</a> 08:38, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It should also be noted that the basis for most of the delete suggestions here is solely on the fact that this is recreated content. As this podcast and web comic have increased in popularity by a factor of ten since the original article was deleted, I think this is not a valid reason to delete the article. If it is decided that ExtraLife is still not notable enough to have an article about it, then so be it, but to suggest this article needs to be deleted simply because it is recreated content is not a valid reason. 67.88.66.41 16:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It is, because popularity is not a criterion for inclusion. Had substantial sources been found in this time, then it could be reconsidered, but merely an expanded audience is insufficient. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am not saying that because the audience has expanded it should stay. I am saying that because the audience has expanded, deleting this article simply because it is recreated content would be a mistake. What might not have been notable could very well be considered notable now. If everything else were equal, and this article was recreated, I would say delete it strait away, but the podcast has grown dramatically since the article was originally deleted. To simply suggest this article should be deleted because it is recreated content is irresponsible. I am not sure what you mean by lack of substantial sources though, Nmaster64 listed multiple external references above. Those references combined with <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28web%29_b1bd.html#Podcasts" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)">Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(web)#Podcasts</a> Ocatecir linked to, in my mind establishes notability. 67.88.66.41 18:41, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Fair enough I read the article wrong. I still feel that the references cited establish notability though. If you disagree so be it, you are entitled to your opinion.

Just pointing out further sources that have found ExtraLife notable enough to write about. <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 17:43, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Blogs do not meet the criteria as they are self-published. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>- <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir">Ocatecir</a> 17:46, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Umm no. Self published means published by the person responsible for the content. If this were a review of ExtraLife, published by the guys at ExtraLife, that would qualify as self-published. This does not, it is published by an independent source. <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 18:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Re-read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#SELF" title="WP:V">WP:V#SELF</a>. Basically, self published sources (even independent ones) are largely not acceptable as sources. Wikipedia is not meant to catalog ideas posted on blogs. We have better standards of sourcing, accuracy, and neutrality than that -- we use sources with reputations for fact-checking an accuracy. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:24, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are right, my mistake, however I was not trying to use this a proof of notability, I feel that is already covered by the redistribution mentioned above. I was just pointing out further references to the site to emphasis the growth ExtraLife has experienced since the article was deleted the first time. And I know audience size is not criteria for notability. It was just a comment. <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 18:27, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've read through the above, and I don't see anything thta meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>'s "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other.

<li>Point three of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html#Criteria" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability_(web)#Criteria</a> states that an article meets criteria for notability if "The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." The ExtraLife comic is redistributed via <a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/humor.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.mmorpg.com/humor.cfm" rel="nofollow"><b>mmorpg.com</b></a>, a well known and independent news source for massively multiplayer online games. Not only does this website aggregate external news but they also conduct interviews with individuals from well-known game development studios<a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1085" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1085" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/gameId/216/setView/features/loadFeature/498" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/gameId/216/setView/features/loadFeature/498" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm?gameId=239&amp;setView=features&amp;loadFeature=1069&amp;bhcp=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm?gameId=239&amp;setView=features&amp;loadFeature=1069&amp;bhcp=1" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Based on this redistribution, this article about ExtraLife meets the requirements for Notability. <i>EDIT: My point is that the requirement you quoted is one of three that web based media may satisfy to qualify as notable. The requirment is that the media meet any one of the three possible criteria.</i> --<a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 19:47, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
