This is one of those times when the first sentence of an article provides the best reason for its deletion:
<blockquote>
<p>"The main article on the early-2000s Internet phenomenon <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a> contains only occurrences/incidents that obtained media coverage; this list is intended to provide a broader inclusion of AYB cultural references."</p>
</blockquote>
In other words, the main <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a> article contains those references to the term that are <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and can be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> This list copies those and adds trivial references. I really don't think we need to document every sign someone holds up at <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestlemania.html" title="Wrestlemania">Wrestlemania</a>. Normally I try to avoid using "<a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">cruft</a>" in AfD, but this is a textbook example. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 06:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> for great justice. The point in the nom is pertinent; this seems to be not a POV fork, but a V fork.

<li><b>Keep</b> - (zomg, someone&#160;!voted keep)! Yes, I think this is a helpful list. This is a very culturally significant term, and many of the listings are interesting, encyclopedic, and useful (e.g., <i>In the Futurama episode Anthology of Interest II, a space invader speaks the phrase.</i>). Per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>: <i>The list may be a valuable information source</i>, I believe it applies (I know, you don't think it's valuable, but is this any less valuable then <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28slang%29.html" title="Santorum (slang)">Santorum (slang)</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Steamer_e6c5.html" title="Stanley Steamer">Stanley Steamer</a>, which the community has decided are encyclopedic?). Unfortunately, we don't have any guidelines on what a list should be, but I think this falls under it, as much as many other lists we have, and have set a precedent on WP for notability: (e.g., much more valuable than <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ace_Mystery_Numeric-Series_Single_Titles_e978.html" title="List of Ace Mystery Numeric-Series Single Titles">List of Ace Mystery Numeric-Series Single Titles</a>). Keep in mind, this was a very culturally significant term in the early 00's (&lt;-- how does one pronounce that?), and the list is pertinent. If you wish to trim out unverifiable terms, I say go ahead, but keep this list. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 10:17, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The cultural significance of the term is what paradoxically would make this list an indiscrimate collection of information. There would be just too many references to make this article useful. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaligron_d32d.html" title="User:Saligron">Saligron</a> 11:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, What you say&#160;!!? Many of these items would have been left on the root article without much debate, but the size of that article warranted splitting. I think the list as a whole should stay, but needs to be further referenced, and perhaps pruned. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 13:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and repurpose.</b> The article's current mission is to include less-notable and borderline notable cultural references to AYB: this is a bad idea. However, if it were repurposed and pruned per Xaosflux's suggestion, it would be a good article. (If not a Good Article.) -<a href="../../../j/h/f/User%7EJHFTC_516e.html" title="User:JHFTC">Toptomcat</a> 13:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Well the introduction sentence of the article clearly implies it is intended for cultural references that did not get Media coverage. Isn't it that original Research? -- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucasbfr_3ae6.html" title="User:Lucasbfr">lucasbfr</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucasbfr_039f.html" title="User talk:Lucasbfr"><font color="darkblue">talk</font></a></sup> 14:46, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Keep but Prune</b> As annoying as the AYB phenomenon is/was, the content listed is verifiable, and follows guidelines for encyclopedic content. Some may question the usefulness of the article, or like me may just not care for the subject, but these are not valid reasons to delete, as per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. Some pruning and consolidation could be done to keep the size manageable though. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArakunem_454b.html" title="User:Arakunem">Arakunem</a> 17:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course, if we do as you suggest and prune all those that are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">non-verifiable</a> and the product of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, we wind up with a copy of the list already in the main <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base.html" title="All your base">All your base</a> article. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 19:17, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The nom provided an excellent analysis. That this might be "interesting", "helpful" or "useful" does not make it encyclopedic or change the fact it's trivia and an indiscriminate collection of AYB..."cruft". There is also nothing to back up any assertion that this is a "very culturally significant term". Whether or not one can measure its "value" is questionable, especially by comparing it to other articles. We're not discussing those other articles and whether or not they are encyclopedic does not affect this article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:01, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete as unreferenced</b> As the nomimator correctly points out, the introductory paragraph tells all. This list is the <i>unreferenced</i> uses of the phrase. Delete this entire article as unreferenced and unverified. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> They're somewhat referenced, and it was a notable internet phenomenon. Although some might have to be pruned, I'd suggest a fair bit of this could be salvaged with a bit of effort. No need to throw the baby out with the bathwater&#160;:P --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyOliver_4b95.html" title="User:TommyOliver">TommyOliver</a> 01:04, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Don't misunderstand. The article <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a> is fine. The problem is that the article in <i>this</i> afd is an attempt to take all the unreferenced information that didn't belong in the main article and put it in a single list. That's why <i>this</i> list needs to be deleted, but the main article is ok. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 00:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. "(random webcomic) by (red link to nonexistent author article) mentioned AYBABTU in its January 31 strip" is not notable material. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 03:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - after comparing the two articles, it looks like the best and most verifiable references are already in the main All Your Base article. It's not a good sign when a sub-article has to reference its parent article. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 10:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The issue isn't if the list is "interesting" or "relevant". It's that the entire list is unverified and unreferenced.

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete and replace</b> I'm persuaded by the argument that such a list might be useful as a standalone page. I suggest deleting the current page (an exhaustive list is still indiscriminate collection) and extracting the list of notable references from the main article. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaligron_d32d.html" title="User:Saligron">Saligron</a> 00:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I'll support that suggestion, assuming the number of such verifiable references is large enough to warrant a subarticle. If the verifiable list fits comfortably in the main article, then in that case there's no need to split it off. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
