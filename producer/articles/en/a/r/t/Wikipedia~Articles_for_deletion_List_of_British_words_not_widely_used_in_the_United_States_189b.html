<li><b>Strong keep</b> this encyclopedia is written in mixed British-, Irish-, Austrialian-, Canadian- and American-English. That's a given and won't change. It is a useful guide to understand both articles and source material to have a list such as this. Most encyclopedias have some detailed preface explaining what is meant by certain terminology, but WP is not paper and no page precedes any other. Having a resource available (not so much as a usage guide but as a usefulness tool) is important, not that different from having lots of articles like <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_customary_units_40bb.html" title="United States customary units">United_States_customary_units</a>, Metrified_English_unit, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_unit.html" title="Imperial unit">Imperial_unit</a>, etc. whose chief contents are their equivalents tables so that <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> users aren't stumped if they want to know the height in <i>metric</i> units of a horse measuring so-many hands high, how long a race measured in furlongs is, just how much is 20,000 leagues under the sea, the whole nine yards, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 18:03, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONGEST KEEP POSSIBLE</b>. That article is part of a whole series on "American and British English differences," and its deletion would just screw up the whole project and send *years* of work right down the tube. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a> 19:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Mr. Proto and the guys who voted delete most likely didn't even bother reading the article. There's a whole Category named <i>American and British English differences</i>, check it out if you have the time. Somebody mentioned <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="American and British English differences">American and British English differences</a>. Well, that's only the main article. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States_481c.html" title="List of British words not widely used in the United States">List of British words not widely used in the United States</a> is a frigging spinoff of the main article—should this article be deleted, the main article would be incomplete. Lexical differences between AmE and BrE are extraordinarily complex; they are NOT dealt with in the main article, they couldn't be dealt with in one single article: indeed, they span three different spinoffs, which are complementary to each other; the page the guys want to get rid of is one of these. Additionally, these guys don't seem to know much about linguistics. OK, I allow that the article could use some cleanup (nothing on that page can be traced to that "fart slang," btw) but deleting it sure would be a gigantic, unprecedented mistake. The article IS well-sourced. And it ain't no list of definitions, why don't you *read* that cottonpicking article, it ain't no list of definitions any. "...<i>Too subject to determine what qualifies as "widely used" and cite each example...</i>" Come on, we have books on British and American English, we have papers, we have style guides, we have corpus data, we have dictionaries. Delete that frigging article, and I'll quit. You can't do this to me. Shame on you. "Proto," you weren't even around when this article got started. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a> 22:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>JackLumber, I don't mind you having an opinion one way or another, but please keep <b><a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a></b>. Your tone and language are unacceptable. I should also remind you to <b><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a></b>. I can't speak for others, but I <i>did</i> read the article. As a result, and for the reasons given, my opinion is <i>delete</i>. I see no notice on the article page that it is part of any "project" (a <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikiproject_8329.html" title="WP:Wikiproject">wikiproject</a> or otherwise), hence my question. A "to-do" list on the talk-page didn't strike me as a "project", other than maybe your own personal project. The article might be "old", but that's no hallmark of encyclopedic value in and of itself. Some matters raised here have not yet been addressed, such as the subjective nature of the article. For example, the nature of "widely used" has no clear meaning, being left entirely up to each person's perception. You refer on the talk page to words "deserving" to be in the article, but how is an editor to know how a word is "deserving" when the criteria are subjective? I stand by my opinion to delete. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe not a "project" in the wiki sense—I meant *the whole category*. We are just trying to provide a thorough, comprehensive, in-depth study of the differences between the two main dialects of the English language. As for that "clear meaning" thing, we have books on British and American English, we have papers, we have style guides, we have corpus data, we have dictionaries, we have papers about word frequencies in British and American corpora and databases, we know whether a word is widely used or not and we know what that means. Stand your ground, I don't care. You're gonna lose. I can assume good faith, I can't assume nescience. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a> 23:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC) And there's no need to <b>SHOUT</b>.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - frankly, I'm at a loss to understand why somebody would want to delete this article. Some of the most useful parts of encyclopædiæ are the tables or lists usually incorporated or added as appendices.
