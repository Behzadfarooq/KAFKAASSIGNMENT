<p>Comment from anon (User:132.236.209.126: I do not believe this article should be deleted. How is passwird.com any different than EBay or Froogle. Both those sites are the same as Passwird.com. They find deals and post them for you. Froogle is most like passwird.com and there is a Froogle wikipedia link. Froogle allows you to find deals for certain products. Passwird automates this for you. The site makes no money and is made to simply help others find bargains online just like Froogle.</p>
<p>Please consider this before deleting this page. I believe this page should be kept online.</p>
<ul>
<li>response to anon: eBay is an auction site not a list of bargains and has entered the public consciousness (i.e. people know about it without having ever used it themselves). Froogle, although not as widespread at the moment, is part of the ever-expanding Google empire. Both are therefore notable. Passwird.com is a website where a student is trying to make money from affiliate links. Not notable.

<li>Neither inclusionism nor exclusionism is a crime or sin. Klo is noted for votes that include/exclude all of a category that isn't policy, similar to many of Kappa's votes, rather than explaining what fact about the topic meets what policy. That doesn't make him encyclopedically significant enough for an article. If Ms. Cassaro is a mailbot as suggested below, I doubt that's pioneering enough or widely enough noted for an article. Its contents as it stand show no reason to differentiate Ms. Cassaro from hundreds of other shills doing a job that has an impersonal feather-touch upon the e-mail accounts of a few thousand people in one place. Do the students at Cornell's joint projects in places like Hong Kong have their educational experience revolutionized by the name on their internal announcements? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:46, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>You see in the opposing system to communism ,Capitalism , people can work very little but get paid very much. Now ,you may see this as an oppertunity but let me assure you it is not, for only 10% of people have 60% of the worlds wealth between them"</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I have long been acqainted with the Freeman family - specifically with the late Jim Freeman Jr. - and submitted the related articles while I was working on a project for the Walker County (Alabama) Historical Society. The family has done an enormous amount of good for the community of Jasper and the state of Alabama - as well as the city and state of New York (where they raised their children on Park Ave. and in White Plains), and while they remain a generous and somewhat legendary local entity, I suppose Jim Freeman's (James Freeman Jr.) entry doesn't qualify for placement with wikipedia. While his information is accurate (he was indeed <i>asked</i> by Reagan to serve as Labor Sec, but declined in favor of retirement/ also, did date Ms. Shirley Temple as a young, fifteen year old teenager while she was filming a movie on location in Hawaii - the relationship being more interesting than notable), his work with Union Carbide - and a socially/politically connected life - hardly qualifies him as an encyclopedic article. His heritage was quite distinguished (did in fact <i>drop out</i> of the naval academy, however, using his father's connections had the dismissal recorded as "medical"/ after rejecting a military career, followed more in his grandfather's footsteps of business and politics), and while the family's legacy continues to some extent, I will surrender the entry for deletion. My reason for such an awkwardly long comment here is that, after by chance coming across the "up for deletion" message on his page, I wanted to explain the submission of his bio in the first place - out of respect. Thank you for the work you do, I think this is a fantastic reservoir of information. --Original Author 08:17, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. I appreciate the author's thoughtful and judicious comments as well as his or her contribution of research. The story of Mr. Freeman is of interest, but his notability is primarily through family connections.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is redundant. Wikipedia has it's way of creating lists which has the ability to automatically group new articles in a category. Because a wikipedia's category can also serve as an article (it holds text and automatically groups the articles), the hand-made lists are a very poor way of doing things. So, to enforce wikipedia's way of doing things and to clean it up in the process, the deletion of this article in favour of a category listing is the right thing to do. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Maciel</a> 11:47, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, I believe you are wrong. The category pages are just like the article pages, with the added bonus of organizing the lists automatically. The category page can have an article if you write one there. Plenty of category pages have articles written in them. Therefore, a category page is better suited for list articles than a regular article. Nonetheless, the list article in question doesn't have content in it, which makes this a non-issue. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Maciel</a> 17:54, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, lists and categories can exist simultaneously. Lists can sort info in more ways than just alhabetically (like this one does). Can add birth dates in case of people. Non-existent articles should be created. But it's always better to create articles than mere stubs. If a link is blue, people expect an article, not just a few lines of text. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:24, May 2, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, in some cases simple list articles can coexist with category listings and in some cases they are even better suited. Still, undoubtedly category pages are better suited for this kind of list. Regarding the "better nothing than a little" point, I believe that you are wrong. If an article doesn't exist, people move on but If an article exists even in a stub form, the user has some information available. On top of that, the user can pick up where the article was left and bring in a small contribution, which is frequently done. Besides that, the stub articles are listed in a stub category, where users browse to see where they can contribute to developing articles. Therefore, there is only advantages in the "mark article as stub and add it to a category" way of doing things and so, this list (and others) is better suited as a category page instead of a simple article. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 08:06, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you wish to list an article that doesn't exist, create it, add it to the category, mark it as stub and move on, which is extremelly trivial thing to do and this has already been stated. On top of the strong points which make this the right thing to do, an article marked as stub gets the attention of contributors (being automatically listed in the stubs section), while a red link doesn't bring any added value whatsoever. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 07:54, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>When you create an article as a stub, some person has to look at it, and recategorize it as a specific <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_72d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting">type of stub</a>. Also the only type of stub that is really easy to create is <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubstub_c0ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Substub">substub</a> definitions, which are not encouraged. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:55, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The recategorization of a stub is a non-problem. But if someone believes it is a huge impediment, they should know that it is only made if the article is marked as a common stub.

<li>Lists can include red links. Lists can include more information than a category does, such as birth and death dates, nationality, a little bit of information. Do you think we should get rid of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> because we can create a category:January 1 and add it to every page linked from the January 1 article? Look at all of the information that would be lost. And are you really trying to encourage the creations of thousands of substubs? Do you know how many people would come down your head because you created a tiny article for every redlinked entry in every list page? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:16, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I already refuted those points in the past. Please read the comments above. And I'm not claiming that <b>every</b> list created in a simple article page should be converted into category page. Only the lists which are, like this one, better served with a category article should be converted/removed in detriment of the category article.

<ul>
<li><b>Note</b>: Wikipediaspace is only suitable for administrative pages. It is not a readerspace. This portal is for readers. It would therefore be entirely inappropriate to move it to Wikipediaspace. It could be moved to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Portal%7ECricket_1b4e.html" title="Portal:Cricket">Portal:Cricket</a>, for example, if people are concerned about it being in the mainspace. But then disambiguation pages are non-articles in the mainspace already - so why move it at all? <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 15:47, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This isn't a Wikiportal. A Wikiportal is a portal for editors and, as it is administrative in function, goes in Wikipediaspace. This a s portal for readers, so they can find their way round pages easier - therefore it is entirely inappropriate for it to go to Wikipediaspace. In response to concerns about this page being called Cricket (portal) it has been moved to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Portal%7ECricket_1b4e.html" title="Portal:Cricket">Portal:Cricket</a>, which is pretty much as good a solution to this as we are going to get, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 16:39, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In its current form, more of the "portal" has to do with the hosting functions of the Wikipedia project (and the WikiProject)--the kinds of things that go on the main page--than with providing a topic guide of signposts for the cricket-curious reader. So I think at least of some of this should move (see vote below). <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 16:22, 2005 Apr 30 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. VfD is not for deciding page moves. Neutrality's nomination (<i>"I'd ordinarily put this on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">requested moves</a>, but items there get much fewer outside input than at VfD..."</i>) shows this nomination has nothing to do with deletion. I urge any administrator closing this debate to not necessarily interpret the "move" votes as a consensus to move this article. People may not come to vote as the article will obviously be kept, and this is not the place to discuss page moves. If one wishes to move the page, please bring it up on the talk page of the article and on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>. â <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">à¦¦</a> 06:57, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move, delete redirect</b>. After some thought, I believe that this is a valid VfD, as it proposes to delete the redirect, thus removing all traces of the portal from the main namespace. Just like an article at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> should be about cricket, an article named Cricket (portal) should be about a portal named "cricket", or something like that; it should not be a portal itself. What the article is saying, is: "These are some useful Wikipedia articles about cricket"; it is therefore more about wikipedia itself than about cricket, and it should therefore be in the Wikipedia namespace. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 15:54, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I may comment: There is no redirect to delete, as the page has not been movedâit is customary to discuss page moves on the discussion page or on RM first. Also, deletion of redirects is discussed at RfD, not VfD. â <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">à¦¦</a> 21:17, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move</b>: Whether Wikipediaspace is appropriate or not is debatable. What is certain is that it does not belong in the article space.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 15:59, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite. To the extent that the "portal" is a guide to the topic of Cricket in Wikipedia, that should stay in with the articles. We have other forms of "guides"--for example, agglomerative articles that incorporate excerpts of content "from the main article" but that are articles on their own because the overview is more effective that way. We have the navigational aid of disambiguation pages. There clearly is some need for establishing a practice for topic guides and other relevant meta-information. Until a better one presents itself, I suggest writing them in the main article space, where this article is. The business about featuring and showcasing articles is, I think, a function purely of the <i>project</i> and not the <i>encyclopedia</i>, and it should be moved to the WikiProject page or some other page in the Wikipedia: namespace. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 16:22, 2005 Apr 30 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is there somewhere better than the delete/move/keep hellhole of Vfd (either listing in this case) to discuss a major innovation like a new type of page in the main namespace.

<li>No, being a bookstore isn't in itself notable. Since you asked, I say that being a school also isn't inherently notable. I vote to delete most high schools and elementary schools that come up for VfD. Accredited universities are notable. They are relatively few in number and usually have distinguishing characteristics. A few high schools may be notable, but vanishingly few elementary schools are notable. At the high school level and below there are a practically infinite number of schools, scarcely distinguishable from each other. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 03:42, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a page that was created by a single user about a video game that's a fan-made reconstruction of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_3_fdda.html" title="Final Fantasy 3">Final Fantasy 3</a> (which in America, never really sold that well anywayâ¦) and <b>it's not finished</b>. I'm sorry, but it's just too soon to write about this game. If it can boast over let's say 100,000 or so users, then yes, maybe it can be added back. But at this point, it's way, way too obscure for an encyclopedia. Wikipedia is not a place for promotion of personal projects. Let's remove this article from now until it achieves some wider notoriety outside the community of FF remake fans. ---<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlj7_e64d.html" title="User:Carlj7">Carl</a> 17:06, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>I don't see the big deal. Yeah, it's unfinished, but it has information about the game if anyone was interested about Final Fantasy fan games, and it can always be expanded apaun.

<li>Careful with the personal attacks. I've been nice up until now and I don't think it's too much to expect the same in return. Go back and read each of the articles you mentioned. Feel free to Google them as well. I think the articles more than sufficiently cite the notability of their subjects. The "Crusader 101" is one of the most collectable toy cars of the postwar era and when one comes up on eBay, the bidding gets fast and furious. At least one eBay store does a land office business selling reproduction parts. It was also the cover subject of a national publication. "Clutch Cargo" introduced a new optical printing technology and Lalo Guerrero was a national treasure by any yardstick (including that of a President of the United States) and a man I'm proud to have known. I hope this game takes off. I really do. I <i>love</i> FFIII. However, it simply doesn't ring the notability bell at this point. - Lucky 6.9 07:26, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't attacking you, I was giving examples. The point was that those aren't popular topics, yet those are good articles. I'm saying that it doesn't need to be popular to be a good article that deserves a place in an encyclopedia. The reason that encyclopedias leave somethings out is because of it can't cover everything. It has limited space. That's the wonder about Wikipedia; There is so much more information here. And one of the reasons for deletion is that it isn't popular enough. I think that's just totally bogus, no offence. There's never anything wrong with having more information. PS: I seem to be inadvertanly attacking you a lot. Do note that none of it has been on purpose. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDooz0_65f1.html" title="User:Dooz0">Dooz0</a> 20:40, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry, but that is total bullshit. We are <i>not</i> deleting your pride and esteem, we are deleting what you <i>think</i> is your pride and esteem. Which is silly of you to begin with. You have worked for three years on a game that, from the looks of it, will be polished, will be playable, and possibly will even be <i>good</i>--something that many <i>published</i> games can't honestly boast of (<a href="../../../b/a/t/Baten_Kaitos_3518.html" title="Baten Kaitos">Baten Kaitos</a> for example). Be proud of <i>that</i>. Take esteem in <i>that</i>. Because you <i>should</i>. Three years is an incredible amount of work and dedication, and you have <i>every</i> right to be proud of yourself. What you should <i>not</i> do, however, is be offended when we tell you that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a crystal ball, is not for advertisements, and is not for vanity.

<li>Calm down, OK? No one wants to injure your pride. Look, if you're the one going through the hard work of writing and designing the game, why not move the info to your user page? All you have at present is an odd little sentence. This way, the information stays intact and when the game takes off, boom! Transfer it to a new article. - Lucky 6.9 07:29, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll do you one better, Nakey--build your own website and link it to your user profile. When I first got here trying to promote my book <i><b>Almasheol</b></i> I found that Wikipedia, like most major bookstores, has an innate prejudice against <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-publishing.html" title="Self-publishing">P.O.D. house-produced books</a>. It bothered me somewhat, but eventually I accepted it. I realize I could sell a thousand copies each of <i><b>Almasheol</b></i> and <i><b>Postcards of the Hanging</b></i> and still not be seen as anything more than a two-bit "vanity" publisher. I'm sure if I published through a legitimate mainstream house, they'd welcome me gladly, but until then, I'm experimenting with web-distributed chapbooks, 'zines, and other alternative publishing channels. Perhaps you can donate copies of your game to public and school libraries--better distribution, great publicity stunt. It's what I'm planning to do with my books. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Iconoclast_bf11.html" title="User:The Iconoclast">The_Iconoclast</a> 19:52, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

</li>
<li>Not yet. I've won a couple of minor awards, though, for my work in <i>Writer's Digest</i>-sponsored contests (who have done quite a bit to legitimize self-published writers, God bless 'em). I even did a web-interview last year, and some movie people I've talked to think one of my stories has great film potential. I'm afraid, however, I still haven't seen what I'd call "mainstream" success. Whatever that is. I'm trotting a new novel around to legitimate houses through an agent this time, though all they seem to be doing so far is drinking my wallet dry. Ten-percenters, yeesh. The thought of paying someone to print your work is such a stigma, so the P.O.D. writer will always labor under a cloud--but I do enjoy designing my own covers and I like the freedom the format offers. The major houses are very cliquey and incestuous, wanting to stay with big names and not giving new authors a chance. A thought: are there competitions for self-produced video games? Once N.N. has a workable prototype of his game, he could send it to them for a review. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Iconoclast_bf11.html" title="User:The Iconoclast">The_Iconoclast</a> 14:41, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I just made a daring stunt as a final slap in your face by editing the article so that it meets your standards of being notable and popular. While I agree that vanity pages should not exist here (pages created to promote one's self or one's work), I still think it deserves to <b>stay</b> because it has an informative approach and it certainly does have significance as stated in the opening of the article. I realize it will be deleted nonetheless, so go ahead and have a field day. Moving it to my user page would defeat the purpose -- I only registered so that I could create the article. The fact is, KR will never be notable or famous according to yous, but its mere oppressed existence is more than evidence of encyclopedic qualification. Or something?? Nobody cares about a Naked Nerd, other than wanting to get rid of him. So LATER dudes. --<a href="../../../n/a/k/User%7ENakednerd_3f1c.html" title="User:Nakednerd">Nakednerd</a> 12:20, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sigh...NN, first calm down. Second, consider the fact that you're adding an article about a as-yet unreleased product on a general reference site with articles on people, places and things that have come before. Simply put, Wikipedia is quite possibly the world's biggest stinkbomb of a site when it comes to promotion of any kind. I work in an advertising and marketing capacity. I've won awards for my schtick. I <i>cannot</i> write an article in the same breezy style I write a radio ad. Wikipedia is dry, <i>dry,</i> <b>dry.</b> I think "Kefka's Revenge" is going to be a knockout. When that time comes and it's a well-known game, it'll be more than deserving of an article and I'll defend its right to be here. Don't leave over this. You're obviously an intelligent (if sensitive) person. I can <i>really</i> relate with the "sensitive" part. - Lucky 6.9 22:02, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Among the article content added in the latest edit is "The responses were discouraging and impetuously negative, yet the duo retained their integrity and superiority." The disclaimer at the end, though valid, lacks encyclopedic style. Encyclopedias need much less bogosity (except on 01-April, which this isn't). And Lucky 6-point-9 was correct: It's got possible future notability but doesn't yet have verifiable notability to WP's standards. For now, you can userfy all this, and once there's a hundred thousand or some huge numbers of players in several English-speaking nations (this is the "en." Wikipedia), you are welcome to put it back into article namespace as a starting point for other editors to work with. And Lucky's also correct that you're fully welcome to help the rest of us collaborate, regardless of whether your article gets deleted in this case. By the way, "playing the villain" is a more interesting approach than most games have, and KR has a better chance than most computer games to achieve notability. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:19, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>NN, I don't think you get the point. Just beacuse it exists does not make it notable. It must be notable in order to stay on Wikipedia. Kefka's Revenge, so far, has no notability whatsoever.

I've written about some rather esoteric subjects myself. BUT: Everything I've written about is notable in some way and I go to great pains to indicate that in each article.

<li>Look, man, think of the <i><b>precedent</b></i> this would be setting. Do you have any idea how many fangames there are that can claim to be of similar quality and merit to Kefka's Revenge? Not that <b>are</b>, but that <b>can claim to be</b>. What makes this different from all the creative and fanfic projects that <i>I</i> started, or that anyone else does? What makes it inherently better? What makes <b>you</b> so special? Those aren't necessarily rhetorical questions, by the way. If you have valid answers, by all means, this is the place to provide them. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 17:21, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I never said we're special. And I dont want to exlude other fangames, either. That's why I listed them in my article. I dont see anything wrong with having fangames on this encyclopedia website. If you want it to be so professional then maybe it should be published instead of being openly editable. Isn't it the point to allow the community to add more content? I understand sometimes stuff would be inappropriate and not worthy, but surely this article is developed and informative enough to warrent a small page of its own. No big deal. --<a href="../../../n/a/k/User%7ENakednerd_3f1c.html" title="User:Nakednerd">Nakednerd</a> 18:43, 6 May 2005 (UTC) And by the way, we're special because we have playable content, something that most other games never achieve. That's stated in the article, I believe.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable. There are thousands upon thousands of user-created mods to old Nintendo ROMs, or games which individuals have made with shareware RPG maker type software. Notability in the case of an independently developed video game would probably require some sort of legitimate site reviewing it, at the very least. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 18:48, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article appears to be at least half BS. How could you draw up a pie graph like that? I mean, how would you calculate the percentages? And at the end of one section, it says that the section is bogus. Sure, a fan-made game like this <i>could</i> be notable enough, but I'm not seeing any evidence that this one is. Delete. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:06, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You guys are using the word NOTABLE so damn much that I had to go look up its definition to make sure I remembered what it means. It means something is worthy of notice, or is characterized by excellence or distinction. By this definition, I see no valid reason why KR' "non-notability" should render it deletable. I think it certainly <b>is</b> notable according to this definition. It mentions nothing about FAME or FORTUNE like all you seem to value so much. The game I am making is remarkable. I don't care how many people are unaware of it yet, but it's true. So stop going delete crazy on my notable project. Either that or come up with a better argument. If fame is your game, then youre lame. HA! (but do NOT take it personally) because as stated before, there exists other articles pertaining to lesser known topics.

<dd>This is a private address, It is not registered to any organisation.</dd>

<dd>Without publishing its accounts it is not an official organisation, I do not have to prove that it is not publishing accounts, YOU have to prove that it IS publishing accounts.</dd>

<dd>Google is a search engine and so can't be used for referencing.</dd>
<dd>The only reference for it on the BBC website is in the 'action network' section and was written by the organisation itself and has not been updated for almost 3 years.

<li><b>Comment</b> It has been mentioned that the address is a residential address, I would just like to point out that that isn't true. There are many businesses resident in the same building as the provided address, and it appears on the satellite images, and internet research to be an office building of some sort. Also the claim it only has 50 members is shot down by the graph at the bottom of the main page that clearly shows exactly how many members it has, looks to be around 200 members. Not a lot I'll agree, but more than 50. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 16:38, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Important Comment</b>. I find it interesting to note that the OP's very first edit on Wikipedia was to this article, to add something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105053001" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105053001" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. A couple of days later he added more information on it being controversial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105719742" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105719742" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. This was then deleted by an anon user, but RepublicUK then altered the article again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109294595" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109294595" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, seemingly knowing something going on about the organisation. The following day he nominated the article for deletion. I'm sorry but I feel there is something else going on here, the OP expands the article, adds some bits that are removed and then nominates it for deletion. Almost all the OPs edits are to this article. Call me old fashioned but there could be something else going on here with this nomination, I think someone may be trying to make a point and this nomination is in bad faith and singleminded against his declared membership of Republic (whatever that may be). His contribs also seem to show a singleminded push against the organisation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RepublicUK" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RepublicUK" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 17:01, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are no references in the article and there is no indication that there has been any notice taken of this organisation by media or official bodies to signify its notability. Simple "keep" statements without verification are discountable. The BBC mention is not a news item but a post from the organisation itself by the look of it. If editors want this article kept, I suggest they get to work on it very quickly. At the moment there is no justification <i>in the article itself</i> for not deleting it. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. After much comment on this page I'm going to call for a delete on this. I can find no notability on the net for it outside of bits the organisation itself has posted or comments on forums. Even the webpage for the organisation seems confused as to what it is calling itself the "United Commonwealth Society" in most places rather than "Federal Commonwealth Society," and "United Commonwealth Society" receives exactly 0 Google hits which is damningly low (oddly enough doesn't even pick up the main site). Even the threads on the forums seem concerned more with less serious issues (not in itself damning) and seems more like a collection of like minded people (for the most part) hanging out rather than trying to achieve anything. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 08:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Can we be clear on this. The same editors may not turn up on the same AfDs. The same or similar editors may not reach the same conclusions as each other. Is this a Wikipedia policy? "Block-voting" is your <b>personal</b> opinion. What have you and User:Tyrenius (who regularly support each other and vote exactly the same way) been telling other users about personal opinions? Really, I think your attitude towards other users is outrageous and wrong. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 09:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is my take (and MrDarcy may have something different to say): editors often turn up on the same AfDs because they have the same interests. The problem occurs when those editors merely express biased opinions based on whether they approve of the subject or not, without attempting to objectively apply non-negotiable policies such as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, or guidelines such as <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. No one attempting to do this could possibly argue for the retention of this article. This does become a matter of concern and needs to be addressed. MrDarcy and I have taken the same stance on this article, because any non-biased editor would have to&#160;!vote delete, if they were following policy. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well said. The only thing that I would add is that I was pointing out that when those editors are expressing the SAME biased opinions, using the SAME flawed justifications, it looks like users are acting in concert to sway Wikipedia in one direction. And that, to me, is unacceptable. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 01:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Folks don't forget that some of us that 'voted KEEP' have actually posted material that we thought supported the position (the Africa Crises one where someone was making fun of the FCS as a racist organization that would support an "white" South Africa in particular looked 'good' to me at the time I added to this discussion), I have of course after review conceeded that the blog in question doesn't pass the 'reliable' test...

<dd>It's obviously not directed at you, because you are doing what should be done, namely searching to see if references are available to justify the article, not just saying keep based only on personal preference.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> in general agreement with MrDarcy and also per my comment previously. I am disappointed that those wishing to retain the article do not seem to understand that this cannot be achieved merely by expressing an opinion, but only by providing proof through verifiable sources that substantiate notability. Otherwise the comments might just as well not have been written. I would ask the closing admin also to comment on this, if s/he feels it appropriate, for the benefit of contributing editors, as the problem is not restricted to this AfD. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment on comments</b> This bickering is quite irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether it is in accord with anyone's views or in conflict with them.

Also, as I stated (before the entire contents of this page were blanked), references to this person keep appearing on the<a href="../../../d/i/s/Disc_Jockey_a8ee.html" title="Disc Jockey">Disc Jockey</a> page, even though he is unimportant, and has no reason to be referenced there.<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.254.0.38.html" title="User:62.254.0.38">62.254.0.38</a> 08:04, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

If a hundred of you vote one way, and one logged-on user with a good contribution history votes against you, then I'd consider the vote won by the logged-on contributor.

<li><b>Merge and redirect.</b> She is notable. I knew instantly who was the subject of the article just from the name. She has been active on the TV Guide Channel since her American Idol appearances and is currently part of pop culture. She actually gets more entertainment news coverage than many other previous contestants, even some who made it further in the competitions. Since there is an American Idol entry, this would probably be the best place for her, but I can see people trying to look her up by name, thus the redirect. -- <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_Finney_c6cd.html" title="User:Glen Finney">Glen Finney</a> 19:51, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><small>Ok, you have the same IP address. But in Wikipedia, it is one user, one vote. And truely, other than people from your school voting for "keep" of the article, no one else has came over and voted to keep. I would not be surprised if an admin will discount the Annon. votes. If you do not want this situation to happen again, why not just create an account so this mess will not be happening. Plus, the main reason why most people want the article to be gone is that Wikipedia is not primarily used as a dictionary. That is where Wikitonary comes into play. It is also the meere fact that only a small group of people use this word and we are not a collection site of slang terms. Try the urban dictionary, or your wesbite to spread this term, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 20:51, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>im the person that made this site and just so you all know how does a word start other than by someone taking the initiative to put it somewhere that people see it, and you said that wikipedia is NOT a dictionary so this means it should accept all terms that have meaning or sentimental value to people <small>Comment by 141.157.76.84</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I said earlier that you should put the term on YOUR personal website or YOUR blog, not Wikipedia. Though if you want to take the effort to make a word popular, more power to you, but Wikipedia is not the place to do it. Plus, this word does not have much meaning to many people, other than your schoolmates. That, to us, is not notable. If the term is used by half of the United States, we might think about it, but it is not. We got rid of terms before that were created, just like Squeegified, and we got rid of terms that appear in placed like the Urban Dictionary. I want you and your friends to read <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">this</a> to see where me and the others are coming from. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 21:18, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>okay, i get where your coming from, but I would like to say that this word is not one that is only used by one kind of group, also that this is not a slang word because it isn't a shorter version of a word that we are to lazy to sound out. This is a word made up be people for people, which is how most words start and i therefore think it should be allowed to stay.</p>
<p><br />
If you want to vote keep, that is fine with me. But I am just explaining on why myself and others do not want the word to be in Wikipedia. As for you claiming that the word is wide-spread, I have two words for you: prove it. Show us links, show us a Google search, show us stuff. Plus, since it is a made-up word, people might have some issue with that. As I said before, if the page here is whacked, then why not just start a website or a blog and then use the word there. It will still not be on Wikipedia, but I do not mind if you use the other methods to spread this word. I do not know if it will catch on. BTW, I want to clariify some of the votes people casted:</p>
<ul>
<li>NN=Not Notable. Usually, this means that this person/place/thing/word/event/etc. is not really important to the world at large. Though the above things might be meaningful to some people, to most the world, they do not care.</li>
<li>Negoloism=That word is defined as a word that is just mainly in local use. This word qualifies at that, since it is only used by you and your pals.</li>
<li>DicDef=Dictionary Defintion. As I mentioned above, we have a project that deals with just dictionary terms, so articles that are usually just terms are frowned upon.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know you want to keep the page, which I have no problems with, but I just think that this article will be deleted. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 21:35, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>do you want me to put the names that go with the comments that have no names? also when we said widespread we were referring to our area.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, but I am not sure it will affect the voting or not.
