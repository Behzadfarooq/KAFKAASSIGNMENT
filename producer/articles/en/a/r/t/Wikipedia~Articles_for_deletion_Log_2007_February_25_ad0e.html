<li><b>Keep for now</b>, at least, so I, as the starting author, can throw some more on it. A lookup on Google of <i>The "Artists' Studio" Fishers</i> (a look up of <i>The Artists' Studio</i> is too vague as many claim that or a variation of that name) gets about 13 thousand entries, which may seem insignificant, but a related article, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Repertory_Theatre_9dcd.html" title="Indiana Repertory Theatre">Indiana Repertory Theatre</a>, gets only about 58 thousand entries. Considering Indiana Repertory Theatre has existed much longer as a theatre, The Artists' Studio is apparently getting it's name out there. The Google search being said, I was unsure as to whether it really was Wikipedia worthy or not.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Reasons for keeping are:</b></i> "Notability is not popularity" (This theatre has made an impact on theatre in Indiana being one of the few of it's kind to feature a more family setting on a regular basis, especially on classes on non-covered material as of yet [also known as: give it time]).</p>
<p>"Notability criteria do not equate to personal or biased considerations, such as: "never heard of this". . ."only of interest to [some group]". . ." (To those that do know it, which in context to the world is not many at all, this article could be of quite a bit of use in informing people about the theatre and history of itself. The fact this theatre is new should not detract from it's effect on the surrounding community, no matter how small you may consider it to be in the grand scheme of things)</p>
<p>"In order to have a neutral article, a topic should be notable enough that the information about it will be from unbiased and unaffiliated sources" (This theatre has been featured in articles ranging from very local to statewide in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>, though many may not be published online.)</p>
<p>"Obscure content isn't harmful" (Just because you don't know it doesn't mean you need to get rid of it. It also doesn't mean YOU even need to read it, though it would be nice if you did when it was anywhere near ready <b>:)</b>)</p>
<p><i><b>Reasons for deleting are:</b></i> "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate directory of businesses, websites, persons, etc. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia." (An argument can definitely be made that this article is nothing more than a business entry, but the fact that there is a history, and that a decent size article can be made out of it, almost shoots this down.</p>
<p>"The subjective nature of notability is merely an issue of defining a guideline for it." (Clearly, if you don't agree with the selections I pulled above from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> then you don't agree with keeping this article.)</p>
<p><i>But seriously</i>, this article WAS given only SEVEN minutes before it was nominated for deletion. How about allowing a chance for anything other than a single edit (with only text and linking for that matter, not even tags, such as "stub", pictures, or even complete text/history, much less sources, etc.) before the final decision is made. After all, the classes the Artists' Studio provides and contributions to the surrounding area haven't been put in place. In fact, this article is only a fraction of what it could be, but creating a full article takes TIME. Even that section that was written took a fairly substantial amount of time.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This article is not being considered for deletion because it is incomplete. It is being considered for deletion because it does not assert notability beyond a local level, and without some basic assertion of notability, there is no article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - regardless of how fast this article was nominated, it is now on AfD and will be for 5 days. Enhanceddownloadbird, I strongly recommend that you take that time to provide sources for the article. If you don't provide sources, it is almost certain that this article will be deleted. You say above that the theater has been featured in statewide articles; it would be best if you could be as specific as possible (links to something online are clearly the most helpful, but even if the mentions aren't hosted online, someone might be able to check out any references you provide if you tell us where to look). References that are independent of the theater, high circulation, and specifically about the theater (rather than just mentioning it) are important. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 03:58, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. My personal view is that this is a loathsome article, and it breaks my heart that an encyclopedia on which I work should cover such a trivial institution. I say that with explicit regard to its position in its local community: certainly it's important there, but in the broader scheme of artistic endeavour it is of no significance whatsoever, as a cursory reading of the numerous reviews referenced in the article makes very clear. Sadly, when I check the references it is easy to see that this article meets our criteria for notability: adequate references are there, and the subject of the article clearly meets <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. Thus, with a sigh, I have to say that under our current community guidelines this article should be retained.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am quite happy to rest upon <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIGNORE_187e.html" title="WP:IGNORE">WP:IGNORE</a> here; this may technically meet notability requirements, but when one uses common sense, one sees that no real claim of notability is made or even really attempted in this article - it is just a small community theater of little or no interest to anyone outside the local area. The founders may have some slight notability themselves, but if so, they should have articles of their own.

<p>There seems to be nothing encyclopedic to say about this dish other than that it exists, i.e. the mundane fact that chicken meat may be cooked with curry powder in a variety of ways, none of which are individually notable as far as I can see. <small>(Come to think of it, might even be speediable under the letter of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A3" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A3</a>, but seems too wordy for its spirit).</small> The main interest of the article's creator seems to be to exhort the world to mind the subtle differences between "chicken curry" and "curry chicken"... –<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 01:32, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

It seems the creator is a newbee, and thus It would be appropriate if we help the author by further adding to the article. I guess the best way is to, add the various cultural histories of the curry chicken dish. <b>In addition</b>, this article can not be added to the curry article because it is not a curry dish. This is a chicken dish, NOT merely a curry dish. In addition, the contents of this article is quite large, and it will become even larger when other lovers of the curry chicken dish from different culture backgrounds, add their own historical history of this dish.</li>

<dd>Just to point out, to verification of the distinction between chicken curry and curry chicken is simple. If you look for recipes of the two dishes, they are summed up by what the article says. Nonetheless, the article has historical facts that are sourced, and is not merely distinguishing between curry chicken and chicken curry. The distinction is just there, to clarify the two dishes.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatopshotta_4554.html" title="User:Thatopshotta">Thatopshotta</a> 02:47, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>I like this article</b> As a native of India, I loved my chicken curry. As I travelled the world, I met many wonderful people. I got to taste this curry chicken dish, and I was extatic. The article has hit the point, about the subtle difference between curry chicken and chicken curry. But more than that, the historical section seems interesting.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is a distinct, legitimate point in that article. I have been to many countries, US, Canada, France, England, India, Pakistan, Jamaica..., working temp-work, mostly as a part-time chef. I have noticed for example that when I cook for a Hindu or Pakistan community, we create the dishes with very few chicken and mostly curry. This is spread over rice, and used like Dahl. However, when I have cooked for Jamaican, and West Indian communities, we/I have prepared chicken by soaking it in a special curry sauce, and so on. I am pleased to see that this article points this subtle difference in these two dishes, and I hope it can remain. I must say, I shall try that Ultimate Curry Chicken recipe on the link provided, looks fantastic!! GobtaNIndia 07:34, 28 February 2007 (UTC)GobtaNIndia

<li>I am sorry that your sorry, I think my explanation above gives reason what fried rice has to do with curry chicken. The point is, after reading these arguments above, saying "should be merged with curry article", then why is not "chicken tika masala" not merged with curry or masala. Why is "Garam Masala" not merged with masala. Why is "Aloo gobi" not merged with aloo, or gobi. That is the point. I say they should not be merged, and therefore this curry chicken should not be merged with curry. It deserves its own article, as those the articles stated in my statement.

<dd><b>Update</b> Interesting Trivia, the curry chicken article continues to grow, with facsinating facts. There is no way in my opinion, this can fit under the curry category, but above all I continue to insist that it doesn't even belong in the curry section since it is a chicken dish. Also, it has become encyclopediac content with the new updates.</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - there are lots of articles on single food types/items. It's a notable food, especially in the Caribbean where it is considered a major local dish not just in Trinidad, where almost half the population is Indian, but also in Jamaica, where the Indian population is small, and other islands where there has never been much of an Indian population at all. Merging it with <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curry.html" title="Curry">curry</a> would require a complete re-write of that article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 13:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> There is certainly a major distinction between this dish and chicken curry, as the article rather haltingly states. It could do with a rewrite though, and probably a name change - after all it's not just chicken that's prepared this way. A merge into <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curry.html" title="Curry">Curry</a> would be misleading, but it could certainly find its way into an article on West Indian cuisine. <a href="../../../c/u/i/Cuisine_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago_9d75.html" title="Cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago">Cuisine_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago</a>, possibly? <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 16:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - These articles that are being brought up maybe a part of a country's cuisine section. Also not everyone makes Curry chicken the same. Sure Curry maybe the most pronounced ingredient but there's various ways it can be prepaired. I also find it funny based on the bias on Wikipedia that someone would call this a "Mundane" article yet there's one on Spaghetti Sauce. I bet that same crowd would say *that* was a very importaint article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 17:08, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You don't really have any basis to claim that just because someone says "delete" for curry chicken that they want the spaghetti sauce article to stay. In fact, one should remember that <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion is not an indication of validity</a>. In other words, just because something "mundane" like, say <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butter.html" title="Butter">butter</a>, has an article (a featured one at that) it doesn't mean that every food item deserves an article. <font color="#1874CD"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 17:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - let them have their page. What's the problem? I see none.

<li><b>Delete</b> No sources to show notability. The precedent has been to delete articles about run of the mill middle schools. This one has nothing to satisfy the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>]. Contrary to what was claimed above, we do not need a "specific criterion which says that middle schools are not notable" to delete a middle school article. If there are references, it would be far better to simply add them than to claim they must be out there somewhere waiting to be discovered. It is my very "objective opinion" that this article lacks multiple independent reliable sources having it as a primary subject and that it is therefore non-notable. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 23:21, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article appears to be on a figure in Chinese history who, despite the article's lack of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> and style issues, may possibly be a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> historical figure. However, every Wikipedia articles requires multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> demonstrating <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and permitting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> to avoid deletion. I believe the article, despite its difficulties, provides enough contextual information that speedy delete is not warranted and would give the creator time to come up with sources during the regular delete procedure period. However, if sources are not forthcoming, the result should be <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 02:59, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well the BBC article you mention proves my point, it doesn't cover Judge Seidlin at all, it mentions him. Does that make him somehow more 'notable' than just being a jurist presising over a case? I suppose some people might consider that to be so, but i am not one of them.</dd>
<dd>Also to say the coverage is massive is first of all subjective: I believe the coverage of the death of Saddam Huissein was "massive," not this story. Also to make any kind of statement about comprehensive coverage being given to this is also I would say, very US-centric. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThethinredline_5528.html" title="User:Thethinredline">Thethinredline</a> 17:12, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><font color="#1874CD">Despite my best efforts, I could not envisage an article that is about anything other than the term <i>itself</i>. It could be an article that discusses the multiple <i>uses</i> of the term, the origins of the term, people who have been described as high-maintenance (a bad idea for a section, I think), and so on, but these are all about the term itself. Thus, <i>delete</i> per nom. Unless ... is there a noun equivalent: high-maintenance..ity? maintenanceness? maintenancousity? Ah, forget it. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</font></li>

<p><font color="#1874CD">Another article about a non-notable student <s>improv</s> stand-up group. The best claims to notability is that they were mentioned in a roundup article Time did about college stand-up groups.

Finally, although it is great three of their members were semi-finalists in the student stand-up contest on nibblebox.com, I don't know those members' individual achievements in this case are notable enough to make the entire group notable. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruth_in_Comedy_96ba.html" title="User:Truth in Comedy">Future Fun Jumper (TIC)</a> 09:09, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<li><font color="#1874CD"><b>Keep</b>. I agree that this is an example of prejudice, but it's not original research for Wikipedia to report that prejudice exists in the world. Pipes's foray into bigotry seems to have attracted something of a following (not surprising, given the current Islamophobic mood) and so is notable. The article must be NPOV, however. As others have noted, the <i>Globe</i> citation isn't to a <i>Globe</i> article that uses the term, as if a journalist found it a helpful way to describe the world. Instead, it's a column by the right-winger <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Jacoby_c465.html" title="Jeff Jacoby">Jeff Jacoby</a>, who merely cited Pipes. This should be corrected. The article should also be balanced by the inclusion of criticism, but I can't find much, although there's a good savaging by a blogger: "When airhead heiress Lizzie Grubman drove her SUV into a crowd in 2001, injuring almost twice as many people as Taheria-azar, then attempted to flee the scene while showing no concern for her victims, nobody started blathering about 'Sudden Rich White Asshole Syndrome'." (from <a href="http://www.leanleft.com/archives/2006/03/15/5313/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.leanleft.com/archives/2006/03/15/5313/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> - he even linked to our <a href="../../../l/i/z/Lizzie_Grubman_527a.html" title="Lizzie Grubman">Lizzie Grubman</a> article) The problem seems to be that most sensible commentators consider Pipes's silliness to be self-evident and not worth remarking upon. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 09:11, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</font>

<li><font color="#1874CD"><b>Comment</b>: I don't quite follow the reasoning here. I would've thought that if the wider community (or "most sensible commentators") haven't touched Pipes' term, that would be a reason <i>against</i> giving it its own article - perhaps a reason for adding it into Pipes' own article, in the manner in which other turns of phrase peculiar to certain commentators are to be found in their articles. If Pipes is the only person who uses the term to any serious extent, and if the best we can do outside of his work is to find an article which links back to him and him alone, then we're dealing with someone inventing a term which has little or no currency, aren't we? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</font>

Generally, a blog doesn't meet the standards of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as a source for a fact -- but a fact about blogs, such as that many blogs use a term, can be considered when we try to adjudicate notabiliity. In addition, there are at least a couple uses that are neither Pipes himself nor right-wing blogs, e.g. <a href="http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&amp;status=article&amp;id=256521423294106" class="external text" title="http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&amp;status=article&amp;id=256521423294106" rel="nofollow">Investor's Business Daily</a>.

<li><b>keep</b> There are certainly problems with the article. But the article is very new (last week only); and the creator is a new editor (also only a week), who has promised to provide more background and sources shortly. He also agreed to take out some of the more problematic stuff (e.g. EU-flag similarity). Hence I think this article deserves at least a fair chance to develop. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoutf_9ee7.html" title="User:Arnoutf">Arnoutf</a> 16:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Disputed <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">Prod</a>. This article fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTAL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTAL</a> - Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> states that Wikipedia should not have an article for an event if it is not almost certain it will take place. Neither <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Sky_Broadcasting_9a1d.html" title="British Sky Broadcasting">British Sky Broadcasting</a> (BSkyB) have confirmed that a service <b>will</b> be launching on <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_terrestrial_television_in_the_United_Kingdom_8a67.html" title="Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom">digital terrestrial television</a> and <a href="../../../o/f/c/Ofcom.html" title="Ofcom">Ofcom</a> have not recieved anything from BSkyB indicating it will launch a serivce. A press release of a proposed launch and a statement by Ofcom is not proof that BSkyB will be launching a service on digital terrestrial television. The service does not even have a name. The proposed service by BSkyB may not launch, hence why I bring this article to AfD. If a service is confirmed to launch, the article should be re-created with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. There is also consensus from two other editors on the talk page that the article should be deleted on these grounds. At the moment, all the references and text in the article is pure speculation and therefore fails WP:NOT#CRYSTAL. <a href="../../../t/g/h/User%7ETghe-retford_2fb2.html" title="User:Tghe-retford"><b>tghe</b>retford</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/g/h/User_talk%7ETghe-retford_e470.html" title="User talk:Tghe-retford">talk</a>)</small> 14:38, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - all that article states is that Ofcom will start a consultation <i>if</i> BSkyB approaches them to launch a service, it does not state that BSkyB are launching a service.

<li><b>Delete</b> - this is looking increasingly like a publicity stunt on the part of BSkyB as a spoiler to the launch of Virgin Media, a negotiating tactic with Top Up Tv, and scare tactic for Freeview. 2-3 weeks have now passed and by all accounts no application has been made to Ofcom, BSkyB's "timetable" is increasingly optimistic. The unlikiness, is further added to by BSkyB, at the same time, asking Ofcom to review Top Up TV's access charges. Why do they need a review of that if they are launching their own services?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO, it is not the place of Wikipedia to fight proxy wars for BSkyB. Even, <b>if</b> such a service launches, the article would need rewriting from scratch anyway, as so much is speculative or depending on regualtory approval (use of MPEG4 in wild, mix of MPEG2 and 4 on one mux, &gt;3 Sky services on Mux C, possible competition implications?, etc.) or approval from DTT partners (such as NGW, who need to ask for mux terms to be varied to carry pay services (despite last year's changes) and have even recently indicated what could be intreted as opposition to pay services). <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 15:31, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is all highly speculative and not suitable for wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I question the source is a good source. It just like a fan site and put it on a famous host site. I don't think a (good/reliable) fan site would have only one news and only one players profile. And the profile coincidence is Alessandro Dellanzo. And google reply only one result, the wiki article. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_hk_6418.html" title="User:Matthew hk"><span style="color:yellow; background-color:black;">Matthew_hk</span></a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthew_hk_d82c.html" title="User talk:Matthew hk"><i><font color="blue">t</font></i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matthew_hk_d0da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matthew hk"><i><font color="red">c</font></i></a> 12:19, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Indeed, upon closer examination the site listed as a source looks a tad fishy. It purports to be an unofficial Siena news site but essentially all that is on there is a single news item referencing this player's release and an essay talking about how said release was a mistake. Looks like something someone cooked up to support a hoax.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 12:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the website has a lot more than that. How could you accuse someone of making a hoax website? My friend Liam, who is a huge Siena fan, set up that website. He was the one that told me about Alessandro Dellanzo in the first place. He has just set up the website. Give him a chance to put everything on it.<a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArunby_24a3.html" title="User:Arunby">Arunby</a> 16:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Fair enough, there is more stuff on the site now, but there wasn't at the time I made my earlier comment..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 16:30, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> But you obviously make very quick assumptions. And another thing, if Chris Fagan and Antonio Bryan are nominated for deletion, why isn't each and every youth team player who hasn't made a first team appearance nominated? Aren't you using double standards by allowing Diego Alliaudi, Natureza, Sergio Tejera, Rhys Taylor, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Roberts_%28footballer%29_3e81.html" title="David Roberts (footballer)">David Roberts</a>, <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Flynn_6afb.html" title="Ryan Flynn">Ryan Flynn</a> etc. to not be nominated?

<li>If I'd realised those articles existed then I'd have nominated them too. Now that you've drawn them to my attention I can nominate them <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 21:20, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> ChrisTheDued, why are you accusing my website of being "cooked up to support a hoax"? I am a die hard fan of Siena, and I decided to set up a website with news items and my own opinion. I'd done half an hour's work and you were already calling it "a tad fishy". I'd like to see you set up a fan site in half an hour. Then I could call your site "a tad fishy" and "something someone cooked up". LiamArunby'sBuddy 16:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Frankly, after doing a quick scan of MapArt I think I can safely say that the <i>only</i> remotely encyclopedic roads in Markham are continuations of roads that start <i>outside</i> of Markham; there doesn't appear to be a single road <i>exclusive</i> to Markham which really merits an article. <b>Delete</b>; a one-mile road through an industrial park which exists mainly as a connecting link between two other non-encyclopedic roads isn't particularly deserving of an article. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 21:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, look! John Street's up for AFD too! And will ya look at <b>that</b>: Pharmacy Road <i>isn't</i> Regional Road 71; all <i>this</i> road does is <i>intersect</i> with a street that <i>eventually</i> becomes RR71. And even then, being a connecting link between two other roads is <i>not</i> a legitimate claim of notability — the key to whether a street belongs in an encyclopedia or not isn't whether it exists, but how likely it is that somebody who lives hundreds of miles away, and has <i>never</i> been to Markham in their lives, has <i>already</i> heard of the street, because it has a cultural context that <i>transcends</i> its streetness. You know, like Broadway or Park Avenue or Yonge Street or Sussex Drive or Sunset Boulevard. Esna Park Drive is simply <i>not</i> in that category of roads. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:58, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep but completely rewrite</b> First, I have found many articles from reputable sources by searching for him on Google (both under "Samir Patel" and his full name, "Samir Sudhir Patel"). <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/02/AR2005060201924.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/02/AR2005060201924.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> from the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2464605" class="external text" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2464605" rel="nofollow">this</a> from <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> are both about Samir, among other spellers. There are a bunch of articles from Indian sources about the success of Samir and other Indian-American spellers, including the winner when Samir was runner-up. And then, of course, there are tons of major web sites that give Bee results word for word or report on the final rounds. As important as the media mentions, however, is something I've argued a few times before, which is that anyone who competes at this level of the National Spelling Bee- making the final two and high finishes three times- passes the sportsperson criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (if you count spellers as sportspeople) by competing at the highest level of their "sport". The National Spelling Bee is broadcast on major networks (ESPN and ABC) in prime time; it is watched by millions of people, and to reach the final rounds of the Bee, a speller must defeat not only 200+ other spellers at the national competition, but millions of others (if I recall correctly, Scripps estimates that 10 million children compete in feeder/qualifier bees, though this of course includes school bees with children that have no aspirations of going further). A speller must put in as much time at his craft as any other competitor (I don't know about you, but I don't want to read dictionaries and study word roots for five hours per day, six days per week), and to finish second place in an historic, nationally-televised competition is enough for an article in my opinion. With all of that said, this article is absolutely terrible and should probably be stripped of 95% of its content. Still, the 5% that remains is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says <b>a</b> primary subject, not <b>the</b> primary subject, and he is a primary subject of at least two of them. (The 'word nerds' ref starts with the sentence "Meet Samir Patel.") I just added another one where you can tell he is the primary subject from just the title, if that is important. So now there are definitely <b>multiple non-trivial published works</b>. But this is not the only way to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; it also states that competing at the highest level in a competitive activity itself considered notable is a sufficient criterion, which he does. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 19:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The most important criterion is multiple non-trivial published works about the subject and not the fact that he competed at the highest level of competitive activity. As <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states "The following criteria make it _likely_ that sufficient reliable information is available about a given person. People who satisfy at least one of these criteria may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available." If he had competed at high level of competitive activity and had no reliable published works about him, then he would not be notable (although that's unlikely as the guideline suggests). I do think that there is sufficient material has been added to the article at this point to change my recommendation. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarfieldian_373f.html" title="User:Warfieldian">Warfieldian</a> 23:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can understand having articles about current royalty. But since the Italian monarchy was abolished a long time ago, this baby doesn't fall under that notability category.

<li><b>Keep</b>. About as noteworthy as, say, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Atheism_Tapes_7477.html" title="The Atheism Tapes">The Atheism Tapes</a>, which I doubt we'll see deleted. I find the arguments made in the documentary absolutely atrocious, but it's by far one of the most noteworthy and high-profile atheism-related documentaries. As Walton noted, "this show was fairly high-profile in the UK when it was on, and I recall it being mentioned in magazines and such"; that makes it noteworthy, all we lack are some reliable secondary sources to give this article some substance. (Much like we need exactly that for The Atheism Tapes, etc.) I'm not British, or I'd look for some print news sources about this myself; could anyone here check up on that? As for the POV soapbox issue, that's not relevant here, as it's a content issue. It's also one I've already fixed, as I removed the "atheist fundamentalist scientists" and "other religious beliefs" misnomers, and the rest of the article is perfectly fine (reporting on a POV is not the same as <i>having</i> a POV). It's also simply untrue that this article doesn't have encyclopedic content. I don't see the need to resort to these weak arguments when the only argument you need is "it lacks references", and that should be our focus—find sources, in print if they can't be spotted through the blogosphere online. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 21:29, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree that this has equal notability with the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism_tapes.html" title="Atheism tapes">atheism tapes</a>, but in both cases all that can be written is then a summary of the program. I guess that can be done well, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_root_of_all_evil__6b64.html" title="The root of all evil?">The root of all evil?</a>, but I doubt in this case that it will ever get to encyclopedic quality. I'm keeping my <i>delete</i> vote until I see at least one reasonable editor that will promise to work on this article. If anybody votes "keep": I will adopt this article, then you can discount my delete vote, but until then, I think the soapbox concerns are valid. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 22:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's perfectly fair, but then we should be consistent. Let's nominate <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Atheism_Tapes_7477.html" title="The Atheism Tapes">The Atheism Tapes</a> for deletion too. (Not for the sake of POV "fairness", but for the sake of consistency with our referencing standards as applied to this class of articles.) That article is in any case doubly unnecessary because it's about an offshoot for <i>another</i> non-noteworthy atheism documentary, <a href="../../../a/_/r/Atheism%7E_A_Rough_History_of_Disbelief_3c3b.html" title="Atheism: A Rough History of Disbelief">Atheism: A Rough History of Disbelief</a> (which we'll probably want to nominate as well; it's an unreferenced stub and gets 61 unique hits on Google!), which it can be incorporated into if necessary. I'll change my vote to a "Weak Keep" or a "Neutral" if we're consistent with our standards.</li>
<li>Also, I'm perfectly willing to adopt this article and help work on it, so you needn't be concerned about it becoming a soapbox. Our concern should remain focused on its lack of references, because I can help flesh out this article and keep it neutral, but I'm American and don't have any familiarity with or significant access to most of the places that would have referenced this documentary in the UK press. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:44, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm changing my vote to <i>keep</i> on this one as I promised, but I'm not so sure about the other articles; I haven't looked at how actively they are being contributed to. Generally, I prefer to keep most articles related to religion, but I have seen the word "fundamentalist atheist" a little too much recently, so apologize that I jumped on it. Now, I have been looking for sources for both this one, and the atheism tapes; but we really need somebody visiting a UK library to look for print sources. I can't help you with that. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 23:09, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I'm open to either keeping or deleting all of the unreferenced atheism documentary articles. All that matters to me is that we keep our standards consistent; otherwise it looks like we're being selective in how we apply our policies, and either keeping certain undeserving documentaries because we agree with them or deleting certain deserving documentaries because we disagree with them. The easiest way not to give this impression, as well as the best way to send a clear and unequivocal message about what Wikipedia's basic standards are for articles of this sort, is to treat all of these articles in exactly the same way so long as they are equally unreferenced. Concerns about POV advocacy are not really relevant because they're content issues that should be resolved through editing and maintenance, not deletion. Besides, this is why <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Atheism_8660.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Atheism">Wikipedia:WikiProject Atheism</a> exists: to help monitor these articles and keep them NPOV. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:22, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A word of outside advice. From my vantage point the speed at which this AfD was put up makes it look even worse. You don't want people to think that WikiProject:Atheism (where the issue was first raised right after the entry was created) is a staging ground for this. That there is an organized effort to one sidedly pinch out these entries before anyone even gets a chance to see them. I know that's not what's going on, but it could look better. Exercise a little more reasoned restraint is all I'm suggesting.<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelleSmith_2335.html" title="User:PelleSmith">PelleSmith</a> 23:14, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree. That's part of the reason why I'm trying to add a more balanced perspective on this article (and I recently heavily expanded the article as well, to show that we atheists don't solely spend time on articles espousing issues we agree with, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Root_of_All_Evil__3cc8.html" title="The Root of All Evil?">The Root of All Evil?</a>). WikiProject Atheism exists to improve Wikipedia's coverage of atheism-related articles, not to advocate or further the aims of atheists (and if it does so, it should do so only as an incidental consequence of the aforementioned aim). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I completely agree with Silence on the consistency issue, if we delete this one; then we should delete the Atheism Tapes. That would be a pity. I think they are both valuable because they present the views of very notable thinkers; even if these articles haven't developed as far as one would wish.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, until enough time has passed to adequately judge the entry. This entry was created all of one day ago. Isn't the normal, respectful line of action to "assume good faith", put up tags, use the talk page, and/or contact the creator before launching an AfD? Maybe this needs to be deleted, but this isn't the way to go. Unless this TV series never aired or has been flat out made up (making the entry clearly irrelevant), it deserves at least some good natured criticism and pressure. Also, lets not judge the merits of an entry by the behavior of its creator(s).<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelleSmith_2335.html" title="User:PelleSmith">PelleSmith</a> 18:52, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you latter ideas that an entry should not be judged by its creator; and this rant is not about you, I'm just generally upset about this whole Wikipedia mentality to "assume good faith in spite of all evidence to the contrary". Why is kindness to new users, who persist in POV-pushing in spite of various indpendent requests to stop, valued higher than the stress, frustration and waste of time of quality contributors like Mel Etitis? I don't get it... --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 19:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hey I have the same gut reaction all the time when I know an editor's history. I also think that the "assume good faith" guideline can be taken to an extreme--there are cases when bad faith is more than apparent. However, the way I see it the guideline has a practical end which has nothing to do with actually "assuming good faith" but has everything to do with judging a contribution on its merits and not on the intentions of the contributer. The guideline is also a check for us to not to overreact when editors who we know to be POV pushers make edits or create entries.<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelleSmith_2335.html" title="User:PelleSmith">PelleSmith</a> 23:08, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Now, the goal of WikiProject atheism is to guarantee NPOV and consistency among all atheism related articles. The problem here was that I suspected this would remain a one sentence description about "atheist fundamentalists". In any case, I have changed to "keep" in light of Silence's commitment to this article, and there are at least <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Trouble_With_Atheism_0771.html" title="Talk:The Trouble With Atheism">a few TV guide mentions &amp; one review</a>, which are at least third part opinions that can be used. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 08:44, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unreleased single from an unreleased album. Supposedly confirmed, but no source. Most of article is based on rumours and MySpace. Even if an upcoming release date is verified by a reliable secondary source, the information is only about the primary subject's <i>intentions</i> and <i>schedules</i>, not facts.

<p>Article asserts some degree of notability, but doesn't provide reliable sources. A Google search only shows his blog, the interview referenced in the article, and participation in various online forums (mostly digg and usenet) <a href="../../../p/e/k/User%7EPekaje_a76b.html" title="User:Pekaje">Pekaje</a> 20:54, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b> Pekaje is a denizen of one of the newsgroups in which Yttrx posts, comp.os.linux.advocacy, and has a long history of confrontational behavior with Yttrx. It's therefore very likely that this move for deletion was for purely personal reasons, though luckily the article itself does indeed fail some important Wiki tests. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalomejones_9cbc.html" title="User:Salomejones">Salomejones</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalomejones_86d2.html" title="User talk:Salomejones">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Salomejones_580d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Salomejones">contribs</a>) 16:30, February 28, 2007.</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b> Yes, I am part of that newsgroup, and yes it is how I noticed this page. However, I would appreciate if you would not outright <b>lie</b> that I have a long history of confrontational behavior with Yttrx. A simple Google groups search will show that I have more or less completely ignored him throughout the time we have both been posting to that Usenet group. I could find a total of 4 posts where I reply to him, 2 about this wiki page, 1 informing him that he was arguing with a known troll, and finally one from last year where I made clear that I considered his behavior to be rather rude. Just because you can't make a case for keeping the page, doesn't mean you have to attack me. <a href="../../../p/e/k/User%7EPekaje_a76b.html" title="User:Pekaje">Pekaje</a> 15:04, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> In order to verify at least one item in Trivia, the identity of the person behind the pseudonym would have to be revealed in this article. Since he's made it very clear that he does not want this article, or any wiki article containing the nom de plume "yttrx" to be linked with any existing reference or work of or created by the person behind the pseudonym, it's not going to happen in this particular permutation of this page. However, if this page does get deleted, it will likely show up in a new permutation, which again, would be engineered not only to the satisfaction of everyone involved, but also for the point of the purpose of the original yttrx entry. And, why Cchamilton2 is still an active wiki account even after evident and admitted wikipedia vandalism is utterly beyond me. Also Cchamilton2, if you need citations then use "citation needed" like everyone else--instead of vandalizing the page. In some of the instances in this wiki entry, there are people who would come forward and supply them as needed. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalomejones_9cbc.html" title="User:Salomejones">sjones</a> 05:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> It's not vandalism if it's the truth. I'd happily change it back and add citations myself, but it's better it's deleted since I can only add citations for so much. The purpose of the original yttrx entry was vanity, so I think you'll have to find another purpose if it is going to stay around next time. As for why my account is still active, well I could ask you the same thing. <a href="../../../c/c/h/User%7ECchamilton2_051c.html" title="User:Cchamilton2">Cchamilton2</a> 11:30, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Keep, but redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cock_and_ball_torture.html" title="Cock and ball torture">Cock and ball torture</a>. There is no solid consensus present here endorsing deletion, so <i>when in doubt, don't delete</i>. Anecdotal evidence known to the closer suggest the term is distinct from CBT; however, mindful of the need for verifiable, reliable sources, a redirection there seems the best route at present. The history of ballbusting will be maintained thereby, and may be resurrected at editorial discretion, so long as sources are provided. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The sexual activity is already covered in <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cock_and_ball_torture.html" title="Cock and ball torture">Cock and ball torture</a>. I'd go with a simple redirect to that article, but the problem is that the concept is most widely used metaphorically, as, per one definition, "scolding or berating" someone. <a href="http://www.clichesite.com/content.asp?which=tip+1756" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clichesite.com/content.asp?which=tip+1756" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> For example, in a Yahoo! search, even "bust her balls" (obviously a metaphor) has 445 hits.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is a notable term, and with 350,000 + hits on Google, that certainly emphasises its usage as a common <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> word.</li>
</ul>
<p>It could be redirected to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexual_slang_terms.html" title="List of sexual slang terms">List of sexual slang terms</a>, or expanded further.

<li><b>Delete</b>, per JamesMLane — entirely covered under <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cock_and_ball_torture.html" title="Cock and ball torture">Cock and ball torture</a>, so a simple redirect will suffice.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Part of my uncertainty is: Does the nonsexual concept of ballbusting merit an article? Arguably, it's strictly Wiktionary material -- but I'm inclined to think that more could be written than just a dicdef. Perhaps it should be just a redirect for now, without prejudice to an eventual article about the broader sense. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 20:23, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. After comparing the article with the sources, it is apparent that certain portions of the article are not verified by the three sources I checked. This does not necessarily mean that it's original research, which refers to material that is "unverifiable", not "unverified". A merge between <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_Conquistadors_b84e.html" title="San Diego Conquistadors">San Diego Conquistadors</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_Sails_be92.html" title="San Diego Sails">San Diego Sails</a> (and turning one or the other into a redirect page) might be the best solution, if indeed they are essentially the same team (the articles already contain much of the same information). Whether the Sails article ought to be merged to Conquistadors or vice versa is something I have no opinion on yet. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I accidentally reverted it. I didn't understand what had happened to the page.
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with your assessment of it. I can try to make it a larger page if necessary, with more of my own writing, but to mark it for deletion simply because it's one of many fictional technologies featured in a work seems unfair. If we applied that standard widely, we wouldn't have a page on lightsabers (just one of the many fictional technologies from the Star Wars universe) or Slaver stasis fields and scrith (a few of the technologies from Larry Niven's Known Space Universe) or any number of other things.--McFarty</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Fictional technologies are rarely notable, especitally when found in only one novel. The article offers absolutely no legitimate sources and completely fails to establish notability. In response to McFarty, the existence (or nonexistence) of other articles on similar subject matter is irrelevant to this AfD, which is solely focused on whether <i>this</i> article is in compliance with <i>policy</i>. Some of these other articles you mention may also need to be deleted, though lightsabers are notable; they appear in a large number of movies (not just in Star Wars), books, etc. The topic of this article is nowhere close to reaching that level of notability. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:59, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm not entirely sure about <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaver_stasis_field.html" title="Slaver stasis field">slaver stasis fields</a>; perhaps that article should be deleted.

<li>Well, technically smartwheels are found in two novels and they're not just throw away technology in at least one of them. Snow Crash is a very notable book; at least in Time Magazine's opinion.</li>
<li>Arthur C. Clarke also wrote of a similar, though less advanced wheel concept in the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey. If you count that, then there's three. How many mentions in novels are requisite before it would become a notable fictional technology? How <i>could</i> I provide a more legitimate source for a fictional technology than quotations from the book it's featured in? In addition, smartwheels of a sort are in development already: <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=486" class="external text" title="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=486" rel="nofollow">IMPASS robot</a> and <a href="http://www.me.vt.edu/romela/RoMeLa/IMPASS.html" class="external text" title="http://www.me.vt.edu/romela/RoMeLa/IMPASS.html" rel="nofollow">the official page</a>--McFarty
<ul>
<li><i>How could I provide a more legitimate source for a fictional technology than quotations from the book it's featured in?</i> — By not writing articles that way in the first place. This isn't the place for original research, for reading the works of fiction and then performing our own analyses of their elements. There are plenty of people who have analysed science fiction, and who have published books and papers about all sorts of things in it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_sources_and_content_98bf.html#Always_work_from_and_cite_sources" title="User:Uncle G/On sources and content">Work from those secondary sources, not from the original works of fiction</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I provided more information in the article, including a link to the real-world version of smartwheels, which should fall under acceptable Wikipedia content, since they're real technology.--McFarty</li>

</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to "Snow Crash". I appreciate McFarty's efforts, but I still don't see sufficient sources to support notability. The comparisons to Clark's work is original research.

<dd>I've removed these. This is an AfD which has been running for 9 days already; adding another 7 items to it at this point isn't going to help generate consensus.

<dd>It somehow proves my point that you listed all these articles for deletion, but separated the discussions, which then have entries that refer to each other. We need a consensus about requirements for a calendar reform proposal to stay as an article on its own, as a note on <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_reform.html" title="Calendar reform">Calendar reform</a> or not at all. I do not see the essential difference among the ones listed above yet. This goal is hard if not impossible to reach, when the discussion is cluttered this way. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 19:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Pak21 was right to separate these. Each needs to stand, or fall, on their own merits. Some of these I *know* will be able to be improved with better sourcing (such as the World Calendar) and their deletion is wildly premature. Others, perhaps won't. But they are different enough to merit separate discussions. To look at them all and say "they are the same, delete them all" is not doing justice to the AfD process, to Wikipedia, or to these calendar reform concepts. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 20:03, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep,</b> but maybe in a different form. There have been serious attempts to reform the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">calendar now used worldwide</a> in the early days of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in continuation of work of its predecessor, the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, and inside œcumenic organisations (esp. regarding <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a>). The UN officially <i>postponed</i> its decision, because no consensus was reached back then. So probably some day they will try again and maybe they will even change something. I think it is encyclopædic to describe the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_reform.html" title="Calendar reform">possible alterations</a> of the roman calendar (that were discussed). I consider naming proposals less important (“Newton week” and the like), because the number of possible proposals is limited, therefore you can enumerate them (except for a few exots) and just as a sidenote give originators, proposers or names; also leap rules are not that essential. Among this list there will also be concepts not discussed fifty-odd years ago, but proposed and elaborated since. One thing of particular interest is the compatibility with international standards, esp. <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">ISO 8601</a>, which unlike most older proposals starts the week on Monday and introduces defacto a parallel leap-week calendar. This way Symmetry 454 (among ohers) would deserve mentioning despite being a rather recent proposal, but <b>I am not sure whether it should keep an article of its own</b>. It is one of the better thought-through proposals, though, and not something made up in school one day. It is perhaps not that helpful that its “inventor” started contributing to Wikipedia and this article in particular not that long ago. Anyway this discussion on deletion cannot be limited to Symmetry 454, but would have to effect all calendars that are not recognized by—well, by whom? --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 15:04, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: the same criterion should be used for calendars that is used for all other articles on Wikipedia: that the article should rely on "reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy", a direct quote from the non-negotiable policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiabily</a>. I see no such sources here, which is why I nominated this article for deletion. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 15:10, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> My point is that you do not need a source for the <i>trivial idea</i> to divide the ISO week year into four quarters of three months each, which have a length of twice four weeks (or 30 days) and once five weeks (or 31 days) in one of the three possible orders. The question is rather whether this (or each of these six possibilities and all similar ones) needs or deserves an article on its own, just because it is assigned a name/originator or is combined with a certain leap rule. If it does not (and I mildly tend to think so), <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symmetry454.html" title="Symmetry454">Symmetry454</a> and all the other articles on proposed calendar reforms should be deleted, <i>but only after</i> all this information is collected into one article. This is currently done only half-way in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_reform.html" title="Calendar reform">Calendar reform</a>, because it can rely on detail articles about the proposals. Note though that any such page would need an active neutral maintainer, because there are people trying to push their preferred proposal or certain requirements a reform needed to fulfill or success. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 16:27, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The trouble then comes with who gets to say what is a "trivial idea"; for instance, it is clear to me that it is a trivial idea that <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> is the cleverest person who has ever lived. Wikipedia solves this problem by requiring third-party sources, of which this (and many of the other calendars linked from <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_reform.html" title="Calendar reform">Calendar reform</a>) lack. Hence they should be deleted. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 17:11, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>This is discussed in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html#What_is_not_original_research.3F" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">WP:A</a> under the topic “What is not original research?”:
<blockquote>
<p>Editors may make straightforward mathematical calculations or logical deductions based on fully attributed data that neither change the significance of the data nor require additional assumptions beyond what is in the source. It should be possible for any reader without specialist knowledge to understand the deductions.</p>
</blockquote>
This would mean (in my interpretation) it was okay to say there are proponents for a new calendar and describe in which ways the (Gregorian) calendar could be reformed, but it was inappropriate to mention any names of calendar proposals, at least not in an article title. My preferred solution therefore is (still) this: Improve <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_reform.html" title="Calendar reform">Calendar reform</a>, <b>then delete</b> all the proposals that have never been in official use. (Whether official use includes being under discussion in the UN or some country is another question that should be answered first. Note that I used Symmetry454 as an example in my (premature) petition to the German government<a href="http://itc.napier.ac.uk/e-Petition/bundestag/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=58" class="external autonumber" title="http://itc.napier.ac.uk/e-Petition/bundestag/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=58" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> to consider adopting a fiscal calendar with months based on the year counting established by the week format of ISO 8601.) <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 13:23, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The flaw, of course, is that neither the Symmetry454 <i>proposed</i> calendar nor any other that I'm aware of has ever had "official use." By the very definition of the words, a proposed calendar that was adopted would simply be a nation's new civil calendar. The idea that proposals can never be named seems absurd on its face for an encyclopedia which purports to inform its readers as to the lastest research and thinking within a certain community. I'm coming to believe that no calendar proposal, however notable, however widely discussed off-line and in the scientific community, can ever be listed on Wikipedia unles there are volumes of "publicity." The problem is that calendar reform, like other sciences, aren't usually on the front page of the New York Times or the National Enquirer (a sensationalistic US Tabloid) and "publicity" isn't usually the goal of researchers, it's discussion, usually behind closed doors. The problem with interpreting these guidelines and policies is that we seem to be aiming not for "notability" but <i><b>"noteriety"</b></i> here. In other words, what makes the biggest <i>splash</i> in the press and what is most widely known is what makes the cut for inclusion. Everything else is assumed to be made up in someone's basement, and not worthy. The problem is that publicity and noteriety isn't always the best gauge of what the <i>facts</i> are, or what is <i>important</i> for inclusion. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 15:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If the calendar is discussed widely offline in the scientific community, then the results of those discussions should be published somewhere. When someone reads this article, all they will learn is what the calendar proposes, but not why some scientists think it is important, or why other scientists may object the proposal. -<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 15:17, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Symmetry454 calendar is extensively verifiable with sources outside of WP, and is not a fly-by-night, created-by-a-teen-after-school project. It was designed by a university professor who has done extensive research on calendar design. As he notes on the discussion page of the article, "publicity" alone is not a significant source of verifiability, and, frankly, Wikipedian admins need to stop these little Jihads against truly encyclopedic articles. The idea expressed above that this is a "trivial" calendar concept is an extremely subjective comment.- <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 15:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Not that it was all that important for this discussion, but I do not think my comment was that subjective. If you start from the current, rather solar calendar with twelve months and your primary goals for a reform are perpetuality and equal-length quarters, you will soon arrive at the two versions published by Dr. Irv Bromberg, except maybe with a different position of the longer month and maybe with weeks starting at Sunday. I think such proposals belong to the better and more promising, though. His work on leap rules and astronomic influences on calendar design at a whole are another matter entirely. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 13:30, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - It's easy for some to point out how 'easy' or natural it is to come up with a design for a calendar, or a car, or a mathematical formula, but you're right, it's utterly unimportant for this discussion. His computations really are a different matter. This is a unique design, his computations and design are copyrighted, and this is perhaps the most vetted design for calendar reform out there. The fact that it's not verified and notable on the Internet, with easily linkable sources, makes it "non-notable" to WP geekdom, I suppose, but that's a pretty flawed standard. The fact that this AfD was begun as a mass deletion dooms this discussion. The AfD notices from these other articles were removed, since the original "train wreck mass deletion" attempt, above, was abandoned. If someone wants to relist them, that's fine. But this should be the only calendar under discussion at this point. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 18:35, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: You are mistaken about the facts here: this AfD was not "begun as a mass deletion discussion": it started listing one and only one article and continued that way for 7 days. The extra articles were listed for less than half an hour yesterday. Secondly, "the burden of evidence lies with the editor wishing to add or retain the material"; if sources cannot be provided, as is apparently the case here, then an article should be deleted. If this is really "the most vetted design for calendar reform out there", where is the evidence? --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 08:28, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that much of the evidence isn't contained online, and the discussions are not in a neat little URL that the article can link to, makes these facts and this calenar irrelevent, apparently. That is a fatal flaw of Wikipedia. Standing behind policies in a legalistic fashion, consistently repeating them like a mantra, will perhaps kill these articles, but it's also killing this as an acceptable vehicle for research among those who are serious about this topic. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 15:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's as encyclopedic as I know about the subject. There are other how-to sites that have articles: <a href="../../../e/h/o/EHow_e328.html" title="EHow">eHow</a>,<a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiHow_664d.html" title="WikiHow">wikiHow</a> &amp; <a href="../../../h/o/w/HowStuffWorks_c4c1.html" title="HowStuffWorks">HowStuffWorks</a>. I skimmed a little about wikia projects. I think they all have advertisers. I noticed eHow has articles like How to French Kiss. I wonder if it has a disclaimer about doing that. Think of the germs and the teeth.

<li>At first glance, those other articles appear to satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> due to having "been the subject of multiple and non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." If not, then perhaps they are also candidates for deletion.

<li>You know you can't catch epilepsy from kissing someone, right? And what exactly has that got to do with whether this article should be kept or deleted? "It is encyclopedic because I know about the subject" is a form of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"I like it" statement</a>, an argument that holds no water in AfD debates.

Looking at the criterion, I think the original nomination correctly points out that it doesn't fit the criterion. I haven't worked with wikipedia closely enough to know about these policies, but it seems common sense for anyone familiar with using image hosts that imageshack is by far one of the biggest out there. It's obviously not going to be covered in news publications - what kind of mainstream publication writes a story on image hosts, and bare-bones image hosts (unlike flickr) at that? The lack of media coverage doesn't mean imageshack isn't big and widely used, take a look at Alexa: [<a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=US&amp;ts_mode=country&amp;lang=none" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=US&amp;ts_mode=country&amp;lang=none" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>], currently #64 website worldwide, and the third largest image host behind flickr and photobucket. Also, for what it's worth, 36 million google hits vs. 44 million for photobucket. <a href="../../../t/e/j/User%7ETejastheory_c89d.html" title="User:Tejastheory">Tejastheory</a> 20:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not clear to me how the article survived the first nomination, if the participants were aware of the policies. I assume they were different back then, or enforced differently.

Neither does Alexa, which merely provides a short summary of what the site is and statistics of how many users of Alexa's software visit the site. --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 21:31, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Looking at the criteria that you linked to, I would have to agree that imageshack probably doesn't fufill those, but I'm not all that familiar with wikipedia notability policies.

<dd>Both of your sources are highly questionable, due to their own relative obscurity and the fact that the cited stories read like press releases. I believe that Mashable exists purely for publishing "press release" materal submitted by the owners of sites themselves. That would essentially be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:RS">self published source</a>.

<dd>As it was pointed out, while self-published its allowed as long as the writer is a well known journalist which is the case since the author is a journalist for guardian.co.uk, so yes its quite reliable in that case. After some looking, you might be write about that particular article on Biosmagazine. Their top articles don't look like press releases as there is some editorializing in them, and it doesn't appear to be a blog, but in this case, the article is actually a mash up of several press releases. So while the content is reliable, that particular source can't be used to establish notability. Though there is still a point of common sense here, and realization that notability guidelines are not policy, and some critical thinking should reveal that while there isn't a lot of independent coverage it is the 52nd highest traffic website on the internet and the third largest image hoster. Its notable by virtue of its use.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 18:27, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an internet encyclopedia so popularity among internet users does make it notable. This website also isn't something that is mildly popular either, its within the top 100 websites on the internet. There are probably tens of thousands or more of articles on wikipedia which have no historical significance, I was unaware that that was a requirement, nor are major achievements. You've already admitted its a popular website. We also know how popular a website it is. Your proposal for deletion was based on the fact that you didn't think it was notable or in other words not popular or well known. In the context of people who would be online and reading this encyclopedia, imageshack is popular and notable.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 15:16, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think sheer use makes it notable. Being in the top 100 of trafficked sites and being the third largest image host in the world means that there are millions of users that engage in its services or view images that it hosts. ImageShack is not this big, but imagine if there was a single website that hosted the majority of all image content on the web. Sure it may not have social networking features or garner press coverage (because it's a mundane thing), but that fact alone makes it notable and relevant. <a href="../../../t/e/j/User%7ETejastheory_c89d.html" title="User:Tejastheory">Tejastheory</a> 20:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
