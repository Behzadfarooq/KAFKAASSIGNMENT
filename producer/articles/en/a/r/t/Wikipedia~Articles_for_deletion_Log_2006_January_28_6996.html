<p>No notability at all. Are we going to list every street in America? I actually found this page because it was put on a forum as an example of how wikipedia expansion will never stop.

<li>In this specific case I'd say <b>Keep</b> - fine wee article on a notable street (notable because of the boundary between Harlem &amp; Upper East Side, plus the movie &amp; song).

<li><b>Keep/Rewrite</b>: You'd never know it from the article but the American/P. Emerson Williams version of this band has released four full-length albums - and at least three of them are available on Amazon. So the band is apparently notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As original writer of article I do not understand what was so "poorly written" about it. Though the discography is appreciated (I had meant to add it myself) to have everything about the history of the project blanked out reduces any of the identifying characteristics of the project. And it is a project, not a "band" insofar as the music is not conventional and the members do not play live shows. Please inform me if I've broken some Wikipedia rule in posting this. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychaotic_4b39.html" title="User:Psychaotic">Psychaotic</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/y/User_talk%7EPsychaotic_0deb.html" title="User talk:Psychaotic">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psychaotic_9353.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psychaotic">contribs</a>) .</small>
<ul>
<li>No offense but it was fairly confusing the way it was. It was also very non-standard. The standard is to give a short, sweet introduction and then try to give some history. And the quantity of history should be relative to the importance of the band. No one's ever heard of this band so it doesn't make sense to write a longer article for it than a more well-known band. This was getting into deeper detail than I think most wanted to hear. Maybe that's just me though - when I read biographies on bands' websites, I usually bail-out from sheer boredom after about a paragraph - and that's for bands I love. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 22:42, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The way I figure it, especially in the digital milieu "significance" is becoming more and more subjective and the grounds for determining it are hazy. I felt that the history, in this case, is part of what makes the project significant. Have you ever heard of another band or project that formed from more than one individual using the same (obscure) name and then deciding to collaborate? Or a band with occult referents that had not one but two incidents of natural disasters following completions of their works? I appreciate your constructive criticism here (just saying something is poorly written is not constructive crit imho) but as far as "deeper detail" goes, what else would someone want when they look up something in an encyclopedia? If one merely wants a definition they go for a dictionary. I'd have gone on for three or four screens of text that would've been one thing; I consciously and conscientiously kept it pretty simple. I don't want to be a pain in the rear (I imagine this place is full of idiotic, interminable time-wasting arguments and I do not want this to become one of same) but I would like to replace some of the information that the rewrite discarded - particularly the above information as it is of primary significance - and it is my hope that if I do so in a more succinct fashion that it will not be hosed off. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychaotic_4b39.html" title="User:Psychaotic">Psychaotic</a> 00:29, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That sounds like a plan. If you caught the end of my earlier sentence: "there's some interesting info in the article if you read hard enough and that shouldn't be lost". I think it's all in the presentation. Some of that may have been better suited in an "Interesting facts" section rather than being the core of the overall article. Basically, the core of every musical band article should be the music. In this case, the music got drowned out by the bio. That's probably the way I should have said it in the first place so I apologize if I offended. I'd say go ahead and put whatever you want in there and you'll probably have other pairs of eyes making sure the point of the article isn't lost. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 02:04, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>DON'T DELETE: While the diet described may sound ridiculous to some, it is of interest to those who want to know more about the different diets that exist, and the guidelines for each. As a nutritionist, I found this article fascinating, not because I agree with the guidelines put forth in the Primal Diet, but of rhte diet's unique approach to health and human history. The article could be re-written to make it easier for readers to understand.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The individuals named in the article are world-famous and their activities, including this one, are notable. They're also newsworthy, if you read the financial pages. The article itself could use some expansion - I think I'll put a "stub" tag on it if I can figure out the best one to use. -Ikkyu2 03:04, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Looked at this for some time. I don't like the total absence of a German-language equivalent of the same site (which might have been more informative) - suggests they may not actually be doing anything much. I agree with the view that this may simply be a vanity-association created by a well-connected banker who wants to ensure his place in history. Does "notable" mean well-connected or significant? Not significant. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaravaca_f6df.html" title="User:Caravaca">Caravaca</a> 13:35, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The "professor" was actually a banker who got himself an honorary professorship (a modern German equivalent of a knighthood or an earldom). And the website itself (or any equivalent) is not in German, which suggests to me that it isn't aimed at Germans, which doesn't make sense if it is in Frankfurt. Normally German websites of this calibre are bi-lingual with the main version being in German. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaravaca_f6df.html" title="User:Caravaca">Caravaca</a> 16:26, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Definitely. MacArthur genius grant is quite prestigous, and she was profiled in serveral publications of high (enough) readership.

<li>I don't know what led to this particular individual winning her grant, but in general, it boggles my mind that a MacArthur Grant in any way constitutes noteworthiness on WP.

<li>Why so? It makes her "more well known" than the average professor, she is arguably a participant in a "newsworthy" event, and many do consider it an indication that her work is somehow exceptional: only a handful of people receive these awards. It's no Nobel prize, but its not like she won a blue ribbon at the county fair for growing a vegetable that resembles <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._Gordon_Liddy_2149.html" title="G. Gordon Liddy">G.

<li>You'd think so, but i wrote an article about a professor at my university, who was a nobel prize winner, and it was deleted as a nn-bio<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelzagood_9ac5.html" title="User:Helzagood">Helzagood</a> 01:48, 1 February 2006 (UTC).. ps. I don't know if the american community is aware, but the US is different to most other places with respect to professors; in most places, someone that lecturers at a university is not a professor by default, a lecturer becomes a professor upon reaching certain requirements, often, this involves becoming a fellow of their applicable chartered body, and only after years (decades) of dedicated research is this acheived. A professor, in the UK, for example is the highest accolade acheiveable in a lecturers' career; which starts with lectureship, then senior lectureship, then readership/chairmanship, then professorship. Many of my lecturers have been in their job for 20 years and are still only lecturers, this nothing against them, it is just that in the UK, it is a demanding task to climb the status scale. I have it on good understanding, however that in the US, everyone who lectures at a university/college is a professor, which may cause some confusion.<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelzagood_9ac5.html" title="User:Helzagood">Helzagood</a> 01:48, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Perhaps I was somewhat negligent in the summary I provided, though it appears a few users noticed anyway. This article is about a "school" within Kalinga Institute for Industrial Training. This Institute is not a higher-level education provider, and does not confer degrees to its graduates, but rather is a typical technical institute. <a href="http://www.kiit.org/academics/departments.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kiit.org/academics/departments.htm" rel="nofollow">See listing of programs offered at KIIT</a> Moreover, the article is inappropriately titled. As far as I see, these are the options:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Move</b> to <a href="../../../i/b/a/IBAT_e034.html" title="IBAT">IBAT</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_Business_Administration_and_Training_6660.html" title="Institute of Business Administration and Training">Institute of Business Administration and Training</a> if you want this article kept as is</li>
<li><b>Move</b> to Kalinga Institute for Industrial Training if you believe the institute is important, but the school isn't (again - the school is one part of the institute)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> if you believe that neither the school, nor the institute with which it is affiliated, deserve an article.</li>
</ol>
<p>As stated in my summary, I believe the latter option makes the most sense. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 00:26, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: Prime number, has some information from other sources. An "infinitely large" prime would NOT work because who has written an article about a 10 digit prime? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 05:39, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment to all keepers using the "interesting" rationale:</b> (I hope I'm not wasting my time with this, please read and consider carefully). There are infinitely many prime numbers. There are infinitely many prime numbers with "interesting" properties (a subjective measure in any case). There are infinitely many prime numbers with more "interesting" (and "more interesting") properties than 593.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Even though I claim to be a deletionist, I find waiving around <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINI_9a1f.html" title="WP:WINI">Wikipedia is not infinite</a> to be just as annoying as waving around <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. In fact, to quote the former guideline, "While it is true that Wikipedia is not infinite, it must also be said that deleting an article does nothing to reduce the amount of space taken up by that article. All deleted content on Wikipedia remains stored on the servers." This particular number isn't any old integer, it has an assertion of significance, and it has a decent article written about it.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> (and I'm an inclusionist). There are an infinite number of primes, about half of them are "good" (as the list will show) - a feature which is in any case interesting only in a small context not mentioned here. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 04:24, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems notable. Its sometimes useful to look at these things. Think of this as an OLEIS for integers. Comment to all deleters: OLEIS is the "<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/" class="external text" title="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/" rel="nofollow">On-line Encyclopaedia of Integer sequences</a>", its considered to be an important resource for math. Sure, there are an infinite number of sequences, (and then some), but it is very useful to be able to look them up, if faced with one that you have in front of you, and you don't know what it is. For grins, check out the <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/100k.html" class="external text" title="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/100k.html" rel="nofollow">OLEIS 100K party</a> -- that's right, they are 1/10 'th the size of all of WP, and 10 x larger than all WP math articles put together. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 01:42, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep.</b> Notable number. Important for keeping 592 and 594 from bumping into each other. Good rewrite by Ruby saves the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - An internet search will reveal that Tracy is much more than a social worker. He is a prominent activist anad was a leading member of the BC NDP Socialist Caucus. Users should find it telling that user Homey votes to delete definitions of people on the same side of the political spectrum as himself, yet to keep definitions of those on the far-right, who are often even less notable, such as James Scott Richardson.

<li>Personally, I think one of the biggest weaknesses of the wikipedia is the {afd} procedure. When I look at some of the nominations which generate discussion what I find is the same bunch of regulars. And many of those regulars show no interest in following procedure, or even giving the articles a fair reading.</li>
<li>Some of the regular habitues have personal axes to grind. Some regulars use the {afd} fora <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Guantanamo_Bay_detainees&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24281607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Guantanamo_Bay_detainees&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24281607" rel="nofollow">to suppress information</a> that they regard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSabir_Mahfouz_Lahmar&amp;diff=23895791&amp;oldid=23895339" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSabir_Mahfouz_Lahmar&amp;diff=23895791&amp;oldid=23895339" rel="nofollow">as "anti-American"</a>, without regard to its verifiability or how neutrally it is expressed.</li>
<li>Many regulars base their vote on whether they regard the article as POV. Some even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCarolyn_Wood&amp;diff=25538753&amp;oldid=25538706" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCarolyn_Wood&amp;diff=25538753&amp;oldid=25538706" rel="nofollow">base their nomination on their opinion that an article is POV</a>, even though the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">wikipedia deletion policy</a> says that the correct response to a perception that an article shows a biased POV is to raise that issue on the article's talk page.</li>
<li>I think the wikipedia would be improved if steps were taken so that there was a monthly cap on how many times per month people could vote in the {afd} fora. This would rein in those regulars who use the fora as a venue to trot out their personal prejudices. Regretably, this would also cap those responsible wikipedians who come regularly to the {afd} fora, and actually read the articles nominated for deletion, and make an independent choice every time they vote. But that would be better than the current situaiton. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 21:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think wikipedia needs to rethink how it treats radio personality bios for commercial am/fm/satellite and internet radio. It took me 10 minutes to find this information, which should be included in the article. There is way too much "I haven't heard of it so it must not be notable" garbage associated with these topics. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 22:41, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> speaking as a programmer, this company is both significant and relevant. found this one on a bay area blog and clicked thru to learn more. there are no other firms that have tackled ecommerce from a web 2.0 perspective, as the article states. this company is perhaps more notable than half the other companies in the website category.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There are an lot of new accounts voicing their opinions here and on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_Pazornik_1dbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert Pazornik">related AfD</a>. Can I please remind you that AfD is not a vote, but rather a method of building consensus. Whilst the opinions of new users are very welcome, the admin who closes this AfD is not obliged to treat them all with the same weight. Personally I think the article Licketyship is more notable than the article on Robert Pazornik, especially as all relevant information from that article can be included in this one. So that'd be a <b>weak keep</b>, but it could still do with being verified/cleaned up. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 16:12, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I should probably first qualify that while my account is new, I am not a new user, I have been contributing religiously by IP only for the past 3 years. I stumbled to the LicketyShip article while reading about other Web 2.0 companies, and I must say I'm mostly (though not entirely) befuddled as to why its up for deletion as NN. I have a feeling that most advocating delete don't really know much about web 2.0 and why it's important. The editor who made the comment about <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_4_Securicor_09bd.html" title="Group 4 Securicor">Group 4 Securicor</a> and <a href="../../../d/h/l/DHL_53c6.html" title="DHL">DHL</a> is a perfect exemplar; those companies are about as similar to what Licketyship is doing as <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodak.html" title="Kodak">Kodak</a> is to <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flickr.html" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>. There is a substantial public interest in this company not only becuase it is part of a larger, more significant movement, but also becuase its doing something no other company has done (or tried to do) before - and it's entirely verifiable. If you do a bit more than a quick google, this company has been covered by Fortune, CNN, and NYT - and I found those in about 2 minutes worth of research. That said, this is my first AfD vote, and hopefully my last.--Bigbang21 22:37, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm admittedly new to editing. I read wikipedia a lot, but havent edited any pages. I searched for licketyship after reading the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/28/nine-startups-at-e27-summit/" class="external text" title="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/28/nine-startups-at-e27-summit/" rel="nofollow">techcrunch blog</a>. I guess they're not a huge company, but they're apparently notable enough to be recognized by stanford's tech community. I'm not really sure what the standard is for deleting an entry (lack of notability?), but when I google them, I come up with all sorts of hits and articles. Does that not make them notable? Or is it something about what the company does that would make them notable? If its the former, I guess you could be objective by measuring how many pieces in the popular press mention them (which seems to be quite a few). If its the latter, then I guess its pretty subjective, and if you don't know much about the space the company is in, you might not be qualified to voice an opinion -- that's just my 2 cents. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.198.133.103 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__71.198.133.103_b869.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 71.198.133.103">contribs</a>) 06:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The author has created a neologism from the word "heathenry" used in the source website by deliberately combining it with the prefix "Christo-" (possibly to troll Christians on Wikipedia). <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 15:12, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't see this a troll at all: to me it looks likes a very interesting expirement in syncretism undertaken by a very small unencyclopedic number of people. I particularly liked the comparison, on the <a href="http://www.englishfolkchurch.com" class="external text" title="http://www.englishfolkchurch.com" rel="nofollow">englishfolkchurch.com website</a>, of this phenomenon to the Japanese blending of Buddhidm and Shinto. - <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquibix_398c.html" title="User:Squibix">squibix</a> 15:18, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm Christian, Catholic specifically, and didn't find it offensive. However it is admittedly a neologism and shouldn't be an article until/unless it gains currency.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 15:20, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm not sure how you'd mix Christianity with paganism though as Christianity is monotheistic.

<p>I am a resident of "West" Morgan Park, which actually shares the zip code, 60643, with Beverly. It is true that there are Irish Pubs on Western Avenue; in fact, I practically live across the street from one. However, no one, and I repeat, NO ONE has ever called the following neighborhoods of Mount Greenwood, Morgan Park, or Beverly "Irishtown." I was born and raised in the Southside of Chicago, and I have never heard anyone ever refer to the area in question by the name "Irishtown." It is likely that someone will punch someone else out for referring to the neighborhoods as "Irishtown." <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Reason_4f5f.html" title="User:Voice of Reason">Voice of Reason</a> 04:48, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's nice that everyone is into this Seattle grunge movement but it seems like there's a need to have one all-encompassing Seattle Grunge history article that captures this endless legion of one-hit or one-album wonders that supposedly rocked every party in Seattle for six months fifteen years ago. It doesn't seem necessary to list how every individual band was "part of starting the movement" only to have various band members "lose interest" and "move on to other projects" or have major labels drop them because of "turmoil within the band", etc., etc. Boring and redundant...

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well I'm not an admin so I didn't delete it - clearly someone else should be voting delete here and clearly the speedy appropriateness isn't so clear. WP:BAND is guideline for notability and notability <b>is</b> a criteria for speedy deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>: WP:BAND can't be used for speedy. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">CSD</a> A7 says "an article about a real person, group of people, band or club that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject". This article asserts significance, even if it's less than what is required by WP:BAND. In the past I mistakenly deleted a small number of articles following WP:BAND and they went to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>, so Leithp did the right thing here. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushroom_bc66.html" title="User:Mushroom">Mushroom</a> 16:14, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm still troubled by this whole "U.S. tour" thing. They played at a couple festivals - does that really constitute a "U.S. tour"? Another of my Afd's is dead because the band toured as the opening act to some notable bands. Does that really count?

<li>I disagree with Wikipedia administrator Rmhermen's remark that the comment that Father Akiona is a non-notable church official. Where exactly in the Wikipedia policy is the term <i>"non-notable"</i> defined? He is a <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicar_forane.html" title="Vicar forane">vicar forane</a> in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Honolulu_1670.html" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu">Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu</a>. Until the phrase <i>"non-notable"</i> is clearly defined, I respectfully submit that your request for speedy deletion of this article is arbitrary and capricious. <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EAloysius_Patacsil_67f1.html" title="User:Aloysius Patacsil">Aloysius Patacsil</a> 18:19, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have read the guidelines at <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and still respectfully maintain that your request for deletion is arbitrary and capricious. I maintain that the existing guideline is insufficient as to dismiss my article as <i>non-notable</i>; the guideline itself states that <i>there are no objective criteria for notability besides Alexa and Google tests.</i> I have authored many articles on Catholicism in the western United States and the Pacific Rim to understand what would be considered notable. I have annotated my source materials for others to confirm the verifiability of the article. Finally, the article while obscure to you, is not necessarily so to readers interested in the subject matter. Other than dismissing my work on Father Akiona using a phrase such as <i>non-notable</i>, please articulate your specific objections using objective criteria. <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EAloysius_Patacsil_67f1.html" title="User:Aloysius Patacsil">Aloysius Patacsil</a> 19:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><strike>*<b>Delete</b></strike> Non notable. I'm very sorry if this harsh sounding phrase sounds like a critique of the subject or the author. This is not intended. Though the exact rule on notability is difficult, there are clear guidelines to help, and a lot of precident. Then we check for consensus. I understand he is Vicar forane. The question is what other grounds for notability exist? Is he an author or often quoted in newspapers? <a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 22:38, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Where does the source belong to? SOME of the information, what do you mean? I have a feeling that you are trying to pin-point at our articles.

This does not fall in the criteria of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. So let's just withdraw this AFD, instead of making a big fuss here.

<li>A few things: first, where's this talk page you reference? The article's discussion page hasn't even been created. Secondly, the "Wikipedia has so many unencyclopedic articles" argument is old, tired, and doesn't work - you're an AfD veteran, you should know that by now. If you know of other unencyclopedic articles, you're free to AfD them yourself. Lastly, since this is not the type of information one would find in an encyclopedia or almanac, how is this not an indiscriminant collection of information? -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 17:41, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please note that I looked at this user's last 2000 edits and found none to any articles related to Singapore. However, I did discover that the user frequently goes to Afd pages to vote keep and then make comments like this. Furthermore, spending a year developing an informative presentation does not qualify material for inclusion in Wikipedia.

<li>What is your point? Must I have edited this article to vote? Or are you saying that only editors who work on Singaporean topics can participate here?

<li>It's really not hard to look at someone's edit history. It took me all of 2 minutes. I didn't say you have to have participated in the Singapore project to vote. I was referring to your reason for your vote, which is ridiculous. Your statement that you "could spend hours digging into something like this" implies that you have some level of interest. Yet, not once have you even made a minor edit to a Singapore-related page. It also appears to be a trend that you vote keep and say how important an article is when you have no prior involvement in the subject. If you had voted keep because you believe it belongs in Wikipedia, then that would have been fine, but don't pretend to be overly interested in something you're not. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a> 12:51, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a>, your attempt to discredit my vote by branding it <i>ridiculous</i> is in very poor taste. As you are an authority given the "<i>two minutes</i>" you spent studying my last two thousand edits, you probably know that I edit articles purely at random. Your analysis would further show that my edit list articles do not reflect any particular interest. I would also submit that they do not reflect the articles that I read. They do not, by definition, show how I spend the hours of my day. Of course, your interpretation may be different, given that you spent "<i>all of two minutes</i>" on the issue, although in my defense I would say it took me somewhat more than "<i>two minutes</i>" to make those edits.</dd>
<dd>I did not ask if you were an authority on the airline industry. I did not ask if you were an expert on Singapore. I do not know if you are an airline executive with a grudge or an unemployed student with too much time on his hands. I do not know what articles you edit, or if you do any editing at all. I am also not going to ask to see the books you take out of the library. However, I stand fully by what I said. Airline fleets interest an enormous amount of people. SIA interests an enormous amount of people. If this was not true, I would have a hard time explaining the +100,000 google hits for the topic <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22SIA%22+fleet+&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=beW&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22SIA%22+fleet+&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=beW&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.</dd>
<dd>I do not believe that editing an article makes one an expert. I am unsure that there is a correlation between editing an article and knowledge. I also value the participation and input of all contributors.

<dd>Your comment does nothing to refute my claim. The fact that the subject is interesting to a large number of people is not what the debate is about. The question is whether a series of tables about an airline's fleet belongs in an encyclopedia. Finally, your sarcastic comments are not appreciated. If you interpret my questioning of your motives for voting here as a personal attack, then I apologize, but responding in kind is counterproductive. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a> 15:25, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I do consider your questioning of my motives to be a personal attack, although I will accept your apologies. However, I am not here to refute your claims about my interests. Please also refrain from lecturing me about which comments are productive. I have not found your approach here to be productive. I did not find your attack to be productive. Lastly, I believe the question of whether I felt this article belonged here was answered with my original comment. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 15:56, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> An article on the fleet of a major international airline is encyclopedic (as far as a wiki encyclopedia - not paper - goes) and, as far as I'm concerned, reasonably interesting too. If we can have multiple articles on such trivia as Pokemon characters we can have an article on SIA's fleet. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 05:28, 29 January 2006 (UTC) P.S.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I have yet to see a fleet table that requires an article. If you read the intro it sounds like an advert for the airline. There is a discussion going on about what needs to be in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Airlines_c0f3.html#Fleet_Data_revisited" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Airlines">fleet table</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> As per below comment, it is ridiculous to believe that an article like this should be seen as setting a standard across all airline pages. Just as <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAirline_destinations_a311.html" title="Category:Airline destinations">Category:Airline destinations</a> does not contain an article for every single airline on this planet, it is ridiculous to set standards on how much information wikipedia can offer for specific topics of interests. The fleet table may be standardised to improve on aesthetic appeal and for ease in comparisons. Its standardisation does not have to be related to this particular article, however, for both can obviously co-exist as it already does so for SIA.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:36, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I may be biased as the main contributor to this article, but that others similarly point out that SIA is considered a major player in the international aviation industry scene enforces the point that article like these should not be deleted based on the feasibility of having similar pages for <b>all</b> airlines. This article's existance does not entail that, and it never had that intention to. Individuals are entirely at their liberty to add similar pages to any other airline they deem feasible to do so. Secondly, this page is not difficult to maintain as claimed, for airlines generally do not see changes in their fleets any faster than otherwise imagined, especially when we are talking about SIA who buys exclusively wide-bodied aircraft, which are high-value planes usually taking months, if not years, to change hands. Last but not least, "listcraft", wikisource, and all that kind of stuff do not exactly apply here, when it seems neccesary to constantly emphasise that this is a <b>helper article</b> to prevent the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Airlines_77f1.html" title="Singapore Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> page from becoming a monster article. I would certainly question the existance of all articles in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAirline_destinations_a311.html" title="Category:Airline destinations">Category:Airline destinations</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline_call_sign.html" title="Airline call sign">Airline call sign</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Boeing_777_operators_fc66.html" title="List of Boeing 777 operators">List of Boeing 777 operators</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World%27s_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic.html" title="World's busiest airports by passenger traffic">World's busiest airports by passenger traffic</a>, amongst plenty of other similar articles. Deletionists will probably have a field day listing all of them for deletion if "listcraft" and "indiscriminant collection of information" are their sole criterion. I have yet to see anyone actually explaining why this is an "indiscriminant collection of information" btw.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:21, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I am surprised that personal "interest" is also a criteria for deletion. "Bland" statistics have a place in wikipedia, for they form the basis for more in-depth analysis. And that, of coz, is one example of a major room of improvement for this article, along with other possibilies for expansion (not neccesarily using statistics alone).--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> If some sources can be listed on the article, then I think it belongs here. I couldn't verify the article with a Google search, so maybe this is just original research in which case it should be deleted. Unfortunately, I don't think privacy is a good reason to delete the article. It might be a reason to delete the many articles about individuals that redirect to this page. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill37212_840c.html" title="User:Bill37212">Bill</a> 18:32, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The article is based on a community I lived in in the 70s. The material cannot be 'cited' because no one has ever published on the occurence. I had thought it was important to document one of these women's colonies--it seems like a shame for examples of cooperative ((NOT communal))communities to fade into the undocumented past. Yet I feel my attempt--and I wrote ALL of the article--is very difficult to complete without talking about the individuals involved. And that seems like an invasion of privacy. And yes, I had attempted to delete the articles about individuals which I started, but apparantly I do not have enough understanding of the format to do so successfully. At the very least, I would like to request the individual links be deleted.~afmareck</p>

<p>hmmm...well I could continue the general article as a basis for investigation of the phenonema. I may be able to find information on other 'colonies' that existed around the same time and work to create some kind of cohesive whole. Yes, if the individual entries could be deleted that would be good. ~afmareck</p>

<p>Delete if you like, though as a joke religion it is necessarily nonsense.

These things make it somewhat more notable than many other solely internet-based joke religions, I think. There are older citations online on usenet (e.g. alt.slack and alt.discordia) going back to 1993.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is funny. I found the entry on pazornik through Licketyship after giving what I stated would be my first and last ever AfD vote. Then I see this one up for delete as well (sigh). Again, I'll pre-qualify that I am a new account, but by no means a new contributer. I'll re-state what I said on the Licketyship AfD: those advocating delete are likely unfamiliar with web 2.0 and why it's important. An editor calimed on the related AfD that Licketyship should be deleted becuase the company was not as interesting as <a href="../../../d/h/l/DHL_53c6.html" title="DHL">DHL</a>, which is patently ridiculous. That's like saying pazornik's entry should be deleted becuase he's not as interesting as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martha_Stewart_cd16.html" title="Martha Stewart">Martha Stewart</a>. In both cases, the 2 are very much dissimilar. I will point out that I would like to see the pazornik entry expanded, becuase as it stands, while he is interesting, the entry on him is not so much. But being a stub does not qualify one for deletion - there are a thousand entries on interesting topics I'd like to see expanded. I was interested enough in pazornik to click through his link and attempt to learn more, and the world is apparently interested enough in pazornik that he's been covered by Fortune, CNN, and NYT, to name a few uncovered by a 2 min. google. I rest. --Bigbang21 22:52, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Article fails to make a case as to why this is considered notable. Maybe if there are such a thing as "male bikinis" then this can be discussed in a related article. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:57, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> As it stands, article does not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy, as no sources are given. But suppose sources were found. Then this content would still not qualify as an article, as it is not about male bikini-wearing in general, but about male bikini-wearing on the beaches of Southport and Blackpool. But suppose male bikini-wearing were shown to be an important and widespread phenomenon. There is still no reason why this should be a separate article, rather than a mention or section in <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini.html" title="Bikini">Bikini</a>. There's no value to leaving the redirect in place, as it is very unlikely that anyone would search for this specific phrase. It can't be merged, as there's nothing verifiable to merge. Therefore: Delete. Contributors are welcome at any time to add well-sourced, verifiable information on male bikini-wearing in Southport to <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southport.html" title="Southport">Southport</a>; on male bikini-wearing in Blackpool to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackpool.html" title="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>; and, if a widespread phenomenon, to <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini.html" title="Bikini">Bikini</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 16:39, 29 January 2006 (UTC) P.S.

<li><b>-Keep</b> Hello, I am the author of this article and I would like to thank the Wikipedia community for this opportunity to defend my contribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was thinking the idea of Wikipedia (please, correct me if I am wrong) is that if one member goes to the trouble of writing about something he/she deems as important and adds that information to Wikipedia in Good Faith, then it is worth having until proven other wise. Since this is a real political movement, which has the ability of becoming an elected representative of the people, it is of great importance to many people to know about this party and that it is actively looking for members from the general public.</p>
<p>The point that I would like to make in defense of the article is that, thankfully, "unencyclopedic" is not an official policy and therefore not a valid argument for deletion. It is an argument for discussion, which I am more then happy to do. Xwire 21:42, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found this article with a "db-nonsense" tag. It isn't patent nonsense, but I have moved it on to AfD. From the article's talk page:</p>

<li><b>weak delete</b>. Many stamp collectors do collect thematically, and fish is a major theme. But this list would be extremely large and of limited encyclopedia value, as well as being nigh on impossible to keep maintained, given the frequency of new stamp issues worldwide. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:10, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> I don't think this is particularly encyclopedia-worthy, but I'm not so strong in my opinion that I couldn't be swayed. Does Icthyophilately exist? Does it need to? -Ikkyu2 00:26, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm for <b>keep</b>ing it. I don't have strong views but quite a bit of work seems to have gone into the various lists -- you'd actually be deleting many pages. There is a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0852594429/026-3745680-5356465" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0852594429/026-3745680-5356465" rel="nofollow">book</a>, although perhaps predictably, it didn't hit the bestseller lists. Given the profusion of articles on Star Wars characters and their doings and other stuff like that, I can't really see that this does any great harm, although a worry would be how likely the different lists are to be updated. It's one of those pages that I wouldn't cry to see it gone but I don't see any great need to get rid of it. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 00:35, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm not a collector, but it seems to be a valid subject for <a href="http://www.linns.com/howto/wheretostart/wheretostart.asp?uID=" class="external text" title="http://www.linns.com/howto/wheretostart/wheretostart.asp?uID=" rel="nofollow">"topical collecting"</a>. Though many stamps are issued each year, there are not necessarily many that are of fish.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I imagine a lot of work did go into it, and if it were for a book on stamp collecting that'd be ideal, but it's not encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian1979_8a73.html" title="User:Brian1979">Brian1979</a> 02:01, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are a couple dozen "standard" "X on stamps" topics - people (for which we have an extensive collection of lists), animals of various groups, ships/boats, etc. Fish is certainly one of the common topics. List is stable and low-maintenance when the listing includes a terminating date ("the list is complete through 1986"). I note that <a href="../../../f/i/s/FishBase_0d81.html" title="FishBase">FishBase</a> includes stamp data, so at least professional ichthyologists find it useful. "Encyclopedic"? Hard to say, since we don't actually have a non-tautological definition of the word ("it's encyclopedic if it's included in an encyclopedia"). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 03:55, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
