<p><b>Delete</b> - listing people by surgical procedures they have undergone is generally a bad idea. People in general do not gain notability by having had a particular surgery. For a related discussion (about a similar category) see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_March_19_8c65.html#Category:People_who_have_had_Tommy_John_surgery" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 March 19">Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_19#Category:People_who_have_had_Tommy_John_surgery</a> <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Very strong delete</b> - List of <i>what???</i> I mean, really, this is taking the idea of "loosely related topics" to an extreme. How about List of politicians who have recieved flu shots. Wait, wait, I had better be careful about <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> ... <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:54, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this article as a supplement to the main <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microfracture_surgery.html" title="Microfracture surgery">microfracture surgery</a> article because this is a very high-profile surgery in the sports world. The surgery is a recent development that is often referred to as "experimental" or "high-risk" in the media, which leads some to question its effectiveness. I believe the list has value because:
<ul>
<li>it provides an easy way to see what athletes in which sports have had the surgery</li>
<li>it provides links to their individual articles so in most cases a reader can see how (or if) their athletic career was affected by the surgery</li>
<li>the article is not original research and satisifies <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>; every single item on the page is cited with a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> from a variety of media outlets - a comparison to flu shots or any other trivial medical procedure is invalid</li>
<li>the list contains information directly relevant to the main article but is too long to be included there</li>
<li>it serves two of the "main purposes" outlined in <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> - it is grouped by theme, and can also be use for navigation for someone researching this topic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Given the extensive sports media coverage of this specific surgery and its effects, I simply don't see what policy or guideline the list fails to satisfy. Don't forget <a href="../../../p/a/p/WP%7EPAPER_01fc.html" title="WP:PAPER">WP:PAPER</a>. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 16:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One other point: I feel this list is more than a directory because it is organized by sport. When a high-profile athlete undergoes this surgery, I believe readers would look for information on the experience of other athletes in the same sport. For instance, if Kobe Bryant had microfracture surgery, the list would inform many interested readers of other basketball players who have had the surgery and direct them to their article to learn more about their recovery. The same could be said for David Beckham and soccer, or Peyton Manning and football. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 17:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You're right, Wikipedia is not paper - but it is also not a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">directory</a>. If any of the examples in your list are somehow particularly important cases to the development of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microfracture_surgery.html" title="Microfracture surgery">microfracture surgery</a> then they might warrant a mention there. Also if the surgery had a particularly strong impact on a player's career then it would warrant mention on said athlete's entry. In spite of assertions that the surgery is "experimental" or in some way controversial (which is close to POV pushing) it is a fairly common procedure, as evidenced by the length of your list. It may not be a minor, trivial procedure like a flu shot, but it's also not a defining characteristic linking these people. It's still a loose association. You make a great argument that the information is <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">useful</a> but usefulness is not a reason for inclusion. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:26, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Points well taken, although I'd still argue the link between these people is more than tenuous - it could be argued that it does become a defining characteristic of the player given how often this surgery is mentioned in news stories and broadcasts. As for the "experimental" assertion, that's not just me, that's major media outlets: see <a href="http://robots.cnnsi.com/2003/football/nfl/10/12/closerlook.pantherscolts/" class="external autonumber" title="http://robots.cnnsi.com/2003/football/nfl/10/12/closerlook.pantherscolts/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for an example of it being called "controversial" although this article <a href="http://www.nba.com/sonics/news/stoudemire070108.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nba.com/sonics/news/stoudemire070108.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> specifically points out that with recent successes the "controversy" has all but disappeared. I will agree that the surgery seems to be becoming increasingly common which will decrease the value of this list in the future; if this is a reason for deletion then I can understand that, although I still feel it is valid for inclusion now. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 17:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As a case in point, consider that the articles of the 18 NBA athletes listed as having undergone the surgery, only 5 mention the microfracture surgery, and only 2 of those mention the impact it may have had on their recovery and career. Please don't get me wrong - the work you put in to making sure the article is properly sourced is fantastic. It's just that given the paucity of information regarding the surgery on the player articles, it doesn't seem to be that important an aspect in their careers, and doesn't seem to make for a good candidate for a common connection in a list. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:58, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
