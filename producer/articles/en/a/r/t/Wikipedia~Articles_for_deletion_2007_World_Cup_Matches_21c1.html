<li><b>Comment</b>. If this thing is kept, it <i>really</i> needs a renaming.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The stats might eventually find a place in the overall report of the tournament as a whole.

<li><b>Regretful delete</b> - while this isn't a paper encyclopaedia, I do question the usefulness of this, particularly with very decent external links providing identical information and, as such, being <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for such events. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rambling_Man_48d1.html" title="User:The Rambling Man">The Rambling Man</a> 22:48, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - has no usefulness, it will just be a recreation of a scorecard from a newspaper, or cricinfo or bbc.co.uk or any news/cricket site. Unless it contains prose on the happenings of each match, in my opinion it has no longevity here other than for the duration of the tournament. Therefore, I recommend deletion. –<a href="../../../m/d/c/User%7EMdcollins1984_1ad6.html" title="User:Mdcollins1984">MDCollins</a> (<i><a href="../../../m/d/c/User_talk%7EMdcollins1984_5836.html" title="User talk:Mdcollins1984">talk</a></i>) 23:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The article does not violate any Wikipedia policy (see list of what the article is <i>not</i> above in response to the stated policies that the article supposedly violated) and the usefulness of an article is a subjective decision and not a proper way for determining whether an article should be deleted or not (think of <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> and other such articles which are only useful to the people who care or even know about such things). If you do not find an article useful, it doesn't necessarily mean that the articles isn't useful to other people. Besides all that if this article is deleted then so should the following articles: <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage_423a.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage">2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_-_Group_A_f884.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup - Group A">2006 FIFA World Cup - Group A</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_-_Group_B_be3b.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup - Group B">2006 FIFA World Cup - Group B</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_-_Group_C_3364.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup - Group C">2006 FIFA World Cup - Group C</a>, etc. (with articles all the way down to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_-_Group_H_06a1.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup - Group H">2006 FIFA World Cup - Group H</a>). Now if the FIFA World Cup can have main articles about its matches, even though there are numerous other websites on the internet to which persons could be referred to instead <i>a la</i> Cricinfo, then why shouldn't the Cricket World Cup? Any deletion of this article without a move to delete the corresponding football articles constitutes a double-standard.72.27.8.49 02:06, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The Biathlon article is more comparable to the 2007 Cricket World Cup article or the 2006 FIFA World Cup article, not to articles detail matches/events of either of those tournaments.72.27.8.49 18:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - For all the reasons stated previously: It does not violate any of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policies (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> are not applicable - check the criteria properly), and in fact is exactly the kind of data that would be found in a traditional encyclopaedia (thus "not encyclopaedic" is not a valid argument against inclusion either). User 72.27.8.49's comment re: the FIFA World Cup entries being allowed to stand is valid - either all must stay or all must go. Proponents of deletion clearly can't even agree on whether producing a scorecard is primary source material, whether it is duplication of a source, or whether it requires attribution to, or validation from, a source! In view of their contradictory comments - obviously based purely on each person's personal interpretation of the WP guidelines - the scorecards pages for sports events should stay until and unless specific clarification is made 'officially' by WP. However I totally agree that this page <i>must</i> be renamed to include the word 'cricket', since there are world cup championships in several sports. I believe <b>2007 Cricket World Cup Matches</b> would be the most sensible title. - 158.143.133.150 19:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I consider it is duplication of primary source information, and horribly formatted, not up-to-date and hard-to-read duplication at that. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a> states: <i>other source material that are only useful when presented with their original, un-modified wording.</i> As a cricket fan, a scorecard is useful, but only in the normally formatted way, which other sites do much better than wiki does. Maybe it belongs in Wikisource, if at all? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe-Pope_c583.html" title="User:The-Pope">The-Pope</a> 02:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, if you read the discussion page for the article, you'll see why the page is not up-to-date. Having had the article listed as being considered for deletion, the author hasn't touched it since, so why complain about the article not being up-to-date when this very process is what basically drove the author away? I agree that the page could be re-done so as to make it more reader-friendly (rather like the FIFA pages), but that doesn't require deletion. As a true cricket fan you could contribute to correcting the page rather than just sitting back and deleting it. I doubt the FIFA fans out there who wrote the various world cup match pages would have even dreamed about letting such articles be deleted simply because they were badly written initially. It probably won't matter anyway as User 158.143.133.150 rightly points out that the proponents of deletion can't agree on what the page is, much less what policy it ever violated, but seeing as how so many people seem set against the page, for some reason or another (usually out of personal consideration) then the article will probably end up being deleted. It's a shame that the info couldn't at least be merged with the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Cricket_World_Cup_group_stage_d75f.html" title="2007 Cricket World Cup group stage">2007 Cricket World Cup group stage</a> and the author convinced to contribute to that page since this seems headed for deletion.72.27.85.98 01:52, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think that the summary information on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Cricket_World_Cup_group_stage_d75f.html" title="2007 Cricket World Cup group stage">2007 Cricket World Cup group stage</a> is much more appropriate than trying to replicate full scorecards, which are better represented on other sites. Isn't the fact that no-one can agree on what the page is trying to be justification for its deletion? What is the value of keeping this page? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe-Pope_c583.html" title="User:The-Pope">The-Pope</a> 03:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> "No-one can agree on what the page is trying to be.."? Actually all the people, including the author, who voted to keep the page know what the page is supposed to be. It's an article on the individual matches of the 2007 cricket world cup, since the information that would be needed for the article would make the main article on the 2007 tournament very long. If you read through the debate, you'll see, as User 158.143.133.150 says, that the only ones who don't agree on what the page is are the ones voting for deletion. They get bogged down in trying to decide whether or not the page violates any policy or whether it is "primary source material, duplication of a source, or whether it requires attribution to, or validation from, a source". Also is there anything in wikipedia's deletion policy that says that if nobody can agree on a page then it should be deleted? If so then many more pages have an even greater justification for deletion. The value of keeping the page was already outlined in the fact that the FIFA world cup 2006 tournaments have analagous pages i.e. it's a page that gives details that would detract from the main article's readability. If the page can be formatted properly, then do so. If the page can be reformatted, but a suitable alternative exists, then the procedure is to merge and redirect, not delete.72.27.85.98 16:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
