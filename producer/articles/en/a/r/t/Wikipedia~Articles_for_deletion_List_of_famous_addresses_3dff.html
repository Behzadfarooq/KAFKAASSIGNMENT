<li><b>Keep</b>, tell me how this is different from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_streets.html" title="List of famous streets">List of famous streets</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_addresses_of_fictional_characters.html" title="List of the addresses of fictional characters">List of the addresses of fictional characters</a>? There are many addresses well known by their address and that's what this list is for. The nominator here apparently didn't read the article nor the talk page because he claims this list is "potentially unlimited" which is almost patently false. This is <i>not</i> a list of famous people's addresses and is no more unlimited than <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_streets.html" title="List of famous streets">list of famous streets</a>. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 05:14, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's not indiscriminate so IMO it gets past <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and BlueValour seems to concede that the information could be converted into a category. So I don't see a valid reason for deletion. Am I missing something? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 09:32, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. I see the point of this list -- there are articles with addresses as titles. If the list is maintained as such (and it states its criteria at the top) I think it should be kept. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 13:50, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm undecided at this point, but one thing that troubles me is that the criteria here seems rather arbitrary. What constitutes a "famous address"? How is this quantified? Why isn't this a list of famous people's addresses? As it stands I see no reason why Oprah's address couldn't be added here and the text "but not just a list of addresses of famous people or things." removed as this seems a rather arbitrary decision to exclude that information by the article creator. Also, where is the sourcing suggesting these are famous addresses? Is this just an example of "I know it is famous so it should be in this list?"--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:47, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Did you not read the talk page? You seem to have completely missed the point. It is not a list of famous people's address. Would you recognize oprah's address as her address? Would the average person know? Doubtful. How many [americans] recognize "1600 pennsylvania avenue" as the white house? The talk page explains this and gives two litmus tests for this and I explained it above. The criteria is not arbitrary as you believe it to be.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I welcome any input (perhaps this could have been done before AFDing it) on how to make this more clear: the addresses here are recognizable when they stand alone. I think 10 downing street, 221B Baker Street, 1600 pennsylvania ave, and 30 rockefeller plaza are excellent examples that demonstrate this. Would you know oprah's address from jay leno's from tom clancy's from leonard nemoy's?</dd>

<dd>As for "As it stands I see no reason why Oprah's address couldn't be added here". People move and people change addresses. Wikipedia is not a phone book. When was the last time the white house moved? Or the PM of the UK? Did Sherlock Holmes ever move? <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 17:39, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I read the talk page and I commented there as well. Your point about celebrity addresses is well taken. The problem I still see though is that the addresses you've cited as examples are not sourced as famous, specifically it is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> in the article that these addresses are famous or well known. I think it is an assumption on your part (albeit perhaps a correct one) that most Americans would recognize "1600 pennsylvania avenue", but what of wider notability? How many people in the world would recognize that as the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a>? Does the fact that the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> have an article qualify it as a notable address? What about <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> locations that might have significance to the populace of a city and be referred to with their address but are not perhaps generally known by the larger public? I still don't think your litmus test for inclusion is well enough defined.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not a heavy AFD/IFD/etc. participant but "notability" seems to be thrown around a lot in such discussions so I think the existance of an article would be sufficient to say the address is notable. A redirect, to me, says that the address is well known enough to trouble someone to create said redirect (please don't go creating a bunch of redirects to dilute my point&#160;:).</dd>

<dd>I initially set the bar to "famous" to make it a more exclusive list but I, like you, recognized the trouble in labelling them as "famous". If lowering the bar to notability presumed by the existance of a WP article is required then so be it. On looking around <a href="../../../4/0/_/40_Wall_Street_14c5.html" title="40 Wall Street">40 Wall Street</a> should probably be added being that it claimed the world's tallest building (albiet for ~1 month). I'm more than willing to "lower the bar" and rename to list of notable addresses and discuss how to make this article work but I still think it's doable. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 19:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Changing the title to 'notable' would help, defined as having a WP article. I propose to do that unless there are strong objections. The other thing that is essential is to separate the fictional from real addresses. To give the list utility I suggest a move away from country splits to topic splits. For example 'Notable addresses of world leaders', Notable addresses of fictional detectives' etc. If a couple of these were setup and then filled before the next is created that gets over the incomplete problem, and would give the list real purpose. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
