<li><b>Delete</b>. Dying does not confer notability, and we would never have a list of non-notable people in an article of their own.

It appears to be taken from <a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/" class="external text" title="http://icasualties.org/oif/" rel="nofollow">here</a> (see the large table part way down 'military casualties by month'), so (more complete) info is available elsewhere on the web. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 14:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Userify</b> Agree content is not encyclopedic for reasons listed above. An encyclopedia summarizes rather than simply listing every detail.

<li><b>Delete</b> I hate to say delete as it's clear a lot of work went into this and I understand the desire for this sort of thing, unfortunately it is too long of a list and really is a thinly veiled memorial.

<li><b>Move to Wikisource</b> Not a good encyclopedia article, since most of these unfortunate people are not individually notable other than being on this list.

<dd><b>comment</b>. This information would be useful if it was complete. An incomplete list of this sort is misleading, which I think is worse than useless.
