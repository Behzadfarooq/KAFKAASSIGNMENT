Yes, the original article was total gibberish (I'm surprised it wasn't just tagged as {{<a href="../../../n/o/n/Template%7ENonsense_9794.html" title="Template:Nonsense">nonsense</a>}}), but as far as I'm aware there's no ban on rewriting an article (or as in this case redirecting it to something at least getting on for appropriate) while it's under consideration for AfD. This isn't "subverting", it's "improving", I'd hazard.

<li><b>Delete</b> Unverifiable at best: "Babyrina" gets some google hits, but they either seem to be names/nicknames or random pornsite words used to spam google. The second person mentioned in the article, Kavita Kaur, is apparently an actual minor Maylaysian actress, whose <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0442443/" class="external text" title="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0442443/" rel="nofollow">IMDB entry</a> shows 4 roles, 1 possibly a costarring role... however, nothing I could find supports the allegation that she's "Babyrina"s lesbian partner. I suspect the whole thing might even be a subtle indirect attack on Kavita Kaur. But even if the article is 100% true, which seems unlikely, it still wouldn't be notable.

<dd>I am an American citizen in the United States writing on behalf of the community at en.wikipedia.org, and am looking for information to expand our online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A user has recently posted an article which touches on the history of Nauru. The article is about Benjamin Drake Van Wissen, and can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BenVanWissen" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BenVanWissen" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BenVanWissen</a></dd>
<dd>As a volunteer-based and completely open organisation, we at Wikipedia must try hard to maintain the accuracy and truthfulness of the articles in our encyclopedia. In attempting to verify the information of the BenVanWissen article, we were unable to find mention of this person anywhere else. It is our hope that you could help us verify or deny the authenticity of the information in the article. Any information or suggestions for further inquiry would be appreciated.</dd>

<li>Well, I got a response from the Embassy, but not specific enough to make a change. They directed me to the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_979.html" class="external text" title="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_979.html" rel="nofollow">Consular Information Sheet</a>, but also gave contact information for the Nauru Consulate General in Melbourne, Australia. I'm not in a position to be making phone calls Down Under, but if there's an Aussie Wikipedian who'd like to give them a call at telephone (613) 9653-5709, they might have more information. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonsaiViking_8e61.html" title="User:BonsaiViking">BonsaiViking</a> 15:14, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I gave them a call at 12:30pm AEDST on Novemember 9, 2005 (I live in Melbourne, Australia). They were rather terse, I don't think this is the sort of information they exist to provide, but they were able to confirm that the statue of Van Wissen is in place on the island. I was, however, unable to confirm the other information in the article. The article does seem more plausible now. A cursory search for Nauru's exports does show that their economy runs mainly on the harvesting of phosphates, and that it waas devastated by this industry. Also, phosphates such as this were mined unjustly (if not illegally) by Australians in Nauru, as evidenced by the 1993 court case. 02:00, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an accurate, biographical first hand account of someones life. Just because one isn't famous, or rich does not mean they are not entitled to have their own entry. Deleting this webpage just exemplifies the social hierarchy that is entrenched within our culture. Everyone has equal right to their own wikipedia web page.</p>
<p>Although one might say Bolbo Jung's life isn't significant history, I believe the definition of "significant" history is completely subjective. Although his life does not profoundly impact the world on a whole it does accurately portray the "typical" life of a suburban upper-middle class male. To some, this sort of account might be very "significant." The most mundane everyday articles tell the most about our socitey. Society isn't made up of the Barry Bonds' and Albert Einstein's that make up Wikipedia, it is made up of the Bolbo Jungs, Joe Shmoes, and John Q. Publics.</p>

"On One Glorious Day", recorded by Joe Roper as piano solo in 1979 on Stamps-Baxter album, "No Tears Over There", recoreded by Arthur Watson in 1981 published by Stamps-Baxter in 1980. There are other songs more current, but thats all for now.</p>

<p>Other songs, like, "Don't Be Late", "He's My Guide", "In Heaven My Eternal Home", "In Stormy Weather", and "I'll Never Understand" have been reprinted in various congregational songbooks over the last 15 years. "I'll Never Understand" has been recorded by various church groups and choirs in Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>
<p>Both "I'll Never Understand" and "Because Of Jesus" were recorded by the Cumberland Valley Quartet, a group which Dr. Reid and his wife Betty-Marie B. Reid sang in before the birth of their son Nathan.</p>
<p>In the area of children's music, "Jesus Loves A Kid Like Me", "Close You Eyes and Sleep", "We Shine For Jesus", and "God's In Control" have all been published by Leoma Music Co. between 1993 and 2005. All have been recorded and performed by various childrens groups at various singing schools. Also they have all been recorded by the Leoma Singers.</p>
<p>Ben Speer Music published and recorded, "Peace For My Soul" in 1993. Again in 1994, they did "Peace, Joy and Love".</p>
<p>Got to Go!</p>
<p>The Jeffress Family Singers recorded, "Strike The Tent" 1999, "One God, One Faith, And One Salvation" in 2000, "Heaven, Home For Me" in 2001 and "Only Jesus Had a View From The Cross" in 2002. All four songs were published by jeffress/phillips music in those same years.</p>

<p>This was all we could come up with on short notice, and it may be a week or two before we can get back with you all. Hope this will give you something to chew on in the meantime. As you may have found out, a lot of folks in this area do not get any recognition or fame, thus little written record of what they have done or what they are doing. Dr. Reid is not the most famous by any means, and you folks would do a world of good to find out more about him and many others involved in Southern Gospel Convention Singing. For an easy to reach source, try Arkansas State Senators Jimmy Jeffress and Gene Jeffress. They are first cousins to Marty Phillips and of the jeffress/phillips music company of Crossett, Arkansas. You can email the State Senate in Little Rock or just give them a call.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see any pushing of editor's POV in this piece. It seems (I say "seems" because the article does not contain nearly enough information to allow verification) the article is pointing to (ie reporting) results of a poll of science faculty on a notable topic. I see nothing unencyclopedic about this, it seems relevant. The article fails on many other levels, but seems like something that ought (at best) to be mentioned in an article reporting upon a notable debate on the topic of science education in the USA. I can understand why POV issues leap to the fore on this topic, but judging from the tone of Carlton's comments the votes to delete seem as POV driven as the article is accused of being. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 19:16, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. As it happens, I am strongly opposed to "creationism" and/or "intelligent design" being taught in public (or publicly supported) schools. However, I do not think that opinion polls are encyclopedic unless they are used in the context of a broader article as evidence of formation and/or shifting of public attitudes on the subject in question. Since voting in here, I have become aware that other editors think that opinion polls are encycloprdic in and of themselves. Therefor, I am withdrawing my delete vote due to uncertainty about what is going on in here. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> 19:46, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If I thought this was simply an opinion poll of the general public, then I would be far more disposed towards thinking it is unencyclopedic. The article presents this as a survey of scientists (perhaps of faculty members at Case Western) which says something different than a simple opinion poll. I'm pretty emphatically opposed to teaching so-called "intelligent design", as well. From what I can glean from this article, I think the report supports my POV. That the article doesn't says enough for me to tell whether this is true makes me uncomfortable about POV accusations. Like I said, I think the article is not acceptable on other grounds, but I think it could be fixed/merged. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 21:44, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment: Like tightwaddery, cheapskating is a pejorative term, but frugality is a virtue. The current text states it is "often incorrectly confused with cheapness or miserliness". So I don't think it appropriate to redirect there. We have <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheapskate.html" title="Cheapskate">cheapskate</a>, which IMO should probably be redirected to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miser.html" title="Miser">miser</a>. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 08:31, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sure. I don't think it's notable because as far as I can tell, Jackson was not actually a particularly significant figure. "Anti-Kerry League" gets a single Google hit. I wasn't able to find any "Vote and Live" hits that actually pertained to Jackson's organization. I'm having serious verifiability problems here, in other words. I freely admit that the Google test is far from infallible, but if he was a significant activist figure in the early 21st century, I'd say that he'd have to show up on that radar, even a little. I may be mistaken, obviously, but I don't think he does. Even if he did, the lack of hits suggests that he was not a notable figure, and given that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, it's not enough for something to just verifiably exist in order to be included in Wikipedia -- I believe that a certain degree of notability is a requirement.

<li><b>Comment</b> No vote because I'm not sure of the policy on radio stations, but is 'potential' audience really relevant? Something's potential audience can be huge but that doesn't mean anyone watches/listens to it - websites are the extreme example of this. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:59, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: that's why I didn't vote keep. Even the most non-notable station in a big city has a big potential audience (though some have such a small range, it might not be that big). I'm voting delete for now because it doesn't make sense for a notable radio station to have such a low transmitting power. It's only 20 Watts. The well known local FM stations in my area are 3,000 to 25,000 Watts, and they're not big city stations, which are often more powerful. If someone from the area says it's notable or some other evidence is found, I'll reconsider. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:30, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A "potential" audience is not the actual audience; for example, NHL on cable TV in the US has a potential audience somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 million. It has an actual audience generally less than 500 thousand.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article claims that this station was the third ever community FM station in Japan. Also claims that it is a leader in the low-power community FM movement and is an 'opinion leader'. To me, that sounds sufficient for it to have an article on Wikipedia. This probably has as much listener-ship as most college radio stations in the US, and it is generally considered that a college radio station is notable enough to have an article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A 20-watt radio station has a "potential audience of over 800,000"? Leaving aside the nonsensensical handwaving about "potential audience" (every website, by that logic, has a "potential audience" of billions), there's no way 20 watts is going to cover that many residents.

I should have said this earlier. In common with most problematic pages on Wikipedia, this one does not meet WP:V and WP:RS. There is a self referential external link, but there are no references to any independent, reputable publications (newspaper, magazine, book, thesis, monograph or other) that focus on this subject (ie the station): if someone had off-loaded spam onto Wikipedia, it will not look much different. That is the main reason this page should be deleted. In addition to that, the wattage of the station raised concerns about whether the unverified claims and projections might not be entirely incorrect: however, this is a technical issue, and its answer, whatever it is, is of secondary importance to the central weakness pointed out above. Fg2's comment seems to suggest that it is possible for a 20W statio to broadcast as widely as the blurb on the page claims. I'm willing to go along with the claim that this is true in principle, although I'm not convinced that this station actually manages it. Be that as it may, this is peripheral to the problems of the page. My vote remains unaltered.

<ul>
<li>I've added a couple of external sources now. Probably no one that helps verify the 20W claim, but at least I found evidence for the existence of the station (and a one-hour Portuguese-language programme on it) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 07:38, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is verifiable, honest information. Deleting this article would diminish Wikipedia's encyclopedic nature.

<li><b>Delete</b> Obviously. If this survives AfD, it needs to be relisted and the nominator needs to a better job pointing out the 20W issue, which is less than a lightbulb.

<li><b>Comment</b>: a mistake for 20 kW perhaps, but not 20 MW, as that would probably make it the most powerful station on Earth. However, some small stations are actually 20 W or less. I believe the FCC requires a license at 10 W, so unlicensed stations, in the U.S. at least, would be even less. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 14:38, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>lol. Thanks for correcting the error. I believe you are correct about the cut-off; iPod and other digital music player attachments that work over FM are about 10 are they not? And those barely have enough juice to get picked up by a car antenna. It makes a 20w station highly unlikely and definitely not noteworthy.<a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 16:42, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Walkie-talkies (hand-held transceivers) are in the milliwatts, and have ranges of a few hundred meters. Radio amateurs, with bigger antennas, can communicate halfway around the world with five or ten watts. Yes, that's comparable to a night light.

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous. Vote count leaves us with nothing clear. My observation here is that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and the lack of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited sources</a> is a concern, something that has not really been adequately covered by the "keep" voters. I also observe that the article is extremely short. While there is not a consensus to delete, I will use my discretion and call this a <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiverse.html" title="Multiverse">multiverse</a>, as has been suggested by at least two people, and invite people to undo this redirect if they wish to expand this article and, most importantly, make it verifiable. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:03, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Okay... that's odd. I read his name in an article about art purchasing trends at North American art shows, one of the trends is Chinese work. Here's the quote from today's <i>Toronto Star</i> article "Big art fair says much about buyers' tastes": <i>No art magazine with a circulation of more than six readers has gone without a recent feature on the burgeoning contemporary art practice in China. TIAF brought Shengtian Zheng — co-curator of 2004 Shanghai Biennale — on board as guest curator for "Art Rising," a sampler of new Chinese work, including some site-specific work by Wang Tiande and <b>Jin Jiangbo</b>, both from Shanghai. As might be expected, "a selection of galleries representing Chinese artists," note TIAF's organizers, will be there, "underpinning the exhibition."</i> I can contact the author, Peter Goddard, to see if it was a typo. However he's a very knowledgable art critic, and <i>The Toronto Star</i> is way too respectable to make up info. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">user:zanimum</a>

<p><br />
Thank you Ulayiti for your assistance. My attitude reflects no concerns at all towards you and your decision. I am however disgusted with the condescending tone of some of your contemporaries, who at no time attempted to give me a shot at making a halfway decent edit. You are the most professional one here it seems, and they could learn a lesson in square-dealing from you. I dont know what sock-puppetry is, but it sounds like a cry for help.</p>
<p>Joseph Wood</p>
<p>Postscript--My guess is that these people choose to focus on sockpuppets and what is deletable in their eyes, instead of trying to help others construct a page in the way "the romans do." Perhaps if they took your approach, they would have less of what they so complain about.</p>
<p>When I was a bit younger, there was no shortage of successful or wise elder gentlemen and lady who did not condescend to your obtuse behavior. Instead they saw nothing but value in attempting to help along a young newcomer who had ambitions. It is called courtesy. They did everything in their power to share some of what they had learned, rather than criticizing those that may possibly look up to them. I was taught that you must learn courtesy to deal with others. I suppose they do not teach old-fashioned goodness at your Ivy-League schools, and apparently no one had the home version either.</p>
<p>If I am successful in my endeavors, I will rememeber to try and help those who need it the most. Remember this gentlemen, after you leave this mortal coil, it is not your resume and accolades that will be remembered--but instead your kindness, or discourtesy. You just learned that lesson for free.</p>

I am trying to compromise with you. Your advice would be helpful.</p>

<dd>You note below that you were repeatedly blocked under various sock-puppets. I blocked you, multiple times, for obvious reasons - A good piece of advice is to not vandalise user pages with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Nlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27250486" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Nlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27250486" rel="nofollow">racist remarks</a>.

If you are now editing in good faith, which I intend to believe, then welcome. However, your article does not warrant inclusion because you are not notable enough, yet. In time, when you are, then someone else will see fit to include you, along with verifiable evidence of notability. Simply including yourself because you feel like doing so is vanity.

<p>I am a big enough man to say I'm sorry. Nlu, if I came off offensive, it was because I was offended. I will bear with you, if you can with me. Truce? JW</p>
<p>PS--I dont understand what it is that makes my article delete-worthy? At first, I was told that it was not from a neutral POV, so I deleted such portions that might be construed in that way. Next, Someone commented on my vanity, so I deleted portions of the article that did not reflect the nature of its value as a description of the person's notability.</p>
<p>Then becoming a so-called vandal, my work was repeatedly reverted back before these constructive edits. That is why I became a bit irritated.</p>
<p>I ask myself, what does a guy have to do to make someone lay off? Why was I targeted so bad? If it is retaliation, and not the nature of it's content, then it should stand, minus a few edits. If, on the other hand, it is indeed the content that has need for editing--then why doesnt a few knowledgeble caring wiki members help me improve the quality?</p>
<p>deletion was a little premature last night, ten minutes after my first time writing an article. I admit I needed help. I will take all/any suggestions if someone cares enough to assist rather than destroy/needlessly belittle.</p>
<p>Joseph Wood</p>
<p>Also, consider that most right-minded adults wont resort to such measures such as sock-puppetry if they have a constructive relationship with others, and feel welcomed and assisted. I had to edit my file, and people were blocking me. What I did in retaliation was not good either, but AS I SAW, THOSE MEMBERS ARE MORE CAPABLE THAN I AT RESTORING THEIR WORK.</p>

He may well develop a national or even international reputation making him eligible for an article but as yet, he is not yet notable enough. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:54, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for your kind comments about my posted work. If you take the time to visit [website] you would see that I am quite serious and active in producing quality works of art, and unlike others, do not simply do the same type of work--over and over again.</p>
<p>You are correct that I am not nationally known. I can tell you that my work is hanging in Austrailia, Norway, Brooklyn, Texas, New Orleans, and Germany--so, I tend to differ with you. To make a living at art is hard enough--but to have been recognized by collegiate journals for work that was not done in the classroom as both current and original is for an artist very rare. I have never had to advertise, and I didn't think that my article was a promotional ad.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is vanity and perhaps it isnt. There is a create a page feature here; it's understandable why people would use it. To say that I'm not well known enough as the criteria your using would make sense, except as you well know there are numerous pages on wikipedia that do not meet such criteria, and there is no bandwagon to delete their work. I have visited the pages for deletion list also.</p>
<p>I thought the purpose of an encyclopedia was information; I didn't realize that it was a popularity contest. Censorship. True descriptions of fact and of a biographical nature is valid, if there is something noteworthy about the person. If you are saying that I am not noteworthy because you have never heard of me, that is a personal trivial excuse. The real reason that you do not want my page on here, is that I did not ask your permission. I do not need your support to be a successful artist, nor do I need your acceptance of the merits of my art. I have had plenty of blessings so far as an artist, and your personal opinion is just that--your personal opinion.</p>
<p>Needless to point out that there are the equivalent of 3-5 pages on Osama Bin Laden and Abu Musab Al-Zarquawi. I suppose they deserve a page and I don't. But then, theyre famous and that's what matters. They don't have my talent, nor half of the talent that most of the people you would nominate for deletion.</p>
<p>Since you have never heard of me, think of all the other remote and equally valid subjects that populate wiki. Tell me, where is the criteria posted that explains when I am good enough in your eyes to have half a page?</p>

<p>I suppose if I had murdered a celebrity, or flew airplanes into buildings--then you would want to shaare my bio with wiki's patrons. I believe you are just an editor, and little more. If you can't find imperfection in someone else, you can't be happy, nor do your job. People as talented and successful as myself must make your job hard, because we have no need for an editor.</p>
<p>I can see why you reacted to me in the way which you did. Marcus Aurelius would have told you that you project your negative view on your private failures onto others, because it is your nature. In other words, you can't help being such a obtuse person. Enjoy your picture of yourself that I'm sure is hanging next to your Framed Certificates. People like you take things too seriously--except when it does not involve promoting you.</p>
<p>You create what exactly?</p>

<p>Ok. Here is what the page says. "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field"</p>
<p>Now, what divides my current status from this description? I am a painter a professional my work has been recognized as exceptional by diverse sources</p>
<p>now, it is up to others whether my work will become an enduring part of the field. All you did was simply look to the number of hits on google as an authority on fine art. Since I have created over 500 oils, 2000 drawings and sold almost all of them, been asked to paint murals in signifigant sites, and have sold oils to prominent personalities--who are you to say whether or not my work will be remembered in the historical record? I have already secured my place. I didnt know I had to be a superstar on TV and the internet too.</p>
<p>Jeffrey O. Gustafson/Fortune Teller....????</p>
<p>This correspondence may be worth something someday. Would you like my autograph, Jeffrey?</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unverifyable. Unfortunate, but if there's no attainable reference that Mr. Wood's work is exeptional by acclaimed experts it is hard to believe he has any merits/value to art history or the current stream he falls in. I tried the St. Lious Post ditchpatch and the North County suburban Journal site's (both of them seem to have the same online reference) but unfortunatly I couldn't get anything from it.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. I also did a fair bit of searching and couldn't find any external verification of notability, although I did find a fair bit on another painter named Joseph Wood. That's not to say his art doesn't have merit, but Wikipedia's about other people recognizing him, not about the art itself. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 02:42, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">newgrounds</a> article states the nature of Newgrounds and how it is relavelent to the internet. <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Dynamite_98d8.html" title="Miss Dynamite">Miss Dynamite</a> article is similar in nature to the mention to Dr. Shroud. This page does not promote Knight Entertianment, but is simply a related article that is in relation to three other web pages and two related articles.

This article does not promote any of these other entries, but just states their nature and relivance to other articles. Also Knight Entertainment is in talks with <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Dynamite_98d8.html" title="Miss Dynamite">Miss Dynamite</a> as well as other popular flash series about the production of flash related DVD's. These are all in direct relation to the established article for <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> <a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a> 3 November 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>Newsgrounds appears to be a large and well-established website with 850,000 registered members. Knight Entertainment (est. 2004) is doubtless a fine company, but one DVD release does not make it notable. An article whose only contributor is the founder of the company, using a Wikipedia account seemingly set up for that purpose and which has contributed nothing else, will naturally be open to suspicions of vanity/advertising. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 14:18, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The duality exists because there was an error with the lower case 'e' in entertainment. Both were to be capitolized as in Mirror site I alter created.</p>
<p>The duality of Rcknight and RCKNIGHT was due to the fact I did not know that articeles were case sencitive. Please delete the all cap one.</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I just made it late yeasterday, and I have yet to tell anyone about it due to the deletion ststus. I have yet to have anyone give me compelling reson why my article should not be allowed when some of the articles I have mentioned above are allowed? Most of the flash series you allow are just web sites. Knight Entertainment not only works with several differnt clients, more will be added upon the release of the 6 other projects currently in works. Those 6 were not listed because they are not a matter of fact until then. I also do not want to get accused of "promoting" them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give me a reason why the above articles were allowed to exist? If my site is an advertisement (I do not post any links to where to buy the DVD by the way. It is listed on over 30 web stores.) then the articles listed in my earlier comments are advertisments for their web sites. If there is no "stock" here, then why is there stock in articles that explain about web pages based on flash animation series? No one has dared to explain that to me. I have just as much stock if not more with an actual product.--<a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a> 20:23, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>So just making a web page is notable. (As in the examples I listed above.) But taking something in cyber space, and taking it to market in association with a variety of those notable web pages is not notable. I fail to see tha logic. Other DVD production are noted, and other flash series are noted, then why is a flash series taken to the DVD not notable? Of the 100's of flash animation, only 8 have made it to the DVD market. I am helping more to faciliate that need. --<a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a> 21:01, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am still waiting for clearification on why my article is not notable, when it is more of a rare acomplishment then simply making a web page as sited articles listed above. In fact I am currently in talk with two of those flash animated series to aid them in the creation of DVD's prodcutions as well. Now if I--<a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a> 22:17, 3 November 2005 (UTC) were truly "promoting" or "advertising" I would have mentioned those facts, but I did not. If you are doing this just because I made it then delete it and i will have someone else create it, would that satisify your issues? I have noticed that the notion of advertisingment has not been used, but now it is a matter of not being noteable, when much more simple accomplishements have been noted. I keep stating my case because no one has yet to offer any compelling evidence to the contrary. It would take less time and effort for me to get someone to draw and create a flash series, and that would be notable. I have spent my time and efforts setting up a distribution network, DVD production editing studio, praphic arts design, and manufcaturing capaibilities to provide a cost effective way for underground series and productions a way for them to get their series to the main stream market. This is a far more complicated task then building a web site, and placing some flash animation on it. But my efforts are not notable. I still fail to see the logic in that, and have yet to hear otherwise from any of you. Then again I would doubt that any of you have a real concept of what it takes to get something to market in the mainstream media.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a>, lots of people here use other articles or previous decisions as precedent to stop their own advertising or non-notable pages from being deleted. It never works (in fact, it draws the attention of "deletionist" editors (like me?) and is thus counterproductive). Each Article for Deletion consideration is based on the article's own merits. The only way to avoid deletion of an article where people are generally anti is <i>not</i> to argue here, but instead to go back to the article and edit it to address the concerns. You have five days to do that between nomination and deletion, which is plenty of time to repair an article that looks like advertising or something non-notable. If it <i>is</i> either of those, you won't be able to clean it up and it <i>will</i> be deleted. If it isn't, you will easily reform the article and all will be well. But arguing - and especially arguing-by-exception - just won't work. ➨ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">❝</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">REDVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">❞</a> 23:51, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Per Google, M. Schuyler Towne is a writer and comic book artist from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable enough for Wikipedia. Vanity. Not a speedy, however, as it does attempt to assert the importance or significance of its subject.

<li><b>Delete</b> biographical article that does not substantiate the notability of its subject. This is a borderline CSD A7; in my view it qualifies.

<p>A D Monroe III states that there is "No verifiable claim to notability" in reference to my artical. What constitutes notability? Is my popularity strictly determined by how often my name appears on a google search?

<dd>Welcome to Wikipedia, Mike Etoll. Have you read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia's policy on Verifiability</a>? Your notability is determined by neither me nor you; by definition, it's determined by the public at large. If you can provide links or references to public acknowledgements of your accomplishments, then your notability is verifiable, and I'll change my vote. Without those references, it's unverifiable. It's that simple. (Note that acknowledgements made by you or on your behalf don't count as "public at large".) --<a href="../../../a/_/d/User%7EA_D_Monroe_III_2a7e.html" title="User:A D Monroe III">A D Monroe III</a> 21:49, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Hey AD,</b> As far as I am concerned, we are both part of the "public at large". Is this statement untrue? Mike Etoll 14:55, 8 November 2005 (UTC) I can provide verification of my accomplishments for you, or else you can do a search on my name. For example,I created illustrations for the book <i>Six Galleons for the King of Spain: Imperial Defense in the Early Seventeenth Century</i> By Carla Rahn Phillips 1987, wrote an icon in '94 for an Orthodox church to work off my community service hours for breaking the law (I am now reformed). Things like this are hard to prove through internet searches, and may also seem insignificant but not only are they true, they are also uncommon accomplishments. The public at large will determine if things like this merit fame. All you are asking for is verification of my accomplishments, and this evidence exists even if it is not fully recorded on the internet. Mike Etoll 14:55, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mysekurity's search omited several articles outside of Modojo linking to itself such as the Business Week and Sports Line articles. On a related note, doesn't the fact that highly reputable publications such as the LA Times and Business Week cite Modojo make it all the more noteworthy? It also makes Modojo the subject of national media attention outside of the Internet, which means the website meets 2 of the 3 requirements to be a notable website (according to Wikipedia's policy, it only needs to meet 1). <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrost_cae9.html" title="User:Jtrost">Jtrost</a> 06:02, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm not sure what, exactly, my search was, as looking through my Search History on Google brought up no real indicator (the search looks to be indeed 76100). I'm not sure why the descrepancy happened, but in any event I'm sorry. I'm not an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/inclusionist" class="extiw" title="m:inclusionist">inclusionist</a>, and personally think that Wikipedia doesn't really need articles on sites such as these, but I think I'm willing to let it slide. I'm going to be neutral on this, because I'm not really sure of the merits of having an article on this site (why not have a history page on the forum?), except to drive traffic. What normal encyclopedic article, may I ask, would link to this site? What are the merits for keeping it on Wikipedia as opposed to having this information on the site? -[[<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity">User:Mys</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity">kurity</a>|<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysekurity_22b6.html" title="User talk:Mysekurity">Mysekurity</a>]] <sup>[[<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mysekurity_f119.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mysekurity">additions</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mysekurity_b472.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mysekurity">e-mail</a>]]</sup> <sub>20:16, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</sub></li>

<dd>First, I would like to establish some credibility for this website. It isn't made by a bunch of people sitting at home on their computers (not to say that's a bad thing, several websites with entries here are made in that sort of environment). Modojo is a real business that takes in revenue. Look at the business's address: 268 Bush Street in San Francisco. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;&amp;q=%22268+Bush+Street%22+San+Francisco%2C+CA+94104&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;&amp;q=%22268+Bush+Street%22+San+Francisco%2C+CA+94104&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a> can show you that hundreds of reputable businesses are located here, including the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Game_Developers_Association_3adb.html" title="International Game Developers Association">IGDA San Francisco Chapter</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now to answer the bigger question of why Modojo deserve its own entry on Wikipedia. It's already been established many times on this page and on the talk page that there are other, less notable websites with entries here, so I won't go into that again. The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states three requirements for websites. Modojo meets all of those except for the Alexa ranking, which is understandable seeing how it's a newer website. However, Cloudchaser Media, the company that the community derives from, was in the top 10,000 during 2001. Even if you omit that fact, this website is still notable according to Wikipedia's standards.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, you bring up a good point about if this still merits a Wikipedia article. I can see how people who are unfamiliar with the website can easily dismiss its entry on Wikipedia because it does look like blatant advertising. Please look at the current article again. The vast majority of the text deals with the history of the community, not the main website (the idea of creating an entry here was to tell the story about the history of the community, not a seven month old website). At its peak, the community had over 11,000 members, and during highly publicized events such as E3 and the Game Developers Conference, it's common for there to be HUNDREDS of active users on the website at the same time. The current record is 544 members who were on the forum simultaneously on 02-07-2005, which was around the time of a big announcement that is escaping my memory at the moment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This community has a long and interesting history, and it's a story that many people here (even if you omit the meatpuppets) think should be told. Why should this be on Wikipedia instead of a page on the website? I think it's for the same reason that every other of the 800,000 articles on Wikipedia should be here. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia of everything notable. Over the years this community and all the websites it has been associated with has had several million viewers. It's part of the Internet's history. <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrost_cae9.html" title="User:Jtrost">Jtrost</a> 22:08, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. In addition to the citations in news media mentioned by Jtrost, Modojo's official industry contacts make them seem noteworthy. Also, the history is interesting enough on it's own - even to someone like me who had never heard of the site before today. 63.224.187.10 04:39, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<u>AFD result.</u>
<p>There is a <b>clear consensus</b> that this article should be <b>merged</b> into at least one other. Debates as to the most useful disposition of cricket match articles are not new; to outsiders (to cricket) they can be extremely confusing. I'm one of these folks, so it took me a while to go through the articles and categories to familiarise myself with the issues. Briefly:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Transvaal_v_Natal_B_1-4_January_1972_abd2.html" title="Northern Transvaal v Natal B 1-4 January 1972">The article that is the subject of this AFD</a> pertains to a single cricket match that took place during the 1971-72 South Africa cricket season. The article is four sentences long and is a short summary of the game. It is unlikely that there is much more that can be sensibly added to the page.</li>
<li>There are dozens of SA cricket seasons, see <a href="../../../s/o/u/Template%7ESouth_African_cricket_seasons_5afa.html" title="Template:South African cricket seasons">Template:South_African_cricket_seasons</a>.</li>
<li>In the 1971-72 SA season, some 32 <u>matches</u> were played. See Category:1971/2_South_African_cricket_season_matches. <i>Each</i> of these matches has been given an <i>individual page</i>, usually only a couple of sentences long.</li>
<li>Aside from individual pages for the <i>matches</i>, there are also individual pages for <i>each <u>team'</u>s</i> performance in that season. For example, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvaal_B_in_1971_2_4dd4.html" title="Transvaal B in 1971/2">Transvaal B in 1971/2</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Transvaal_in_1971_2_520a.html" title="Northern Transvaal in 1971/2">Northern Transvaal in 1971/2</a>, <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesia_in_1971_2_e29c.html" title="Rhodesia in 1971/2">Rhodesia in 1971/2</a>.</li>
<li>Aside from individual pages on single matches, there are also articles on the various <i>tournaments</i> (I hope that's the right word) within that season. In the 1971-72 season, the tournaments were <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currie_Cup_Section_A_in_1971_2_3d59.html" title="Currie Cup Section A in 1971/2">Currie Cup Section A in 1971/2</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currie_Cup_Section_B_in_1971_2_615a.html" title="Currie Cup Section B in 1971/2">Currie Cup Section B in 1971/2</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillette_Cup_in_1971_2_37aa.html" title="Gillette Cup in 1971/2">Gillette Cup in 1971/2</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Castle_Cup_first-class_matches_in_South_Africa_in_1971_2_9dba.html" title="Non-Castle Cup first-class matches in South Africa in 1971/2">Non-Castle Cup first-class matches in South Africa in 1971/2</a>.</li>
<li>The material in the articles on the <i>tournaments</i> (what I mentioned in #5), and the material in articles on <i>teams</i> (what I mentioned in #4), are all collections of substs of the <i>individual match</i> articles (what I mentioned in #3).</li>
</ol>
I agree with <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a>, <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanbrown_eb80.html" title="User:Ianbrown">Ian</a>, <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a>, and (I think) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> that these individual match (not just the one here discussed on the AFD) shouldn't be maintained. The information is all in the larger articles, each of which consist of a series of substs of the match articles. The larger articles also provide the opportunity for context that the tiny articles don't (I'm sure a bit more could be said about the 1972 Northern Transvaal team, for example, than merely a list of the matches they played). I would also like to point out that the <i>team</i> articles (ie. what I mentioned in #4), are poorly titled. <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodesia_in_1971_2_e29c.html" title="Rhodesia in 1971/2">Rhodesia in 1971/2</a> may be an acceptable title for a cricket encyclopedia, but on a general encyclopedia like WP it is misleading. The disposition of articles not the subject of this AFD cannot be decided here, but there does appear to be a strong consensus, both within and without the WP cricket community, that the individual match articles be merged (and redirected if not deleted). I lend my voice in support of this idea. Finally, I'm a little mystified as to why the match articles were written in the first place, and agree with <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> that they shouldn't be in future. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>03:12, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</i> <a name="Northern_Transvaal_v_Natal_B_1-4_January_1972" id="Northern_Transvaal_v_Natal_B_1-4_January_1972"></a>

<li><b>Query</b> - I thought the whole point of the 2005 English county match reports was that at the end of the season, they would all be merged together into a week-by-week analysis or a team-by-team analysis, and that the original match reports would then be deleted. Is my understanding wrong? If so, would very much appreciate knowing what was intended originally and what happened in the end, now that the season has been over for a month or more. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripatetic_b918.html" title="User:Peripatetic">Peripatetic</a> 00:58, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your understanding is not wrong.

<li>There was no consensus in any of these discussions. So pretending that a precedent has been established is disingenuous.</li>
<li>It was clearly stated by several contributors that the articles would be deleted promptly at the end of the season. I suspect that the vote would have been more negative without this promise. However, this has not happened, and I'm not even sure whether this is planned for these South African articles. I'm beginning to suspect that the authors quite like having the individual articles.</li>
<li>The fact that <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECricket_b112.html" title="WP:Cricket">WikiProject Cricket</a> is continuing to do something so controversial based only on the inability to reach consensus either for or against is itself worrying to me. We're not being good neighbours, and we're giving our project a bad name. Besides, we could do without wasting time having this argument every few weeks. We should be voluntarily finding a better way to do this.</li>

<dd>I don't see how your faith could be "shattered" here. You have what may be a very good website for all I know. But you don't have a website that deserves to go into an encyclopedia. Would you expect Britannica to list you? Are you writing to them daily? Do you think that, in 100 years time, your website will be important enough to be in an encyclopedia? Honestly? Really, nice try, but no banana. And readers don't decide here: <i>users</i> do. All the people who voted are users rather than just readers. And as people who <i>use</i> the Wikipedia, in whatever way, we've come to a consensus that this article doesn't fit here. Have you tried sending it to <a href="http://dmoz.org" class="external text" title="http://dmoz.org" rel="nofollow">The Open Directory Project</a> for listing in a web directory in the right category instead?

<p>Like I said, you win. I just thought Wikipedia was a little more democratic than most mainstream commercial sites. I don't understand the difference between a user and reader; I "Read" encylopedias, and "Use" them at the same time to research information. I don't see how the addition of my entry in any way hurts Wikipedia...the only people who are going to find it are people researching "Porn" or "Adult Sites" and my entry is a legitimate resource for those people as an example of a sex blog, a TGP, and a link list. Anyway, you all win, I've given my opinion. <b>And no, I wouldn't expect Britanicca to list me...but by that criteria, the vast majority of entries in Wikipedia should be deleted.</b></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Two things: First, Wikipedia <i>is</i> more democratic than most sites, hence the review process in operation here. You can't get much more democratic than an open vote with direct participation by the user base. It may not be going the way that you'd like, but it's definitely democratic. Second, the guideline most people use for notability is whether the article in question is considered notable within the overall heirarchy of such things. Your article isn't garnering delete votes because it's a sex blog, it's garnering delete votes because (in the opinion of most people here) it's not notable within the overall community of adult websites. It doesn't have an exceptionally large user base, it hasn't received notable amounts of coverage in the mainstream media, and it hasn't effected a fundamental change on the industry (as a site like <a href="../../../j/e/n/JenniCam_f92d.html" title="JenniCam">JenniCam</a> did, for example). Though it looks like it won't be kept, I thank you for your contribution as it appears to have been entered with good intentions, and I wish you luck with the site. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 16:42, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article will start/inspire more entries by others on the subjects of Non-profits management, Non-profits fund raising, Non-profits board issues, Non-profits marketing, Non-profits PR, Non-profits low cost Web usage, etc. This group helps many low-budget and low-profile non-profit/volunteer groups survive and grow. This group offers workshops and will share knowledge with other similar groups in the country. Many such groups and organizations are not tech-savvy to be know on the Web. This entry in the Wikipedia may help other such groups to learn and grow. This group has provided free help to other volunteer/non-profits for 9 years and made significant impact to the society. It does not make sense that when many users come to Wikipedia and can't find "Princeton Community Works."

<li><b>Keep</b>. Many adult sites may have a huge number of hits on Google, but it doesn't mean that they should have a Wikipedia article. An entity doing significant work cannot be judged by just Google hits. This group is helping hundreds of small/low-budget volunteer groups, and could be the only training they receive in the entire year. These small(some are large) groups touch the lives of at least a hundred thousand needy people, or solve society and environment issues. If you are part of this kind of low-budget group, you understand that they cannot spend money on building Web presence -- although they should learn to do it at almost no cost. However, if they go to a library and use the Wikipedia, can they find Princeton Community Works? Any local school can have a Wikipedia entry if it is done right, any local community foundation should not be denied an entry, either. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangWeiHsing_60b8.html" title="User:WangWeiHsing">WangWeiHsing</a> 14:03, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please vote only once. Duplicate votes are not counted and just make it more difficult for the administrator to tally everything correctly.

Take a look at this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_reform" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_reform" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_reform</a>, and specially this one, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_reform/Brainstorming#Remove_notable_requirement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_reform/Brainstorming#Remove_notable_requirement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_reform/Brainstorming#Remove_notable_requirement</a></p>
<p>Please don't just go around and cast your vote on this same reason, read more and think more. Why get in the habit of deleting others' entries with 'not worthy/not notable?' If you don't have a 'real' reason, your vote looks like you are showing your anger at what others may have done to you.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't care a jot about notability, but one half of this is unverified (if it is a significant workshop, where is the press about it? external sources? verification?), the other half is just a list of attendees at a yearly meeting (Wikipedia is not a directory). A workshop that - as far as I can tell - rents a hall in Princeton University's Frist Center once a year really needs something more.

<dd>Please excuse us if we seem brief in our criticisms, because as you can see there is a large volume of articles that get nominated for deletion every day! Basically, articles need to be encyclopedic, both in subject and in content, and some people think that your subject is non-encyclopedic in that you haven't demonstrated why it is relevant to anyone outside of the local community. Ways to demonstrate this would be to show that it is unique, special, or unusual, or that it has received considerable press in several reliable, fact-checked publications like books, large newspapers, or the like. Unfortunately, many people try to use Wikipedia to promote or advertise things, and there is often a strong reaction to the appearance of this, which is what I think you may be dealing with here. The best examples of Wikipedia articles are the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a>, and all of them contain multiple sources (as I said, books, significant news reports, and so forth) to back up the facts that they provide. More specifically, articles like <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellcome_Trust_4ffb.html" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Helsinki_Human_Rights_Group_8b1b.html" title="British Helsinki Human Rights Group">British Helsinki Human Rights Group</a> provide a good model of the kind of verification that articles need. If you have offline materials (note that they still have to fulfil the criteria of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>) you don't need to scan them, just reference them as detailed in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>. I will warn you, though, that the bar is set pretty high, and there will have to be some extraordinary proof that this is more than just an annual conference attended by some community groups (there are literally tens of thousands of such meetings, few of which would be encyclopedic). Good luck! <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font><font color="black">iggurat</font></a> 20:51, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> not that I think it will do any good. I <i>surely</i> do not see the point in saying something I don't believe as mooted by howcheng above. Keep nominating schools, or wrestlers, or battle ships if you feel it's the correct thing to do. Shouting down dissenting voices is anti-wiki. <b>I</b> do not nominate schools, and I don't go out of my way to find the nominations, but when they show up on my watch list I contribute. It doesn't take long, I am usually polite (well, recently at least), and if people want to keep doing this I'll keep doing it. I think that calls to "stop nominating" while at the same time blocking all attempts to reach some <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>-like accord are <b>foul</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is the latest in a string of <b>bad-faith</b> nominations and actions by this editor. This type of behavior is disruptive in the extreme and completely ignores WP policy and guidelines. Creating a stub article which has the sole content of "<b>Saint Andrew's School</b>, is a private co-educational <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_1bad.html" title="Episcopal Church">Episcopal Church</a> day school in <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saratoga%2C_California_26e8.html" title="Saratoga, California">Saratoga, California</a>" then waiting for another editor to improve it in order to nominate for AfD is outrageous, especially given this editor's previously stated positions on the notability of schools and the value of one-line school stubs. This is preceeded by the creation of hoax schools, preschools, grocery stores, etc. all for the purposes of making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> and being generally disruptive and absuing the AfD process. The claim that the "article was created before I realized there were notability issues that should be taken into account for an article" in August of 2005 is patently false and deceptive, since this editor's views on schools are and have been well publicized long before the creation of this article. I think it is high time for an RfC and conceivably further action to prevent this editor from so callously abusing the AfD process.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:30, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Find me proof I'd developed a concrete opinion on or before August 10th. Also if you'd bothered to read the posts above you'd realize I didn't nominate this because it had been improved but because it never should have been made in the first place.

<dd>The article states that Seamus O'Shaunessy is the stage name of Stephen Farrelly.

<li>Trollderella, from your vote it seems that you haven't looked at the website and just voted keep for it. The website is about some game that User:EatItRaw plays down the pub with his mates, not about the well-attested shove ha'penny played on a board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a real game played on a weekly basis, we have no association to shove ha'penny, our money tour is worth far more than shove ha'penny's world championship purse, Why is coinorama allowed if we are not. I co own the www.shovepenny.co.uk website and we are a genuine game with a regular circuit of players. By all means edit sections you do not agree with but the game is real and played by a large number of players.</p>

<li>Notability doesn't enter into it. The article cites no sources and research turns up no evidence outside of the web-site purporting to be that of the association that the association actually exists. The same is true for the purported game. Indeed, given that the web site gives the name of its owner as "Eat It Raw" and that this article was written by EatItRaw (<a href="../../../e/a/t/User_talk%7EEatItRaw_9c91.html" title="User talk:EatItRaw">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EatItRaw_58ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/EatItRaw">contribs</a>) this seems to be a clear case of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, with one person creating a web site about a new game that they have invented and then creating a Wikipedia article as well.

<p>If you feel that this original game does not warrant entry then fine delete it, do not redirect to shove ha'penny as it had nothing to do with shove ha'penny, they are about as similar as snooker and pool.--EatItRaw 08:44, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As an outsider looking at the article I am sure that the games of Shovepenny and that other game involving coins are not related not do they even claim to be the same game. The game of shovepenny has been played in many locations and counties over the last few years. Many a landlord has commented that they would love to host a premium Shovepenny tour event as it brings life to the Public House and additional money to the Landlord.</li>
<li>I have found other websites that link to the Shovepenny website (<a href="http://www.filmgeek.me.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.filmgeek.me.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.filmgeek.me.uk</a>). To delete this entry from Wikipedia would be an outrage. Surely to delete it would be to claim that it is not exist... The game does and will continue to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are to delete the article then delete any reference between Shovepenny and that other game involving a coin and a board. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bubbashovaa (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubbashovaa_b785.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubbashovaa">contribs</a>) 11:04, 4 November 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Come on now, I mean for real! What the hell are you all talking about a Stoner Burrito? You know up here in the northern part of the U.S. certain individuals will act out violently upon hearing such terminology. I mean after all the 1960s was the era of Civil Rights Activism. I know it was mainly just for women and blacks. But what about the hispanic/Latino culture?</p>
<p>Go ahead and walk into any of America's numerous ghettos or certains other parts of the inner city and call the first person you see that you can classify as a hispanic/Latino a "Stoner burrito" and see what happens!!! I bet you dollars to doughnuts that you will not like what you see, not to mention the fact that you will be extremely lucky if you don't happen to see the glint of a steel blade being exposed or tearing at your skin for such a rude racist comment.</p>
<p>This says a lot comming from a white guy who used to be a racist and knows all different sorts of phrases from back in the day, if you know what I mean.</p>

The front page is a news page, and in the forum might be lots of chat, but from regular users that keep it running. The point where the site becomes great value, is for the inexperienced web/computer user that is requesting help. I had seem lots of users that looked lost, but ended feeling welcome in the site, and resolved their computer related problems. It also has a lot of sections that keep information accessible for users. If the original article was biased, I think it can be corrected, and it should not be very difficult to do.</small>

<li>You cite bad logic. It was you who called the site a "advertisement" from the beginning.

Then the following day you try to delete the page.

<ul>
<li>I did indeed call the article an advertisement from early on. You or own of your puppets removed the tag immediately I put it on. Your selective quoting of me is interesting: to selectively quote myself from your quote, <i>I'm pleased that, following the placement of the tag, your next edits cleaned up the article somewhat</i> - note the last word.I then went away and allowed time for the article to be improved <i>more than</i> somewhat. This didn't happen: it was obviously just advertising and obviously had no encyclopedial merit or notability, as stated in the guidelines - which are prominently linked from all over the Wikipedia and where very clearly linked from the advertising tag you (or puppets of you) deleted. I'm sorry you don't agree with the listing of your article here, but the idea of listing here is to gain a consensus of Wikipedia community members. That consensus may have proved me wrong - a decision I would accept without question. But I fear that now we will never know.

I have used wikipedia countless times, but as many users I come here to learn a topic, so I am in no condition to edit an article, since I am learning the topic. In this case I do know about it. I am a member of the forum, but I don't think my vote should be discarded, because I can discuss about the forum knowing very well about it. If you think that the article should be deleted, take a look around the forum itself. Hardware and Software sections have lots of post requesting help. Tips and tweaks I believe is a noteworthy section where you can find a large list of tips and tweaks.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>Techzonez deserves to have a Wikipedia article. I have been a member of the forum for over a year now and can say without a doubt that it is the best tech support forum on the net. Better than the likes of MSFN and Neowin- because the people there are polite and ensure that questions are answered no matter what. The sheer number of questions that have been answered by the members of the community makes Techzonez one of the largest searchable databases of tech support questions on the internet.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Dalbury, do you know what a sock puppet is? I'm sure you've spent god a lot of time here at Wikipedia and yet you keep rambling on without making much sense. Let me clarify. A sock puppet is <b>"A sock puppet is an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name. The Wikipedian who uses a sock puppet may be called a sock puppeteer."</b> All the voters against the deletion of this article are genuine members of the Wikipedia community, albeit first time users/first time editors. Secondly, why must we take down this article and why can neowin and slashdot stay up?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Did you read all of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sock puppet policy</a> page? The last section, "Meat puppets", says:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A related issue occurs when non-Wikipedians create new accounts specifically to influence a particular vote or discussion. This is especially common in deletion discussions. These newly created accounts (or anonymous edits) may be friends of a Wikipedian, or may be related in some way to the subject of an article under discussion.<br />
These accounts are not actually sockpuppets, but they are difficult to distinguish from real sockpuppets and are treated similarly. Neither a sockpuppet nor a brand-new, single-purpose account holder is a member of the Wikipedia community. The reason behind this is, for instance, that an article about an online community should not be kept merely because all members of that community show up to vote for it. The Arbitration Committee has ruled that, for the purpose of dispute resolution, when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sockpuppets or several users with similar editing habits they may be treated as one user with sockpuppets.</p>

<dd>As for your second question, Slashdot is certainly much better known than Techzonez.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, please edit the article so it is no longer an advertisement. Also, please prove notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> regarding your comment on the talk page,and i quote "Your quest for a Google rank is understandable, but doing it here is downright pathetic.?" we hardly need to improve our google ranking,its fine as it is thank you. You've clearly got some other underlying reason for opposing our wiki,rather than just the content. Anyway,delete away if it gives you a buzz. We innocently set up the wiki as a form of information,unfortunately you are too far up your own arse to see that. Oh and btw,you mentioned good manners in your previous reply,obviously no one told you its considered rude to use all capital letters in your username.

<p>I think perhaps we should give "high" art ventures, especially those in classical music, a little more leeway regarding their notability. Classical music is a relatively rarefied field. You can't expect the same number of google hits for a concert at the Cleveland Orchestra as a Prince show. I don't really need Wikipedia to tell me about Elton John, but I had never even heard of Alan Fleming-Baird until I read this article.

<p><b>Delete</b>. There has <i><b>never</b></i> been another Tropical Storm Alpha. It is completely sufficient and correct to just make a link to other pages which are only somewhat similar (in this case, 1972's <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtropical_Storm_Alpha_bcb0.html" title="Subtropical Storm Alpha">Subtropical Storm Alpha</a> and and 1973's <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtropical_Storm_Alfa_664a.html" title="Subtropical Storm Alfa">Subtropical Storm Alfa</a>, both named for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_phonetic_alphabet_9726.html" title="NATO phonetic alphabet">NATO phonetic alphabet</a> and <i>not</i> the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_alphabet.html" title="Greek alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>). &#160;–<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiojon_da08.html" title="User:Radiojon">radiojon</a> 18:30, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The style thus far has been, when there is one storm with a name, it gets the article (or a redirect to the appropriate season). When there are two storms with a name, and one has an article, there is a disambig link at the top of the article. When there are two or more storms with a name, and at least two don't have articles of their own, we use a disambiguation page; we don't crowd the top of the article with disambiguation links. Also, it has more information than most hurricane dab pages we have here. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 18:53, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As I said on the talk page (which you have ignored), the disambiguation is absolutely necessary. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">Jdorje</a> 19:01, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b>, seems perfectly reasonable. If it's a likely mistake to make, it should be disambiguated. We're supposed to help people find information, are we not? <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.205.45.148.html" title="User:132.205.45.148">132.205.45.148</a> 20:43, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I should say that I've worked on this page. I'd like to point out that it is the style to have disambiguation pages for nameable tropical cyclones. These were all named. Also, using your (radiojon) arguments, the <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Nicole_4de0.html" title="Hurricane Nicole">Hurricane Nicole</a> page should also be deleted because, after all, there has only been one <i>Hurricane</i> Nicole. Also using your arguments, we should split up many of the hurricane disambiguation pages, such as <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Madeline_78f2.html" title="Hurricane Madeline">Hurricane Madeline</a>, because it was used on different lists, first on the female-only four year lists, and then on the modern, mixed-gender six year lists. Finally, I'd also like to point out that it is current practice to have spelling tweaks of a name all in one page, as the <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Dalila_7d30.html" title="Hurricane Dalila">Hurricane Dalilia/Dalila</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Kirsten_dfd7.html" title="Hurricane Kirsten">Hurricane Kirsten/Kristen</a> disambiguation pages do. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichelle_T_0f20.html" title="User:Michelle T">Miss Michelle</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichelle_T_bee5.html" title="User talk:Michelle T">Talk to Michelle</a> 23:11, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Whether I agree with the “notability” requirement or not, I must say that “A Google search… gets less than 200 hits” is not a valid test for notability.
