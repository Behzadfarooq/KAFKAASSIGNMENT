<p>Having been part of the LDS Wikiproject for a year now, I have to say that this is one of the more unusual Mormonism-related articles that I've seen. As it stands, "Animals in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" seems like a non-sensical topic... there is very little in terms of doctrine relating to animals specifically, and none that would really be considered <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. If encyclopedic content were to appear concerning this subject, it would be better inserted as a part of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_ff27.html" title="Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, as it's doubtful that it would merit its own article. In any case, this one needs to go. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 07:27, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It may seem to you to be a non-sensical topic, but as the article's references state, it's a topic that is included in the <i>Encyclopaedia of Mormonism</i>. Wikipedia should not be any less of an encyclopaedia than that encyclopaedia. The article requires citations for much of its content, but what citations there are indicate that this is, indeed, a subject that has been covered in multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of their subjects, and thus notable. This is a stub article that cites sources and that has clear scope for expansion. Deletion is not the way to fix the parts of the article that don't yet have sources. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the fact that it's a topic that's been covered in a Mormonism-specific encyclopedia doesn't strike me as the most persuasive of arguments, since an encyclopedia specific to <i>any</i> topic will naturally be able to devote more space to more esoteric topics than a general-interest one will. An encyclopedia of competitive sport, for example, would more than likely deem football clubs notable which would fail our guidelines, while an encyclopedia on the Pacific islands would be able to devote considerable space to members of local government in Samoa who would probably get short shrift here as well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 09:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a very persuasive argument against the assertion that the topic is "non-sensical". Please read what I actually wrote. The argument about <i>notability</i> is based upon the multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of their subjects, both cited in the article and locatable elsewhere. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:53, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> While I still haven't made up my mind about the need for a seperate article or inclusion in a list of unique theology, I do think that coverage in another encyclopedia is relevant. "What Wikipedia is not" clearly says one advantage of wikipedia is that it need not be limited by printing/arbitrary limits on which topics to cover. Wikipedia is not meant to be only a general purpose encyclopedia but also include everything that would be in specialized encylopedias as well. some quotes below (emphasis added) --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 16:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> discussion of undue weight is about minority and majority points of view on the same topic, not about the weight that should be given to <i>different</i> topics. The relevant style guide on whether there should be breakout articles on sub-topics is <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>. If you actually read what is cited by this article, you'll see that there's a <i>lot</i> that can be said on this subject, clearly enough for the topic to be broken out on its own. As I said above, <i>the article is a stub</i> with clear scope for expansion. Please actually read the articles being discussed and their sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:53, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did read the article. I'm not persuaded that "scope of expansion" is a good reason to keep a stub around if there's a logical place to merge it until a separate article is needed. Better to split subtopics out of the parent article as they grow too large, than to spew stubs all over the place in hope of expansion. Stubs are to hold a place for an article when there's noplace else to put the info.
<p>Also, undue weight in my view applies to the enclopedia as a whole, not just to individual articles. That's the reason <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> is bad. It's fine to have an article about some movie of medium importance. It's also ok (or anyway it's a fait accompli) to have a bunch of separate articles about characters in an ultra-notable movie like Star Wars. It's undue weight to have dozens of separate articles about the different characters in the minor movie, especially stub articles where nobody has bothered to research whatever they thought the article was supposed to be about. This is more of the same. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Stubs are to hold a place for an article when there's noplace else to put the info.</i> — which is the situation here. <i>Also, undue weight in my view applies to the enclopedia as a whole</i> — You are still mis-applying a principle related to the presentation of multiple points of view to something completely unrelated. <i>I did read the article.</i> — I also encouraged you to read the sources. That you don't see that there's scope for expansion indicates that you haven't seen how much more is written on this topic in the sources than is at present in the article. For the third time: This is a stub article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:39, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Stubs are to hold a place for an article when there's noplace else to put the info</i>. In this instance the info can go in one of the more general Mormonism articles. <i>Scope for expansion</i> I never said there's no scope for expansion; I agree that there is scope for expansion. I explained why I think the existence of scope for expansion is not a good reason to keep a stub. It's like saying we should keep an article about some some unknown musician or author because she "might become famous". Let her become famous first, <i>then</i> we can add an article. Expand the info about &lt;whatever&gt; in some other article first, <i>then</i> split it off to a separate article once the parent article starts becoming unbalanced or overlarge. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 21:15, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it is not like that. That is another misapplication of a principle to something that is unrelated. Authors who "might become famous" have nothing written about them now. This article, on the other hand, has scope for expansion <i>from material that currently exists</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>By the way, I <i>did</i> read what's cited, and it's very, very little to work with. As BigHaz mentioned, being mentioned in an interest-specific encyclopedic doesn't do anything to establish that it's of sufficient importance to merit an article here. From personal experience, after five years in the LDS Church, I don't ever recall hearing or reading any discourses on animals in Mormon theology. Thorough citations on an unsignificant topic don't make it more important. It was a good intention, and it may find a home on an LDS-specific wiki. If consensus is in favor of deletion or a redirect, perhaps it could be userfied to UncleG so he can use it elsewhere. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 16:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are, in effect, applying the "I've never heard of it." criterion to this article. That is an exceedingly poor criterion to apply to decide whether an article should be deleted, and one that is generally rejected. If you want a notability criterion, consider the primary one from <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, et al.: A subject should be the subject of multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the subject. This topic clearly is. <i>It even cites a few of those published works.</i> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:39, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One of many criteria applied, and while "who's heard what" isn't always a good determinant of a subject's importance, it isn't always bad either. In any case, you miss my point — the intention was to illustrate how rarely the topic is brought up. If you can find any discourse, spoken or written, by a General Authority of the LDS Church (for outsiders, that is more or less what could be considered "official") focusing solely on animals in the same manner in which this article treats them, please, post it up. Problem is, I doubt it exists. This is patched together from a scattering of brief statements drawn from different sources, and even then, the article is filled with supposition. Whittle it down, and you're left with material that may be appropriate in a larger doctrinal article, but not meriting its own. I think you'd be hard pressed to find any authoritative LDS Church statement mentioning the significance of its animal theology. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 04:13, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> This article needs work, to be sure. But I think the information is interesting enough, particularly because it differs from the views of some other forms of Christianity that hold that animals have no souls at all. This difference should be noted somewhere, be it in this article, in another article on Mormonism (for example, it says that they believe that animals have immortal spirits so the article on whichever afterlife kingdom they're believed to go to, Celestial, Terrestrial, or Telestial, <i>might</i> be the right place), or in an article on the views of animals in general as Smerdis suggested. One benefit of keeping this article is that in merging, it would be difficult to decide where to merge to and the info might be broken up into many pieces (some in the articles on Mormon beliefs in before life, some in after life, some elsewhere, etc.) instead of being in one comprehensive article. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 20:21, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>merge</b>. As a former member of the church for a good 20 years I can say that this topic is one that very rarely is ever mentioned in the church itself and there really isn't any way to expand upon this article, and is not important enough to merit its own entry.

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> This is not a trivial article or obscure point on LDS theology. The role the animal kingdom plays in relation to humanity (humans are animals, by the way) is an important theological question with perhaps more questions than answers, but a valid question nonetheless. LDS are but one Christian church whose leaders have evidently commented on the significance of animal life, but animals are important to many more than just LDS, including non-Christian perspectives. These should be included also. When article expansion is initiated, the discussion merits careful navigation to preserve NPOV simply because I suspect there are a multitude of voices on the issue. The broader Christian view needs to be navigated carefully (including LDS), but I believe it can be done. Interestingly enough, CS Lewis devotes an entire essay in The Problem of Pain (ISBN: 0060652969) titled "Animal Pain" that parses the moral and physical intracacies of animal life, especially in their relation to humanity. Clearly, animals are important in his fiction as well and take on roles of sacrifice, redemption, deceit, suffering, valor (Reepicheep), and transcendance (Lewis has remarked in Mere Christianity something to the effect..."Isn't that how the higher thing always raises the lower?...how our pets seem human, and in the end that's what they almost become," to paraphrase from memory. Thus, an article dealing with just the LDS view is, I think, a little too narrow in the broader scope of the issue, albeit very, very interesting...it merely needs expansion, context, and additional references, not deletion! I don't think we should abandon valid information, regardless if it appears to be an unfrequently traveled religious issue. There are thousands of current Wiki articles that any random schmuck could point a finger at and say "too trivial" or "no import whatsoever." Look, frankly I don't perceive this information to be in error or obscure at all. It's an important moral question. Yes, the recent edits are far from transcendant, so clearly it needs to be expanded or merged (however, given the contentious climate at the main <a href="../../../l/d/s/LDS_Church_bdf6.html" title="LDS Church">LDS Church</a> article, I doubt that a proposed merge would be adopted easily). In the meantime, let's get this thing off the delete list and get it in better shape. Deleting this would be a shame.--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 22:54, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The "Typical Mormon doctrines" section of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> is a pretty obvious place for this. Even if the article is kept, it should be summarized and linked there. I still suggest merging. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 01:00, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep for now</b> — It is clearly a stub, but it is a topic that is fairly unique among other Christian religions. If people seem to be unable to expand it enough to make a decent-sized article, then we can merge it with some other article (although I can't think of a candidate at the moment). <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 13:26, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
