<p>This should probably be reintegrated into the article, but not in a big paragraph like that (and it really needs to be far more clear which nation gave him each title). Also, it's not actually his "full title" by any means - it's just a list of all his titles and honours, which would never have been put together in that way. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 18:39, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Title seems wrong anyway. As the younger son of a Peer (not holding that title) he was entitled to "the Hon." and as a Knight "Sir".

<p>I have removed the claim he was called "the peer" when he was made a duke as it is wrong - it was used from his viscountcy until his Dukedom. Thereafter in some sources he seems to have been called "the Duke". I have added the common nicknames for the Spanish/Portuguese troops he commanded. I have one source claim he was called the "Great Lord" by some of the troops but its hard to tell if this was widespread or only by the soldier (the source quotes) or regiment concerned.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 15:01, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>How was he ever a Whig? - danno That's a good question. That whole sentence is flawed, he was PM of the UK, not Great Britain...when did that get changed? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> 16:23, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am fairly certain he was never a Whig - he was born in 1769, so by the time he reached maturity, we have a clear Pittite/Foxite distinction. And the Wellesleys both seem to have always been Pittites. That is, Tories. Richard, in particular, served in various capacities in Pitt's first government in the 1790s. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 16:32, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recall that Wellington produced some well-known phrases, but I don't have them to hand. Something about being Irish ("being born in a stable doesn't make you a horse", maybe?) and a good one about the English army after their appalling behaviour in Spain ("I don't know what the enemy makes of them, but they put the fear of God into me"). I'll try to find them. --MJW 81.154.201.45 01:33, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good luck. Although searches for quotes like that often leave one disappointed. The one about being Irish, for instance, seems a brilliant candidate for being apocryphal - the kind of quote that someone might come up with, and then back-attribute to a famous Irish protestant who lived in England most of his life. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:41, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thank you, sir. Is it possible for anyone to be installed as a Knight of the Garter whilst outside of England(Foreign monarchs are apparently able to be.)? I hope that I am not wasting your time, but I also wonder why some of those who were seemingly appointed Knights of the Garter were never installed. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnglius_e80b.html" title="User:Anglius">Anglius</a> 23:47, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is possible for the monarch to announce that the Order has been bestowed upon a person while they are abroad, and then the actual investiture taking place after the Knight has arrived home. Some may have opted out of the pomp and ceremony, others may have been announced as recipients of the Order but unfortunately passed away before returning to England. As an example of the latter, I believe there was a case where a man was elected as MP of Portsmouth in 1747. News came later that he had died in the West Indies 87 days before polling. Another man died just prior to news arriving that he had been elected MP for the City of London in 1780. In these modern times, technology allows us to receive near-instant notification of death. Pity our forefathers had no such boon.</dd>

<p>Why did he take the town of Wellington in Somerset for his title? I assume he had some family connection to the place, but I'm not aware of the details. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastie_a178.html" title="User:Bastie">Bastie</a> 00:33, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wellington himself did not actually pick the name; his brother William did. Wellesley received a viscountcy for his victory at Talavera in Spain, but apparently there was no time to consult him as to what his title would be. William Wellesley wrote to Wellington: "After ransacking the Peerage and examining the map, I at last determined upon Viscount Wellington of Talavera and Wellington, and Baron Douro of Welleslie in the county of Somerset -- Wellington is a town not far from Welleslie..."

<p>I think this section needs a little expansion. There are bits that seem to misrepresent the positon. For instance Wellington some thirty years before becoming PM writes to both friends and in his official capacity as aide-de-camp about the wisdom of removing measures that penalise the Irish, a position he repeated and maintained throughout this time. The article as written suggests it was an almost damascene conversion in 1829 which may be true of some of the Tory party but not of wellington.</p>
<p>The other issue that strikes me is the problem of the "Tory" label. While he was conservative in nature he was not always a Tory. He accepted office as Chief secretary to Ireland on the specific understanding that this was non partisan and that he would not be bound to support the governing party, if they resigned, by following suit. Even as a supposedly Tory PM he was interested in the continuance of government more than party politics and his short term in office owed much to the refusal of much of the Tory party to support his policies.</p>
<p>In terms of the Reform Act, it passed in the end in part because Wellington convinced his supporters to stay away and not vote against the measure. He didn't support the reforms but he thought their failure to pass and the consequences was more of a threat to the country and its stability than reform.</p>
<p>In terms how he saw as his role he repeats throughout his life phrases similar this this:</p>
<p>"I am nimmukwallah, as we say in the East; that is, I have eaten of the King's salt, and, therefore, I conceive it to be my duty to serve with unhesitating zeal and cheerfulness, when and wherever the King or his Government may think to employ me." (Letter to a friend 1806, Despatches, II, p616 footnote)</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether:</p>
<p>"He came from an established family of noblemen – his father was the 1st Earl of Mornington, his eldest brother, who would inherit his father's Earldom, would be created Marquess Wellesley, and two of his other brothers would be raised to the peerage as Baron Maryborough and Baron Cowley. "</p>
<p>fits into the introductory part. Maybe mention that he came from an established family of noblemen, but put the detail later on in the article? The introduction should be more of an overview of why he is well-known/what he did. A humble suggestion, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_davison_47a0.html" title="User:Ben davison">Ben davison</a> 13:41, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems wrong to me, as well. He was the son of a 1st earl. That is as far as his family's origins go. Lord Wellesley would receive his higher peerage title due to his successes in India, and Wellington's other brothers got their titles in large part due to the prominence achieved as the relatively talented brothers of even more talented and prominent leaders. At any rate, this should probably be in a "family background" section rather than the intro. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 15:01, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're over stretching your knowledge I think, he was the son of a first Earl but the grandson of a baron (paternally) and of a viscount (maternally).On his paternal side there are a succession of knights (through the colleys, cusacks and then back to the original Wellesleys and Plunketts) over several hundred years.

<p>I have added a new section (accidentally anonymously) recounting Wellington's contributions in warfare. I know in lieu of some of his other accomplishments, it might seem a bit "foppish" or unacademic, but in general Wellington was known best as a military commander, and secondly as a statesman. Therefore, I think an appropriate analysis should be given on his contributions to that industry. Obviously, this will be difficult to do completely NPOV, and though I have read a great deal about military tactics and strategy of that era, some will inevitably come from interpretation of some facts and sources. The sources I will be using will be Richard Holmes' biography, David Chandler's numerous military texts, and Phillip J. Haythorntwaite's military descriptions of the respective militaries. <a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvidius_f6d5.html" title="User:Arvidius">Arvidius</a> 00:32, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, if you're going to go down that line then we'd better explain why the tactics were different. Napoleon could afford battles where he lost 30,000 men as his armies numbered in the 100s of thousands. Wellington struggled to get 30,000 troops and could never afford to take risks. With regard to persuit, it is in good measure a feature of cavalry reserves; Wellington had few enough for use in battle let alone to keep fresh for the persuit.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 10:51, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed, which is why the perspective that he was first and foremost an allied general as opposed to a commanding general is an important distinction. The British army the Wellesley personally commanded varied roughly from 40-80,000 soldiers. In retrospect, this is little larger than a corp d'armee of Napoleon, therefore it inhibited many of Wellington's broad strategic sweeps that he utilized in India. I am by the way going to be analyzing the Indian campaigns as there is a scholarly propensity to focus solely on the European battles, and more specifically Waterloo. I think the Indian campaigns display new regards to warfare of the era, and Wellington summed it up himself when he said his greatest military triumph was Assaye. <a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvidius_f6d5.html" title="User:Arvidius">Arvidius</a> 13:34, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>British army of 80,000 troops? I think you mean allied army. At Waterloo he had 30,000 the remaining being allied/Hanovarian troops. Both in India and early in the peninsula he had fewer than 40,000, even including allied troops under his command.Vimeiro for example, was ~17,000 Anglo-Portuguese. We have to be a bit careful in this area to fairly mention the allied army, even if some of the allied elements were not exactly 'trusted' by Wellington. WRT to India, I think that would be excellant, as you rightly say, it is an area almost forgotten in popular culture and general articles about the Duke.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 16:44, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh good, but I think the current text overplays Wellington as a "defensive general". He certainly understood the value of terrain, and keeping his valuable (but contemptible) men out of harm's way, but the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Assaye_04e6.html" title="Battle of Assaye">Battle of Assaye</a> was an offensive engagement; ditto the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vitoria_e9b8.html" title="Battle of Vitoria">Battle of Vitoria</a>.

<p>The DoW was one of only two people to decline the premiership twice, which seems noteworthy although I can't really see where to add it. As does the offer for him to command the Prussian army and that of the (iirc) the Quadruple Alliance in the 1840s.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 15:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Who is the other to decline twice? It seems to me that both Granville (1859 and 1880) and Hartington (1880 and 1886) did so. And what were the two occasions for Wellington? 1832 is obviously the first, but both 1834 and 1839 seem possible as the other; or perhaps he refused it thrice? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 04:20, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>'34 &amp; '38 are the usually agreed dates in the sources I checked. In '32 he was unable to form a government rather than specifically delining the offer. You might see that as semantic but I think it significant. On the other point Hartington: Granville iirc in '59 at least wanted to but was unable to form a ministry. Both H &amp; W then declined twice from principle not from having tried then failed to form a government.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 10:30, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It does look pretty silly and we don't start articles with Dr X or Professor Y, so we certainly shouldn't for an unearned style.

<dd>It does seem unnecessarily pretentious, especially since it provides no new information. Including "Right Honourable" for commoner privy councillors makes some sense, because it provides the useful information that the individual was or is a privy councillor. But including "Most Noble" for a duke or "Right Honourable" for an earl seems unnecessary, since every duke is "most noble" and every earl is "Most honourable". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 04:13, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>"(But none of the Wellesley siblings had happy domestic lives: eldest brother Richard was a playboy, and then had a bitter divorce; William's wife ran away with a cavalry general to enormous public scandal; clergyman Gerald failed to achieve a bishopric because of his womanizing.)"</p>
<p>I can't quite decide if this is unnecessary article bloat and should be deleted - being nor really about W - or actually needs expanding and correcting. For instance, the 'Cavalry General' was the then Lord Paget later Earl of Uxbridge and Marquess of Anglesey. He eloped with Lady Charlotte called by Paget's relatives a 'nefarious damned hell-hound'! who was the wife of Wellington's brother <b>Henry</b> not William. Paget's actions resulted in him being denied command with W in the peninsular - which obviously had military consequences as he was probably the only decent cavalry commander they had.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 13:12, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

The stable horse remark is popular but has no source, the dukes explation I can't verify from any source even the etymology dictionaries &amp; give alternatives not that given here. I have also amended the titles to change when he uses his surname. He first signed Wellesley 19 May 1798 in a letter to General Harris and uses that form thereafter in his corresponsdence. His styles are prob best not overcomplicated but he was an Irish MP from 1790 (trim) - underage at that - and later for GB.

<p>"He volunteered for service in the Netherlands and India, and achieved spectacular success, rising in a decade to the rank of general, never losing a battle, and winning prize money from grateful rajahs..."</p>
<p>As I recall, Wellington was defeated once, in a night action during a siege in India- unfortunately I can't remember the name of the place or the battle exactly, but I think that the above quote is misleading. Anyone else with a better memory than mine?</p>
<p>As a minor aside, I also changed the wording of "However his political life came to an abrupt end when he sailed to Europe to participate in the Napoleonic Wars" (at the end of the Early Career section) so that it now reads "...an abrupt halt..." instead; the small matter of his being installed as Prime Minister in 1828 ten years after (and the article's reference to his having taken up politics again from 1819) would seem to indicate that it was hardly an 'end' to his political career.</p>

<p>You may be thinking of an incident that occurred at Seringapatam on the night of the 5th April 1798. Wellesley, in command of the 33rd Regiment of Foot, was ordered to make a night assault on a Sultanpettah Tope (a thicket or plantation) without opportunity to reconnoitre. The attack was repulsed with losses including at least one officer killed and eight men captured (who were promptly and gruesomely executed). Wellesly was separated from his regiment, got lost in the darkness, and failed even to effect an orderly withdrawal. He renewed the attack in the morning and carried the position 'in high style and without loss'.</p>
<p>That's most distinctly a defeat, but perhaps not technically the loss of a battle.</p>

<p>The current text says "Wesley was educated at Eton from 1781 to 1785, but a lack of success there, combined with a shortage of family funds, led to a move to Brussels in Belgium to receive further education."</p>
<p>According to Guedalla Wellington went to Brussels with his mother for a year chiefly to retrench expenses, and his only education there was 'twelve months of casual tutoring'. Longford states that he was lodged and tutored in Brighton by the Rev. Henry Michell for some time between Eton and Brussells, but does not mention any kind of education occurring in Brussells: she implies that Wellington's only known activity there was playing the violin. This being teh case, it might behove us to delete references to Wellington being educated at Brussells.</p>
<p>We would do better to make some reference to the 'Royal Academy of Equitation' at Angers, where Wellington spent the year 1786.</p>

<p>If you are indeed an historian within the Academic community then you will understand that simply standing on your status to confirm a stance would not be tolerated. As a wikipedian I can assure you it means even less (reference EssJay) around here. I can assure you that the terms Napoleonic Warfare, era, and wars, all speak to me of the Conflicts of the First French Empire and its allies against the seven coalitions that were set up against it. There have been enough published works to support it certainly. So as to remove this statement and getting into a reversion war makes even less sense. Since Wellington was involved in various forms against the armies of the French Republic and First Empire I would think that the widest form might be the best, in this case Napoleonic Wars might be appropriate. If one were speaking just of the peninsular wars I would be tempted to call it the war of the sixth coalition and if you include the Waterloo campaign then I'd also include the seventh. However the man was involved long before that in the Low Countries, hence my thoughts on this matter. I can not think of a better way to lower one's image in the community that to engage in one of these revert wars. As a friend of mine told me, "arguing in online forums is like winning a special Olympics... you have everyone looking for the short bus to pull up." Remember the Military task force and the Napoleonic task force are watching so can we please all stop looking like idiots? <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 23:44, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>'Conflicts of the First French Empire and its allies against the seven coalitions that were set up against it' That shows a lack of understanding as to the British reasons for being involved in a European theatre of war. My problem is with the misuse of the term, not the term itself.</p>
<p>The term is fine as part of a glossary, but after reading the Oxford History of the British Army and the links to the Napoleonic Wars, it fails to mention those words. It is the classification and designation that is in dispute, not that others outside the British military historians will refer to Napoleonic wars and not be at fault. <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondo06_0d60.html" title="User:Londo06">Londo06</a> 10:31, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>While the Oxford History of the British Army would be a great source I fail to make the connection between that and your statement. Assuming the lack of my understanding is again making the assumption that you have such an understanding and that I do not. I also don't fail to make a connection of what the British view of the various alliances it brought about and often played the role of paymaster to promote. Again this comes down to a simple labeling of the conflicts over a definable period of time. Now arguing about when that time began is an interesting byplay by historians but out of this the scope of this article.</p>
<p>None of this however addresses your engaging in a reversion war and the dim view I and this community takes on such activities. These articles are closely watched and this type of behavior is not well looked upon. I would suggest that you engage the other editors of this page and come to consensus on a stance on this. Further, I would encourage you to not take a stance of superiority in education or knowledge on the subject. I would submit that neither you nor I would have a singular clue as to who is on the other side of these keyboards therefore not a clue as to either capability, education, or knowledge of subject.

<p>I accept that wikipedia is a place to promote knowledge and accept it as not a change in the historiography, but that the term is useful as a redirect, and serves as a useful tool to begin a reading into the likes of Sir John Moore, the Peninsular War and Arthur Wellesley. The term Napoleonic Wars is not incorrect, just not accurate as a term to describe either intention or specific actions. <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondo06_0d60.html" title="User:Londo06">Londo06</a> 19:51, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Currently the article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Napoleon's tactics were typified by massive conscript armies who advanced in tight columns to rout opposing forces, combined with massive artillery bombardments. This tactic originated with <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_the_Great_9da3.html" title="Frederick the Great">Frederick the Great</a>, and was soon adopted by nearly every major participant in the war, with the chief exception of the British, and the Portuguese and Spanish troops they trained. In almost every engagement, the tight-packed French columns (in which only the first two ranks and outer edges could fire) would advance, apparently unheeding of casualties. Against the ill-trained and panic-prone armies of the Austrians and the other allied powers, it was spectacularly successful. Against the disciplined and trained British regulars who stood in line in two ranks (thus permitting every man in line to fire), the column was a dramatic failure. Despite the demonstrated helplessness of the French columns against the British line, the French commanders in Iberia continued to attack in column. (Indeed, column attacks were used even at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>.) Thus, in many instances, a single British <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalion</a> would defeat an entire French <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">division</a>.</i></dd>

<p>Until six months ago I would not have thought the paragraph anything but the historical received wisdom, however there is disagreement over this traditional analysis -- See <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_revisionism.html#French_attacking_formations_in_the_Napoleonic_wars" title="Historical revisionism">Historical revisionism#French attacking formations in the Napoleonic wars</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Column_%28formation%29.html" title="Column (formation)">Column (formation)</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Talk%7EColumn_%28formation%29_65cb.html" title="Talk:Column (formation)">Talk:Column (formation)</a>, so I think that the paragraph should be souced. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 00:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also I read with interest an account of the Battle of Sabugal where the 95th picked off any Frenchman infront of them who looked likely to give an order to redeploy from column formation. Of the 5 French colonels who faced the Light Division that day 2 were killed and 2 were badly wounded. (Urban <i>Rifles</i> page 109). It is also well documented that at the Battle of Waterloo that on a number of occasions the French were thrown into confusion when columns redeploying into line were fired upon.</p>
<p>Finally the above text seems to assume that there as only one type of column the "Heavy column", but infact there were a number of different types of columns for example the "column of companies" which was still in use in the American Civil War, for these and others (see <a href="http://napoleonistyka.atspace.com/infantry_tactics_4.htm#infantrycombatcolumns" class="external text" title="http://napoleonistyka.atspace.com/infantry_tactics_4.htm#infantrycombatcolumns" rel="nofollow">Infantry Tactics and Combat during the Napoleonic Wars.

<dl>
<dd>I've certainly read accounts that suggest the French did try modify their tactics but never a clear one as to tell us the details, it seems that whatever they were trying failed to be completed under sustained fire. As to the later point I don't think that is a problem. This article covers the brief details of the events and armies involved in an article that is about Wellington and it would be quite unnecessarily bloated by a wider discussion of forms of column which surely belongs to another article. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 12:23, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately the section at the top starts off wrong and ends up worse. The system Napoleon inherited had little to do with Fredrick the Great and never did. Instead it was a mixture of the old French Army and half trained volunteer formations of the revolution. Add to that the insult given the Austrian Army is even worse and has no place in Wiki. The Austrian Army was always well trained and its troops would fight as hard as any in Europe. They were always well equipped. I assure you that the French army does not celebrat the Battle ofWargarm or the Battle of Leipzig, as great victories. I wish that tactical combat was as simple as counting muskets and good British resolve, I honestly do, it would sure be simple wouldn't it? It however is not and was not the case in most of the battles a simple matter of solid lines against ill though out assualt columns. I would refer you to Paddy Griffin's work on the subject. It is the primer to understanding Napoleonic Warfare tactics at the small scale. Honestly I think the whole paragraph so bad that deletion would and should be considered. This section is insulting in the extream to anyone that isn't a subject of the UK. Frankly I expect far better in a Wiki article. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 14:05, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One other point, As Wellington frequently used the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverse_slope_defence.html" title="Reverse slope defence">reverse slope</a> when he chose the battle field, it may be that when attacking his army, that the French had problems gauging when to redeploy from column into line. All credit to him, but that does not mean that the French intended to press home their attacks in column formation. As this paragraph is controversial it should cite its sources or be deleted. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:41, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem with the Austrian Army was not that it was disorganised, it was very well trained and equipped, something the Prussian Army could not say through Waterloo. However unlike the Prussian Army (which was far more effective in the field) it was often poorly led and never had a General Staff system and the concurent C&amp;C issues often ate them alive. However the point is this isn't a comparative of the armies of Europe during Wellington's time. We went into details that are at best circumstancial perhaps sliding into urban myth and have it in a bio... <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 18:33, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of the Napoleonic commanders, Archduke Karl and Schwarzenberg were both competent commanders. Mack was notably incompetent, and Melas wasn't very good, but Austrian leadership was reasonably good. Karl was almost certainly a more gifted leader than anyone either the Russians or the Prussians could muster (besides Suvorov). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 04:15, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If by Archduke Karl I have seen referrence to Archduke Charles and I assume this is the same commander. He was more than competent and damn near ruined the French army when it beat him the 2nd time. Schwarzenberg was competent but hardly engergetic. However the issues that people talk about with the Austrian army are with its earlier era. The Austrian army that marched to war in 1813 was a competent force that marched all the way to Paris and defeated Napoleon convincingly. Now that being said I still stand by what my line of inquirey is... what is all that paragraph doing in a biography? <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 15:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Karl is the German form of Charles, so, yes, they are the same person. As to the earlier Austrian army, Charles was defeating Moreau and Jourdan in Germany in 1796, and I think if you read Tim Blanning's book on the French Revolutionary Wars, you'll see that Blanning, at least, thinks that the Austrians generally fought quite well throughout those wars, although there top leadership wasn't necessarily all that inspired. At any rate, I will concur that the paragraph is an odd one for the Wellington article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This link goes directly to what I am saying about the line vs. Column debate. It should have been laid to rest years ago. That English speakers somehow think that the French army was tactically or stratigically stupid astonishes me to this day. I hear things like stupid and incompetent labeled to them and its just flat wrong. The real end to French dominance of Europe was when their enemies raised their own game to match. The Austrians of Wargam of Liepzig were far more effective as an army than the Austrians of Austerliz. The Prussian Army would never see another Jena. The British army floundered until Moore and Wellington. This speaks to what the French were doing.

<dd>Wellington was not at Maida; and the picture of <i>Wellington's</i> battles can be sourced from Longford's <i>Wellington</i>, which used (but in part criticizes) Oman. The claim here is not that the French were inept, but that the French tactic was ineffective against an enemy disciplined enough to reserve fire, especially when deployed on the far side of a hill - and that Napoleon, not having fought a fully trained and effectively generalled English army, did not realize this until too late. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 23:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think, if I followed that was being said, the point being the French would charge from line or from column as the situation dictated not that Wellington was or was not at a battle. Paddy Griffon wrote a very small book about small tactics and how they were different then what our perception was. In the America's we think the Minute Men used Pennsylvania Rifles to pick off British officers and shooting the lines to bits... the reality was much different. I think what I am working to is this, the British consistently fielded the most disciplined infantry in that era. I can not begin to tell you how difficult it is to train troops to fire one volley and charge. Every impulse is to reload and fire again yet the British infantry would lower bayonets and charge with every intention of closing. This factor, along with the fact that the French often didn't know where the British lines were, allowed them to work magic. It didn't always work D'Erlon's attack showed what might be done, but the British Heavy Calvary saw to that...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably true; but were any of those occasions Wellington's field battles? He didn't fight all that many, and at Waterloo, he himself said that the French fought in column in the same old way and were defeated in the old way (not exact; I don't at the moment have Longford in front of me.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 23:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This may be a non-issue; when Pakenham counteerattacked at Salamamca, Wellington ordered him to form in column. Napoleon almost always attacked; Wellington almost always defended. If the column was the standard attack formation, Napoleon will have used it far more often.

<p>The last major rewrite while not any worse than the previous is exactly why this article has gone from a Featured Article Canidate to class B. There are so many unsupported statements and damning critic of Generals and capabilities... all completely unsupported by the way... all provided by an unknown IP address. This edit is so POV that I felt like getting out pom poms and cheering for Wellington. I think the time has come to lock down the page to ip's and new accounts. Also after having my nose rubbed in it enough nothing in the article begins to have footnoting and verification anywhere near wiki standards. I would suggest a total rewrite from a cold 3rd person stance. I don't know when bio's became the playground of opinions but it sure has here. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 22:13, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This said that the Wesleys "legally" changed their surname in 1798. This seems most unlikely; eighteenth-century spelling was variable: The first Earl of Mornington's original surname was spelt <i>Colley</i>, <i>Cowley</i>, or <i>Cooley</i>. Is there a source for this (especially for Arthur, who was in India, away from British legal machinery)? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 23:21, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've seen nothing to suggest any legal formality, iirc correctly Longford &amp; Guedalla just reference him using the new form in all his letters from a specific day. Other members of his family certainly went through the correct procedure of getting a royal licence but I can't find entries for all of them. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 14:38, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'33rd Regiment of Foot Wellingtons Redcoats who fought in the Napoleonic Wars between 1812 - 1816' Just out of interest what actions did the 33rd take as part of any force acting against French forces after Waterloo. <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondo06_0d60.html" title="User:Londo06">Londo06</a> 06:55, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I do not have any knowledge about the 33rd Regiment of Foot. I can tell you that Wellington's army marched to Paris after Waterloo trailing a bit behind the Prussians. If that regiment was part of Wellington's order of battle then it would be so employed. More than a little care should be provided here however regiments were frequently detailed to other objectives. The Prussian army detached an entire Corp to assist in the fortress campaign that didn't complete until Sept. of 1815. Its very possible for a regiment to be employed elsewhere. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 14:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
