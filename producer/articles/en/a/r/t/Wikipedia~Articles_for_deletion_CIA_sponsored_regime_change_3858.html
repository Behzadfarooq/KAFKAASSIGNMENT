<dd>The nomination is not a very good argument for deleting the article, but this is a discussion, not just a series of opinions on whether the nominator got it right. I don't think NPOV is a very good argument against this article; I think saying that it is redundant, badly named, and a POV fork are good arguments. If we are trying to rationalize the structure of the information here, I think logically this article should be a subsection of the CIA article; instead, it repeats - badly - material already in that article. We just don't need it. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>*<b>Comment</b> As it stands, a rather worthless POV magnet of an article. This is exactly the type of page that needs solid referencing, including inline citations - and it has none. Needs a wider range of sources too (also please note: Lew Rockwell's website is probably not the ideal place to go if you want to create factually accurate, NPOV pages). If that's not enough to delete then <b>stubify, remove unreferenced and possibly POV content pending a rewrite</b>.

<li><b>Keep but Rename</b> The page conveys a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point of view</a> before one even opens it. The word "regime", while neutral in its dictionary sense, carries notions of repugnancy or totalitarianism. The central contention of the article - that the CIA were involved in the overthrow of a number of governments - is supported by numerous <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and I do not believe NPOV is a content problem with this subject as long as editors adhere to Wikipedia policies/pillars. The current content is suspect but cleanup is <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">not a reason in itself for deletion</a> - whacking a big "cleanup" tag on it and inviting editors to improve it is the answer to that problem.

<dd>"Involuntary removal of governments" is <b>not POV at all</b>. It means that the existing government is removed against the will of the government. Are you suggesting that when the CIA has taken action to remove a foreign government from power that there has been even a single such foreign government that has welcomed the CIA's efforts to remove it? Can you cite an example of such a case? A thank you note from a deposed head of state perhaps? I mean seriously, are you joking? You're the one claiming that the phrase is tainted with POV; instead of just repeating it, try supporting the assertion. Sheesh. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You have misunderstood me and I you. There is nothing POV in <i>"Involuntary removal"</i>, it is just a clumsier way of saying <i>"regime change"</i>. I do not think there is anything POV in "regime change" either, besides it has <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regime_change.html" title="Regime change">an article</a>. Reading the article does bring up some questions though. The article assumes that external military force is needed for something to be called "regime change". It seems that this is a post Iraq War misunderstanding. I think the phrase was used long before G.W. Bush. -- <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetri_Krohn_f1f9.html" title="User:Petri Krohn">Petri Krohn</a> 08:26, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><small>Your&#160;!vote is effectively for a completely new article to be created that does not use the POV stance from this article.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. In its current state, the article exists only to push a point of view. It is also made redundant by other (more neutral) articles on the CIA and the corresponding issues. Perhaps summarizing the content in one article is warranted, but only under a different title, and after a complete rewrite that contains more than zero sources.
