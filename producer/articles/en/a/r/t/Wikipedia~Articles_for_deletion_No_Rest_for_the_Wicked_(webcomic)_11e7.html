<li><b>Keep</b> A useful analogy might be an excellent but obscure fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm, such as Der Gevatter Tod. There would no question of the notability of an article on such a story, even if no external source could be found that discussed that story specifically, right? Here we have an ongoing story told in fairy-tale form, a story that has engrossed the loyalty and affections of many people across the Internet. This comic has been nominated repeatedly for awards, and was selected as a "presenter" of an award in 2005; hence, it is clearly one of the most notable web-comics and there are reliable external sources citing it. Indeed, more people probably know of Andrea Peterson's story than know of Der Gevatter Tod, although that too is an excellent and engrossing tale. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillowW_a94c.html" title="User:WillowW">Willow</a> 22:36, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the Grimms are very notable, but the author of this comic is rather less so. The artistic merits of the comic are irrelevant for the purposes of its inclusion in Wikipedia. You mention reliable external sources citing it; what are they? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi, you seem to have missed my point, so I'll clarify. I did not claim that Andrea Peterson is more notable than the Grimm brothers, nor did I claim that her story was "art". Rather, I argued that <i>her story</i> was better known and, hence, more notable than many analogous stories that would reasonably be considered notable, such as Der Gevatter Tod. Two external sites that reference her work are <a href="http://www.ccawards.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ccawards.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.comixpedia.com/node/1784" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.com/node/1784" rel="nofollow">here</a>. She has been interviewed several times, which were published externally, such as <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/llperks/vpost?id=1436737" class="external text" title="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/llperks/vpost?id=1436737" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://studio.paperfox.org/candy/index_2.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1128643001&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=12&amp;content=articles.php" class="external text" title="http://studio.paperfox.org/candy/index_2.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1128643001&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=12&amp;content=articles.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The story has been favorably reviewed by several external sites as well, such as <a href="http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=3081&amp;issue=2004-04-01" class="external text" title="http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=3081&amp;issue=2004-04-01" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.enterthedream.net/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=223" class="external text" title="http://www.enterthedream.net/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=223" rel="nofollow">here</a>. These external sites are independent and therefore cannot be considered as "advertising".

<li>Thanks for providing the sources. It's not unusual for a webcomic to be well covered online, but the sources you cite do not appear to be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> - i.e., sources with a reputation for fact-checking and serious research. Although Sequential Tart, which looks to be fairly professional, <i>might</i> qualify, the others appear to be blogs, forums and other enthusiast-run projects. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 23:13, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm. From what I've learned in the recent flurry of AfDs, Comixpedia is an online magazine. The site readily agrees, and has such things as monthly articles, issue archives and cover art, with the more modern blog, forum and wiki elements on top of that base. (Sure, it looks rather ugly, but so do I and the site at least works.) Apparently it actually pays writers, and while the amounts are symbolic that sets it well apart from the usual enthusiast work. I think it should count. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 06:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah, now that I actually read what my mind, assuming it to be an advertising banner at the bottom of an empty page, was filtering out... yes, I see. Lousy layout, this. Anyway, while I'd not have nominated this article under these circumstances, I'm not withdrawing the nomination, because I'm not convinced of all this underground-flavoured notability. Marginal coverage by subculture publications and receiving a marginally notable subculture award (itself still up for AfD) is less than impressive in my view – and I am a regular reader of webcomics! – but I'm aware that many other editors may feel differently. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 18:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough. Truth be told, I asked you to consider it in large part because of weariness. I'm here to make contributions, this recent flurry of webcomic deletions that had just been abating has been increasingly grinding. Oh well. Too late for that.
