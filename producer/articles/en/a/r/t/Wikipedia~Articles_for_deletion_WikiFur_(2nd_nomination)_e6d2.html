<li><b>Keep</b>. What statements in the article cannot be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verified</a>? We've tried to keep it to the facts wherever possible. The majority of the current references are to wikia.com because that is where most of the information is. Only two of them are to WikiFur itself, though, and one of those is an announcement that could also have been referenced to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Furry_fandom&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=20243784" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Furry_fandom&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=20243784" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia edit</a>, or to a LiveJournal post. I thought it best to make a page for it on WikiFur where it could be given in context with later posts. Wikis aren't always great secondary references, but I don't see a problem with it being a primary one for itself. This article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WikiFur_343c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WikiFur">was deleted once</a>, and rightly so, because it was badly written and the site was one month old.

<dd>That's true of most wikis. The documents concerning their foundation and policy are hosted on their websites and related websites. The best place to go for information about Wikipedia is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> - an article which happens to have large numbers of references to meta-wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation, and even to itself. It also happens to be the most comprehensive coverage of its topic. It's the same for WikiFur. I <i>could</i> link directly to LiveJournals where significant members of the subject area have said what they thought about WikiFur, but why not just point to the wiki page where they are already referenecd and tied together into an article? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 03:15, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Comparing Wikifur to Wikipedia in terms of media coverage is unfair. Wikipedia is a large, general purpose encyclopedia aimed at the general public, wikifur is not. A by-the-word interpretation of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not refer at all to size or distribution of the third-party source, only that it be well-known. The fact that this non-furry third-party source chose to directly quote from wikifur and redistribute its content is an example of wikifur's notability and a demonstration of it's usefulness outside the fandom. -- <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeVandalizer_1f70.html" title="User:DeVandalizer">DeVandalizer</a> 10:54, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't the one who originated the Wikipedia comparison.

<dd>The section that mentions furry topics on Wikipedia is just intended as a explanation, not a claim to notability. (Though perhaps it's notable for being most vandalized as a direct result of its content?

<dd>And in reply to your statement: My belief is that material that is verifiable and does not contain any NPOV violations should have a place on Wikipedia. Using other people's reports (notability) is a way to try to achieve some assurance of that, but it seems like it's just a shortcut for Wikipedians doing the fact-checking themselves, and that when it is easy to do then they should do it. I can understand that when it's a complicated question of law or science which is hard for laymen to understand (which is why there is NOR, to avoid that uncertainty), but I don't really see the application to this particular article, which makes reasonable, referenced assertions about the mission and history of a wiki that has existed and operated for over a year, and which is well-known within its sphere. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 06:46, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> One mention in a local paper is not sufficient mainstream press coverage to establish notability.

The article has a click link to a dictionary definition article <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a> which is unencyclopedic as well. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:14, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Don't find a lot of the reasons cited for deletion here to be that compelling. Just because the wiki isn't covered in Time magazine doesn't make it non-notable; I realize major media coverage makes a handy shortcut to deciding what deserves space, but it shouldn't be used as a crutch either. The article should be improved, rather than deleted before it has the chance to get better, as I can't think of any serious reason it can't be made better or more referenced. --ToyDragon</li>

There is no evidencce that the content of WikiFur has multiple independent coverage.

<dd>Are you referring to the second paragraph, starting "Like Wookieepedia,"? The objective there was to give some context for its foundation, to answer the question "why does this website exist?" I think this is something that needs to be answered, and those are the reasons <b>I</b> had in mind, but there's probably a better way to put it - I'd welcome any edits, or suggestions on how to improve that section. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 21:15, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no way this is notable. WIth reference to article number: I've seen articles where the info is taken from a <b>new user's userpage</b>, so it's no wonder the articles are as numerous as they are. Take out all the Category:People articles and you have far fewer than other wikis that were deleted for notability reasons. Also a depressingly low number of google hits. Apparently it's a favorite at <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Wikia" class="extiw" title="wikia:Wikia">Wikia:Wikia</a>, but that doesn't make it notable. Seems very self-referencing of the "wiki universe" section of the internets, someone with no knowledge of Wikia and Wikipedia would not care. By the way, I only have like 20 edits, lol. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Miltopia</a> 20:55, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are around 2100 articles in Category:People. I do not know how many of these articles would be included in the conservative count - some are, of course, stubs, while others are highly trafficked, linked and/or featured - but I'd say around 4/5 of them, or ~1700. This is not surprising given that the chief part of a community <b>is</b> its people. But why would anyone want to take them out? WikiFur is not Wikipedia - it is intended (in part) as a public directory of members of the furry fandom, and it is used as such by many, who find it convenient to get a summary of facts, accomplishments, and links to further information. We do encourage users to develop public articles about themselves if they are in the fandom, because in this case much of the information that would normally go on user pages <i>is</i> relevant to the topic of the wiki. It is often the topic that new users have the most knowledge about to hand, so they can make a quick contribution, plus it gets them used to having their writing edited. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 21:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I'm just saying as far as measuring WikiFur's notability by article number isn't accurate because most of those articles are written about people who, frankly, don't matter in a global encyclopedic sense any more than I do. So, number of articles probably shouldn't be used to offset the low google results, since the articles are not at all about significant people. Like, it's not like these are essential articles to be knowledgeable about the furry fandom, and many are autobiographical. This is compared to ED (might as well get that out of the way), which, while not a good article candidate in itself in my opinion, has information about famous internet people that you just can't find anywhere else, thus making it a more notable source of its purpose in comparison to WikiFur. I think the very low traffic kind of speaks for itself. I'm sorry, I'm trying really hard not to like insult your wiki and am not expressing myself well and probably insulting it anyway, but I'm doing my best here. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Miltopia</a> 22:59, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine, but the only person who's brought up measuring notability by article number (twice) is you. We all know anyone can make a wiki with lots of articles, usually by <a href="http://man-wiki.net/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://man-wiki.net/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">importing them</a>. The link I pasted above was in reference to editors, as I see community involvement as a big factor in wiki notability. In that sense, I'm not quite sure what you mean by "very low traffic". WikiFur certainly don't get a billion hits a week - more like 120,000 - but then the furry fandom does not have a billion people in it. We're happy with our figures, as they make for a high-traffic site within its domain (especially considering we're not giving out porn&#160;:-). I would argue that this, plus the ability to verify the facts in the article from the given references (which I don't think anyone has disputed), is sufficient reason to keep it.<br />
ED is a discussion apart from this AfD. While I agree with Wikipedia's link policy, I think it should probably have an article. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 20:58, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
