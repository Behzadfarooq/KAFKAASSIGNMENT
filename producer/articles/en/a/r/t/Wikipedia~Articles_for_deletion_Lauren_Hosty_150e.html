<dd>Haha, well I would have to agree to a certain extent. I do not really know why socialites deserve mention in an encyclopedia. But I was looking up someone else, and came across whole categories of socialites (by nationality, etc) whose authors would probably be sad if they were deleted. Honestly, you are not deleting this because you think it is a silly article (otherwise you should delete ALL of them)--you are deleting it because you didn't like what I wrote about the universities/colleges.

<dd>Let's not play games like this. You would not have even thought about looking up random socialites and deleting them if you hadn't seen it on my contibutions list, so it is clear that you did it because you are mad at me or something for reporting some (admittedly negative) information about some schools in BC. We are fixing that, and I will try to be unbiased about universities in the future. So about this, you would have to agree to saying that all or the majority of the articles on socialites should be deleted for the same reasons, which I don't think you are prepared to do because you really don't care about the socialite thing but about the universities.

<p>Ok, I made the new category for Canadians because there wasn't one before. I realize it looks a bit silly with only one, but I guess I was sort of hoping others would add more. There are categories for Americans, Australians, French, British, etc. I thought Canada should have a category too. Is that ok?</p>
<p>And about non-notable-ness, most socialites probably *are* non-notable compared to celebrities or less-famous authors or certain types of cheese or a bunch of other wacky stuff that is on wikipedia because some people think it is interesting. There are enough people interesting in recording the goings-on of socialites, so that is why there are articles about them, Hosty included.

<dd>Ok, I just looked it up and I think what is happening is "sockpuppeting". This is really sad and it makes me never want to go on wikipedia if people are just going to gang up on me and delete everything I write just because I wrote it. That is so mean. There is just no other explanation for it, unless Ardenn just called up Fan and Ginkgo and TOLD them to go online and start debating this. Which is also really mean.

<li><b>Delete</b> as 100% NN vanity, what more do you need? I'd also question the sheer factual nature of the article - I'm wondering when, for example, she would have fit in "studying at Oxford" during this "youth" of hers, since she only finished high school in 2003 and has been at college in British Columbia since (and while we're at it, how can one start college in 2003 and now be in their fourth year?). Anyway, the article asserts no notability whatsoever. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 09:09, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fact: Canadian universities end in April and thus students graduating from high school in 2003 are entering their fourth year, and when you are in the summer between years you wouldn't say you are in the year you just completed. Also, many bright students ie those that would be accepted for a study abroad program at Oxford will have taken AP classes and would be well into the fourth year credit wise. So Seb Patrick's question of the article's "sheer factual natural" is illogical in those areas. In terms of notability there are other articles on Wikipedia regarding socialites are equally not "notable". The main definition for socialites being that they are not primarily something else ie actress, model. For if they were they would be called by that instead. This article sounds like most of the rest of them so I'd say <b>keep</b> because I don't see a problem about this one. Roses85 00:00, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Roses85 has only made one contribution to Wikipedia, and it's on this afd. <span style="border: 1px solid green;"><a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdenn_1d2f.html" title="User talk:Ardenn"><font style="background: green" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Ardenn</font></a></span> 00:11, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Rose85 also totally ignores the fact that, even if socialites were notable, we're totally unable to verify that she is one, or exists at all. All that can be verified from google is that a Lauren Hosty finished a half-marathon in Niagara, ON a few years back. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:22, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as nn. Just because <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_socialites_9e84.html" title="Category:American socialites">Category:American socialites</a> exists doesn't make all socialites notable enough for a Wikipedia article, when even a cursory look at the category would reveal that it contains people like <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Radziwill_4e62.html" title="Lee Radziwill">Lee Radziwill</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Vanderbilt_5923.html" title="Gloria Vanderbilt">Gloria Vanderbilt</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline_Kennedy_5528.html" title="Caroline Kennedy">Caroline Kennedy</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patty_Hearst_15a1.html" title="Patty Hearst">Patty Hearst</a>, who are notable for other reasons <i>besides</i> simply having been socialites. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeritasophia_d515.html" title="User:Veritasophia">Veritasophia</a> is hereby invited to stow the attitude. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:46, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
