<p>Fancruft. It's not well-written, either. Much more appropriate at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Wiki_d0c2.html" title="Star Wars Wiki">Star Wars Wiki</a>, where Star Wars fans can write to their hearts' content about stuff like this. As it is, I don't see how debates about which canon supports this theory or whether <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lucas_cbb4.html" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> would agree with the theory belong on such a venerable encyclopedia as this one. <b>Delete</b> this article, and <b>write a better one one the Star Wars wiki</b>.--<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.123.232.156.html" title="User:67.123.232.156">67.123.232.156</a> 06:27, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's worth reminding people that <b>redirect</b> and <b>merge</b> are both counted as <b>keep</b> votes. it's all to easy to forget that. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a> has just survived a VfD for exactly that reason. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:06, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - barely. I'd agree it is not well written, however I've heard very interesting, detailed, and scientific debates on this which made it into a fascinating thought experiment. What is here is not very good, but I say give it time to see if someone comes along and makes it right. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 06:32, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Mass-nominating on VfD is probably not a good idea. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 06:57, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, article is borderline encyclopedic, but with some reservations. The Sci-Fi genre is not really committed to realism, and Endor is still standing at the end of the <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:11, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> on its own merits. All the movie's heroes were on the moon and it's absurd to think that Lucas meant for them all to die. This is glorified fan fiction. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 07:41, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue of whether this event "actually happened" in the context of the fictional universe, whether Lucas intended for it to happen, etc. is addressed within the article itself. VfD isn't the right forum to be debating that sort of thing in. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 15:23, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, needs cleanup and expansion. Borderline notability. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 09:37, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Fan speculation. A couple of lines in the Endor article can deal with this subject, but this whole article is just overwritten fanwanking. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 09:52, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for the same reasons as Gamaliel. Wikipedia explicitly excludes speculation, the propounding of theought experiments, etc. — that's original research (though that term really flatters this article). That the nominator has nominated less obvious articles, or is mass-nominating, is irrelevant to the vote on this one. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:02, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor.html" title="Endor">Endor</a>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:17, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
<li>I'd suggest severely condensing (no more than a few sentences) and <b>merging</b> into <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor.html" title="Endor">Endor</a>. Pretty obvious that the holocaust theory wasn't the intent of Lucas (in fact the article even states that several canonical sources have debunked it). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:32, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and maybe add a paragraph in <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor.html" title="Endor">Endor</a>. I've read this theory in a handful of other webpages <a href="http://www.theforce.net/swtc/holocaust.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theforce.net/swtc/holocaust.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but it is still fan speculation, and not particularly notable. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 13:47, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-encyclopedic. A small amount of this article could rewritten for one of the other starwars articles if it's not already covered well enough.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. By the way, when I do VfD closes I always count redirects/merges distinct from keeps and deletes. It seems fairer to me that way. I get a lot of "no consensus" results, but I think that's okay because it reflects the diversity of opinion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:37, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep!</b> The nominator has been mass-nominating Star Wars articles on Vfd. Apparently on some kind of crazy anti-star wars crusade. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStancel_c73e.html" title="User:Stancel">Stancel</a> 18:04, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You mean that the nature of the article is irrelevant; you'll vote to keep for extraneous reasons, ignoring the arguments given for deleting? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:16, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Or Stancel may simply be saying their vote is for keeping it. Also, The nominator has been mass-nominating Star Wars articles on Vfd. Which is info I'm glad to know, so I can consider and vote on some of those others--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 18:47, May 9, 2005 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>Then, as this isn't a mere voting process, but reasons matter, there are at least two, possibly three votes without reasons (or with reasons irrelevant to this article) which need to be supplemented. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:00, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mass-nominating? I nominated <i>three</i> articles on Vfd. Hardly a mass-nomination. Next time you libel me, at least try to make it sound plausible.--<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.123.232.156.html" title="User:67.123.232.156">67.123.232.156</a> 19:03, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though the attempt to add "..and then deleted" to the Star Wars Wiki template tag would arguably count as an attempt to delete EVERY Star Wars article using it, a whole lot more than three. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 19:50, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's true that I did change the template to that. But in that case I was only following the recommendations of the Star Wars Wiki itself (see <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:Community_Portal" class="external autonumber" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:Community_Portal" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). Also, when I did that, I did not <i>nominate</i> the articles, I merely took an action that might eventually lead to the articles' deletion. You cannot say that I mass nominated those articles for deletion, since nominating consists of placing vfd tags and such, as I did with these three (carefully selected) articles.--<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.123.232.156.html" title="User:67.123.232.156">67.123.232.156</a> 03:44, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hm. Dumb VfD drama about a dumb D-canon SW fandom debate. <b>Delete</b> this and all other fandom debates with little basis in canon. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> 20:05, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for reasons cited by Mel and Andrew. Fancruft surrounding fiction, not verified, apparently contradicted by available facts, no potential to become encyclopedic. It's clear that some editors are voting based on whether they like the topic, and are not differentiating among these three nominations by the criteria at <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, where a major character or a major race are treated differently than fan-generated, non-canonical speculation about a side issue. 205.247.102.130 20:07, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- mildly interesting, but non-notable in the grand scheme of Star Wars mythology. Fancruft at best, and irrelevant to canon to boot. Might eventually turn out to be interesting if it was an accepted part of Star Wars <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a>, but I'm not even aware of it being that. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:52, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is not canon. Everyone lived happily ever after, that's why they all were dancing (badly) at the end of the film. It wasn't in those awful books set after the films either. <b>Delete</b>, lest be we swamped with articles like Theoretical genetic mutations that would have arisen if Leia had married Luke or The sex lives of Ewoks <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 05:05, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. VfD crusade or otherwise, this is still non-canonical and, while scientifically accurate, is also irrelevant, as Endor stopped being important to Star Wars basically the instant RotJ ended. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarblespire_61cf.html" title="User:Marblespire">Marblespire</a> 07:13, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The debate is large enough to be notable and as clearly mentioned in the article there are references in expanded universe canon, both for and against. I completely fail to see how including this damages Wikipedia's "venerability" - especially since our excessive width of knowledge is one of the biggest advantages! Star Wars Wiki is not a sister project of Wikipedia, what on Earth does it have to do with anything? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 09:42, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This debate has come up reasonably often in Star Wars fandom, the "canonicity" of it isn't relevant to its notability (and issues of canonicity are discussed within the article itself, in any event). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 15:18, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see how anyone could reasonably make that statement. The article is written using the movies and at least three other articles as sources. <i>SWTC</i>, the <i>The Truth about the "Endor Holocaust"</i>, and Pablo Hidalgo's statements in <i>SW:Insider</i>, and as far as we know, this article has not be contributed to by any of those authors.

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I have vague recollections of seeing the Insider lying on my bro's bedside table (he is an immense star wars fan), the other two sources you cite look like nothing more than essays published online on fan sites. Are they considered canon? Are they even notable? Is every piece of fan speculation on anything that exists notable? This isn't about being pro or anti star wars (I love Star Wars), or even about how much genuine Star Wars information deserves to be on Wikipedia, this is about non-notable non-canon unverifiable speculation about something that didn't happen in a film. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 00:42, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Technical_Commentaries_8152.html" title="Star Wars Technical Commentaries">Star Wars Technical Commentaries</a> have had their own Wikipedia article since Mar 2004, so they are certainly notable. SW:Insider is a magazine with wide circulation, so it is notable, and the last is a rebuttal to Curis Saxton's (of the SWTC) arguments, and is not that widely known, which is why I said only 2 of the 3 I would consider notable. This is a theory argued about inside the SW:Community, including among magazine editors and physicists. If you go to a convention, you are bound to find either view represented. This is not a test of notability, merely a demonstration of the relativity of notability. Walk into the physics department of a university and everyone knows that a quark is an elemental and indivisible subatomic particle; walk into a Star Trek convention, and Quark is a lovable Ferengi bartender.--<a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEion_bc74.html" title="User:Eion">Eion</a> 13:30, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Question</b> I lack a bookstore where I live. And a library of back issues of insider. Do either of these two that you cite say anything more than "The Endor Holocaust never happened"? Do they cite canon explanations of why Endor was not trashed? If they did, then these should go on the endor article, but still don't make for an article of its own. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 20:06, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Idle Comment</b>. I'm often perplexed by the argument that certain things should be constrained to one article. I mean, it's going to take up approximately the same space in two articles, and its not like Wikipedia is ever going to run out of space, ever.--<a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEion_bc74.html" title="User:Eion">Eion</a> 20:54, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I still fondly remember a VfD many months ago for some fairly obscure technical topic that was labelled "sciencecruft" by a delete-voter.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:08, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I've been tempted to do that to various historical articles. After all, history bores me; it's not interesting to me, therefore it shouldn't be here!
