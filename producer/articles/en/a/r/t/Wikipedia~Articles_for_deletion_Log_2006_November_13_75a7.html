<li><b>Comment</b> The Proactiv "system" contains more than benzoyl peroxide, so it would not be appropriate to merge it into benzoyl peroxide. It has three parts - the benzoyl peroxide solution, a salicylic acid solution, and a gentle cleanser. As I said below, you can get all three in larger containers than Proactiv's for about one-fourth the cost of Proactiv if you buy generic at a discount drug store. Its notability (pro or con) is in my opinion not because of its ingredients but because of its marketing. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 06:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This product is overpriced and unremarkable in and of itself (you're basically paying $50 for the exact products you could buy at any discount drugstore in North America for $10), but the prevalence of the infomercial and the notability of those who have endorsed it make it notable IMO.

<li><b>Delete</b>. (multiple edit conflict) The previous discussion talked about taking time to consider amending policy, but it has not been amended. Encyclopedic lists generally serve as short summaries of articles or sections of articles, and should have some hope of being exhaustive. Lists of non-technical terms tend to be attractive nuisances.

The reason there are many other slang lists out there is simply because they have not been gotten to, <i>or</i> they are well referenced with significant encyclopedic content. The reason I nominated this is that it is a list of dictionary definitions.</li>
<li>I personally think homosexuallity is a fine encyclopedic subject. I think an article about slang is also very encyclopedic. But a list of words with definitions goes into a dictionary, not an encyclopedia.

My concern with a slang list is that anyone can come along and add words to the list that are extremely local, rarely used, or even bald-faced neologisms. If we don't require that use of the terms be verified, what good is the article? I think we should include only those terms that have documentably widespread use. That would undoubtably decimate this list, and the terms that are left over are going to be those that are already mentioned in other articles (<a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">MTF and FTM</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexual.html" title="Bisexual">Ambisexual</a>) or are important enough to have an article of their own (<a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaydar.html" title="Gaydar">Gaydar</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_community.html" title="Bear community">Bear community</a>, <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twink_%28gay_slang%29.html" title="Twink (gay slang)">Twink (gay slang)</a>). So, out with the list. Seriously, what good is it? You can't use it to learn slang for conversation because you have no way of knowing whether a term on the list is completely unknown in your area or hopelessly out-of-date, and you can't use it for research because there's not enough information and it's unverified. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMa</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 00:06, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

This killing is a newsworthy facet of the Northern Ireland peace process only if there's a prominent source for the material in the final paragraph (about possibile political motivations for the PSNI statement).

If someone has time and access they may want to check that out. Joe Sabia (an undergraduate columnist for the Cornell daily newspaper(and no Sabia, in event that you google yourself regularly, I'm not comparing you Ann Coulter)) apparently had an article where he used the term extensively - <a href="http://atheism.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://joesabia.com/article/0168.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://atheism.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://joesabia.com/article/0168.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and some bloggers responded to it (for example <a href="http://atheism.about.com/b/a/045863.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://atheism.about.com/b/a/045863.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>).

<li><b>Comment:</b> The question is if there is such a thing as a distinctive "atheist left" movement, as opposed to a collection of people who happen to be atheistic and hold left-wing political views. If the only thing that can be said about the "atheist left" is that it is a term used to describe left-wing atheists, then we can never write an encyclopedic article on the subject. We cannot and should not have an article on every random combination of two adjectives (e.g. homosexual right, Scientologist left, atheist centrists, Muslim pro-choice, etc) -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 06:29, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think the sources above make it clear that at minimum there are conservative sources such as Sabia who are using it to mean a specific group and not just the intersection of atheists and leftists but even that is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:33, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Are you sure they use it to mean a specific group? It seems more like they use it to imply that all leftists are atheists (or vice versa). -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 06:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not completely sure but I think so. Note in particular the way it is used in parallel to "religious right." However, since none of them define the term its hard to tell. Certainly from the brief Coulter excerpt she seems to think that its an actual group since she complains that the NYT doesn't use it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:42, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as said on the talk page unlike supercouples, popular couples may not last as long as a supercouple for many reasons like; actor recasting, sudden storyline changes, shows being cancelled during a couple's romance, etc. But are still remembered by long time fans none the less.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As it says on the "supercouple" page:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"While there are many <b>popular couplings</b> on soap operas today, very few earn the right to be called a supercouple by fans and the soap media alike."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So clearly there is a difference between a so called "supercouple" and a "popular couple." As stated on the "supercouple" page. MrKing84 04:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I still don't think there needs to be a list of couples article. Articles on the shows themselves should be able to sufficiently explain popular couples and their impacts on the show and the storylines. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">I did "That's hot" first!</a> 04:12, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As you well know many of those articles are not linked to their respective shows. Especially shows that have been off the air for years and have very little if any character history on their show's wikipedia articles. Shows like Santa Barbara and Port Charles say nothing about their popular couples on their pages. And therefore have no links to their supercouples and or popular couples' wikipedia pages. As you yourself said a long time ago "Who gets to define who is a supercouple? Many print sources that are reliable, that's who!" But yet they're are little if any sources in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercouple.html" title="Supercouple">supercouple</a> article. But the list of popular couples must have them? And then what if somebody like yourself doesn't believe the source given is acceptable by the soap media like Soap Opera Digest? I just find all this very intresting.

<p>Bumping from speedy (G11 and A7). My initial reaction is this person is not notable enough to warrant the permanent privacy violation created by the encyclopedia entry. Apparently he wrote an ill-advised or spoof blog entry and was then made fun of by Fark. There was a previous AFD: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_McNamara_67a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David McNamara">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David McNamara</a>.

<li><b>Delete —</b> I am the person who proposed the deletion due to the fact that I have moved on from that time.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author an argue for keeping it. I dispute this assertion. Ivan Balaz Kral is a young Slovak author and you cannot make the relevancy argument based on Google hits. but to convince you that this entry should be kept. Ivan Balaz Kral already published several books as you will see when I finished my entry. He is a university teacher his webiste and here He has his own entry at slovak Wikipedia. As well his citizen name is Ivan Baláž, Kráľ is pseudonym. So hits on this name Ivan Baláž maybe on Google for his person as well.Sure but let consider, regional newspapers in Slovakia do not have their websites sometimes or do not list everything in archive, here I will post bibliographical notes to some interview Mr. Balaz did like in 2000 in Presovsky vecernik Návrat do minulosti (rozhovor o básnickom umení), No. 2470/ 20.4.2000. Here is a link to another article as Mr. Balaz published new book at the website of one the Slovaks largest cities Presov <a href="http://www.presov.sk/article.php?i_id_article=1258" class="external free" title="http://www.presov.sk/article.php?i_id_article=1258" rel="nofollow">http://www.presov.sk/article.php?i_id_article=1258</a> Some of his stories and stories about him were published in alternative magazines. This is a pdf of one interview <a href="http://zumag.ku.sk/papier/data/050605.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://zumag.ku.sk/papier/data/050605.pdf" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> An interview was in Eastern Slovak daily which is in the group of largest mainstream newspaper SME too "Ako básnici prichádzajú o ilúzie (rozhovor o pôvodnej tvorbe a básnickom umení), In: Prešovský denník KORZÁR" According to these cicrcumstances almost none of young publishing authors in postcommunist countries can make it to wikipedia. When you try to search this author on Google you have to use his citizen name Ivan Baláž as he researches as a scholar under this name, so the hits will be more <a href="http://www.google.sk/search?hl=sk&amp;q=%22Ivan+Bal%C3%A1%C5%BE%22&amp;btnG=H%C4%BEada%C5%A5&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.sk/search?hl=sk&amp;q=%22Ivan+Bal%C3%A1%C5%BE%22&amp;btnG=H%C4%BEada%C5%A5&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> on the other hand this includes many other Ivan Baláž s of course as that can be a common name. it still lists him on the first entries, he has his entry in wikipedia. I probably cannot make more argument to keep it. I will finish the article and wait the wikipedia s decission. But let me note this, there is almost no way contemporary authors can make it to english language Wikipedia it is only another proof of my theory which I call the "death of freedom on the internet" as this may sound to you unpopular. For countries like mine, Slovakia, there is no way to get attention, even on wikipedia that prides itself as the "free forum". There is almost no entry on Slovak authors here and I will not change it, I even cannot. Decission-makers in your forums are culturally rude. postings like "I am now officially founding the Solomon Society for fine art. Can I have an article?" but "freedom" at least functions at this point - At the end to suppress freedom of small ones. Yeah, google everything, you can google me [<a href="http://www.google.sk/search?q=%22brano+ondrasik%22&amp;hl=sk&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.sk/search?q=%22brano+ondrasik%22&amp;hl=sk&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>] and [<a href="http://www.google.sk/search?hl=sk&amp;q=%22branislav+ondrasik%22&amp;btnG=H%C4%BEada%C5%A5&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.sk/search?hl=sk&amp;q=%22branislav+ondrasik%22&amp;btnG=H%C4%BEada%C5%A5&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>].

<li><b>Keep</b> In the spirit of stemming systemic bias I feel this should be kept. If everything in the article is true, he's notable, and the article does <i>appear to be</i> well sourced. The sources are in Slovak which I cannot read, however the fact that I don't speak Slovak does not, by any means, make the sources incorrect or inappropriate; thats a problem on <i>my</i> part, not the part of the source. I'll give the benefit of the doubt in this case to the article's creator. If someone else who speak Slovak comes along and makes the case that the sources aren't what the article's creator purports them to be, then I'll reconsider. Also, ghits aren't always the best thing to go by, especially when dealing with something or someone from a country without much internet access or presence, or when dealing with certain historical subjects. The lack of many ghits remains rather unconvincing to me. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:42, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why is not Slovak wikipedia proof of encyclopedic notability? Btw, I am not the author of Slovak Wikipedia entry about this person... Probably someone, reader of this author.... do not know.... (Branislav.Ondrasik 12:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Doubtful Delete</b> There is indeed massive systemic bias in Wikipedia, but giving authors the benefit of the doubt is hardly the right way to deal with it. By analogy, scientific papers don't get accepted for publication just because the journal's editor cannot find a referee with the relevant competencies. This nomination however pinpoints quite an important issue for Wikipedia, particularly for its English instance, which has an obvious transcultural dimension. An appropriate specific guideline may be useful. To me <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> suggests deletion in this case, but Feureau and The Way's arguments are not without merit. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 09:21, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm just assuming the good faith of the article's creator insofar as I trust that the Slovak language articles are valid and closely related to the topic. If we refuse to accept foreign language articles as valid sources for the establishment of notability we're going to naturally end up with more systemic bias; many topics, especially historical ones, tend to have few sources in English. For example, I took a course on the history of <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus_36a8.html" title="Kievan Rus">Kievan Rus</a> and while we had a few books covering the subject, the vast majority of sources related to that topic are only written in Russian and have only recently begun being translated into English. If we aren't going to accept these sources then we're going to miss out on a lot of good and valid information. I will, however, admit that it would be quite nice if we could find someone who spoke Slovak and who was not connected to this article in order to get their opinion on the sources. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:48, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Making acceptance in one Wikipedia instance a sufficient condition for overall acceptance would enable weakest-link posting strategies and basically sink Wikipedia as we know it. I fully agree with you on the use of authoritative foreign language sources, but I do not think that this is the issue here. I would replace your "quite nice" with "essential" and add that more than one voice would be needed. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 07:07, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Hi everyone...so I will not influence the decission anymore, but after you shut down this article, please visit this discussion for my last interesting comment with links etc. to make my claim on wikipedia. I understand your fears, that is clear but... you will see. Anyway, I am glad the discussion went more to substance than in the beginning....I have already given up hope this entry will stay (Branislav.Ondrasik 12:53, 15 November 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<li><b><strike>Weak</strike> Delete</b>, <strike>I'm a bit puzzled by this one.</strike> On the one hand, it looks quite non-notable. The press coverage links provided are trivial coverage, possibly based on PR releases, and don't even point directly to the claimed sources—they link back to the company's web site. And a cosmetics company that owns a patent is about as notable as a country music star who owns a cowboy hat. And I see no other serious evidence of notability, and the article does have a strong flavor of pork products. On the other hand, the creator and sole editor appears to be <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">User:CatherineMunro</a>, who is a WP admin! which is about as far from the single-purpose account I expected to find as you can get.

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- I had actually forgotten I'd done this one. Looking back on it, I'm uncomfortable with it myself. As someone who often struggles to make ends meet month to month, I do freelance work for hire on another site (usually copyediting and web design), and I was asked to use my Wikipedia experience to write a properly formatted and referenced article on this company in return for $75. After some consideration, I decided that the company was notable enough, in part because of the successful patent challenges against <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revlon.html" title="Revlon">Revlon</a> and the like -- little guys usually either lose or are bought out when fighting the cosmetics giants. I thought I'd done a decent job to make it a straightforward and non-fluffy article, but yeah, from today's perspective I'd agree it is a bit, er, porcine.</dd>

<dd>I was careful to explain to the clients that once the article was released to the wild, it would be at the mercy of the community -- that I would not be trying to "protect" it from editing or deletion on their behalf.

I certainly should have thought to declare the 'hiring' on the talk page. (For the record, the only other work I've ever been paid for concerning Wikipedia was an external research project on categorization, which did not involve any editing.)

<dd>Ah, ok, thanks. I was afraid that I, as a relatively new editor (though fairly long-time browser/reader), was overlooking some obvious reason why this article deserved to be kept. I'm relieved to find that my judgement skills are not <i>that</i> badly flawed.&#160;:) I'm no longer puzzled, and agree that nothing inappropriate happened, since this was a while ago, and you gave them fair warning.

<p>This article keeps getting recreated. I nominated it previously for deletion (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Spanish_Group_Films_997c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spanish Group Films">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spanish Group Films</a>) and it was early closed with a speedy delete. It was recreated and eventually protected, but then the protection page was deleted, and now it's been recreated again. Let's settle this by giving it the full AfD run.

<li>Thanks for visiting the site. Obviously you liked it, and hopefully you watched some of the movies. That is the updates page, and is not a "claim to fame." It is simply a place for our fans to see what is new with the site. Oh, and I think it's pathetic when an adult man edits and deletes wikipedia articles. Especially if the group is working their way up, because you clearly don't know what that's like. So instead of going out and being with people, you edit an encyclopedia.

<p>This is not a hoax in any way. This is simply noticing a WORTHY group, as they have put much energy and work into these projects. If what you are saying below is true, then you are discriminating articles by the age of the writer. Check IP adresses for visits to the site. There are many visits to the site from different places. How come this is not a valid article? What could make this company recieve "accreditation" from your super educated administrators so that this group can be realized? I guess I can understand how this could be a way for you people to make up for the fact that none of you have ever done something notable in your life, but lets be reasonable. Why don't you delete the 20th Century Fox article? Because it's a corporation and makes millions? Or because they have made hundreds of films? Isn't that unfair descrimination? If this article is continually recreated, what does that tell you about the will of this group and how important it is to others around it? You should understand that this was not thought up in one school day, nor is it a joke. It is a legitamate company on the rise, but all you see is amateur filmmaking, and that is what you base it on. By continually deleting this article, you are smashing the dreams of the founders of the company, and are disappointing everyone in the town of Somers, CT. And you should realize that you can continually delete the article, but the it is always going to be recreated. Because that is how important this group is to people that have dreams, something you should learn from as you sit on your couch and laugh at other people's work. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.209.25.80 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.209.25.80.html" title="User talk:72.209.25.80">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.209.25.80_c1a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.209.25.80">contribs</a>) 14:51, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Keep Spanish Group Films. It seems to have lasted a long enough time on wikipedia anyway. You would save your sorry selves time and energy blocking all the people that add refrences to the group, and deleting all the articles that are made about the group. Think about it. It's completely understandable that a group wants to get proper recognition. And the site is in no way advertising. It is giving the facts about the founders and controllers of the company, which is wrong how? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustfor52_944c.html" title="User:Justfor52">Justfor52</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustfor52_d87c.html" title="User talk:Justfor52">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Justfor52_15f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Justfor52">contribs</a>) 15:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So what you are basing this entire argument on is the fact that Spanish Group Fims is not online through a valid source. Which means that the only way a topic can be included into Wikipedia is to have it be online. So what you are implying is that everything worth mentioning can be found online, which you know as well as I do, is certainly not true. If public popularity and mainstream is a necessity of topics, then mention that somewhere in your fance guideline articles. But there are things out there that don't need to be writen about online for them to be important or worthy of mention. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.209.25.80 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.209.25.80.html" title="User talk:72.209.25.80">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.209.25.80_c1a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.209.25.80">contribs</a>) 15 November 2006 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> No. All our articles must contain only material that has been published by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Spanish Group Films. In response to the above comments, I would like to add, what is needed for a topic to be "worthy of mention"? What I understand from reading the above comments is that Wikipedia is not the encyclopedia for topics that are <i>important</i>, but rather for the topics that get the most promotions. This is not how the system should be based, and I am sure that Spanish Group Films is not the only one who has pleaded this case. However, I would also like to ask how much of a limit is put on Wikipedia? Is there a limit to the amount of articles that can be put on? I understand where your administrative views are coming, but I also believe that an encyclopedia presents to you facts on whatever you would like to know about, and I know of many people who would like very much to kow about Spanish Group Films. Isn't that a reliable enough source? 72.10.100.204 19:37, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Guys, I'm really sorry, but there's only so much advice we can give you. Please take your time to read and re-read the policies <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> has directed you to above. They explain things fair better than we can, that's what they're there for. The one last thing I can suggest you do is to take a look at some of the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a>. Pay particular attention to the "references" or "footnotes" section. These <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> sources such as books, scientific journals, respected current affairs websites and newspaper and magazine articles. There is no way that any of these will have covered <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=SpanishGroupFilms" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=SpanishGroupFilms" rel="nofollow">your home movies</a>. Finally, yes, there <i>is</i> a limit to the amount of information that can be stored on Wikipedia. Wikipedia exists on very real computer servers, that are paid for by <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising" class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising" rel="nofollow">real money</a>.

<p>A collection of largely random things - a small one at present, but it appears to be only just starting. Though I can see why some might consider this list a good idea, it will be almost totally unmanageable; either things named only directly after rivers are to be included, or things indirectly named after them can be added as well. If the latter is the case, this list will soon become of impossioble size: how many things in the US are named Missouri something, Mississippi something, Ohio something, or Arkansas soomething? They are named after the states, which are named after the rivers - therefore, things like Ohio University are indirectly named after rivers. On the other hand, if only things <i>directly</i> named after rivers are to be added, we veer towards OR territory (how do you tell whether something in Sacramento is named after the city or the river?) and are also still in the realms of the enormous - bridges, schools, shipping companies, towns, you name it. In its present form, I don't see anyway this could ever approach being an encyclopedic article, and to attempt to limit the meaning of the title will define it out of practical use. As such, sadly, this appears to be unlikely to be anything other than a <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 04:25, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The original Internet Book Database article (as you can see from that discussion) was written when the site was beta testing and has come a long way since then. The reason I vote for keep is that this is a significant effort for the book community unlike the earlier efforts mentioned above and does deserve mention in the Wikipedia. The site has nearly a 1000 inlinks from external sources(according to yahoo siteexplorer) and that is IMO a good achievement for a site whose domain was registered in Feb. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavenhelllord_de3a.html" title="User:Heavenhelllord">Heavenhelllord</a> 16:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not have a provision for "growing quickly".

There are no book related websites that offer such a large listing of both fiction and non-fiction of all genres. There are no other sites that I know of that offer a combination book database/social networking aspect. There are other features unique to ibookdb such as finding other versions of books. The site is notable for it's content and usefulness to the book community.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have requested on the talk page for the article that the author provide references mentioned on the associated webpage for related articles shown there as clippings from "Furrow" magazine, "Progressive Farmer" and some unidentified newspaper. Those would go a ways toward satisfying notability. The title is cumbersome and overly specific. Info about the demonstration sawdust fueled boiler could be added to the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biofuel.html" title="Biofuel">Biofuel</a> article in the history section, if the deletion here is successful. I do not feel that an article having one author is any ground whatsoever for deletion, and if it is by the founder of the company, who knows the subject better? Likewise there is no ground for deleting an article because its author has not written other articles. Don't bite the newbie, since he could probably add to the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biomass.html" title="Biomass">Biomass</a> article, the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biofuel.html" title="Biofuel">Biofuel</a> article and other farming and energy related articles. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The entry meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> based on criterion #9, "Has won or placed in a major music competition." As mentioned in the entry, the band placed in the 2004 "Shake Stuff Up" competition (sponsored by Rolling Stone magazine, the Got Milk? campaign, and MTV) as the winner for the state of Massachusetts. Also, <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> is incorrect in stating that the band hasn't made an album yet. The band released "We Have No White Flags" in 2005. The 8-track release was briefly circulated independently before being picked up by Blue Duck Records. The album is distributed throughout New England in the United States as well as being readily available for international purchase online through various retailers. The album is also distributed in Japan exclusively by online retailer STM, whose label is scheduling a 2007 Japanese release of the band's forthcoming album (to be released in the USA on November 28). The band has also toured extensively around New England since 2003. The band's cable television debut (also mentioned in the entry) was on the Steelroots program on <a href="../../../i/n/s/INSP_Networks_1ee1.html" title="INSP Networks">INSP</a>, which wikipedia cites as reaching 21 million homes. The program itself has a viewership of 7 million. The band has also been featured on several major New England radio stations, including Boston giant <a href="../../../w/f/n/WFNX_4bd5.html" title="WFNX">WFNX</a>, as well as a host of college radio stations across the United States.

<dd>An EP isn't an album, so they haven't released an album yet, and the album they will release is on a very small label. I don't think the "Shake Stuff Up" can count as a "major music competition" (compare to the "Major Music Award", which is of the level of Grammy and Mercury Prize: a Major Music Competition should be something like the Eurovision Song Contest, or Idol (yep, it's bad, but it's a major bad thing anyway). This is clearly a minor music competition: being sponsored by Rolling STone and MTV is completely different from being organised by them.

<li><b>Comment</b> This film has been "upcoming" for more than a year now and still there is no confirmation from the studio. Production may have been anounced but this page does not cite it at all, the <a href="http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7260" class="external text" title="http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7260" rel="nofollow">first reference</a> states the name but they also state that Jensen Ackles is in talks for the lead role which <a href="http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_10006.html" class="external text" title="http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_10006.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> says has never happened, it also says that the title is in no way confirmed to be "Afterlife", that may yet be the name of the third film. The link to where Ali Later says the film is in preproduction leads to a homepage on Resident Evil but I have been unable to find anywhere on the site where she mentions this film. Some of the other links also lead to no where or repeat another link. The references are total speculation. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirelement85_a27d.html" title="User:Firelement85">Firelement85</a> 03:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>First of all the Street Vendor Project, Vendy awards is a New York City sponsored public program run by Urban Justice <a href="http://www.urbanjustice.org/ujc/projects/street.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.urbanjustice.org/ujc/projects/street.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> therefore winning the Vendy Awards is notable since it is a public program of New York City. A statement of "street vendors" in my town has also won an award is irrelavent since NYC is among the most notable cities in the world. Also this article pass notability and is not a self promotion since it has been cited by multiple indepedent sources. I will go over a list of citations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1. Chicken and Rice is an integral part of student life at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a>. It is a major hot spot for food among NYU students. <a href="http://www.nyunews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/11/02/45499fc3d45d0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyunews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/11/02/45499fc3d45d0" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></li>
<li>2. The stabbing involved was directly related to the food served by the vendor. The lines can grow so long that a person stab another person for "cutting in line". Name me another food stand that can do this. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/466625p-392516c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/466625p-392516c.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a></li>
<li>3. Chicken and Rice has won a notable award from a public service of New York City. It is has been cited as <i>"uniting the Muslim community from the tri-state area and beyond in their search for halal food"</i> <a href="http://streetvendor.netfirms.com/public_html/staticpages/index.php?page=20051021224336800" class="external autonumber" title="http://streetvendor.netfirms.com/public_html/staticpages/index.php?page=20051021224336800" rel="nofollow">[36]</a></li>
<li>4. As both a Wikipedia editor with a good history and a customer of Chicken and Rice, I can be a primary source to this event. All of the information on the page is true minus the POV comments. The food itself is amazing and is more notable than even the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grease_Trucks_8ebf.html" title="Grease Trucks">Grease Trucks</a> and can generate unbelievable lines. <a href="http://www.gridskipper.com/travel/new-york/best-street-food-53rd-and-6th-avenue-206492.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gridskipper.com/travel/new-york/best-street-food-53rd-and-6th-avenue-206492.php" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> I live in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton%2C_New_Jersey_b719.html" title="Princeton, New Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a> and have travelled countless times to NYC just for a platter.

<li><b>Response</b> One can use a primary source to establish facts, just not for establishing notability. Many of the statement in that article can be sourced by simply going to Chicken and Rice.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have restored my former edit. I stated that Wikipedia is not a vote, because a few editors were saying the same thing. The reason why I said "Before anyone votes please read through this response" is because I tried by best to disprove many of the reasons why this article was nominated in the first place. I cited sources to disprove WP:OR and that this article was WP:V. I wanted to put an emphysis on what I said which is why asked people to read my comment. However this statement was irrelevant to the debate which is why I removed it not because I was trying to hide something. Also my statement about being busy with school was because I initially did not have time to edit the Chicken and Rice article so I was hoping someone else could, however I did so anyways, which is why I removed that statement as well. Because of issues unrelated to this AfD I was forced to put it back in. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 17:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> I have only asked for the opinion of EveryKing and Easyas12c. My calling for Easyas12c was more because he is an inclusionist, however I did not ask him to say keep, just what he felt given the circumstances, however for Everyking, it was completely neutral. I wasn't asking Mailer Diablo for an opinion on the AfD itself, just who he felt had the stronger argument. In fact you have asked me for my opinoin for several AfD as well, it happens all the time. I see nothing wrong with asking for notable Wikipedia editors for opinions, it is not the same asking sockpuppets and random people. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 20:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If a push cart is a New York landmark then apparently I haven't missed much which I find strange given what I have otherwise heard of New York as a great place to visit. Seriously, am I the only one who finds this devotion to a food cart a little too much? I can understand they serve great food but this is just an odd AfD when you really think about it. But that is just my two cents, you can disregard them if you disagree.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with MartinDK. While this article is now less POV in tone, it's still just an article about a food cart. I'm trying to imagine what would happen if every popular local mobile food vendor in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico_City_fae1.html" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> or wherever were to get their own Wikipedia article. Can I write a page documenting the history of my friendly neighbourhood <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_cream_van.html" title="Ice cream van">ice cream van</a>?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I disagree, all POV references have been removed, the article most certainly establish notability as there was both a stabbing over the food because of the demand and the nomination for top 4 food cart's in New York City. This article was nominated for POV and OR and based off my reading both have been removed. Also, what do you mean just a food cart? <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnathan_Wendel_90df.html" title="Johnathan Wendel">Johnathan Wendel</a> is "just" video game player, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Carl_Roberts_4210.html" title="Charles Carl Roberts">Charles Carl Roberts</a> is "just" a murderer, and the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellesley_College_Senate_bus_dfc6.html" title="Wellesley College Senate bus">Wellesley College Senate bus</a> is "just" a bus. Are you suggesting that food carts can not have articles despite notability claims? Of course a small cart in Shanghai won't get an article unless it establishes notability. If that cart in Shanghai is rank one of the best food carts in China then it most certainly deserves an article. Wikipedia is not bias. Simpleerob 22:43, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firstly, AFD is not a vote. It looks like one, it has a lot in common with one, but it isn't a vote. It's an attempt to achieve a consensus decision, or failing that, to measure community feeling. The closing admin uses the page to make a decision, considering first the weight of argument, and then perhaps the weight of numbers. Mistakes happen, which is why <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> exists. The raw numbers are a part of the process, sometimes they they are even the major part of it, but it's not a vote.</dd>
<dd>Regarding this specific page, <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_cart.html" title="Food cart">food cart</a>. Most of this article should be chopped, but there are things in there that are not in food cart, such as a description of how the cart works, typical food. Maybe the bit about customer demographics and probably the stabbing. I think there is enough mentions of Chicken and Rice to earn it a line in 'food cart' but not an entire article of its own.

<li><b>Delete</b> for a lack of verifiability (Google gives pages in Spanish and Japanese for some reason). Certainly there's no indication that the league cited in the article exists, and what little I can muddle out from the Spanish sources suggests that they're using the term in some other way. Calling it something made up in school one day is perhaps a bit harsh, but it doesn't seem to have much currency in the wider world. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:55, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well that was the aim, if you read the discussion you will see I asked if other people had seen it. That way, I would be able to get help finding the sources. Because as written in the article, it is not yet extremely popular. However, if other people had seen it, they too would find sources. Also, are you aware of Google's indexing process? It takes quite awhile to actually have a site enter the database, as a result, with Footbasket only being given regular air-time recently, the site would probably not be indexed yet. As scary as it may be, google does not know all the secrets, including the meaning of life.

<li>'Ah, can I have an article about my new game Headball hoping that more people will add sources without me having to prove its notability or even existence?' Oh, I wasn't aware that other people had played this game, other people around the world, other people from a variety of backgrounds. But sure, if this game has been aired on international television, then post it. But wait, that's right, it hasn't been aired on international television, so I think your argument is flawed there. But as you are speaking with ad captandum, I think I shall ignore your arguments altogether.
<p>Just a question, when did Google become the be all and end all? I realise that yes, it's a good search engine, but I wasn't aware it was everything. But to follow the logic of my friend over here, as a google search for my thesis on certain topics reveals no hits, does that mean the topic does not exist?</p>
<p>Finally mate, it's a bit hard to make a 'made in school' notion when you don't attend school, wouldn't you say? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Quillandpaper73 (<a href="../../../q/u/i/User_talk%7EQuillandpaper73_ec90.html" title="User talk:Quillandpaper73">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quillandpaper73_68d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quillandpaper73">contribs</a>) 10:41, 13 November 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Uhh, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make about Google being the end-all be-all. Google is a search engine, plain and simple. If something as well known as, say, a publicly broadcast sport is documented somewhere on the Internet, chances are, Google will find it.

<li>I do believe there is a key difference between 'it is classed under things made up in school one day' and 'probably made up in school one day'. Sure, to the experienced person, it may read the same. But for someone new who only knows the rules, it reads as claiming I am a juvenile seeking to cause havoc. And as the wiki ettiquite guidelines go, you should be clear to newcomers, I'm sorry I expected such behaviour here.</li>

<dd>Actually, all that is present in the article is the same that you would see accompanying advertisements for a drug, such as the accompanying full page of small print text that comes with an ad for a new birth control patch or low-dose pill, etc. "Edit if you are capable"-- requires some scientific knowledge and a COMPLETE re-write. Is anyone ready, willing and able to do such a complete re-write? And just because there is a portion of scientific information included in the article, does that justify an article blatantly promoting a brand-name product by the brand-name? The name of this article is a commercial product, which might not even be a notable commercial product. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 00:58, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> All of these hoaxes share one thing... the author seems to be able to write articles without sources after which he/she explains on the talk that the article must not be deleted yet because sources are still being looked for. Also, he/she consistently tries to convince us that Google can't be used. Apparently the author posses some kind of magical ability to write articles without knowing the sources. Well, where did the information come from then?

<li><b>Delete</b> Article makes no attempt at establishing notability and a google search turns up zilch. The above confirmation letter, regardless if it is actually from Madhavan, adds nothing substantial to this discussion to establish the film's notability. Feel free to bring the article back once the film has actually been released with some independent links attesting to its notoriety. As an aside, is it possible that Mr Madhavan was once a civil servant in Nigeria? <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 21:41, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've searched the entire net for hours and I have not come across ANY article that provides mention of this film. Also note that all these articles provide the same trivia as <i>Hello Zindagi</i>, <i><a href="../../../a/a/v/Aaval.html" title="Aaval">Aaval</a></i> and <i>Yaaravan Nalam</i>, that is that these so called "films" are being shot at a budget of <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupee.html" title="Rupee">Rs.</a> 30 million and these articles have been created on the same day. These articles have also been created in a mere gap of 13 minutes by the same person, which is bound to raise suspicion. I suspect the article has been purposely created - pure fancruft.

<p>Contested prod: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for crystal balls. Please add all referenced material to the main Nine Inch Nails article, and only create a new article when at least the title of the album is known. Prod contested because the article does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and does not contain speculation. In my view, it violates at least the spriti of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and the article will become utterly useless once the album will have a name and be released, thus making this a news report / crystal ball hybrid and not a timeless encyclopedia article. All artists are regularly known to say that they are "working on a new album" (and the same goes for writers, film directors, ...): that doesn't mean that we should create articles for them. We don't know who will collaborate, what will be the title, which tracks will be on it, ... Specifically for this article, the info on the tour is unrelated, the info on the unreleased tracks of "with teeth" is probably incorrect in that we have no later info that indeed any of thees tracks will apear on this, another, or no album. There will be an album, hopefully in 2007: why not just add this to the main NIN article and be done ith it? Notice also the so far uncontested prod's Untitled Green Day album and Untitled Dream Theater album, created by the same editor. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:55, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Agree with nom: once all the speculation is removed, there's nowhere near enough to justify a full article yet.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm not categorically opposed to articles on upcoming albums; if there's a track list or significant information out there, that's fine. However, in this case the album <i>doesn't even have a title yet.</i> The whole article could be summed up in one sentence on the Nine Inch Nails article: "Nine Inch Nails is purported to be working on a new, as-of-yet untitled, album due out sometime in 2007" --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:26, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As per a recent interview with director <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanjay_Gadhvi_c4dc.html" title="Sanjay Gadhvi">Sanjay Gadhvi</a>, he has clearly stated <i>"I am not making another Dhoom after this"</i>. He has also said that <i>"In fact, a Dhoom 3 hasn’t yet been planned. Like any producer would do, <a href="../../../a/d/i/Aditya_Chopra_96cf.html" title="Aditya Chopra">Adi</a> is not thinking too far ahead and wants to see the response to <a href="../../../d/h/o/Dhoom_2.html" title="Dhoom 2">Dhoom 2</a> before planning another film. And had I been the producer I would have had different directors for every two Dhoom films. How differently can I shoot a chat between <a href="../../../a/b/h/Abhishek_Bachchan_6292.html" title="Abhishek Bachchan">Abhishek</a> and <a href="../../../u/d/a/Uday_Chopra_0669.html" title="Uday Chopra">Uday</a>? As for me, like the game of soccer, I want to change directions... I would rather make a family drama next."</i>. This is concrete evidence that the film has not been confirmed and the director has NO plans of directing the next film even if there is one, which hasn't even been planned yet.

<li>Why are personal interviews considered an established source in every other aspect of literature then? While burden of proof is on the user, it simply cannot be said "these are unverifiable." Reasons for this accusation must be made so it can then be shown it is not true. Keep in mind sources are only needed for something that might be up for debate in the article. Much of the article is not update for debate, however, and need not a reference to be proven while it can be be viewed by the user themselves (thus the referencing of the subject twice) Placing an impossible to reach burden of proof simply to strive for articles deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXander756_26ec.html" title="User:Xander756">Xander756</a> (<a href="../../../x/a/n/User_talk%7EXander756_e344.html" title="User talk:Xander756">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xander756_881f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xander756">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please sign your comments. It's not an impossible burden of proof. One simply needs a source discussing the matter that is well-acknowledged as a source of valid information, such as a newspaper, or magazine. <i>personal</i> inteviews fail this requirement because there's no means of verifying they happened. Other kinds of interviews, such as formal interviews by a magazine, or any sort of documented and beckcheckable source would be accepted. No one here is claiming the interview didn't happen, or that anything said in it was untrue, it's just there's no way for any other editor to use the interview to check information cited. That's important to wikipedia because it's an encyclopedia edited by numerous users who work together to fact check things. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 16:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Since you are not aware of what a personal interview explains, I will tell you here. A personal interview explains the method of interview. This does not mean it was informal and it does not mean it was not conducted by a magazine. MLA style of citation does not require that these things are made known. Odd that you would declare wikipedia above the level of MLA citation! In fact, magazine "The Maverick" is cited within article as well and you neglect to mention that. Keep in mind what was said in another comment of mine, citation is only needed for facts that may be disputable. Numbers of something, dates, rankings. These things are all indeed cited. Claims that citations are needed for things that do not need to be cited show lack of knowledge. <a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXander756_26ec.html" title="User:Xander756">Xander756</a><sup>(<a href="../../../x/a/n/User_talk%7EXander756_e344.html" title="User talk:Xander756">User_talk:Xander756</a>)</sup> 12:14, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You misunderstand. It doesn't matter whether it's true, or whether you can say things about its contents, what matters is that some other person could look it up, and backtrack the various claims to their sources. Most of the time people don't, the ability to is a requirement for references. Otherwise the claims made through them are no more meaningful than arbitrarily declaring "I have the biggest stack of matresses in a residential environment". It may be true, and I personally may be able to verify it, but no one else can. <i>That</i> is the reason why personal interviews are problematic. Secondly, I <i>did</i> check all your links, and "maverick" is owned by you, and is a personal site, not a well read publication. Since it mentions that the maker of "Alex's DBZ RPG" is also the writer of the article in question, this is also evidence of violating <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>, but that's another issue, and nothing to do with the article in question.
<dl>
<dd>"I have the biggest stack of mattresses..." is completely different than articles subject. Nowhere in article does creator of site claim anything. The article was not written by someone associated with the site. Nor was "The Maverick". Affiliation with ADBZRPG does NOT mean site creators are same. Look at list of ADBZRPGs affiliates. By your logic, Alex must be the owner of all of these sites! You seem to neglect to read things that disprove your points and skim sources for things that vaguely may. Writer of the article in question? <b>Compiled By</b>: Alexander Hinkley. Compiled specifically means they were <b>not</b> written by this person.

<li><b>comment</b> Your reference to the talk page misinterprets the quote. "Games like Everquest" refers to the genre of MMORPGing and games similiar to that of Everquest which did not begin to gain popularity until around the time site was created.

<li>Everquest wasn't the first MMORPG either - not by a long shot. MUDs date back into the late 1970s.

<li>1,000 members is still not all that many. Articles have been deleted on web forums with thirty times as many users - Genmay, for example. Member count really doesn't mean much until you get into the hundred-thousand range, and even <i>that</i> can be debatable.

<li><b>comment</b> Must be educated on the genre of game we are talking about to know 1,000 members if phenomenal. Do you not think best of a genre is note worthy? Aware that some genres may be so small it would not matter but if you are to search wikipedia thoroughly, you will find dozens of articles about indie rpgs and their importance as well as mmorpgs, roleplaying, and the mission to make these things more noteable on wikipedia itself. Keep in mind the history of the game as well. Since this summer 1,000 members. There are online games with far less of a member base than this game still on wikipedia. Linked tracker refers UNIQUE HITS FROM SEARCH ENGINES! Would be impossible to receive 42 google hits and 600 "click throughs".</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> no, that's simply not true. Your claim that it's the "Best of a genre" is unprovable, and uncited. Second you misunderstand what "google hits" means. That's the number of TOTAL PAGES which mention the subject(found by google). It has nothing to do with how many people click this or that, just a measure of how noteworth it is in the context of other internet sites. For comparison "Everquest" gets 15,900,000 hits, and everquest is not even web-based(internet based, but not web) <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 16:41, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That is incorrect. Citation within article proves that it is the top ranked of the genre. I do not know why you say it is uncited...seems every argument made so far has been on fallicious reasoning. You've refused to share your sources for the information you are using to prosecute so how can anything you say be disproven when it seems to be made up off the top of your mind without any evidence? <a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXander756_26ec.html" title="User:Xander756">Xander756</a><sup>(<a href="../../../x/a/n/User_talk%7EXander756_e344.html" title="User talk:Xander756">User_talk:Xander756</a>)</sup> 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not sure what "facts" I have to prove, and google stuff you can just check yourself., and as I've said, I did check your links, and, among other concerns, "ultimatetopsites", which I'm assuming is the reference in question, as you didn't specify, is not a noted authority on the subject, nor has it been updated in nearly 5 years. None of this is "off the top of my head" either. The things I'm mentioning are part of wikipedia policy. Articles are to verifiable, and it's generally accepted that they be notable as well, by a defined set of guidelines. The policy pages in question may be found at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>(for this one also see <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li>Google stuff? This is why in a court trial evidence must be submitted to make an accusation. I've "googled stuff" and came up with different responses. I would like to know how one could arrive at yours is what I'm asking. Yes I have read the pages you are linking me, too. Site is complient. Ignorance of site content and nature does not make it uncomplient. Comment about your "hasn't been updated in 5 years" was also false! Right on bottom of referenced page states "Last Update: November 14 2006, 6:13 PM PT". This is the 3rd time you have expressed a conclusion that was either false, or hidden behind a shroud of secrecy whereas others cannot duplicate your results.

<p>This article makes no assertion of notability. A Google search of the book title yields 13 hits, which suggests that the controversy (if there is any) has escaped everyone's attention. A Google search of his name reveals plenty of people named Aaron Anderson, but I saw more hits for a man fleeing a warrant in Minnesota than this fellow. To boot, the article is completely unreferenced save for a link to his website, which is how I ran across in the first place. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 14:13, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Israeli_shelling_of_Beit_Hanoun_0efc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Israeli shelling of Beit Hanoun">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Since a number of people are trying to confuse this issue!</b></span></h4>
<p>The facts in the case are:<br />
<b>#1</b> - The original article, <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beit_Hanoun_November_2006_incident_5c8a.html" title="Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident">Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident</a>, was created at 13:06. NINE HOURS LATER, Striver comes along and creates a fork. There is zero possible chance he didn't know the original article existed, yet instead of editing on the original article, he created a fork. It strains the bounds of credulity to try to presume he was not creating an illegal POV fork as defined in wikipedia's policies.</p>
<p><b>#2</b> - I nominated this based on that principle.</p>
<p><b>#3 - The idea that the content of a highly POV forked article should be merged into the original article directly contradicts our NPOV policies.</b></p>
<p>Now, to the other items at hand: In reading the responses and checking the userpages of the editors in question, it appears that Striver, Bhaisaab, Nielswik, Puddleman, Truthspreader, Palestine48 (counting those I've identified so far) are all either (a) members of a POV-pushing group on Wikipedia that calls themselves "The Muslim Guild" or else have strong POV biases in the Palestine conflict that they are trying to push. I do not consider it an unreasonable assumption that they are even going so far as to try to "stuff" this AFD by calling in friends to vote for them, seeing as only Striver and Nielswik have any connection to the page in question. This is behavior that Wikipedia very much frowns upon and I again believe it strains the bounds of credulity to try to assume there is good faith involved when editors like this are saying things like "<i>showing the atrocities committed by the Israeli government</i>" is their goal for the article in question. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox and obvious propaganda, which is all that the POV fork up for deletion is, ought to be excised as quickly as possible. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 15:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, a note to Striver: your demand for an apology is <b>denied</b>. AGF does not require that I ignore the resounding evidence in front of my eyes. A 9-hour gap between the creation of the article, when the article was edited heavily, and when the article was being edited by <b>other members of your guild</b> like Nielswik, it seems to me almost impossible that you somehow did not know of its existence. I am stating, for the record: I believe that as per AGF, your behavior strains the bounds so far that I can not assume you are operating in good faith. If you can convince me otherwise, fine, but the creation of a POV fork so late after the other article was created, and the pushing of obvious propaganda statements as well as copyright violation images, and the concurrent statements by your own guildmates indicating that the whole purpose of your POV fork is to be as negative to the Israeli side of the issue as possible, shows me that it was a bad-faith creation. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 15:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>as per below that title (esp. the word 'incident') is a revolting euphemism for the slaughter of innocent civilians. it is highly POV &amp; everyone supporting it knows very well that people would take issue with it. <i>this</i> article was created afterwards with a purely descriptive title in an attempt to redress that mistake per per 'npov' &amp; naming conventions. obviously the other article should be merged on these grounds. then 'debate' about content can proceed (it's not relevant here). furthermore the nomminator's biases and prejudices are amply demonstrated in his/her refusal to acknowledge this problem and in the above hypocrisy about other users spreading "propaganda". clearly these are all reasons for terminating this process &amp; allowing a purely procedural merge to go ahead.&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 16:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yawn. Don't insult my intelligence. If you have a problem with the title of an article, you hold a discussion on the title of the article on the article's page.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have just completed some major cleanup of the article (including references), and I have to say that unless someone points the NPOV violations out to me I can't see any - all the references (with the possible exception of the Gush Shalom article which I suspect is likely not to qualify under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>), seem to be from reputable sources, and no statements made in the article are taken out of context. This article is now better sourced and contains a good degree more information than <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beit_Hanoun_November_2006_incident_5c8a.html" title="Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident">Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident</a>, all of it verifiable. The only question that remains in my mind is whether it is encyclopaedic (at the moment it seems to be more of a news article, but it has become an increasing trend on Wikipedia for events in the news to develop rapidly). I'd like to see some other unbiased editors opinions on this (I am neither pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian, or anti-American), since it appears to be almost exclusively users with strong views on this conflict editing here. <a href="../../../q/m/u/User%7EQmunkE_1841.html" title="User:QmunkE">QmunkE</a> 21:30, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The search in your link finds all pages with the words "Quake", "Lost", and "Marine" in any portion of the text (including more than 120,000 on the subject of various real-world earthquakes).

<dd>That goes more to weighing notability than determining verifiability, and you'll note that lower down in the article, there is a bit about self-published sources being acceptable. The policy itself is defined in the three points at the top of the article, not the discussion below, and it only requires reliable sources. Sometimes the most reliable source is the people who made it. Doesn't matter in this case though, at most I'd say it's an EL candidate, maybe a section in another article, but not one itself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:49, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>weak delete</b>. The policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires that information be verifi<i>able</i>; it does not require that sources be in the article itself. In this case, basic details about the mod can be sourced to the mod's web site. They also have coverage by a third party in <a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Zone_d18c.html" title="PC Zone">PC Zone</a> magazine (visible on the website). If an article is lacking sources, AFD is not the right place—tag it for cleanup or fix it. Only if there is no reasonable possibility that sources exist (<i>i.e.</i>, it is unverifi<i>able</i>) is that a criterion for deletion. That said, this mod doesn't appear to be finished and doesn't seem to be particularly notable, so I do think it is unencyclopedic on those grounds. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 00:27, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I posted this in response for Wickethewok for deleting everything ever mentioned about me throughout Wikipedia in a whole, which all is notable and proven with sources, though I've noticed before the deletion of such pages, someone editing the page deleting the sources, saying that even those weren't viable sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am the creator of the Quake II: Lost Marine project and it has been brought to my attention your request for deletion. As well as all other references to me within Wikipedia that users have created. I share a network with 15 other people which some have created and edited these articles about me and my professional career.</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense after reading your discussions with other admins that you say the articles you had deleted have no notability or you can't find any resources. I believe you to be in the wrong by doing this, and I do feel this has been a personal attack. Articles that I'm aware of that you had deleted.</p>
<p>Thearrel 'Kiltron' McKinney Quake II: Lost Marine The Mean Arena Futrix Studios (not 100% sure on that)</p>
<p>As well as any links to any other mentions of me or my works within other Wikipedia articles. You aren't doing very thorough research to request the deletion of information about other professionals and their careers. For example, Quake II: Lost Marine is a mod for DOOM 3 (currently) and not for Quake 4. What research tells you this mod is available for Quake 4? It isn't, it's only available for DOOM 3 and is being ported to Quake 4. So the removal of the link to the mod or article from the DOOM 3 article and relisted in the Quake 4 article is invalid on your part. I could understand maybe 1 or 2 things being removed for your lack of research, but to remove me completely from Wikipedia as a whole is no doubt vendictive, intentional, and a personal attack. Especially when every instance mentioned and all articles are valid articles that all have notability and all sources can be sited. Type any one of those into Google and you're guaranteed to have them at the top of the list. The articles were 100% accurate and true and valid. You're not doing a very professional nor thorough job editing Wikipedia when it's obvious you aren't doing the right research. Do you even know my professional history or the companies I've worked with, or for or the games I have worked on? Probably not, so you felt it necessary to delete everything about me mentioned. Or there is another motive which I'll be glad to look into. Thanks.</p>

<li><b>Keep This Article</b> Why is there no notability? I'm not understanding this? It's plastered all over the internet this mod is. It has it's own site, it's been featured on major gaming news sites, it's been in several issues of PC ZONE Magazine and published on the DVD's etc. It was at QuakeCon in 2005 and it's been well perceived by the DOOM 3 community and it's widely known. For one person to come by and say, well I'm deleting it cause I don't feel it's notable is pure rubbish. If you're going to delete this article you might as well go the long hall and delete all of DOOM 3's mod articles. As well as other mod's for other games I see on Wikipedia that aren't even actually released and were flat out canceled. Those are the things you should be deleting. Speaking of industry sources, how can someone say they can't find anything on the website? That's bull as well and when there were sources cited in this article including the PC ZONE issues and articles themselves to proof these, some idiot deleted those as well thus making no viable magazine sources. The mod has had widespread coverage. What more can be proven? It's not on your HDD so it don't belong on Wikipedia? Personal vendetta? What? Wikipedia hire some new admins that do real research and base articles on real research not on what that individual just feels belongs. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.36.87.172 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.36.87.172_d264.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.36.87.172">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Proof was added when the article was created from the start but some deletionist said the proven sources weren't valid and removed them way back. Basically saying PC ZONE and such articles did not exist nor does the person who created the mod. If the person that created the mod does not exist then how is it they can be found everywhere on the net and their name is tacked onto it as it's creator? Plus the articles are right there on the mod's website. Anyone who decides to delete article ever take the time to email someone and ask them personally about it? That may help a lot. Pure craziness.</li>

<p>I already nominated this one for deletion as original research on a subculture which fails notability, etc. It got deleted on 5/11 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Scene_(subculture)" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Scene_(subculture)" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>after an AfD filled with sockpuppetry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Scene_%28subculture%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Scene_%28subculture%29" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. Then it was recreated, still without sources, etc. So I am nominating it again. The following is distilled from my original nomination, which still largely applies:</p>
<p>This is a terrible article about an alleged subculture, which is actually just a flattering name for 'trendiness'...There have not, as far as I can see from Google, been sociological studies of 'scene' as there have of goth, punk, metal, etc. In short, this is not a verifiable topic, it is probably just a slang word of a particular sort of trendiness, and hence not a valid subject for an encyclopedia article, belonging more properly to a dictionary.</p>
<p>(Note that the term here is not being used as a synonym for 'subculture' (as it sometimes is) but is rather simply cruft written about an alleged subculture, without any claim to notability, verifiability, proof it isn't original research and so forth). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 16:58, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The phrase it uses is "substantially identical".

<li><b>Delete</b> because "Scene" does not describe a specific subculture, but is a term to decribe many movements and subcultures such as the punk scene, art scene, goth scene, etc. What this article describes is the fashion trends associated with specific modern music scenes...Mainly the post-hardcore and emo scenes. This article fails on many levels and makes plenty of contradictions that prove the point that it is written about modern youth trends and subcultures in general but trys to present them as one specific subculture. <a href="../../../r/z/r/User%7ERzrscm_f324.html" title="User:Rzrscm">Rzrscm</a> 17:09, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Add to that the near-complete absence of sources (and those which do exist appear to be primary and often links to offsite copyvios) and we have canonical listcruft: original research with no apparent bar to inclusion, any glimpse however trivial is included. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 17:11, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> A backup college quarterback doesn't warrant an article. Yes he did take over for Colt McCoy when McCoy was injured, <b>BUT</b> he'll be back on the bench as McCoy returns as the starter on Nov. 25, 2006. As long as McCoy stays healthy, he'll be the backup quarterback to McCoy, and McCoy is a redshirt freshman, meaning that he'll be there for the next 3 years. Granted that Snead is a true freshman, who's to say that he won't be beaten out for the #2 spot at quarterback by someone else next year? If that is the case, then would there be a need to put an article on a 3rd string quarterback? I'd vote <b>delete</b> for now, <b>IF</b> however he becomes the <b>permenant starter</b>, THEN there would be a need for this article, at this current point he is not the starter and I stand by my decision to <b>delete</b>. Someone above (&gt;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> brought up the point that Snead is a backup for the reigning national championship college football team, so what? Come 2007, a new champion will be crowned in college football, should we also make articles for the backup quarterback of the 2007 college football team or better yet should we make articles for all of the backup quarterbacks of past national championship college football teams? I think not, as that would be pointless. Like I've said before, <b>IF</b> and <b>WHEN</b> he becomes the permenant starter, go ahead and recreate the article. <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">Abstrakt</a> 00:47, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I see no harm to having articles on back-up quarterbacks if they are well sourced and well written. Besides, his high school accomplishments are notable even if he had never taken a snap in college. As Wikipedia expands, we will naturally have more in-depth coverage of more topics, including more minor figures in sports, politics, music, etc. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 01:12, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Like I said before, <b>IF</b> he were to remain as a backup quarterback to Colt McCoy or be beaten out by someone else next year and never see any playing time again, he would be just that, a high school quarterback who played a couple of games in college. That is why I voted for <b>delete</b>. I mean "minor sports figures" is really pushing it, at this rate we might as well start up articles on high school athletes who didn't go beyond high school. <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">Abstrakt</a> 01:58, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> After reviewing prior nom, there were only two reasons in four&#160;!votes to keep it. Three&#160;!votes were to keep if it could be improved, and the other keep&#160;!vote was in dispute over the Alexa Test, (which I don't know why any AfD editor would use the test given its flaws, but I digress.) In four to five months, there have not been significant edits to the article bringing it in line with WP:WEB or other Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Without a last minute overhaul, or some other reason offered, I think we can reach consensus this time --<span style="border:3px solid #00f;font-weight:bold;background-color:#c00;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk"><span style="color:#fff;">RoninBK</span></a><sub><span style="background-color:#fff;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_Esperanza_3389.html" title="User:Roninbk/Esperanza"><span style="background-color:#0f0;">E</span></a><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">C</a></span></sub></span> 07:01, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This page does seem to be a spin-off from <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history.html" title="Alternate history">Alternate history</a> actually, so it might be intended as an attempt to reduce the size of that article. I agree it wasn't well-done though, and as it stands, the page is lacking in good content. Might be fixable, might not. Not quite willing to vote delete, but I wouldn't oppose a merge back either. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:27, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> A list of links this long would take major maintenance to make sure they are all live - plus would anyone want to scan through this list? Would they use a search engine to achieve the same goal? I agree with the nominator that this is what WP is NOT, but I'm not up on the context of all of them. Is it something which grew because people kept adding their own links? If so, it definitely should go because it will grow into a monster. Reserving judgment. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 23:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Would the interested be opposed to the idea of trimming (per comment of Bubba Hotep) and making more artickly (per Mister.Manticore)? Perhaps listing only those that actually score hits through Alexa.com? The remainder of the list could be moved to the Althistory Wikia, which would be a more suited venue for such a list. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBoLingua_e27f.html" title="User:BoLingua">Bo-Lingua</a> 01:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> I actually went in and removed a lot of the links yesterday of the smaller groups, leaving what I could see were the larger groups as opposed to single author's pages. I think I transferred about 20 links to the AltHistory Wikia. If the links are the problem, I can migrate those with the rest at AltHistory Wikia and we can crosslink to that link page, thus decreasing the "cruft." The rest of the article _is_ useful, though and SHOULD be, somewhere. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBoLingua_e27f.html" title="User:BoLingua">Bo-Lingua</a> 22:17, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think it would be best to keep the article, it's informative about a game that is fairly popular.

<li><b>Keep</b>—Better sources can be found. This is a very popular game, with much information of a non-game nature about it.

<li><b>Question</b> Where can these better sources be found? I looked through several pages of Google results but it turned out quite fruitless, if you know of some please point me in that direction.

<li><i>Strong Keep</i> Gunbound is one of the most popular, if not *the* most popular free online game. It usually has several thousand games going on at any one time. There have been tournaments held as part of a world competition with thousands of dollars in prizes (this can be verified in old news on the official site). As for sources for the article, there is always the handy www.softnyx.net for actual official info, and there are a bunch of sections on MMO sites and GunBound fansites (search for Bunge Holes for a good one). <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKargath64_fa71.html" title="User:Kargath64">Kargath64</a> 01:43, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Granted, the site has a number of media mentions, but these seem due more to the publicity-savviness of the site's creators than to any actual newsworthiness of the site itself. There really is nothing whatsoever to the article so far that wouldn't apply to just about every other moderately-sophisticated web-forum out there. Also, the original wording of the article (plus the username of the creator) suggests that it was planted in WP by one of the site-founders as a means of boosting their search profile.

<p>After a decent amount of review, I have decided that a consensus should be reached regarding the proposed deletion of List of U.S. ticker symbols. The 1st nomination is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_U.S._ticker_symbols_6afa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of U.S. ticker symbols">here</a>.I would also like to make the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_dcb1.html" title="Category:Companies">Category: Companies</a> is the main category for all companies listed on Wikipedia, and there is a subset of that called <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_by_stock_exchange_708b.html" title="Category:Companies by stock exchange">Category:Companies_by_stock_exchange</a>. Within this category are all U.S. Stock exchanges individually, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_e75b.html" title="Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange">Category:Companies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange</a>, etc. Thus, instead of having a list of ticker symbols by country, it makes more sense to seperate the lists by individual exhange. This page should be created in the format of Companies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_(by Symbol) because <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_companies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_bb17.html" title="Category:Lists of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange">there are already categories for stocks listed by company name.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>List of U.S. ticker symbols contains an absurdly large amount of broken links. A quick lookup of many of the symbols indicates that the stock symbol is no longer in use and in addition, many of the companies seem to also no longer exist. I am unfamiliar with the exact source of the content, but it clearly does not match up with the NYSE or NASDAQ listings on wikipedia. There is no reason we shouldn't have this content in the encyclopedia, but in this format it is mostly useless.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I think of any other points, I will list them. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Hamster_ef06.html" title="User:Flying Hamster">Flying Hamster</a> 07:12, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmm, while I don't think this list is particularly good, I can't really get behind the categories approach either. I go into those categories, and it seems like there's several subcategories that really shouldn't be there, since they don't really cover that subject, but are rather related to the company. That's not quite the place for it, and I think it messes up the flow of the pages, which are already bothersome enough. I don't know where the source for this page was either, but it seems that it uses all caps as opposed to the format Wikipedia uses, which explains the number of redlinks. It could probably be more or less fixed with a style-script, but I'm not going to suggest doing that until there's more consensus on how to this thing. I also think that the current way the NYSE companies are listed is poorly done, since it makes over a dozen pages when a single page might be what somebody wants. Though that could be easily solved with adding another page listing every company in the NYSE for example, on it. Anyway, I really think something more constructive than an outright deletion needs to be done, but I'm not ready to propose anything right now myself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:20, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't see your problem with the categories exactly... I also don't understand what you mean when you say that the current way that the NYSE companies are listed makes over a dozen pages... I think that alphabetical sections are appropriate when listing anything of this magnitude. There isn't any need to have a page that itself lists every company in the NYSE when we have <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_e75b.html" title="Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange">this page</a> with <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_companies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_bb17.html" title="Category:Lists of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange">this page</a> linked to from it. Also, salvaging this page will be more difficult than you mention, since a substantial quantity of these links are companies that do not have any wikipedia entry at all, and furthermore may no longer exist. As well as this, this page arbitrarily claims to list all U.S. stock market ticker symbols when seperate pages for each stock market would be far more appropriate. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Hamster_ef06.html" title="User:Flying Hamster">Flying Hamster</a> 04:08, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To illustrate the problem with categories, go to: <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_e75b.html" title="Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange">Category:Companies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange</a> and see the subcatergories. It just seems a little ugly. I think alphabetical listings may have some use, but I'd suggest a combined list for times when you want to search the whole thing at once. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure how <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_e75b.html" title="Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange">Category:Companies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange</a> is ugly besides the fact that it is a category page. It is not dissimilar to other regular category pages. Wikipedia does not currently have any equivalant of Companies_listed_on_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_(by Symbol), or its NASDAQ counterpart, etc, and there is an obvious encyclopedic imperative to first create these listings (which would not be category pages). Wikipedia isn't the place to list databases of symbols based on the nation in which the stock market they are in is located. I think this may be an example of <a href="../../../l/c/_/WP%7ELC_690f.html" title="WP:LC">WP:LC</a> as well as <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> as it seems to fit in with the characterization of the inherant biases in wikipedia to have a list of U.S. only ticker symbols instead of a global list of ticker symbols (not that I would enourage such a cumbersome listing). <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTV_bd6b.html" title="WP:LISTV">WP:LISTV</a> talks about how lists are sometimes used to get past <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and since a large portion of the links that are here are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> and the listing is primarily a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">resource to conduct business</a>, I believe that this is the case for List of U.S. ticker symbols. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Hamster_ef06.html" title="User:Flying Hamster">Flying Hamster</a> 19:54, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I had to think about this one for a bit. Aside from the fact that this list is going to be <i>incredibly</i> difficult to maintain (as evidenced by its current state and the fact that this information changes constantly), I don't think this list makes much sense. If this were a list of stock ticker symbols on the NASDAQ or NYSE, then maybe this works. But a combined list of all US exchanges is less useful. In some cases, a company can have multiple symbols, making this format even less useful. This sort of information is better off in individual lists of symbols for notable stock exchanges (American or otherwise). <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 02:38, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I actually think a combined list is better, since it allows someone who doesn't know what exchange a given company is on to look them up. And I don't see why there's a problem with multiple symbols. Just have them all on there if that's a concern. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:19, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you are going to list a symbol that exists on multiple stock markets on one page, that page should not be a list of U.S. Ticker Symbols, it should be a list of all ticker symbols. However, this approach is prone to unencyclopedic pages that will not be updated and will have a ton of broken links constantly. Currently, this page is of very little use compared with say, finance.yahoo.com, which is a much-used resource for ticker symbol verification in the U.S. Stock Exchanges especially. Keeping an outdated and redundant list is unneccesary. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Hamster_ef06.html" title="User:Flying Hamster">Flying Hamster</a> 04:08, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That a company like yahoo.com is willing to pay people and keep their lists up-to-date and accurate is a natural consequence of Wikipedia is a community-driven approach, as opposed to profit-driven. That's not a good argument, as there are literally thousands of databases with better, more up to date information than Wikipedia. We don't delete articles on sportsteams just because you can find more recent information on them elsewhere. Nor do I understand your comment about a list of all ticker symbols when you have multiple stock markets or multiple symbols. You can still restrict it to markets within the US. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, the reason Yahoo keeps its lists up-to-date and accurate is because they are actively invested in the quality of information on their site because they make a large profit from the verifiability of their information. Secondly, Yahoo outdates wikipedia by many years, and they have always had a reputation for the quality of their economic data and statistics. What you call the community-driven approach of wikipedia is something that I have a deep respect for and understanding regarding. If you are suggesting, however, that wikipedia, because of this non-profit approach, has more accurate information, then you are mistaken. It is an inherant quality of wikipedia to have unreliable information, and this is important for everyone from editors to researchers to understand. In this case, however, the difference in information is aggregious and the updating would be infinitely more intensive than the update of a sports team's roster. Additionaly, I am not proposing a list of all ticker symbols anywhere, I was pointing out the <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> in having a U.S. only listing since there are not canadian exclusive listings, etc. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Hamster_ef06.html" title="User:Flying Hamster">Flying Hamster</a> 19:55, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's at least as encyclopedic as many other articles. It explains the term, where the term comes from and why, and what it refers to. It also explains that it doesn't bar it from legal prosecution and explains that the term doesn't refer specifically to particular acts, although that's what's considered... Given there's no porn, no graphic descriptions, I also don't see how it's inapproriate. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantras_f651.html" title="User:Cantras">Cantras</a> 20:27, 12 November 2006 (UTC) Also edited the tag so the "this article's entry" comes here instead of a blank page. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantras_f651.html" title="User:Cantras">Cantras</a> 20:31, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Keep" I assume the objection is to the (controvercial sexual) context surrounding the RACK philosophy/idea. However, this entry does not contain any information which would shock or mislead a young person, or a person sheltered enough to be not yet aware of that context. I do see this entry as plainly factual, potentially edifying for one who comes accross the term in research or recreational reading, and carefully non-explicit. The RACK scene, like many controvercial counter-culture behaviors, does exist and people may want to know about it. It is not necessary that those people agree with RACKs endorsers or participants. Nor does this entry advocate for such endorsement or participation. In fact, knowlege of the existence of such a scene could reduce the risk of someone "unwittingly" entering it... or being duped into it. 70.23.228.75 05:28, 17 November 2006 (UTC)AC</p>

However I think it is better than that pov, which pushes every shade of masturbation, penetration, foreplay, oral sex etc. as encylopedic stuff.

<li><b>Strong Dlete</b> There are many advisors to PM of Pakistan at the moment.

This shows that advisors seems to be nothing, except whatthey are working in current government. They are not elected members nor they have legislation rights. Nor Salam Shah is answerable to both houses of Parliament of Pakistan, National Assembly and Senate. So to best of my knowledge, a strong dlete should be recommended.

<p><b>Delete</b> - PROD'd and then DEPROD'd with the edit summary of <i>"deprod obviously notable school"</i> (?) Basically, there is no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information available to suggest that there is any sort of overall (or even <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>) notability for this topic. As it stands the article is comprised of an unsourced POV statement about the growing popularity of hockey in Illinois, a statement that "high schools field varsity teams competing, in the Amateur Hockey Association Illinois" <i>[sic]</i>, the factoid that <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Montoya_9af2.html" title="Al Montoya">Al Montoya</a> played hockey in Illinois, and a 1 entry list of Amateur Hockey Association Illinois club teams. The problem is that even cleaned up, there is no real useful potential for expansion here. AHAI itself does not appear to be a notable club and if it was it would merit its own article with a list of teams. As I said before, I can find nothing reliable to suggest that High School or Amateur level hockey is a significant or growing sport in Illinois. There is a merge tag on the article, but without verification, I wouldn't even suggest a merge to <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> because at that point all you have is a unsourced POV statement and mention of a non-notable organization (AHAI).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:18, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete —</b> Delete per nomination. Lack of content, and the user who started it was quite new, registering on November 14.

<li><b>Delete</b> The two sentenses that form the bulk of the article have OR/POV problems. No real sources; as it is, no notability is established. Also, as a side note, I'm from Illinois and I can say, at least in central Illinois, hockey is not very popular. Sure, some teams exist (though I know of no high school teams), but then again I'm guessing all states have some sort of hockey league. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 08:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> There is a major problem with applying the definition from <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> quoted above to art galleries, which is that even major commercial galleries do not usually command such coverage. The coverage is given to the artists who exhibit in them, and this is the means by which the gallery achieves its reputation (e.g. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/02/28/nvine28.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/02/28/ixportal.html" class="external text" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/02/28/nvine28.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/02/28/ixportal.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Daily Telegraph</i></a>). The fact that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_Vine_740f.html" title="Stella Vine">Stella Vine</a> was exhibited and discovered by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Saatchi_9f71.html" title="Charles Saatchi">Charles Saatchi</a> in Transition and has subsequently gone on to achieve an international reputation and ongoing media coverage is enough to make the gallery itself of enduring interest. Anyone reading about Vine may well want further information on this initial event and its context. Failure to provide it will be disappointing. Additionally Vine had her first solo show there, has continued to exhibit in group shows and is scheduled for <a href="http://www.stellavine.com/future.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.stellavine.com/future.htm" rel="nofollow">a further solo show in May 2007</a>. An rare example of critics focusing on the galleries rather than the artists is in <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_20050923/ai_n15621227" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_20050923/ai_n15621227" rel="nofollow"><i>The Evening Standard</i></a>, where only 4 galleries were singled out, one of them Transition.

<p>- Tyrenius, you have me confused. first you write half the article, then you sponsor (?I think) &amp; vote for deletion, then you give a spiel for keeping.

<li><b>Keep</b> This has been one of the most contested House races for two cycles now and it has generated a huge amount of national press coverage - Farrell may very well run again in two years which will continue to keep her in the news.

<li><b>Keep</b> seems to pass WP:RS and WP:V, as for notability its a toss up. They are notable after the last race and for having a political position equivalent to a Mayor, which is more then just an alderman at least.

<li><b>Keep</b> She's clearly one of the most important politicians in Connecticut, having run two high profile campaigns for congress and she doesn't cease being an important politician just because she lost this election. She's an elected municipal leader, raised millions for her last bid, etc. Also, this has ALREADY been argued -- how many AFDs is this going to get?--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 05:03, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> She may run for office again. Not to mention if she is deleted and she does run again a future editor might not know about her 2006 run for Congress and not only that they will have to start all over again. Plus many other candidates that lost this year (and in past elections) still have articles. MrKing84 07:48, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Does somebody have it out for her? Why a third attempt? Is WP paper? She's run two very competitive campaigns the latter of which got national attention; she was elected twice as "selectwoman" (equivalent to mayor); As I wrote in the 2nd attempt to delete her: <i>please note in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that one positive factor is: "Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage". As of this writing, she gets 429 news.google hits, and " 'Diane Farrell' + candidate" gets over 100,000 google hits. Further, that she lost last time by only 4% shows that she is a significant figure in her district (as well has holding previous elected office)</i> -- <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 15:04, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> She was deleted in the first AfD request, early in the election process, because she was only an ex-"mayor" of a town of 25,000. She was kept in the second AfD request because the CT 4th CD race had become so noted. Farrell's notability is that she ran against Shays. Her information should be included in the 2006 Connecticut 4th Congressional article. It does not rate a seperate article unless all current and former mayors of small towns are allowed individual articles. -- Wspta 15:27, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I have mixed feelings about this. If the final decision is to <b>not</b> keep the article, I highly recommend a redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_4th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Connecticut 4th congressional district election, 2006">Connecticut 4th congressional district election, 2006</a>, as was just done in a similar case: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Samm_Simpson_8948.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Samm Simpson">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Samm Simpson</a>.

<li><b>Rebuttal</b> As I emphasized in the nomination, the Vendy awards received <b>local news/dining coverage</b> in the New York Times. The NYT is not just an international or national newspaper, it is also a local newspaper covering issues of local interest specific to New York City and surrounding area. (The Times has reviewed the majority of the thousands of restaurants in NYC too. Wikipedia is not a restaurant guide so we don't need articles on every single one of them.) As for <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_d%27Argent_a107.html" title="Tour d'Argent">Tour d'Argent</a> - it's a 400 year old landmark (i.e. older than the United States.... and the NYTimes calls it "a famous landmark", "a legendary restaurant", and "a <i>monument historique</i>") - not comparable to Hallo Berlin <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:52, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To be frank, I don't see a push cart being notable unless it did something pretty amazing. A couple reviews, and some directory listins don't cut it for me. I don't see any mention in the times abstracts. If that counts, then there are 15 or so little food shops around here with a few local reviews. I am not going to make articles on them though. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 00:25, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If this were ny.wikipedia.org, I may have a different opinion. But for a general interest encyclopedia, I just don't see it. While the New York times is certainly a substantial publication, not everything in it is non-trivial (<i>All The News That's Fit To Print</i>). The publications seem to be in very local in nature, and no different from the type of article that appears in the primary newspaper of localities around the world. Not to say that no weiner stand could ever be the subject of an article, but this one doesn't seem to be it. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 02:12, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> several things to note. New York is considered to be the financial headquarters of the world. Therefore, anything notable in NY is more notable than anything in small towns. Of course magazines and other magazines that publish locally in small towns are hardly notable. But when an article is published in NY Mag and New York Times it is notable. The real question is does this dining location merit enough notability that people not from the location would be interested, because it has been mentioned as a notable dining location in NY mag, it most certainly would (not to mention Vendy Awards). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 04:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Restaurant reviews (especially such pieces on the level of a brief blog entry by one guy (gothamist link), one-line opinions by one person as in the "best power lunch" link, a few lines in a quote from one guy(Food &amp; Wine link), a youtube video (!!!)) are not a good basis for encyclopedic notability. Awards and press coverage do not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability.

<dd>You're thinking way too quantitatively. The guidelines on notability for companies say nothing about how much needs to be written to qualify for inclusion. All the sources I cited (obviously with the exception of the YouTube video I threw in there for fun, in ext links not references) are "non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself". (That's taken directly from the guideline, so yes, press coverage and awards do designate notability. By definition, when you give something an award it's to show it's more notable than the rest.) You're going to toss out the fact that this food institution was given awards (Vendy and Best Power Lunch), because they didn't see the need to write a novel about it? That's unnecessary, the notability lies in the fact that major magazines and newspapers wrote about Hallo Berlin with distinction regardless of the fact of how long those articles are. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 19:08, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What has happened with the Rudolf Steiner and Waldorf articles is that individuals from outside Wikipedia have brought a very vicious and personal fight into Wikipedia. These articles are the battlefield. A mediation request has been accepted, but no progress has been made. No Wikipedian has been able to de-escalate or to talk any sense to either party. The two groups are very well dug into their respective positions, and I am utterly skeptical that there will be any solution short of arbitration. Someone needs to take control of the situation, because the edit and ideological war does tend to spread to other articles and certainly does not do Wikipedia any good. Determining the status of this article without dealing with the conflict is pointless. — <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <a href="../../../g/o/e/User_talk%7EGoethean_f9d1.html" title="User talk:Goethean">ॐ</a> 22:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What happened to the idea to merge it into the main article, rather than delete it entirely? The gist of the debate is this: The "Views on race and ethnicity" article is, in fact, essentially a POV fork, but it was created because agreement couldn't be reached in the main article on Steiner as to how to appropriately represent his very controversial racial views. Steiner's devotees want minimal if any mention of his racial views on wikipedia because it is very, very bad press for them. They know that even scanty quotes on Steiner on the topic of race strike outsiders immediately as appalling. They will not consent, in the main article, to even cursory coverage of this controversial aspect of Steiner unless it is to whitewash the overall offensive nature of his views. They raise inane, unscholarly arguments about how many quotes there are that are racist, noting he wrote so-many thousand lectures and in only, say, 10 of these lectures did he describe blacks as having overdeveloped sexuality and boiling blood etc. or describe the white race as the "spiritually creative race" or the "race of the future." Critics of Steiner cannot consent to this aspect of Steiner being hidden or buried in the main article; it is central to his worldview. This ultimately led to creation of the sub-article; this also pleases Steiner followers to some extent because probably fewer people will read the subarticle. Full and honest coverage of Steiner's racial views does belong in the main article; the sub-article should not be deleted, however, until that issue is resolved.<a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDianaW_7ed2.html" title="User:DianaW">DianaW</a> 01:54, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I understand that. These sources have been cited. (Yes - secondary sources, published in scholarly journals, by academic authors.) They are routinely deleted by the Steiner devotees; that's what the continual edit-wars are about. My comments pertain to keeping the material in the main article where it belongs. Anyway, I'm not sure what's wrong or questionable about "revealing the truth" about someone's racial views by quoting those views directly.<a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDianaW_7ed2.html" title="User:DianaW">DianaW</a> 17:37, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article was created because the main article <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Steiner_8c51.html" title="Rudolf Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a> was becoming swamped by enormous tracts of quotations from both secondary and primary sources on this topic - the same kinds of material that appear in this article. Though the article clearly does not conform to Wikipedia standards, if deleted, there is a clear and present danger (see above comment) that this swamping will recur.

<li>Yes, this is a common issue that might need some solution.

<li><b>Comment and suggestion</b> The issue of race, as it was understood at Steiner's time is a peripheral issue in his published works. About five of the appr. 3.000 published lectures by Steiner have the issue of race, as it was understood at the time, as their main theme. In total, the Dutch commission that in 1996 started to find, document and comment on all comments by Steiner on the issue of race, as it was understood at his time, found and document appr. 245 such comments in its final report from 2000. They probably constitute about 0.5-1% of his total published works, including the context for them. Of these, in the view of the Commission, 16 would probably constitute a violation of Dutch legislation on discrimination if expressed by someone in the Netherlands today on his or her own responsibility. Five of the 16 comments were made in 1923 during one ad hoc morning lecture to construction workers in answer to a question by one of the workers. The remaining 11 are spread out in the appr. 90,000 pages of the published works. For more on this, see <a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/ARacistMyth.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/ARacistMyth.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In <a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/Myths.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/Myths.htm" rel="nofollow">anti-Waldorf propaganda</a> they constitute the main focus of the "criticism", and is the primary reason for their appearance in the article, budded off from the Steiner article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The allegation that they play any significant role in Waldorf education is contradicted by <a href="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/SwedishWaldorfSchoolEvaluationProject-Summary1-4.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.waldorfanswers.org/SwedishWaldorfSchoolEvaluationProject-Summary1-4.pdf" rel="nofollow">empirical research</a> on Waldorf pupils in Sweden, comparing several hundred Waldorf students there (grade 9 and 12) to corresponding students in Swedish public schools. Among other things the research showed that the majority of the pupils in both types of school repudiated Nazism and racism. However, the proportion of pupils who suggested anti-Nazi and anti-racist solutions, i.e., solutions that involved counteracting or stopping Nazism and racism was considerably greater among the Waldorf pupils (93%) than among pupils at municipal schools (72%). It indicates that similar research in other countries would come to similar results, and that the heavy focus on the allegations of racism in anthroposophy and Waldorf education primarily is an expression of anti-Waldorf propaganda, not reality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One possible consequence of this would be to delete the separate article on "Rudolf Steiner's views on race and ethnicity" and reflect the description and discussion dedicated to the issue in the main article on Steiner to the actual importance it plays in his his works, in quantitative terms being on the order of 1%, as reasonable. <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebee_38e5.html" title="User:Thebee">Thebee</a> 12:17, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Above, we see the problem here. One or two authors don't understand what racism is and why it is important to identify racist philosophy especially when it is the foundation philosophy for a SCHOOL. Steiner invented Anthroposophy. Anthroposophy elevates one race above another. Anthroposophy is taught to Waldorf teachers directly (including the racist material). Waldorf teachers teach Anthroposophy to the students indirectly (including the racist material). The two authors will never admit this - it's literally <i>against their religion</i> - and furthermore, they don't believe the material to be racist. The edit wars here are often focused on disputing the reliability of sources that identify Steiner's racism and hiding the Anthroposophical affiliations of sources that refute it. One author, in particular, believes his own original research website to be a legitimate supplement of Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The problem we have with second-sourcing the material is that second sources aren't acceptable to either side. The "Dutch Commission" that TheBee talks about was not an unbiased commission, it was a commission exclusively made up of Anthroposophists (a fact in the article, the inclusion of which was hard-fought). Nobody who wasn't an Anthroposophist was on the commission. So we have Anthroposophists excusing their guru, Steiner, of racism. Big surprize!. Learned professors confirm Steiner's racism, and those, according to the Steiner revisionists, require labels like "Skeptic", or the inclusion of more articles by more Anthroposophists that obfuscate the information presented. The intent seems to be to bore people into not reading the article. That's why Steiner's own words have been provided here - because they are indisputable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The information contained in this article is absolutely relevant to who Steiner was. Steiner was a philosopher. Racism found its way into his philosophy. He was a political activist who promoted assimilation of the Jews and took a political stance on the housing of black troops in France after WWI. He wrote articles published in activist magazines. He promoted social reform - even proposed a plan to the League of Nations - while holding and promoting racist views. That's at least as important as a good portion of the material that is currently on the main article (meeting with an herb gatherer) - most of which is branched off in other Wikipedia articles such as eurythmy, Waldorf, bio-dynamics, Anthroposophy and almost two dozen other articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia has become a place for Anthroposophists to advertise Steiner and his mediocre accomplishments. If the race and ethnicity article is deleted, at least a dozen more need to be deleted as well. Clearly, the material contained in this article needs to be merged into the main Steiner article before deletion is considered. It represents who Steiner was in his time, and the bulk of the controvesy surrounding him today (as demonstrated by the various reports and studies cited by TheBee). The controversy about Steiner's racism rages on because of Steiner's influence in Waldorf. It is essential that this part of Steiner's biography not be buried simply because Wikipedia does not have room for controversy. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 16:40, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per multiple verified references from reliable sources. The keep is "weak" because all of the sources are zine-related, thus signifying that while the zine community (if such a thing exists) may have picked up on the site, few people outside of this group have heard of it. However, while I am arguing for this article's existence, I highly dislike that much of the article is about the creators' distaste for Wikipedia. While it's quasi-relevant to the article, it's also highly self-referential of this encyclopedia (which is to be avoided) and slightly POV (which is explicitly disallowed). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:52, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

There is definitely a zine community, dating back before the early days of Usenet with alt.zines, multiple yearly zine conventions, zine related books, Factsheet Five, zine libraries, zines included in college library collections, etc. ZineWiki is definitely very new and is just starting to gain attention outside the zine community, but it attempts to collect all the zine resources around the Web and in print into one complete database, which is essential to documenting America and the world's small press history and culture. ZineWiki is already the largest online guide to zines, small press publications and zine publishers and it's growing rapidly. The Wiki, like the listing, will be growing in leaps and bounds over the next few years. It seems short-sighted to delete it now because it's relevance is only justified by some Wiki editors in mainstream attention (which it will no doubt get more of in time). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan10things_9bb1.html" title="User:Dan10things">Dan10things</a> 00:37, 14 November 2006 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan10things_9bb1.html" title="User:Dan10things">Dan10things</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan10things_4427.html" title="User talk:Dan10things">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dan10things_0b7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dan10things">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I would think a more serious subject matter like zines and the small press that spans decades and that is a key element in social movements like punk, riot grrrl, hardcore, as well as the comic and science fiction communities, would hold a little more weight than a TV show, people that talk shit, and people that dress like squirrels. This is the first I've heard of Wikifur, but thanks for adding it in your comments, wow! For me the notability is not that it's a Wiki, it's ZineWiki's content and importance in creating a comprehensive database of information about zines and the small press--something up until now, no one had attempted.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan10things_9bb1.html" title="User:Dan10things">Dan10things</a> 07:31, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Zinewiki is a reality. It deserves fair recognition in any general encyclopedia on or off line. It has recognized and celebrated the decades of recent zines - a zine explosion of thousands and thousands of independent writers and artists and desktop publishers who are the major source of quality contemporary writing and art. It celebrates a new art form, zines - that combine bookmaking, writing, publishing, and illustration. It is also representative of the world of independent and small publishers outside of the recent media/art consolidation that has occured in the last few decades. If wikipedia celebrates the hack commercial writers of the mainstream publishers - that are overly promoted - then it should cover the gifted writers outside that commercial promotion. And cover those that celebrate these gifted writers. Zinewiki does. The world of writers it covers is real. It's work is all the more important and valid for becoming the source for the history of so many gifted and neglected writers. It is a recorded history of zines and deserves recognition as a history source as much as any other history source. If writers are covered in wikipedia, then zinesters should be covered. If online sources for writers are covered, then zinewiki should be covered. If zines are covered in wikipedia how can one not cover zinewiki? There seems to be a dangerous challenge of all artists that aren't apart of the handful of corporations that control the mainstream arts (music, film, writing, tv, etc.). This isn't fairness its prejudice in favor of big corporations. As a zinester, I say a strong keep. 172.150.43.75 17:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)<small>— 172.150.43.75 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.150.43.75_b874.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.150.43.75">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - There seems to be a lot of perpetrating in the zine world by individuals who seem to be agents for interested parties. Though I don't know zinewiki well I'd surmise that this challenge is a form of disinformation. <small>— James Nowlan (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_James_Nowlan_2cb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/James Nowlan">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> - I may not be someone who contributes or edits Wikipedia, but I am someone who finds it useful to use. Zinewiki on the other hand, is something that I have edited and contributed to. As someone who doesn't know much about the Wiki world, I figured that this was the same thing - but alas, I suppose not. All that aside, after reading the "notability requirements," Zinewiki does in fact, fit two of the three (according to the requirements, an entry only needs to meet one).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Zinewiki meets the first requirement, as it has been covered in such places as The Small Press Exchange (<a href="http://www.smallpressexchange.com/directory/magazines_and_e-zines/zines/zinewiki/details/" class="external free" title="http://www.smallpressexchange.com/directory/magazines_and_e-zines/zines/zinewiki/details/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smallpressexchange.com/directory/magazines_and_e-zines/zines/zinewiki/details/</a>), Supernaturale\Glimmer (<a href="http://www.supernaturale.com/glimmer.html?id=612#g612" class="external free" title="http://www.supernaturale.com/glimmer.html?id=612#g612" rel="nofollow">http://www.supernaturale.com/glimmer.html?id=612#g612</a>), and Powell's books (<a href="http://www.powells.com/review/2006_10_14.html" class="external free" title="http://www.powells.com/review/2006_10_14.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.powells.com/review/2006_10_14.html</a>). Zinewiki has also been mentioned on numerous blogs and even on some non-english language websites. The coverage on Powell's books also meets the requirement for number three, as Powell's online is an extremely well known website and the content of Zinewiki was used in a review on the site.</dd>
<dd>In addition to meeting the criteria, I believe that Zinewiki represents a large subculture, and is worthy of its own Wiki entry in the same fashion that Memory Alpha (the Star Trek Wiki) has its own entry. Zinewiki is a relatively new entry, and still has plenty of time to grow. It has already been of great interest to people in the zine community (trust me, there is one) and has a potential of being of great interest to people in the small press community.Aaroncynic 01:28, 15 November 2006 (UTC)<small>— Aaroncynic (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaroncynic_df21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaroncynic">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - ZineWiki is an attempt to catalog what is in fact a huge subculture. Zines are written and created everyplace-- an authentic expression of American culture; of the American voice. Is Wikipedia to give attention only to those who've been blessed and sanctified by a select group of mandarins representing not the American voice, but their own privileged status? The writers mentioned in Zinewiki are MORE genuine, more American, than the John Updikes of the mainstream. I've made this argument in many venues, and will debate the idea anywhere. If Wikipedia is to represent a true picture of our times, of more than one cultural stream, than a site like Zinewiki has its place. -King Wenclas.<small>— KingWenclas (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KingWenclas_e26d.html" title="Special:Contributions/KingWenclas">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>.</li>

<li><b>Reluctant weak keep</b> - Frankly, I'd be happier if so many of those voting "Keep" were people who actually contribute to Wikipedia itself; and if the article, and those supporting its retention, didn't have so much trouble keeping their points of view out of the material. (And frankly, I'm unconvinced that Memory Alpha has a place here either.) The paranoia displayed here by the person calling him or herself James Nowlan is not a good sign for rational discussion.--<a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemike_a411.html" title="User:Orangemike">Orange Mike</a> 22:02, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Is Wikipedia only for those who have the free time to create or edit its entries? Or does it exist for the online community to use as a powerful reference source, whether they contribute or not? I am a regular Wikipedia user, both at home and at on the job (at a library). I'm also someone, yes, very involved in and interested in zines. It's because of that involvement that I can second the validity of Dan10things's comments above. As a user, I do think it is notable.

<dd>What he means is, this type of debate is really designed for regular wikipedia editors to participate in. Every so often, a debate will attract a lot of new accounts, almost always supporting whatever article is under discussion -- but it doesn't help get a good picture of what the Wikipedia editing community thinks, which is what really matters (Wikipedia runs on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> and is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a democracy</a>). New users can sometimes make arguments that sway established editors, but in most cases, they just state preferences, which are pretty much irrelevant to the discussion. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Per Orange Mike, I dislike the stream of meatpuppets here, but multiple media mentions make this pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in my book, and I think any POV issues have been resolved at this point. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>: I'm a little hesitant, on the basis of "notability first, encyclopedia article second." I don't doubt that the Wiki has potential to be a very good resource on an area worth documenting, but the article seems a little premature. I certainly would not have started it at this time, but since it is there, I suspect that we should keep it, since it will probably merit mention soon enough. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:29, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. All the mentions are trivial or zine-related. The article's creator has admitted a conflict of interest. We cannot give in to a shitstorm of meatpuppets.

<li>Well, they're <i>listed</i> for a couple thousand $US. Listing and appraisal don't equate to sale value.

<li>Those sources are short blurbs from websites that sell art.

<li><b>Keep</b> He's obviously not as well known as Picasso, but he's an artist who received enough note to still come up in a basic web search. He seems notable to me, from what I've seen. I think more citations should be added to the article, and that it should be cleaned up. I also think any portion that is a copyvio should be cut out - but none of those are reasons to delete (rather than just trimming back to a stub, at worst). In any event, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that the author of the page was somehow associated with the painter (e.g. a dealer or relative). It seems to me just as plausible that he is a huge William Barr fan, noticed the lack of an article about the artist, and signed on just to make one - precisely the sort of thing we like to have happen. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 04:49, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hmm. I'll assume good faith, and maybe I'm in a bad mood (it's pretty early in the morning), but your response seems overly sarcastic and antagonistic. Anyways, I'm not going to get into a debate with you about how many Ghits equals notability - but here I see enough. You disagree? Ok, please feel free. Oh, and are there 5000+ other artists on that website whose names start with the letter B? Great.

<li>I haven't mentioned ghits at all. Now that you mention it, if I put in more than two or three relevant words into a Google search, I come up with nothing. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22Anne+Beaton%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22Anne+Beaton%22" rel="nofollow">[91]</a> shows nothing, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22John+McGilvray%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22John+McGilvray%22" rel="nofollow">[92]</a> brings up unrelated genealogy, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22Paisley+Cross%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22Paisley+Cross%22" rel="nofollow">this one for his "notable painting"</a> shows zero hits. Frankly, if one were to remove all unreliable info from this article, very little would be left. From the tone of it, I wouldn't be surprised if it were a copyvio from a book but I can't prove it.

<ul>
<li>We aren't talking about Ghits? I was under the impression that we were, since that's what you were responding to - but I'll take your word on that. Anyways, the searches you've run (including "Anne Beaton" (I don't know who that is) and "John McGilvray" (same problem - though I see the name in the article)) seem to me to be poor indicators, and I'm in no way surprised that an individual work of art by a minor artist doesn't show up in a Google search. (I'd suggest running the artist's name and "artist.") To address your other points: if the article is about someone on whom there is reliable information, but is not based on that reliable information - write something reliable (or add a tag asking someone else to). If it's a copyvio, cut it down to a stub. I disagree about the claimed "spammy" tone - I rarely receive spam regarding early 20th century artists, and sincerely doubt (unless you can point me to something more than a naked allegation) that it's blatant advertising. I would be very surprised to find someone actively advertising the works of a long-dead painter. On the other hand, articles about them are precisely the sort of thing I'd expect to find in an encyclopedia. So I'm still on the side of keep. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 15:56, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Search this page - the first mention of Google and ghits is not mine. The three searches I just did were all with the first three unique-looking things I saw in the article. We agree that the whole article should be chopped down to a stub - and it will be if no one finds sources for it all. The search you suggest is a common misconception at AFD - if you search on his name and "artist", all you've proven is that he's an artist. I'd like something to prove that he's a <i>notable</i> artist - or at least more notable than the 5,000+ artists that start with the letter B on that page. You yourself just characterized him as a "minor artist" which doesn't speak well for his notability. I'll drop the spamminess hints - at the very least, the last sentence left me with a spammy feeling. The whole thing leaves me with a copyvio feeling: <i>William Barr was struck by the beauty of the California landscape...</i> - how does anyone know that? <i>John McGilvray was a successful builder...</i> - based on what? Who says? I'll bet whatever brochure it was copied from says. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wait - your comment is under mine, and I took it to mean that you were discussing what I was saying. Are you <b>not</b> discussing whether my comment on web searches was accurate? (I suppose the web search we were discussing could have been done with Yahoo, but I think that's a distinction without a difference.) Anyways, I don't think it matters, and will gladly grant you that it was my idea to talk about Ghits if that will resolve that part of the question. You are, however, confusing (if you'll excuse my saying so) notability with fame. They aren't the same thing - and a notable artist <i>can</i> be a minor artist. (Wikipedia should include minor, perhaps even obscure, artists.) I also disagree about the "searching his name with artist only proves that he is an artist." If I searched for Joe Smith with artist, and got lots of pages saying "Joe Smith is an artist," that's probably (though not always) a notable artist - notable enough to have been mentioned as an artist multiple times. Have I found something saying "Joe Smith is a notable artist who probably would meet the standards of AfD"? No - of course not. But if I've found enough about the person (and I think I have here), then he's probably notable. So, I'm still in Keep. The copyvio thing - yeah, like I said, I get the same general feeling. As I've said all along, I think it should be trimmed and cleaned up.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 21:39, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
