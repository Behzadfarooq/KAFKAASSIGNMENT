<li><b>Comment</b>. I realize that there are a tremendous number of arguments for and against retaining school articles, but whether the school is <i>named</i> after a notable person should be irrelevant. If a school is named after <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, that doesn't make it more notable than if the exact same school were named after the neighborhood in which it is located. If Ghiyasuddin, the school's namesake, is notable, then an article should be written about him rather than have his biography in an article about the school. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:56, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Systemic bias? Isn't that why we have 3.5x10^25 different language-based Wikipedias? And I think to myself - a school named after a person who introduced breadfruit. Now there's a reason for a claim of notability. CalJW may not be concerned with squeezing Wikipedia onto paper, but I am concerned with being able to squeeze Wikipedia onto servers (which are a little more expensive than paper), and onto access time.

<li>So your reasoning is that "if all schools that don't deserve to be in Wikipedia should not be in Wikipedia, then all other articles that don't deserve to be in Wikipedia should not be Wikipedia".

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Hipocrite, I thank you for retracting your allegation that of bad-faith. However, I feel compelled to point out that I believe in this nomination and I am not attempting to make any sort of point, other than that this particular article fails the test of notability and should be deleted. If you look at my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Johntex" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Johntex" rel="nofollow">Contributions</a>, you will see that I nominate a fair number of articles for deletion because they fail notability standards. Schools are a very small percentage of my delete nominations or votes. Schools, businesses, destroyers, girrafes, eggplants, people, or any specific instance of any other thing needs to be notable enough to merit inclusion in this encyclopedia or he/she/it should not be included. There is no Wikipedia policy that says that all schools are notable or that all schools should or must be kept. I believe the true waste of time is in creating and defending non-notable articles, not the effort to have them excised from the project. And to answer Oblivious' question, my answer would be "absolutely", not notable bands, movies, etc. should be deleted are deleted here everyday. Schools do not have a policy protecting them from the same legitimate scrutiny. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:29, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I will second the "clap, clap" for a mature retraction. And I will also second John's larger point. I won't nom schools (I never go looking for them anyway) but I vote delete when there is no assertion of notability beyond "the bricks and mortar." I'm sure a lot of work has gone into the school's project but there is nothing binding about it. Wiki is not a directory. Wiki is discursive but not indiscriminate. I simply do not find schools notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:47, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hear, hear. It is dealing with the inflexible inclusionist that makes me a more inflexible deletionist when I would much rather be flexible.

Not only have I stated repeatedly that I support school articles <i>where the school can show some reasonable degree of notability</i>, but I have even (gasp!) actually voted to keep some school articles. What I am not prepared to do, Kappa, is to share server space with articles on every so-called school on this planet, most of which are uttterly lacking in anything worthy of note. Have you even once voted to delete a school article? Thought not. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 21:48, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

There are many school articles that started out as stubs and later became full articles after contributions by multiple users.

<li><b>Precisely</b>. If a school article contains information which demonstrates the school is of note, and is what could be described as a full article, <i>it will not be deleted</i>. It seems those who contribute school articles feel all that is necessary is to name a building as a school, and that constitutes enough info for it to deserve to be kept. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 21:55, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What a load of rot. You have no evidence of systemic bias because none exists. Most normal Wikipedians will vote to keep or delete articles on the basis of their content, not their subject. It is those like yourself who vote to keep on the basis of subject that see plots where there are none. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 23:48, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Skritch skritch skritch</b> (sound of hair being pulled out). Maybe if I type r e a l l y s l o w l y, I won't be misunderstood. I will vote to delete an article on <i>anything</i> which does not have requisite notability. I do not have some special vendetta against schools. I will also vote to delete articles on destroyers, pokemons, and star trek characters which are not demonstrably notable. However, I do not vote to delete schools categorially in the same way that some vote to keep them, that is to say, without apparently even reading the articles to ensure something is actually being said. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 22:07, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>What? That's a personal attack if I ever saw one. No need to go around calling others "abnormal" because they hold a different viewpoint to the majority.

<ul>
<li>Please. Firstly, describing a philosophical position as stupid is not an attack on the person who holds it (eg. You are stupid vs You are a Nobel Prize Winning Wikipedian, but your argument is stupid). Second, I've only ever called it stupid once. Third, I retracted it and apologised the moment it was pointed out to me it was rude. Fourth, <i>my</i> conduct has no bearing on the rudeness (or otherwise) of <i>your</i> conduct. Even if I've called you "abnormal", it doesn't grant you license to call someone else "abnormal". In constrast, your use of the term "not a normal Wikipedian" was clearly directed at the <i>individual</i>, not the arguments he was advancing, and you're making up excuses to justify it.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 04:17, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please. First of all, it is at best <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a> to refer to someone else's philosophical position "stupid", and a great many editors on WP would consider it a personal attack. Next, <b>I</b> (nor anyone else for that matter) have not referred to anyone as "abnormal", in fact, you are the only one to have used this term so far. Next, it was <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a> (like yourself, one of "those who routinely nominate or vote to delete school articles") who first made the statement that: "Most normal Wikipedians will vote to keep or delete articles on the basis of their content, not their subject," indicating that those of us who vote to keep or delete on articles on the basis of their subject are somehow "not normal Wikipedians" by obverse implication. When <b>KAPPA</b> (obviously not me or my sockpuppet) simply retorted about what 'must' constitute a "normal wikipedian" by that standard, you accused him of making a personal attack. As to your contention that your misbehavior doesn't give "me" (or in this case, Kappa) license to abuse others, you are correct, but your abusing others or being uncivil and then going about admonishing others for being uncivil does make you a <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypocrite.html" title="Hypocrite">hypocrite</a>. What I'd like to know, is why you weren't rushing to remind <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a> about his uncivil statements when he suggested that those of us that decide to vote on the basis of subject are "abnormal" (as you put it).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 04:55, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you should get out a dictionary and look up "normal", Nicodemus. No, wait, let me do it for you. "normal - adj. 1. regular, usual, typical" Not so scary after all, huh? No mention of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_scan.html" title="Brain scan">brain scans</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/t/ECT_11a1.html" title="ECT">ECT</a>, or twitchy eyes. No, school inclusionists are probably <i>not</i> "normal" Wikipedians. "Normal" Wikipedians actually take the time to read articles before voting on them, and actually ask themselves whether an article contains anything of merit before deciding to keep it. This is true of schools, pokemons, and star trek characters. If stating what is apparently true can be construed as a personal attack, then all of us are in big trouble. Now can I help you with the definition of "abnormal"? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 05:58, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not about viewpoints, it's about actions. Many normal wikipedians <i>think</i> "delete Simpons episodes" but they don't bother voting that way when they realize there's no consensus to do it. 01:45, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree with Denni. No one has mentioned Asia. The nom, votes and argument would be the same if it were Kansas School, Kansas City, Kansas. The repeated recourse to systemic bias in these keep arguments is specious. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 00:07, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The claim that there is <b>not</b> a systemic bias against schools outside of the English-speaking geographical pale is specious. By their very nature, there is a systemic bias against schools whose primary source references are in another language. This renders what "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete schools" consider to be articles of an inferior quality and more likely to garner delete votes on the basis of a poorly-written article and difficulty of verifiability. Asian schools have been conspicuously targeted in the past 45 days by a variety of "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete schools". Apart from the bad faith mass-nomination of 24 schools in one day in September, Asian schools represented 15% of all school AfD nominations in the month, while representing a <b>much</b> smaller percentage of the total number of school articles on Wikipedia. If that doesn't consitute a systemic bias, I am not sure what does.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 00:50, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A systemic bias is <i>systemic</i>. It does not pop up suddenly one day or one month, and the number of school pages that show up in a month is small enough that statistical fluctuation is everything. I would also question your use of the term "conspicuously targeted". I can only assume that you see a plot a-hatchin' when you use language like that. First, there have not been a whole lot of Asian schools nominated, Second, the vote counts for those schools was pretty much the same as it usually is, with the usual cast of character casting the usual distribution of votes. In fact, one Asian School, Apeejay Public School, actually garnered some keep votes from some (myself included), who, as you so quaintly put it, "routinely nominate and vote to delete schools." If you really wish to test this conspiracy theory of yours, you may want to go back to those delete votes and see who it was that originally brought them to AfD. I expect you will find they were nominated by a diverse group, including some who do not participate here on a regular basis. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 06:19, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
