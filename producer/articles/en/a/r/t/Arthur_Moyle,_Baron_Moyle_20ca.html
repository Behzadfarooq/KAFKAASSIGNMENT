<p>Moyle was a native of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, the son of a stonemason. He grew up in <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llanidloes.html" title="Llanidloes">Llanidloes</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomeryshire.html" title="Montgomeryshire">Montgomeryshire</a> and went to the National School there. He learned the trade of a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bricklayer.html" title="Bricklayer">bricklayer</a>, and worked in Wales and the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_Marches_048b.html" title="Welsh Marches">Welsh Marches</a>. He was active in trade union work and in 1918, he became Secretary of the <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrewsbury.html" title="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> Building Trades Federation.</p>

<p>From 1920 Moyle was promoted to be an official of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives. He also became active in the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>, and in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1924_0d47.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1924">1924 general election</a> he was chosen as Labour Party candidate for <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torquay_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_7c55.html" title="Torquay (UK Parliament constituency)">Torquay</a>. Moyle's intervention in what was a close fight between the Conservatives and Liberals, where Labour had not fought in the two previous elections, was met with annoyance on the part of the Liberal Party. <sup id="_ref-1924_election_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1924_election" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the end, the Liberals lost the seat by much more than the 2,752 votes which Moyle obtained.</p>

<p>After trade union mergers, Moyle became National Officer of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Union_of_Public_Employees_ffe8.html" title="National Union of Public Employees">National Union of Public Employees</a>, which made him responsible for local authority workers generally and not just those in construction. In the year 1937-38 Moyle was Chairman of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities Non-Trading Services. He was a spokesman of a delegation to the government to ask for pensions for manual workers as well as local government officers in 1937. <sup id="_ref-Pensions_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pensions" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In May 1938 he joined a delegation pressing for a <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_Whitley_f65e.html#Whitley_Councils" title="John Henry Whitley">Whitley Council</a> for nurses, to fix minimum salaries and maximum hours. <sup id="_ref-Nurses_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nurses" title="">[3]</a></sup> During the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, Moyle served on a departmental committee on Nurses' salaries under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Betterton%2C_1st_Baron_Rushcliffe_9f34.html" title="Henry Betterton, 1st Baron Rushcliffe">Lord Rushcliffe</a>. Moyle was a member of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities Administrative Professional, Technical and Clerical Staffs, and in 1945 was chairman of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Union_Congress_b184.html" title="Trade Union Congress">Trade Union Congress</a> Local Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>Moyle had been adopted as Labour Parliamentary candidate for <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stourbridge_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_9f64.html" title="Stourbridge (UK Parliament constituency)">Stourbridge</a> in January 1940, <sup id="_ref-Adoption_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Adoption" title="">[4]</a></sup> His chance to fight the seat had to be delayed during the war, but when the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1945_2336.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">election came in 1945</a> he won the seat from the Conservatives with a majority of nearly 16,000. In Parliament he concentrated on local authority workers' issues, and in supporting the National Insurance Bill in February 1946, he spoke of his concern for the local authority staff who would find themselves redundant after the Bill became law. He called for adequate compensation to be paid. <sup id="_ref-National_Insurance_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-National_Insurance" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>In May 1946, Moyle was appointed as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_Private_Secretary_0687.html" title="Parliamentary Private Secretary">Parliamentary Private Secretary</a> to the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_Attlee_cce2.html" title="Clement Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, following <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_de_Freitas_5a19.html" title="Geoffrey de Freitas">Geoffrey de Freitas</a> who had been given a ministerial post. <sup id="_ref-PPS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PPS" title="">[6]</a></sup> The appointment gave Moyle a central role in managing relations between Attlee and government backbenchers, and almost silenced him in the chamber of the House of Commons. Attlee gave his PPS access to almost all important decisions, and respected Moyle's advice on the sometimes fractious <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_Labour_Party_d1cd.html" title="Parliamentary Labour Party">Parliamentary Labour Party</a>.</p>

<p>After boundary changes, Moyle was elected for <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldbury_and_Halesowen_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_2e62.html" title="Oldbury and Halesowen (UK Parliament constituency)">Oldbury and Halesowen</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1950_5ee5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1950">1950 general election</a>. That November, he drew top place in the ballot for <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Member%27s_Bill_7249.html" title="Private Member's Bill">Private Member's Bills</a>, and introduced a Bill to tighten up the licensing of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireworks.html" title="Fireworks">fireworks</a>. <sup id="_ref-Fireworks_Bill_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fireworks_Bill" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Bill passed into law. Moyle continued to act as Attlee's Parliamentary Private Secretary when Labour went into opposition after the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1951_ec18.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1951">1951 general election</a>, <sup id="_ref-PPS_2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PPS_2" title="">[8]</a></sup> and received the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a> in Attlee's resignation honours list. <sup id="_ref-CBE_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CBE" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In July 1952 Moyle insisted that <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_defence.html" title="Civil defence">civil defence</a>, even in the nuclear age, should not be made into a disciplined force, but instead find its own level of discipline as in the Second World War. <sup id="_ref-Civil_Defence_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Civil_Defence" title="">[10]</a></sup> In November 1953 he came top of the ballot for Private Member's Bills, and chose the subject of humane slaughter of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horses</a>. <sup id="_ref-Humane_slaughter_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humane_slaughter" title="">[11]</a></sup> His Bill received government support <sup id="_ref-Government_support_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Government_support" title="">[12]</a></sup> and was also enacted.

<p>After Attlee retired as Leader of the Opposition, Moyle was allowed to range more widely in his contributions. He was particularly concerned about air pollution and complained that smokeless fuel was too expensive and slow to order; he advocated the nationalisation of the companies who made it in order to expand production. <sup id="_ref-Smokeless_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Smokeless" title="">[14]</a></sup> During the <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez_crisis.html" title="Suez crisis">Suez crisis</a>, Moyle stated that Britain had destroyed her moral authority by one action and lost the opportunity to criticise the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> for its action in <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. <sup id="_ref-Suez_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Suez" title="">[15]</a></sup> He wanted <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_martial.html" title="Court martial">courts martial</a> to be comprised of petty officers and ratings as well as officers. <sup id="_ref-Courts_martial_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Courts_martial" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Moyle topped the ballot for Private Member's Bills for a third time in November 1957. <sup id="_ref-Ballot_1957_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ballot_1957" title="">[17]</a></sup> This time he introduced a Bill to implement recommendations of a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Commission_08f4.html" title="Royal Commission">Royal Commission</a> on the children of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> people. <sup id="_ref-Divorced_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Divorced" title="">[18]</a></sup> As with his previous Bills, he secured government support <sup id="_ref-Children_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Children" title="">[19]</a></sup> and received Royal Assent. In 1957 and 1958, Moyle ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_Cabinet_8b66.html" title="Shadow Cabinet">Shadow Cabinet</a>, although he polled poorly. <sup id="_ref-Shadow_Cabinet_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shadow_Cabinet" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1959_4ba6.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1959">1959 general election</a>, Moyle found himself unable to play an active part in Parliament due to illness. His lack of participation was highlighted by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> television programme "<a href="../../../t/h/a/That_Was_The_Week_That_Was_1d99.html" title="That Was The Week That Was">That Was The Week That Was</a>" in January 1963, which listed all 13 MPs who had not made a speech in the entire Parliament.

On the death of Earl Attlee (as he had since become), Moyle was named as his <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_executor.html" title="Literary executor">literary executor</a>. <sup id="_ref-Literary_executor_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Literary_executor" title="">[22]</a></sup> In March 1970 he spoke against making an application to join the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Communities</a>, arguing that Britain should stand by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> who had stood by Britain in two world wars and were continuing to do so. <sup id="_ref-U.S.A._0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-U.S.A." title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Moyle married Elizabeth Evans from Llanidloes in 1921, but was widowed in 1949. Their son, <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roland_Moyle_aaba.html" title="Roland Moyle">Roland Moyle</a>, was later a Labour Member of Parliament in Lewisham. He married Lena Bassett in 1952.</p>
