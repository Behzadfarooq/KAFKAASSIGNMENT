<p>Hi i'm the writer of the Ne'er-do-wells article and also the frontman for the band. What can the harm be in leaving this article on. We are trying to release an album but it isn't that easy. We've performed in a variety of locations and every time have recieved a great reception. Just because we haven't yet released an album doesn't mean we are not a band, Enter Shikari are yet to release an album aren't they? Why do they qualify as a band? One article on Wikipedia is a big thing for our band it however barely affects you. Please consider keeping this article on, i find it unfair that we are removed due to not having an album, we are trying and we need some kind of way to express our band over the internet. Wikipedia, myspace and youtube are the biggest ways. A myspace page is being set up, we have submitted an article for here and we are going to record us at out next performance. Thank you for your time.</p>

<dd>Hello... One of the most common arguments for keeping articles is that they "aren't harming anyone." Wikipedia is intended to be a serious encyclopedia with information that can be relied upon for accuracy and neutrality. It is not an advertising space for new bands, or for anything at all, so the issue is not about "harm" to individuals (articles rarely harm people, people with guns harm people) but about maintaining the quality of the site. The reason people <i>want</i> articles on Wikipedia is because they know the public uses it... but the public only uses it as long as they think they are getting good information. In other words, keeping articles that violate policies of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiablity</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> <i>do</i> harm the project, if not the people. By saying that Wikipedia is one of the "biggest ways" to get publicity shows that you may have some misunderstanding of the purpose of the site, and I hope I've been able to clarify this for you. For example, the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enter_Shikari_8e8d.html" title="Enter Shikari">Enter Shikari</a> entry indicates that they've been around for a while, have been included in a number of public events and have received a number of awards. I hope your album does well... if it does you will certainly be notable enough for inclusion. That way the encyclopedia will have a record of your work for information (not publicity) purposes. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 03:32, 20 February 2007 (UTC) - P.S. You do a nice cover of "On A Plain" per your YouTube videos.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Obviously a vanity article; it was created by one of the members of the band itself. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 17:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a vanity article at all and yes it is kind of for publicity and i understand what's being said about it being a place for notified information. Based on the rules of wiki my article should indeed be removed, but why is there need to call me vain? I'm far from it as has been stated in the article i wrote where i wrote something along the lines of having a lack of talent. The band is more of a statement and an attempt to show people if they try they can achieve any goal we are just a bunch of guys who enjoy music and entertaining. We have performed in a variety of places in Middlesbrough/newcastle and areas around. We have performed as a warm up to the lostprophets when they came to Middlesbrough. And thanks for the compliment regarding our covers on youtube, we are branching away from covers, they were in our early days when we weren't as good. Again i'll ask if you can not delete this article as it is valid and accurate as i wrote it so it is accurate even if there isn't much proof. The line-up of the band has been the same for nearly a year, the reason we don't have a singer is because we all enjoy trying it and switch around singing our own songs. Thanks</p>
<p>Ne'er-do-wells is the band name it is grammatically correct and if it isn't we don't really care its the name of the band regardless.</p>
<p>What's wrong with saying 2007 looks to be a good year?</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b> - Try not to take it personally... the term "vanity article" simply means an article placed here for publicity, which you admit is one of your reasons (if not the primary one) for posting the information. It doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean the person posting it is vain. You've realized that Wikipedia's policies would work against the article's presence here, and the discussion in this AfD is probably going to reflect the desires of our regular contributors to keep the policies fair by applying them equally to every entry. Your article's information may be accurate, I don't doubt that it is, but the standard for a band's inclusion in the encyclopedia is pretty well defined. You can check out <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> if you're interested in the specifics. As far as, "What's wrong with saying 2007 looks to be a good year?" The policy I mentioned above, <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>, prohibits articles (and the editors who make them) from making predictions about the future without a high level of proof. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 19:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So when will the article be deleted?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The norm is five days for discussion from date of nomination and then if it is decided that deletion is the case it will be a couple of days after the close of the discussion. Or in plain English, any time after Friday the 23 depending on how busy the Admins are. See the bottom of this page <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> for the explanation of the process. - <a href="../../../x/2/0/User%7EX201_1eb7.html" title="User:X201">X201</a> 21:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whats the liklihood this article will be removed?</p>
