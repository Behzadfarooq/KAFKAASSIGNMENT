<li><b>Keep</b>. How about actually providing some <i>reasons</i> why the article supposedly fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. It has two sources, plus a link to a TV segment. How is that non-notable? (Also, there are more articles listed on their <a href="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/?lang=en&amp;badboy=page,Media" class="external text" title="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/?lang=en&amp;badboy=page,Media" rel="nofollow">media page</a> in magazines like Playboy and Cosmopolitan that could be incorporated into the page.) As for being a "list of someone's ideas about seduction," that "someone" is the founder of the company. Don't you think his ideas about how seduction works are relevant to this page, considering that the company makes money by teaching them? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> says "Were it not for the sources, I would have had difficulty believing that this was even a real industry."

<dd>Did I forbid you from a POV? Course not, humans by their very nature will have one. However what you should be discussing in this AfD is how the sources make this a "<i>Non-notable corporation</i>" as the nominator claims. Other than one of the editors you listed (obviously SecondSight) <b>none</b> of them are active anymore. Which is what I was referring to. Even worse, one of the editors you listed doesn't even exist! (Mooft (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mooft_8183.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mooft">contribs</a>)). Also, WoodenBuddha isn't my "old pal". Oh, and don't claim "single-purpose editor" when I'm not that.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Wish the nominator had stated specifically why they believe it is a "<i>Non-notable corporation</i>". You can't reply to the nominator's specific accusations when there are not any! I suspect this is a bad faith nomination with the nominator merely being disruptive. Of course, I would rather that I'm wrong in what I suspect about this. So I'm looking forward for a more detailed explaination from the nominator. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 21:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, certainly. The article contains no assertion of notability - the size of the corporation is not discussed, and it's relevance to an encyclopedia is dubious.

<dd>See <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a>'s comments for why it has notability. Secondly since when is the "size" required for an article to be notable?!

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>: Seems to be a spam article. The only external source is YouTube, and that's not a reliable source. Furthermore, the YouTube link does not seem to be a "documentary", but rather an advertisement piece. (Either that, or it's a really, really favorable documentary.) It was also uploaded by this organization, so it's not a true third party link (just more material created by this organization.) For those reasons, it's non-notable. <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 18:21, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, I guess I was thinking Google Video but put down YouTube. Anyway, the other sources are from this company. What we need are reliable, third-party sources. There are none, so there's no indication of notability. <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 03:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the company did put the Titan TV segment up on Google Video, it doesn't change the fact that the segment was made by a third party. Hence, it is an independent source. Do you think they fabricated the video entirely and are lying that it was ever a segment on TV? Or are you arguing that the company edited the segment or something to make themselves look better? Also, the article has two more sources. The fact that independent links aren't available to these sources doesn't mean that the sources don't exist or that they are not independent. Sources don't even need links anyway (many books are cited in wikipedia that don't have the whole contents linked to online). We could just cite the sources, and remove the links to their text on the company's website if that would make you happier. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 06:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is there any proof at all this video was made by a third party? It doesn't have any logo on it that says "Titan TV", and the only source that says this is from Titan TV is Badboy Lifestyle. Also, this is not a documentary. This is a promotional piece. It shows the corporation talking about their infallible method, it talks about being a "player", it shows the price of the seminars, and then it closes with an advertisement screen: "Seduce any girl - badboylifestyle.com". This is an infomercial. If you were to remove the links and rather just cite the articles, it would still not fix the problem that the articles are unverified. Several of the sources are from Badboy, and two links are the same video.

As SecondSight points out, there is plenty of third-party coverage with the full-text available at the website <a href="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/?badboy=page,playboy" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/?badboy=page,playboy" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/?badboy=page,Loaded" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/?badboy=page,Loaded" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/?badboy=page,cosmo" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/?badboy=page,cosmo" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Loaded, Playboy, and Cosmo are all well-established magazines that are clearly reliable sources, even if not in the same league as the NY Times, for example. The coverage is extensive, especially in the first two, so Badboy meets CORP (no one has really offered an explanation for why these should be disregarded).--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 13:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the key phrase here is "at the web site". In my view, sources from sites other than Badboy Lifestyle are required. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 13:25, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I didn't understand that criticism at first, but now I get it and think it's fair. That said, the piece from Loaded includes a scan of the article. That's pretty strong evidence that the article actually was published as it's found on Badboy's website.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 13:44, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
