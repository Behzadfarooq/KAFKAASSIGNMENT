<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">User:David Spart</a> created a new page called <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> which was mostly content from the <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> article and the controversy section of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a>. I believe that instead of having multiple articles on every aspect of the messianism and the controversy there should be one article on the controversy in chabad and perhaps a shorter article on the phrase of <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> and if that gets too long than to further split as per <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>. Therefore I had moved his new article to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_of_Chabad-Lubavitch_f92b.html" title="Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch">Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch</a> and merged in the rest of the controversy section of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">User:David Spart</a> does not agree with this. I am therefore putting this article up for deletion, to see what the consensus would be. Should everything go back to the way it was before with all the controversies staying in the chabad-lubavitch article or should just the messianism page stay separate along with a separate <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> page, or should the main article be controversies of chabad-lubavitch. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 12:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Bad faith nomination</b> I created the Chabad Mechanism page because that is the true nature of the issue. If you read the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_of_Chabad-Lubavitch_f92b.html" title="Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch">Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch</a> article you will note that the first section is unencylopdic blather about Chabad in general, and all the rest is either about of stemming from Chabad Messianism. PinchasC refused to allow me to write the article and kept deleting my material WHILE he knew it was still being written, despite requests. <b>Chabad Messianism</b> is worthy of a topic in its own right, check Google to get a taste. Numerous '<b>scholarly BOOKS and ARTICLES have been written on the topic</b> from many perspectives, many of them peer-reviewed.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>When the <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> article was nominated for deletion there was a strong consensus to keep. Note that all <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> is is the mantra that Chabbad Messianists use. IF that deserves an article obviously Chabad Messianism does!</li>
<li>PinchasC did not grant my request to allow the article a week or two to stabilise before he nominated it for deletion, to perhaps merge in the Yechi stuff etc. <b>He did not even nominate the article he wants to be deleted</b> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> for deletion because he knows that it would stay. He instead has tried to confuse the issue further (a theme in his edits on Chabad topics) by nominating an article for deletion that no-one wants to be deleted, so that it will stay - since no consensus will be reached to delete - and he will then use that as a pretext for deleting the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> article WITHOUT consensus , based on this smokescreen.</li>
<li>If PinchasC wants <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> deleted, then <b>he should rescind this bad-faith nomination and nominate THAT article for deletion</b> and stop merging articles without consensus.</li>
<li>PinchasC has long maintained the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_of_Chabad-Lubavitch_f92b.html" title="Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch">Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch</a> article in the parlous state that it is now in. Notice that in all wikipedia there is only ONE PARAGRAPH of discussion about <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a>. One of the biggest controversies in Post-War Judaism has one measly paragraph that is then followed by a lengthy OFF THE POINT attacks on David Berger from some marginal sources! <b>This is due to PinchasC's constant edit-warring to maintain the Chabad articles the way that he likes them. He is not a disinterested party, as anyone can see and should step back from editing Chabad articles for a while.</b></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The way it reads looks fine to me. AfD is not the proper venue for settling nomenclature brawls. Find consensus terms, use redirects, and have done with it. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I would not be opposed to a merge or restructuring of these articles as long as content is preserved. In particular, I agree that the current duplication of content on multiple articles is a problem, and hence I agree that there should be only one article on the subject of Chabad messianism and either <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> or vice-versa, and in addition, there only needs to be a summary on the subject in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_of_Chabad-Lubavitch_f92b.html" title="Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch">Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch</a> with a link to the main article. However, Chabad does have more than one controversy, and content on the other controversies, even if some characterize them as "blather", is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, encyclopedic, and should not be deleted. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 20:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and create a <i>seperate article</i> on <b>Chabad Messianism</b> which may or may not need to have <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> merged into it. I (as others have suggested above) have been concerned that editing articles on Chabad is closely controlled by admins such as PinchasC and Eliezer. This is not healthy. I sympathise with the creator of the above article, I recall similar problems about a year ago and see that nothing has changed. Well done for whoever managed to sneak the Yechi article past the gaurds - I asume that was in frustration at not being able to write a proper NPOV article on Chabad Messianism. <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuicifer_867e.html" title="User:Juicifer">juicifer</a> 16:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The multiplicity of articles seems in part to be due to an edit war. I'm not impressed by the references of any of these articles. Can anyone who wants to defend their own article be sure to (1) be sure that all the links actually work, (2) that any real published books have ISBNs? I'd allow all these articles to exist until there is one master article that is extremely well-sourced and is acceptable to the general Wikipedia community as being a good article. What's here now does not seem to meet the normal WP standards. For example, there are many claims made without in-line citations. We are supposed to take it on faith that the person writing the article is correct. The only article by David Berger that I could find was a web posting, that probably does not count as a reliable source by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. If this stuff is important, someone should be able to write an article that is well-sourced by general Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 22:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Perhaps a merge with the main Chabad article will do? Anyway, this article is already very well off and has no problems, is very informative, well-cited, good structure, . I have heard tell of PinchasC nominating it under an ulterior motive (not sure). <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoogster_f017.html" title="User:Noogster">Noogster</a> 03:07, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
