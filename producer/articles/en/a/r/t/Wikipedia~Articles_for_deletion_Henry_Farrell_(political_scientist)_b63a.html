<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> We <i>expect</i> academics to get hits for publishing, that's their job. You link didn't work for me, so I used <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Henry+Farrell%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Henry+Farrell%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">this.</a> I use what's cited and how often as a rough guide, and he's not cited often enough for me to thinks he's a notable in his field. He does get one mention on <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=%22Henry%20Farrell%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=%22Henry%20Farrell%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">Google news</a>, but that's a throw-away line at best.

</li>
<li><b>keep</b> - I just can't see the point of deleting. He's a real person, with real publications, he contributes to a notable blog - <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 09:55, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> There are a lot of entries for people notable mainly because they write or contribute to a notable blog that is listed separately, the closest parallel being members of <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volokh_Conspiracy_986a.html" title="Volokh Conspiracy">Volokh Conspiracy</a>. Farrell in addition has real publications and a media profile. I made the entry on that basis <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 11:35, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please do give examples so that I may at once merge them into their parent article where they belong. I notice that this article makes claims that Farrell is "quoted extensively in mass media" but fails to support those but with a single link where he's mentioned in passing and is paraphrased rather than quoted. I'd refer to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> where, with the evidence to date, he does not qualify. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 12:06, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Stated criteria at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> "better known and more published than the average professor" are met (link to CV added for latter point or use Google scholar). I agree that's a rather low bar, so I've added more media citations to back up notability <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 20:44, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not convinced that writing for any sort of blog is notable, and we're not likely to be able to find a lot of verifiable information other than from the blog, which I'd discount as a reliable source. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 12:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. His "publications" are what, a 27 page paper and some <i>blog</i> entries? Blogs are the ultimate vanity press; their writers have a <i>very</i> high bar to clear. If any real indicator of notability is asserted I may reconsider. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:53, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Google Scholar seems to have over 15 publications. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a>
<ul>
<li>Still not impressed, all academics publish something. Did he write any books or anything? 15 publications is hardly great, especially since some or all seem to be brief papers. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22mark+martindale%22" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22mark+martindale%22" rel="nofollow">the guy who's lab I used to sweep</a> gets more than that. In fact, I can probably take any scientist in that building and get comparable results (if I could only remember their names). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:03, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually Farrell has nearly twice as many Google Scholar hits as Martindale, and "Henry Farrell" gets 93000 Google hits, of which most front page items refer to the political scientist. "Mark Martindale" gets 380 hits, only a minority for the scientist.
<ul>
<li>Well, Henry Farrell is a <i>much</i> more common name, and don't you think that a few hits might be this <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Farrell_2952.html" title="Henry Farrell">Henry Farrell</a> (or one of thousands of others)? Maybe some of the google scholar hits too, I'm not sure.) In any case, small academic papers are not widely read, if he's had articles in major magazines, or any written books, we'd be on the right track. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:45, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As noted in the entry under dispute, he has an article in <i>Foreign Affairs</i> which is a <i>very</i> influential magazine, and this article was quoted in an editorial in the <i>Washington Times</i> among other media. On your point about other Farrells, please reread my comment. I checked the first 100 entries to verify that most referred to the Farrell in question, and not the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Farrell_2952.html" title="Henry Farrell">Henry Farrell</a> whose notability is undisputed.

<li>While not commenting on <i>this</i> discussion, I'd like to say that <i>that</i> AfD was a really crap example of how things should run. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">Testimony of editors is not a citation</a>, and having people simply say "notable blog" without (for example) providing links or references is somthing that we should, in the strongest possible way, discourage. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 00:08, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'd ask that when people contribute to an AfD, they take the time to attempt to improve the article as opposed to just saying "keep" and wandering off.<br />
