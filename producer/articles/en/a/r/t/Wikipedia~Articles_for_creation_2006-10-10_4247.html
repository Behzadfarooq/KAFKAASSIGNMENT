<p>Bills are drafted by a team of lawyers in the Parliamentary Counsel Office also known as the PCO., Each bill goes through a series of editings and checks, commonly known as "Readings." On the day of presentation, a “dummy” copy of the bill is placed on the Table. Once it has been presented, each bill is allocated a bill number. The bil number is printed on the bottom left-hand corner of the front page in square brackets, e.g. [Bill 4]. Each time the bill is re-printed, it is given a new number.</p>
<p>It may take up to a decade some times for a bill to be finished. Even then it may not be approved.</p>

<p>Angel Aircraft Corporation (AAC) was founded by Carl Mortenson. AAC's most noteable accomplishment is the aircraft dubbed "The Angel." The Angel is a pusher prop, twin-engine aircraft with Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) capabilities. The corporation and aircraft came about due to the lack of a quality twin-prop STOL aircraft available suitible for unpaved runways in undeveloped areas of the world such as Central America. The aircraft is designed to fulfill a missionary transport role.</p>
<p>The aircraft seats eight, is reported to have a starting price of $640,000, and boasts excellent take-off and landing figures for its size at less than 700 feet for the former and less than 600 feet for the latter.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-10_4247.html" title="Edit section: North Moreton">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">North Moreton</span></h2>
<p>The medieval manor of North Moreton is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. The manor house, where the Stapleton family lived was situated East of the church but can now only be identified by the remains of a moat. North Moreton retains many houses from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, despite the devastating fire in 1807 which destroyed one quarter of the village including one whole side of the main village street.</p>
<p>North Moreton has always been a village existing solely within Berkshire boundaries until 1974 a year which saw comprehensive reorganisation of local government in England and Wales. An indication as to how deeply North Moreton was embedded within Berkshire is indicated by the fact that Abingdon was the county town of Berkshire until 1867. Reading only became the new county town in that year taking over from Abingdon which remained part of the county until 1974. On this date several of the historic counties disappeared, new counties were created and all had significant boundary changes. North Moreton was swallowed up within Oxfordshire and despite losing the title of being within the 'Royal' county of Berkshire it is probably safer for the village to be within Oxfordshire.</p>
<p>"The first record of North Moreton is in the year 944 and it is one of many villages in historic Berkshire whose name ends with ton meaning a ` homestead'. The mor signifies, simply, a fen. With the arrival of the Normans in 1066 there came in due course Norman rule and a Norman church. North Moreton seldom had a resident lord of the manor though influential families such as the Stapletons played an important role over three centuries. The Stapletons largely rebuilt the church in the thirteenth century, endowing Stapleton’s Chantry with some unique glass from the period." The subsequent centuries have not been without their high and low points. "At the very end of the sixteenth century there was a ‘cause celebre’ in the famous witch-craft case bringing North Moreton to the national stage and leading to the allegedly-bewitched Anne Gunter going before the Court of Star Chamber and before King James I himself. An unusual feature of the Cromwellian period was the high number of marriages performed in All Saints church probably attributable to the lords of the manor being relations of Oliver Cromwell. North Moreton became acceptable for church weddings even when nationally they were forbidden.</p>
<p>Village life for centuries produced its even tenor of the rotation of crops and the struggle for existence - North Moreton was never a rich village as the lack of any monuments in the church testifies. But change in many directions came in the last one hundred and fifty years. The Enclosure Award (late- in 1849 ) stablilised the economy of the village. The growth of Didcot and the development of railways gave employment and a new vicar, Albert Barff brought fresh vigor to the community.</p>
<p>The village paid its debt to the nation in two World Wars and the later twentieth century has seen a change in population with many professional people making their way to London daily as commuters. But, in the end, the sounds of sheep bleating, combine harvesters at harvest time and of tractors down the High Street, remain evocative of a North Moreton whose eternal roots are in the soil."</p>

<p>The concept of grace ‘’anugraha’’ in Kashmir Shaivism is unique in comparison with other systems of both western and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_philosophy.html" title="Indian philosophy">Indian philosophy</a>. Where as the showering of grace in other systems is dependent either wholly or partly upon individual effort, in Kashmir Shaivism it is solely dependent upon the free and independent will ‘’svatantrya’’ of God – ‘’Paramashiva’’ (supreme Shiva) also known as ‘’Para Bhairava’’ (supreme ‘’Bhairava’’).</p>

<p>For the followers of Kashmir Shaivism, adhering to the monistic philosophy that God and only God exist, the idea that God should be subservient to the actions of an individual makes no sense. It is God alone who has expanded his own nature, in the form of a pulsating vibrating mass of light and consciousness (‘’prakasa’’ and ‘’vimarsha’’), and in doing so, it is God alone who has created the entire universe including the totality of individual beings that inhabit the myriad of worlds. In other words, it is God who has contracted his "unbounded universal Self" and become a "limited individual self" bound by space and time.</p>
<p>But the question must arise, "Why should God create the universe when he is already eternally full and complete in his own nature?"</p>
<p>The answer to this perplexing question, from the Kashmir Shaiva point of view is: "For the sake of play!"</p>
<p>For the sake of PLAY God loses himself in his own creation, for the sole purpose of eventually finding himself again, and experiencing his own true nature. It is within this play that God (Lord Shiva) expresses himself through his five great acts.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/w/a/Swami_Lakshman_Joo_99bb.html" title="Swami Lakshman Joo">Swami Lakshman Joo</a>, practically the last living exponent of the oral tradition of Kashmir Shaivism has explained this as follows:</p>

The five great acts of Lord Shiva are ‘’srishti’’, the creative act; ‘’sthiti’’, the protective act; ‘’samhara’’, the destructive act; ‘’tirodhana’’, the act of enfolding or concealing His nature; and ‘’anugraha’’, the act of unfolding or revealing His nature. Each of these acts is also accomplished by the individual soul. In the case of the individual, however, they are not called acts, but “actions” because this kind of act is dependent on the will of God, not on the will of the individual being.</p>
<dl>
<dd>‘’"The individual being does not act according to his own will; he cannot. He is dependent on the will of God, Lord Shiva. It is only God that is completely independent."’’</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is a difference, therefore, between “action” and “act.” Action is attributed to the individual soul and act is attributed to Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>If you believe that because the individual soul does not perform acts but only actions, and that he has no freedom and, therefore, cannot be held responsible for his actions, you are wrong. The limited individual is responsible for his actions. He does have ego and feels that he is acting himself. When he feels that he is acting himself, then he is responsible for his actions. If he were to feel that Lord Shiva is really the actor and that it is Lord Shiva acting, not himself, only then is he not responsible for his actions. But then, of course, he could do no wrong. In the kingdom of spirituality, Lord Shiva creates masters and disciples through His fifth act, the act of grace (‘’anugraha’’). This grace is nine-fold and, therefore, He creates masters and disciples in nine different ways.</p>

<b>Supreme Grace:</b> The first and highest level of grace is called ‘’tivrativra shaktipata’’. ‘’Tivrativra shaktipata’’ means super supreme grace.</p>
<dl>
<dd>‘’When Lord Shiva bestows super supreme grace on anyone, then that person becomes perfectly self-recognized. He knows his real nature completely and in perfection.’’</dd>
</dl>
<p>At the same time, however, this kind of intense grace cannot be resisted by his body, so he throws away his body and dies. This person becomes a master; however, he accomplishes the act of his mastery secretly in the deserving hearts of disciples. He is not visible in this world. Only those who are deserving experience his subtle existence.</p>
<p>The second intensity of grace is called ‘’tivra-madhya shaktipata’’. This is supreme medium grace. The effect of this grace of Lord Shiva is that the recipient becomes completely and perfectly illumined, but does not leave his body. He is said to be a ‘’pratibha guru’’, that is, a master who is made not by another master initiation, but by his self, by his own grace. He experiences spontaneous enlightenment. These particular masters live in this world with their physical bodies for the upliftment of mankind.</p>
<p>The third intensity of grace is called ‘’tivra-manda shaktipata’’, which means “supreme inferior grace.” In one who has received this grace the desire appears for going to the feet of a spiritual master. And the master that he finds has received the second intensity of grace, ‘’tivra-madhya shaktipata’’. This master is perfect. He is all-knowing. There is no difference between this master and Shiva. The master does not initiate him, rather, he simply touches him with his divine hand, or gazes upon him, or embraces him, and at that very moment this disciple, who is a recipient of medium supreme grace, perfectly transcends individuality and enters into that supreme transcendental state without the need of practicing ‘’japa’’ (recitation) or ‘’dhyana’’ (contemplation), etc. Although he still experiences pleasure and pain in his physical body, it does not affect him, as his being has become supreme.</p>
<p>That master who has received this particular intensity of grace, which is known as ‘’Rudra shakti-samaveshah’’, is called ‘’Rudra shakti-samavishtah’’ because he has completely entered into the trance of ‘’Rudra shakti’’, the energy of Shiva. He exhibits five signs which can be observed by others. The first sign is his intense love for Lord Shiva. The second sign is that whenever he recites any mantra, the ‘’devata’’ (deity) of that mantra appears to him at once without his having to wait. This is called ‘’mantra-siddhih’’. The third sign which can be observed is that he has control over the five elements. The fourth sign is that whatever work he begins, he completes that work without defect. And the fifth sign is that either he is a master of all the scriptures or he becomes a great poet.</p>
<p>Lord Shiva, through these three supreme intensities of grace, creates masters in the kingdom of spirituality. With lower intensities of grace Lord Shiva creates worthy disciples.</p>
<p><b>Medium Grace:</b> The fourth intensity of grace is called ‘’madhya-tivara shaktipata’’. This is “medium supreme grace.”</p>
<dl>
<dd>‘’"Through the effect of this intensity of grace, the disciple reaches the feet of that master who is absolutely perfect."’’</dd>
</dl>
<p>But because the foundation established in the mind of this disciple is not quite completely perfect, the mere touch or glance of this perfect master will not bring this disciple to enlightenment. He, therefore, initiates this disciple in the proper fashion by giving him a mantra and teaching him the proper way of treading. Through this initiation, the disciple becomes enlightened but during the period of the existence of his physical body, he is not completely satisfied with this enlightenment. When he leaves his physical body at the time of his death, however, he obtains completely satisfactory results from the initiation he had received earlier and becomes one with Shiva.</p>
<p>The fifth intensity of grace is called ‘’madhya-madhya shaktipata’’, which means “medium middle grace". When Lord Shiva bestows this particular intensity of grace upon someone, the intense desire for achieving the existence of Lord Shiva arises in this person’s mind. At the same time, however, he does not want to ignore the enjoyments of the world. He wants to enjoy worldly pleasure along with wanting to realize the existence of Lord Shiva. Yet the intensity of his desire is only for achieving Lord Shiva’s state. So, although he is initiated by a master and realizes his real nature as Lord Shiva, his real self, and enjoys the bliss of that state while remaining in his physical body, simultaneously he also enjoys the pleasures of the world. But as these worldly pleasures, which take place in this mortal field of the universe, are not real pleasures, at the time of his leaving his physical body, he enters into the kingdom of paradise (‘’svargaloka’’) and enjoys all the worldly pleasures to his entire satisfaction. After he has satisfied his desire for worldly pleasures, he does not come down again into this world but is again initiated by his master, who is all-pervading, while he remains in heaven. Through this initiation, he becomes complete and realizes the reality of his supreme nature and he enters into the kingdom of Lord Shiva and merges in Him completely from heaven itself.</p>
<p>The sixth intensity of grace is called ‘’madhya-manda shaktipata’’, which means “medium inferior grace.” The effect of this grace is very much like the effect of medium middle grace; however, the difference lies in predominance. The effect of medium middle grace is that in the mind of the disciple arises both the desire for attaining the state of Lord Shiva and the desire for experiencing worldly pleasures. The predominant desire, however, is for attaining the state of Lord Shiva. The effect of medium inferior grace is also that in the mind of this disciple arise both the desire for attaining the state of Lord Shiva and the desire for experiencing worldly pleasures. However, the predominant desire here is for experiencing worldly pleasures. Though he achieves self-realization, it is not complete because of the agitation he experiences seeking worldly pleasures. So at the time of his leaving his physical body, this intensity of grace carries him from this mortal world first to paradise, where he enjoys the pleasures of the world. But while in paradise he does not gain the fitness to begin practicing for attaining the realization of his self. He must, therefore, be again reborn and come down into this mortal field. And from that very birth he sentences his mind toward the fulfillment of his self-realization. Although his life in this mortal realm is very short, as Lord Shiva wants to carry him quickly to his own state, he becomes absolutely complete in that short span of time and enters, in the end, into the transcendental state of Shiva.</p>
<p>The above three medium intensities of grace take place in the field of aspirants living in the kingdom of ‘’Shivadharma’’. Those aspirants have the inclination to achieve the state of self-realization at least half hourly during the day and at least twice during the night. The remaining period they keep aside for worldly pleasures.</p>
<p><b>Inferior Grace:</b> The following three inferior intensities of grace—‘’manda tivra’’ (inferior supreme), ‘’manda-madhya’’ (inferior medium), and ‘’manda manda’’ (inferior inferior)—take place in the field of aspirants living in ‘’lokadharmah’’, the kingdom of worldly life. These aspirants have the desire for achieving self-realization, the state of Lord Shiva, only when the pains and pressures of this world become too much to bear. At that moment, they want to abandon everything and achieve self-realization but they are not able to, and though they want to leave this worldly life, they cannot. These aspirants have more tendency for worldly pleasure and less tendency for realizing their Self. But, as the grace of Lord Shiva shines in them, in the end, which may take many lifetimes, they become one with the supreme being.</p>
<dl>
<dd>‘’This is the greatness of Lord Shiva’s grace—that no matter what intensity His grace is with you, it will carry you to his nature in the end.’’</dd>

<p>Soweto Kliptown Youth (SKY) provides hope and services to some of the most neglected children in South Africa.</p>
<p>SKY's exemplary leaders and programs are the glue that connects people in need to support and opportunities. Name the need a child has and SKYwill be there to meet it.</p>
<p>The results are obvious! The minute you enter their neighborhood, the children are joyful an warm despite the many hardships they face everyday. They have pride, energy and talent and they abundantly share it with others. They have a chance to make it with SKY at their side.</p>
<p>Bob Nameng, SKY's founder, was a neglected street child who was given a second chance. He says, "I won't let any child suffer what I had to. They are our Kings ans Queens."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Youth Programs</b><br />
Founded in 1987, SKY has formal and informal programs to support children and teens including sports, performance arts, support groups, girls empowerment &amp;life skills classes. City Year has provided a team of afterschool tutors and mentors. The NBA has funded a new youth center complete with computers and books.</p>
<p><b>Care for the Aged &amp; Sick</b><br />
Theelderlyare also supported by SKY. They are driven to appointments. the women infected with HIV/AIDS have a crafts project. They make beautiful handcrafts witch are sold to the visitors to Kliptown.</p>
<p><b>Visitors and Tourism</b><br />
Visitors to Johannesburg hoping to connect with Africans will embrace the chance to visit Kliptown. Children will greet you with singing, dancing and smiling. If you are lucky, you will watch one of their powerful theatre productions. You can visit with the residents, see a home, and be touched by it all.</p>
<p><b>Conditions in Kliptown</b><br />
<i>Lack of infrastructure:</i> Shanty-type homes lack electricity and plumbing. No school, clinic, or library.<br />
<i>Lack of opportunity:</i> Unemployment is very high. Most adults lack education or source of incom. Youth have few productive outlets–school is not free and jobs are unavailable.<br />
<i>Health Crisis:</i> The HIV/AIDS epidemic leaves many children orphans. Low life expectancy.Linited access to health care.<br />

<p>Bob Nameng, SKY's founder, was a neglected street child who was given a second chance. He says, "I won't let any child suffer what I had to. They are our Kings ans Queens."</p>

<p>First featured on Andy Kershaw, "The Indestructible Sound of South Norwood" have made a genuine and very commendable attempt to collect a very distinctive mode of playing the penny whistle (see also flageolet).</p>
<p>I first heard Lemmy Mabuso (aka Lemmy Special) on my mother's old Jeremy Taylor records, a jaunty yet somehow melancholy sound, quite unlike the cheerful notes of James Galway. That feeling was entirely captured as "Kwela Claude" came over the airwaves courtesy of Mr Kershaw.</p>
<p>South African record sites have occasional CDs of the bigger Kwela stars, but the Positibely Testcard go one further, making up their own, and playing old standards in a Kwela style.</p>
<p>Supposedly derived from the Zulu shout for "get up" (i.e. get up and dance). Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Below submitted by David.</p>
<p>Sinful is a Magic trick designed by Wayne Houchin, www.waynehouchin.com .</p>
<p>Effect: A borrowed quarter and soda can of any flavour is borrowed from any member of the audience or brought from home. The quarter can then be signed and examined to establish that there can be no switches involved and the same goes with the can. The magician then tells the audience that every can has a soft spot in it, and if you find it, you can penetrate it with any small object, about the size of a quarter, through it without leaving any holes. The magician then INSTANTLY show BOTH of his hands to be empty and then shows every bit of the can to the spectators, the bottom through which the coin went through has no holes in it, nor does any other part of the can. The magician then approaches an audience member and shakes the can, everyone within earshot can hear the quarter hitting the can from the INSIDE. The magician then opens up the can and pours everything out (onto the ground or into a cup, even the spectator can be allowed to pour it out) and when the can is empty you can hear something moving inside. The spectator and the magician the shakes the can, or cuts it open and inside you can see the SIGNED quarter, completely untampered or fooled around with. The trick has no gimmicks and no preperation what-so-ever and everything is completely examinable.</p>
<p><br />
You can see Wayne performing this trick on his website www.waynehouchin.com in the videos section along with a few more of his amazing videos. He has also released Stigmata and is working on releasing Indescent; He also has a few more ticks on his site that he has not released (Thread) and Unreal is actually what he uses for one of his shows.</p>
<p>A note to all magicians out there who know or think they know the secret (Please do NOT delete): Remember that I have posted the effect and not the secret; Which is a reminder for you to follow suite, do not post the secret. You are only taking away from others if you do. Magic is supposed to remain magical, if you post the secret and somebody comes home from seeing a magic show and can find everything about it on here; You have just taken away that little spark that they had in their eyes during the show from the mystery of it all and at first they feel good that they know the secret, but they would feel even better by thinking about it and coming up with no explanation. That is what makes magic wonderful, please do not spoil it.</p>

<p>Homebake is a slang name of monoacetyl morphine in New Zealand and Australia. In Australia most manufature was limited to Western Austrailia. Homebake can be manufactured from over-the-counter and prescription painkillers and was popular in the late 1970s to 1980s due to the crackdown of the Herion supply in this time period. Clandestine drug laboratories established to homebake heroin have existed in New Zealand since the 1980s<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The “homebake” process involves use of the reagent pyridine hydrochloride to convert the codeine to morphine by removing the methyl- group. The brown morphine powder produced by this process is in the form of crude morphine base. This is generally reacted with acetic anhydride to give a brown or black tarry residue which contains a mixture of heroin, 3- and 6-monoacetylmorphines, morphine and other impurities.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Springfield Catholic Central is located in the once bustling city of Springfield, Ohio. While the majority of those who attend Springfield Catholic Central (SCC) are Catholic by faith, the strict, regimented lifestyles typically associated with Catholics is not present; in fact, little punishment/regulation is distributed. The average total population as of 2006 is two-hundred.</p>
<p>The principal is Jeanne Kuney. She came in 2005 after teaching at Fairborn where scandle was high and money was tight. Although SCC's debt is much greater than Fairborn's (totalling at about $1,000,000 as of 2006), this did not deter Jeanne Kuney from taking on the task of turning the school around. Teaming up with the "Irish Mafia" as Jim O'Dell refered to the supervising group including himself, Millie Vollmer, Steve DeWitt, Wilma Somers, and Jeanne Kuney, together under the premise of a Catholic Institution managed to go through an astounding number of faculty before arriving at the current staff. Only two years after Jeanne Juney's move to SCC, the school has produced more students with criminal activity and lower standardized testing scores and higher alcohol consumption rates than any other previous year.</p>
