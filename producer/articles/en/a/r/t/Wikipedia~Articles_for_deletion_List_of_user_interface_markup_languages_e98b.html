<p>I believe that this piece of information is best served with the User interface markup languages category. So, for redundancy's sake of redundancy, I propose that this article is deleted and all the references made by it may be preserved by the inclusion of the articles in that category. <a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 11:21, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Nothing wrong in this article. An article gives a different (more flexible) view other category. If we delete this article, all the articles in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_software_5eec.html" title="Category:Lists of software">Category:Lists of software</a> need to be deleted as well. No. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinghong_2ceb.html" title="User:Minghong">minghong</a> 11:24, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is redundant. Wikipedia has it's way of creating lists which has the ability to automatically group new articles in a category. Because a wikipedia's category can also serve as an article (it holds text and automatically groups the articles), the hand-made lists are a very poor way of doing things. So, to enforce wikipedia's way of doing things and to clean it up in the process, the deletion of this article in favour of a category listing is the right thing to do. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Maciel</a> 11:47, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is the same person that wrote the original request. Not everyone may notice it, because he altered his signature. At least I didn't until now. -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 13:21, May 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't altered the signature. The signature appears this way by default. I just press the "your signature and timestam" and the signatureappears this way. And, if you look carefully, why would I want to conceal my identity while signing all the posts with a reference to my user page? And on top of that, the administrators can compare IPs and my entries are all made by the same IP. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Maciel</a> 18:02, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry, this is my fault. Mecanismo wrongly put marked the page as "pending delete" and speedy deletion. I corrected that and created an entry here, signing using Mecanismo's name instead of my name as I thought Mecanismo won't comment here again. I was using the name <a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a>, which is clearly wrong. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinghong_2ceb.html" title="User:Minghong">minghong</a> 18:13, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK. I didn't look at the first edits. And I added more wrong-looking signatures for Maciel, because I used the first signature as a model. -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 19:52, May 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Non-exitent articles, if they are indeed relevant, should be created as stubs and added to it's respectful categories, which brings added value to wikipedia as a whole. Therefore, the "red link" argument is a non-argument. -<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 12:08, May 2, 2005

<li>You can't? Are you sure? You create an article, you add it to a category, you mark it as stub and there you have it. What's the dificulty in that? --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Maciel</a> 16:01, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>When you go to the category page, you can see only the titles of its articles. You can't see the article contents, so you can't read the them. Reading a book title isn't the same as reading a book. -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 16:16, May 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I believe you are wrong. The category pages are just like the article pages, with the added bonus of organizing the lists automatically. The category page can have an article if you write one there. Plenty of category pages have articles written in them. Therefore, a category page is better suited for list articles than a regular article. Nonetheless, the list article in question doesn't have content in it, which makes this a non-issue. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Maciel</a> 17:54, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, lists and categories can exist simultaneously. Lists can sort info in more ways than just alhabetically (like this one does). Can add birth dates in case of people. Non-existent articles should be created. But it's always better to create articles than mere stubs. If a link is blue, people expect an article, not just a few lines of text. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:24, May 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, in some cases simple list articles can coexist with category listings and in some cases they are even better suited. Still, undoubtedly category pages are better suited for this kind of list. Regarding the "better nothing than a little" point, I believe that you are wrong. If an article doesn't exist, people move on but If an article exists even in a stub form, the user has some information available. On top of that, the user can pick up where the article was left and bring in a small contribution, which is frequently done. Besides that, the stub articles are listed in a stub category, where users browse to see where they can contribute to developing articles. Therefore, there is only advantages in the "mark article as stub and add it to a category" way of doing things and so, this list (and others) is better suited as a category page instead of a simple article. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 08:06, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>If you wish to list an article that doesn't exist, create it, add it to the category, mark it as stub and move on, which is extremelly trivial thing to do and this has already been stated. On top of the strong points which make this the right thing to do, an article marked as stub gets the attention of contributors (being automatically listed in the stubs section), while a red link doesn't bring any added value whatsoever. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 07:54, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>When you create an article as a stub, some person has to look at it, and recategorize it as a specific <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_72d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting">type of stub</a>. Also the only type of stub that is really easy to create is <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubstub_c0ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Substub">substub</a> definitions, which are not encouraged. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:55, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The recategorization of a stub is a non-problem. But if someone believes it is a huge impediment, they should know that it is only made if the article is marked as a common stub. In the case of this article, that isn't needed. Please take a look at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7EComputer_language_stubs_2fdd.html" title="Category:Computer language stubs">category:Computer language stubs</a> --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 11:19, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
</dd>

<ul>
<li>Lists can include red links. Lists can include more information than a category does, such as birth and death dates, nationality, a little bit of information. Do you think we should get rid of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> because we can create a category:January 1 and add it to every page linked from the January 1 article? Look at all of the information that would be lost. And are you really trying to encourage the creations of thousands of substubs? Do you know how many people would come down your head because you created a tiny article for every redlinked entry in every list page? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:16, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I already refuted those points in the past. Please read the comments above. And I'm not claiming that <b>every</b> list created in a simple article page should be converted into category page. Only the lists which are, like this one, better served with a category article should be converted/removed in detriment of the category article. We, as wikipedians, should strive to add value to wikipedia, whether it is by the introduction of information and cleaning up the "bazaar" mess. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 02:06, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No one is saying the information that the list holds isn't usefull.
