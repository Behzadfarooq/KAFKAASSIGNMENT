Same as now. This article should technically qualify for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a> A1 and G4, but it's past the speedy-by date. Both WoWWiki and FFXIclopedia are vastly bigger wikis than GuildWiki (12k<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Special:Statistics" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wowwiki.com/Special:Statistics" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and 13k<a href="http://wiki.ffxiclopedia.org/index.php/Special:Statistics" class="external autonumber" title="http://wiki.ffxiclopedia.org/index.php/Special:Statistics" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> pages respectively vs. 8k<a href="http://gw.gamewikis.org/wiki/Special:Statistics" class="external autonumber" title="http://gw.gamewikis.org/wiki/Special:Statistics" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> for GuildWiki). However, if you compare Alexa data, WoWWiki<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=wowwiki.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=wowwiki.com" rel="nofollow">(5,667)</a> and GuildWiki<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=gw.gamewikis.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=gw.gamewikis.org" rel="nofollow">(6,475)</a> are vastly superior to FFXIclopedia<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=ffxiclopedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=ffxiclopedia.org" rel="nofollow">(46,062)</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand per Matticux78 and Artw: there are at least three uses for WAP and that doesn't account for whatever arcane uses exist by some notable sub-cultures.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the magazine was created prior to the rise of the web; I'm not surprised there are no hits.

I'm not sure how it can be interpreted as a "personal attack"; it was a fanzine created by a student who clearly was heavily influenced by Butler's work.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not a corp, so WP:CORP is the wrong standard to judge by. I think the specific standard should be <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, even though that is only proposed. There are a lot of career specific networking and continuing education associations. Finance has a bunch of them because <a href="../../../c/p/a/CPA_787d.html" title="CPA">CPAs</a> and some other finance professionals are required to meet ongoing continuing education requirements. This association is international (U.S. and Canada at least), but I haven't found independent reliable sources to make much of an article yet. Organizations like this frequently do and publish surveys on compensation for their field and other topics specific to the field. This one does that, and also publishes a journal, but I'm not sure if they merit keeping as an author - the journal is free to members and we have no data on non-member subscriptions. (Disclosure, I work in Finance, but have no relationship with this specific organziation.)<a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:54, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into the articles of the programs. I think the trend of Neighbours and Home and Away actors becoming pop musicians is largely due to these programs' huge popularity in the United Kingdom (are they still as popular there now? I have no idea. But it was <i>de rigeur</i> to watch them if you were aged 10-25 in the UK in the 1990s). This is strangely unmentioned in the article (Kylie would not be the global star she is now if not for her Neighbours celebrity appeal in the UK market) Other than that, these soaps arent really related. #Neiiiiiiiighbours... everybody neeeeeeds good Neiiiiiiiiighbours# #With just a little understanding.... Neeeeeighbours... can.... be-come..... good...... friends.........# or something like that. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:53, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into the two program articles, since there's no real link between them other than their being Australian.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. A merge would essentially mandate the same treatment for articles on each of the songs on the album, which isn't practical considering how jam-packed they are with song info. (Instead, I recommend that all song articles tied to this page be deleted, except the singles and any others that are notable for other reasons.)

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I know this band, every member, personally. The entire article is completely accurate. Justin Hearn did indeed die of an adhesive overdose while attempting to "get high".

<li><b>Comment</b>: Thirteen Thirty-Six meets the criteria for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> in that it "has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media" (ie. Bill Chapin. "Play Offs" Port Huron Times Herald, January 13, 2006 and Bill Chapin. “CD REVIEW: Five Ways to Kill a Pirate by Thirteen Thirty-Six” Port Huron Times Herald, April 28 2006). These articles also serve to verify the existence of Thirteen Thirty-Six and all claims made in the article, excepting the death of Justin Hearn.User:Casualtyken 01:32, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Unfortunately, most editors, such as myself, don't consider that to be a "non-trivial" mention in the strictest sense of the word; for example, there is a review of CDs published by local artists in the arts section of my local newspaper as well, but I would hardly consider any of them to be worthy of Wikipedia, as most of them are self-published EPs and whatnot. (There is a discussion about this on the talk page of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, I believe.) Assuming that there have been any mentions outside of the "home market" or if any of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria were otherwise satisfied, then I would be willing to reconsider. As it is, my vote still stands. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 13:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I am unsure as to why your <i>opinion</i> on what is non-trivial should outweigh my own or why you are so vehement in your argument against Thirteen Thirty-Six. I am shocked that you provide no more than a semblance of statistics (though "most editors... don't consider that to be a 'non-trivial' mention." hardly even resembles a fact) to support your assertion that the Port Huron Times Herald is a "trivial" periodical, even in the strictest sense of the word. There are currently no statutes concerning the definition of "non-trivial" for use as a reference for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> verification and therefore it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not a periodical is indeed trivial. Your opinion, or that of any other individual, weighs no more heavily than my own on this matter. Please clarify exactly how my support and citations aren't "good enough" for Wikipedia with anything other than personal opinions and challenges (or, if you prefer, a clarification as to how your opinions outweigh my own), and I will gladly concede the point.User:Casualtyken 18:16, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>See, this is the problem I have with your position. You say "if the information in this article is true." How can you base your position on an assumption like that? I was unable to find any really notable information about this person by researching on the internet, and you yourself even admit to finding the same result. So isn't it extremely obvious that most people haven't heard of him?

<dd>Would of, could of, should of. This article has been here over a year. There has been plenty of time to clean it up and provide something verifiable that fits with wikipedia policy. Obviously no one is interested in doing that. It also needs major re-write because it reads like a conspiracy theory blog entry. I also used usenet a lot and don't recall once hearing about this. This is subjective, and may not have been that notable. As they currently don't provide a single credible source for this article, its complete original research, especially given the style of writing used in the article.

The timestamp does not verify who wrote those messages. The timestamp can also be forged as can the from header.

<dd>I never made the leap from using a newsreader to one of the web-based alternatives like google groups, but does it just not show usenet content and allow you post to it through the web? Whether or not the specific google interface allows you to forge time stamps, I have no idea. But that group you're referring to is just a usenet group. Anyone can access that with a newsreader and forge their timestamp. Not-withstanding that, you cannot verify who made any of those individual posts which goes against <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> this is why forums are also not acceptable as sources. As for the primary source of what happens on usenet, there may not be a primary source. Regardless of how notable a topic this may be within the usenet community, if no one outside it has ever covered it (like say Wired) then you may not have a usable source. Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of all information <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and from WP:V "<b>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth</b>" Wikipedia is about verifiability not truth.

<dd>You may vaguely recall something called deja news? Google acquired their database sometime ago. Those archives go back to 11 May '81 [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1709527.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1709527.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>]. The database is certainly more secure than many, many sites that are routinely accepted as reputable sources. Indeed, much of the uproar over Deja was because of the concern that they kept your words set in stone, so you could never take them back. You can forge a datestamp easy enough on your usenet client, but that doesn't keep the server from accurately recording when and from where it received your message. Keep in mind, as Bryan pointed out, this is not a case of using a usenet post as a source for anything other than it's own occurence. In that context, this is about as reliable a source as you're ever likely to see for anything. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArker_a43e.html" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 00:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't justify keeping this article on the basis of a poor decision to keep another article. This article is also not in good shape. Its not written professionally, and doesn't contain a single credible source.

<dd>Published in <i>The New Hacker's Dictionary</i>, which - as the dead-tree version of The Jargon File - is semi-cited in the article. With regard to verifiability, Usenet postings are obviously primary sources about themselves. In this case the authorship of an individual post is irrelevant, as the article is about the meme, not the spreaders of it. I'm ambivalent on its notability - I think <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_is_no_cabal.html" title="There is no cabal">There is no cabal</a> is appreciably more widespread, and would support a merge - but deleting this on verifiability grounds is pretty wikilawyer-y. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 23:02, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

Articles on obscure pieces of net humour are very, very hard to ultimately source, especially when a lot of discussion about this stuff happened on some forums (or Usenet, in this case). My only defense when writing the article is that I certainly did not make <i>new</i> claims, just repeated the same stuff that people said when debunking this "conspiracy". So yeah, of course it <i>looks</i> like OR, while actually just KSRTPWRMFITHBAP (Kinda Shoddy Research the Professors Would Roast Me For If This Had Been a Paper). =) I certainly wouldn't begin such article nowadays... --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:39, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Okay, I've rewritten the article substantially and added many pre-Wikipedia references, including Salon, Wired, and Gambling Magazine. Also many mailing-list archives containing posts with Lumber Cartel references, thereby indicating that the concept has retained its notability. Also anti-spam companies calling themselves the Lumber Cartel. Also note that, despite Crossmr's concerns, Google Groups doesn't allow posting via an external newsreader, so you can't falsify your datestamps. I'll concede that the Wired article has a warning that the reporter later faced some verifiability issues regarding her sources... but the fact is, the article <i>mentioned</i> the Lumber Cartel as anti-spammers, and that's the point of notability of a meme. Remember, this is a hoax, a confabulation. The Lumber Cartel <i>per se</i> never actually existed, and no one is claiming it did; therefore, we need no more prove its existence than we need prove <a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_Man_3087.html" title="Piltdown Man">Piltdown Man</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 20:41, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>again, its not the existence that needs sourcing. Its the rest of the information put forth by the article. I've read the 5 acceptable sources (I've organized them) and while google groups doens't allow you to post via an external news reader, the usenet groups it allows you to read do. Not-withstanding google groups is no different than usenet, a forum, a blog or anything else that any random person can just create. It fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as a primary or secondary source.

<dd>Remember the threshold for inclusion on wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. Opinions and information culled from an unverifiable source, while many might believe it to be true, can't be used on wikipedia. They can be linked as external links, which I've done on the article. They might need to be sorted and gone through to ensure relevance to the subject. I would consider withdrawing the AfD, or supporting a keep on this article so long as a concensus was reached and enforced on this and other articles like it (i.e TINC) with regards to ensuring proper verifiability. If people aren't interested in keeping the articles within the policies and guidelines, then there is no other course but to delete them as essentially useless in the context of an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> per Mackensen, FOo. This is an important piece of internet culture and history. Deletion would be a travesty as well as a tragedy. As to the WP:V argument above, this is a clear case where the rule being cited was worded without this sort of case in mind. It would not be appropriate to cite a usenet post for a source 99.9% of the time, and it's a good rule on that basis. In this particular case, however, usenet posts are verifiable and verified primary documents! They're much better sources, in this particular case, than exist for most articles. It makes no sense to throw the baby out with the bathwater simply because a particular rule was worded with the majority case in mind. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EInterpret_all_rules_7caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Interpret all rules">Wikipedia:Interpret all rules</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_common_sense_cd4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Use common sense">Wikipedia:Use common sense</a> apply here. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArker_a43e.html" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 22:29, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>unfortunately the rule is a non-negotiable policy and a foundation for content on wikipedia. Usenet posts are not verifiable. Can you prove to me who wrote them? No you can't.

<li>Usenet posts are verifiable <i>as Usenet posts</i>. ie, if the relevant fact is that "x was posted to usenet" then a link showing that x was indeed posted to usenet serves as verification of that. You can dispute whether they'd be verification for the fact that "y wrote x" but categorically excluding all Usenet posts as references under every possible situation is going a bit far.

<dd>I didn't disclude it, its already been discluded by wikipedia policy and guidelines. WP:SENSE has no bearing in this, as it clearly states that WP:V cannot be worked around by another other guideline, policy or editor concensus, let alone an essay. I can already see problems with Newsgroup Spam, and its not a proper example. Their first citation is in fact original research. They're making a claim "x was the first piece of spam to hit the newsgroups", however their only citation is the actual post itself. Thats the definition of original research, because there is no independent verification for that fact. A published source has to make the claim or present that as fact for it to presented as such in the article.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 02:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The actually nitty gritty of it is meaningless here, because it boils down to: These things can be used as examples to illustrate a point, i.e. "Here is someone using TINLC in their signature on usenet", but you can't use it as a primary or secondary source for facts, opinions, theories, etc that you want to include in the article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 04:09, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Additionally, Courtney has been elected to the Connecticut General Assembly, has raised millions of dollars of campaign contributions, and is one of the more prominent politicians in the state.

What we have now is not a full article but a tiny stub that has no business being an article of its own.

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, Chris Murphy is notable as a State Senator. He's the Assistant Majority leader of the Connecticut State Senate, the author of the Connecticut civil unions law, the chairman of the Senate Public Health committee (which, if you know anything about Connecticut politics, you'd know is of the two or three most important committees in Hartford). But even if he weren't a State Senator, he'd be notable, because he's the Democratic Party's candidate in one of the fifty most closely watched Congressional races in the country. The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines do allow "major local political figures who receive significant press coverage" to receive WP pages, and Murphy, who has twice been featured on the front page of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> certainly and unequivocably qualifies.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 00:40, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> You can't seriously believe that a three-term State Senator, the chairman of the Connecticut Senate's Public Health Committee, the author of CT's civil unions law, and one of the more prominent politicians in the state is not prominent enough for a Wikipedia entry. The guidelines cited are proposed, not active, and anyway would not affect Chris Murphy who is a prominent elected politican. This RFD seems like a partisan attempt to include only one candidate in the upcoming House race, which is non-neutral and contrary to the NPOV purpose of WP.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 22:05, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not so. Most of the editors come from way outside the district in question, and have no interest whatsoever in this campaign. What is objected to is the blatant posting of campaign materials for the candidate and calling it an article. In other cases, the article ends up as only a sentence or two saying the subject is a candidate, nothing more. Neither applies here. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 23:15, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If you feel that the article is insufficiently NPOV, then by all means, submit your suggestions and edit the article to make it so. But if Sen. Chris Murphy, of all people, isn't sufficiently notable, then neither are all but a relative handful of the biographical entries on WP. This is a powerful, prominent figure, and excluding him simply because he's a candidate for higher office seems silly and contrary to the purpose of WP.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 00:35, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually I only included this article for deletion in response to the deletion of the Diane Farrell article (see link to discussion above). I supported keeping that article of a democratic candidate. I am only trying to be consistent. Plus Murphy's opponent deserves a page as a sitting congresswoman. Moreover, Murphy really is a minor CT politician (being from CT I know this). Nevertheless, I think an article on the race itself is warranted.--<a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERexRex84_f2f9.html" title="User:RexRex84">RexRex84</a> 23:17, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>The deletion of the Diane Farrell article was a travesty -- 'Diane Farrell' gets 4.7 million Google hits, 118 current Google news articles, has raised more money than the vast majority of sitting members of Congress, and is perhaps the most prominent Congressional challenger anywhere in the country. If new or proposed WP standards don't count her -- or Chris Murphy (who dispite what you say is one of the most powerful members of the State Senate) -- as sufficiently prominent people, then it is those standards that are lacking. Excluding biographies of prominent politicians would place a chilling effect on the amount of useful information available on WP. It also has the perhaps-unintended effect of editorializing in favor of incumbent politicians at the expense of their often equally notable challengers. We may not need WP pages on every single person who has ever run for elective office, but Diane Farrell and Chris Murphy are serious, well regarded politicians who have each raised millions of dollars, and who's names are justifiably familiar to the majority of residents of Connecticut. Keep the bios non-partisan, but don't remove someone's bio just because they're a politician.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 00:30, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Diane Farrell article was merely 'candidate and member of town council'. If she <i>had</i> raised millions of dollars and had statewide notice, it wasn't in the article.

<p><b>Question:</b> Is there a rule that if the subject of an article doesn't exist on google or Yahoo that it is considered unreliable. Come on, Just if something doesn't happen to come up on a search engine that is always 100% reliable, why should it be deleted. Also it is new on the internet and it will catch on (I think)...

<li><b>Delete.</b> Sorry, it's not that I have anything against the videos or anyone involved with them, but more that I don't see their usefulness on Wikipedia; we <i>clearly</i> can't have an article for every video ever made, so there has to be a cutoff point. Cutoff points favored by many editors can be found at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">WP:MEME</a>. Per <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">WP:MEME</a>, this article's subject has no major media exposure; a web meme like <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base.html" title="All your base">all your base</a>, however, would be encyclopedically notable because of mass media attention. Other questions to ask include, "Will this article be useful and helpful to people a year from now? Ten years? A hundred years?" Is the article's subject notable enough to be historically relevant? Make sense? Thank you all for your time, and I hope that none of you take this as a comment on the work itself; I wish you nothing but success. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 11:02, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not quite sure how this one isn't vanity for a non-notable radio show. There's no evidence that this has been syndicated or widely broadcast (the article doesn't assert this), and while the article does assert that the show is "award-winning," there no source to back this up or even any information on what awards this show has won and when.

<li>Yeah. Good point. I sort of realized that after my initial search, but I saw 600 results, so I didn't think that the result was too notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I did not write the article, but I've contributed substantially to it. The article does not claim that the <i>show</i> is award-winning, but that it includes music from <i>artists</i> who are award-winning. This refers to country music stars <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy.html" title="Buddy">Buddy Miller</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Miller_0eb2.html" title="Julie Miller">Julie Miller</a>. Buddy has won Song of the Year and Album of the Year awards from the Americana Music Association, according to wikipedia's page on him (which I have not contributed to). I believe the involvement of the Millers in this project makes it notable, in addition to the reason advanced above (i.e. the number of stations that syndicate it) and its success on CD and cassette. I'd agree that the show probably does not warrant separate pages for each character, but the article itself does not warrant deletion. -- <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsonLine_0a15.html" title="User:CrimsonLine">CrimsonLine</a> 21:31, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result was&#160;: Alexa rank is unlikely to mean anything much to our readers (yes, not everyone here edits) and the claim made is very shaky grounds for notability. The second-highest? Really? Because it's "316,670"? What, only one of the 316,669 sites above it are related to Tango?

<dd>Thanks for asking. No I am not voting for the deletion. The website is the second most used among tango dancers, so I don't really understand why you vote for deletion. It also has some unique feature which make it valuable for tango music collectors. I very often tried to bring tango people to edit in wikipedia, but most of them simply don't do it, sometimes because they don't like WP very much. I wrote the article myself, since I know the website quite good. I also started an article on <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todotango.com.html" title="Todotango.com">todotango.com</a> - nobody accuses me of vanity there. I also started <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tango_music_labels.html" title="List of tango music labels">List of tango music labels</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tango_singers.html" title="List of tango singers">List of tango singers</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_public_domain_tangos.html" title="List of public domain tangos">List of public domain tangos</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociedad_Argentina_de_Autores_y_Compositores_de_M%C3%BAsica_51aa.html" title="Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música">Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música</a>, I edited other tango related articles. I created lots of stubs for locations where tango people where born. I asked lot of people to create basic tango articles in other language wikipedias, since I don't speak romanian etc. I love tango.

<li>I don't believe this spam. I can't see that Tobias Conradi is acting in anything other than good faith. He has clearly been chucking just about every tango related resource he can at Wikipedia... his website happens to be, in fact, one of the most notable ones. And in fairness, we are talking about what seems pretty clearly to be the internet's second biggest resource on the entire tango genre - we're not talking about a "fansite" as if for a minor rock or pop group. Should we include the second biggest website on the classical genre, for instance? I think we should. It's also clearly not a commercially-led website driven to sell viewers as much as possible: in fact it appears to be an extremely useful database. Bear in mind that we do keep comparatively minor (in "it's small when you compare it to the whole internet" terms) statistical databases for sports, at least partly, I suspect, because they are used so often in our references. The article is pretty badly written, but it's certainly not written as an ad. It's very easy to get hot under the collar because the page has been written by the site's creator - it would have been a better idea to allow somebody else to do so - but given that (1) it's a useful database of encyclopedic information (which means we should brush over it less harshly than we would for a forum or sales-based site), (2) it seems notable within the tango community, (3) tango is not just a minor band, it's actually a major musical genre, and (4) there is sufficient material to write a substantial article without it verging anywhere near an advert, I think that there's a chance this should be given the benefit of the doubt and <b>kept</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 22:50, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

The site offers many imports from foreign countries, which the seller visits personally to satisfy the needs of collectors. The online shop also makes a large array of promo's and out of print titles available to collectors.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the basis for this article (Chinese character for "boat" = proof of the Flood being recorded in ancient Chinese writing) comes from a book, then the title of the article should be a title of that book and the content should be a summary of that book. Otherwise, to draw a conclusion and assume that an argument from an author is a "fact", is totally POV and non-encyclopedic. This is the same degree of speculation as that book by <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavin_Menzies_f56b.html" title="Gavin Menzies">Gavin Menzies</a> - 1421: The Year China Discovered America. I mean, just because an author - Gavin Menzies - put forth an argument that the Chinese discovered the Americas in 1421 doesn't translate that into a "fact" and doesn't mean that we can make an encyclopedic Wiki article on that, unless the article itself a synopsis of the book. It's at best a hypothesis, not even a "theory". Furthermore, another reason why this article is Original Research: the "pros" and "cons" points beings put forth in this article cannot be found in any references and reflect the opinions of the editors. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeilme_f25a.html" title="User:Heilme">Heilme</a> 21:11, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article is of a non-notable fast food outlet (and may well have been created as a joke). NB: possibly the establishment's name is "BoBo's Chicken" according to the one Google reference I could find (a blog entry). Also: I originally "prodded" this, but then an anon. removed the prod notice 4 days later for what I suspect was a spurious reason. What a drag. <a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a> 10:22, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Here's a brief summary of the article as I read it... Paragraph 1: BoBo's Chicken exists. Paragraph 2: This is what you can order. Paragraph 3: There's no seating. Paragraph 4: Unsourced, likely unverifiable statements about people who dine there. Paragraph 5: Rumors which really don't belong in any sort of article. Paragraphs 4 and 5 probably need to be exterminated, and the first three paragraphs really establish zero notability. I'm not sure if there's even a claim of notability, unless it's the parking lot/no seating thing. I say <b>delete</b> it. GassyGuy 10:50, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Retort</b>I understand what you are saying and thank you for your advice - I often find it hard to argue cogently without using 'Legaleeze' as it is known. I would thus like to take a different approach. TBF2 (Total Battlefield 2) is the leading authority on BF2. Thus I would take their word as 'credible'. To this end i would point you to this post: <a href="http://www.totalbf2.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1000117" class="external free" title="http://www.totalbf2.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1000117" rel="nofollow">http://www.totalbf2.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1000117</a> , made by the owner of the site - who also happens to be involved with IS - who run tournaments across the internet which involve thousands of players. Again a notable source. Further more Planet Battlefield, another very notable source for BF2 information noted the PR Tournament (of which ASOG is at least half). <a href="http://planetbattlefield.gamespy.com/pagetools/pagetools.php?act=printnews&amp;id=83266" class="external free" title="http://planetbattlefield.gamespy.com/pagetools/pagetools.php?act=printnews&amp;id=83266" rel="nofollow">http://planetbattlefield.gamespy.com/pagetools/pagetools.php?act=printnews&amp;id=83266</a> . BF1942 Match also commented on the commencement of the tournament <a href="http://www.bf1942match.com/view.news.php?id=551" class="external free" title="http://www.bf1942match.com/view.news.php?id=551" rel="nofollow">http://www.bf1942match.com/view.news.php?id=551</a> . Also in Germany the Tournament is recognised. <a href="http://bf2.4players.de:1045/index.php?area=1&amp;p=news&amp;newsid=556&amp;koobi=faf5933f9713511bbb1f83f6888985bc" class="external free" title="http://bf2.4players.de:1045/index.php?area=1&amp;p=news&amp;newsid=556&amp;koobi=faf5933f9713511bbb1f83f6888985bc" rel="nofollow">http://bf2.4players.de:1045/index.php?area=1&amp;p=news&amp;newsid=556&amp;koobi=faf5933f9713511bbb1f83f6888985bc</a> . ABR - a group recently consulted by DICE and EA (the companies responsible for creating BF2) - also referenc ethe tournament on numerous occasions. <a href="http://www.battlefieldranking.net/4/24.html" class="external free" title="http://www.battlefieldranking.net/4/24.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.battlefieldranking.net/4/24.html</a> . Battlefield Files also references PR Tournament. <a href="http://battlefield2.filefront.com/news/Project_Reality_Tournament_Campaign_2_Signups;27357" class="external free" title="http://battlefield2.filefront.com/news/Project_Reality_Tournament_Campaign_2_Signups;27357" rel="nofollow">http://battlefield2.filefront.com/news/Project_Reality_Tournament_Campaign_2_Signups;27357</a> . Another site is here <a href="http://www.infragiliscommunity.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.infragiliscommunity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.infragiliscommunity.com/</a> . By this time I am very bored of finding so many links simply by GHITS for <i>"Project Reality Tournament". I do however recognise there is an argument that states ASOG is only a part of the tournament and thus is perhaps a 'closed garden'. To argue against that I would state that anybody who is interested in the tournament (and many are - as I established above) have to be interested in both teams! Otherwise there would be no tournament! Thus the figures for memebership of the sites show popularity again. I hope this has laid out my case more clearly.

<p>The so called "phenomenon" returns only 25 results in Google Groups, of which most consist of a single usenet user's signature. On the world wide web, almost all returns are reproductions of the wikipedia entry, or unrelated websites such as "zamanfou casino" and forum usernames. In fact describing "zamanfou" as some complex Greek social phenomenon, when in fact it is nothing more than a slang expression, similar to <i>"devil may care"</i>, while amusing, is completely incorrect. Last time I checked what Wikipedia was not, I read that <b>Wikipedia is not a Dictionary or jargon guide</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kpapatelios (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kpapatelios_c2ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kpapatelios">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>This is typically a vanity article; the only person interested in it is its author. The issue has been covered in a single sentence in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_updraft_tower.html" title="Solar updraft tower">Solar updraft tower</a>, and that is probably more attention than it deserves anyway. We have seen a proliferation of "Solar Tower" type articles in the past. Just a few months ago we had 3 almost identical articles <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_Tower_9681.html" title="Solar Tower">Solar Tower</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_chimney.html" title="Solar chimney">Solar chimney</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_Tower_Buronga_7bbc.html" title="Solar Tower Buronga">Solar Tower Buronga</a>, all of which were riddled with commercialism. Those 3 articles have now been merged into one single article, i.e. <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_updraft_tower.html" title="Solar updraft tower">Solar updraft tower</a>, which btw still needs a lot of cleaning up as it bears the traces of its torturous past. But these kind of articles keep popping up; another example of that is <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vortex_engine.html" title="Vortex engine">Vortex engine</a>.

<li>I already put in a single line about it. I wouldn't want to spend more characters on it, because it is one of those hairbrained schemes that wouldn't work. What the author didn't think of is that the Solar chimney is based on the fact that there is a pressure difference between outside and inside the tower; and that pressure difference gets bigger the higher the tower gets. Schlaich actually describes the use of internal bracings (spokes) to strenghten the tower. In short: The tower needs to be pretty sturdy to keep it from collapsing under the pressure difference, and it will therefore be far too heavy to keep it up with balloons. <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdH_4dd2.html" title="User:JdH">JdH</a> 02:10, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether it would work is not necessarily the point. It has been published about, so citable references are available, and it is a variation from building a concrete tower.</li>

<p>The arguments about weight and strength could be used to prove that neither a <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> nore a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a> can fly, too. Those floppy "men" at used car yards are a lightweight tube with air flowing through them. In that case, they are powered by a fan or air compressor, not a solar collector and chimney effect, but they do stay up <b>because</b> of the pressure difference—stability is the issue. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 05:13, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In that case there is a <i>positive</i> pressure difference; in the case of the solar chimney there is a <i>negative</i> pressure difference.

<li><b>Keep</b> Search for "Tara Whelan" on www.google.ie and see what comes up. This was a national news story in Ireland for the summer of 2005. Just because it means nothing to you, try and show some shread of respect for the grievence of another nation. This incident showed how terrorism effects ordinary people. If anyone agrees that this should be deleted, well why not delete the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2005_London_bombings_333a.html" title="July 2005 London bombings">July 2005 London bombings</a> while you're at it? That was the main story in Britain in summer 2005, and this was the main story in Ireland. Consider keeping it and do a more thorough search for notability, you'll see that this is a very notable story. The death of this girl moved an intire nation, which could have also contributed to the end of the IRA's armed campeign, after seeing how a person from their country could be taken with such an ammount of inconsiderate bloodshed at the hands of another terrorist group.

<li><b>Comment</b> An act of terrorism is notable but being a victim of that act is not in itself notable. This article is not about the incident as the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2005_London_bombings_333a.html" title="July 2005 London bombings">July 2005 London bombings</a> is. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 15:31, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I see where you're coming from but I also ask you to reconsider. Please see the external links on the page. As you may know, young <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bulger_5e73.html" title="James Bulger">James Bulger</a> was also taken through an act of evil, his story also bringing a nation together (Britain). I understand that it was the trial that attracted most attention, but it was the death itself that brought grievence and confusion to ordinary lives on a large scale.

<li><b>Merge</b> If there isn't an article about the bombing itself(after a quick search I couldn't find one) then one should be created and the bulk of this information merged into it. If this person's death had the political impact in Ireland that the author asserts it did then it should be kept, but within an article about the terrorist attack and its consequences. This article should then become a redirect/diamg. --<a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> 17:56, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Stifle, if you admit that you remember the news, well then why suggest that this article be deleted? Are there not articles about other murders on Wikipedia? I believe there are. Wikipedia is universal after all, or so I understand. If this happened to a person of another nationality it would most definately by kept. Sorry if it sounds like I'm accusing you of being unpatriotic or anything, that is not the case. Just interested in why this article is still listed for deletion, even given the amount of reliable background and information sources in the form external links, media files, etc. Please do not take this comment in the negative.

<li>Notability has been stipulated to not be in question. So the term exists. As I understand the argument of the nom as of now, (it seems to have shifted around a bit, I can't quite tell though) the contention is that the article is bad, and that no one has fixed it since it has existed, and that it's not sourced. The nom seems to have a strenuous objection (near as I can tell) to the use of the Jargon Dictionary. The JD is a published and purchasable work with an ISBN, which is itself highly notable and has existed for a very long time relative to most internet things, by a notable author who many recognise as an expert in this area of culture. I think the objection to the JD as a source is therefore clearly unfounded. I think the article itself could stand improvement but is already sourced and cited adequately enough as of this moment. I think the suggestion that this article is OR is spurious. <b>Strong keep</b>. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:39, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>actually I've addressed the Jargon dictionary being a source, its only a source for an explanation of TINC and absolutely nothing else in the article.

<dd>Bear in mind that the linked "backbone cabal" article in the Jargon Dictionary contains more information on TINC.

In addition this article has been here a long time, and its been in the unsourced, original research state that it is now for about the same amount of time. If no one wants to maintain it and bring it up to wikipedia standards why keep it? Maybe to save time we should just create one-line stub articles on every notable topic and piece of information on the planet and hope someone comes around and actually turns them into something worthy?

<p><b>Keep</b> Why is this article up for deletion? People proposing deletions need to state reasons, rather than expecting authors probably not familar with Wikipedia bureacracy to second guess them or wade through reems of policy waffle.

<dd>Wow, good guess! Not-notability it is. For the record, if this car's claim to fame was that it holds the record for the quickest 13B turbocharged, tubbed drag car in the United States, then I would feel just as strongly that it should be deleted. Even if it were the quickest 13B turbocharged, tubbed drag car in the entire world, I would still be nominating it. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, like which car held the record for the quickest 13B turbocharged, tubbed drag car in New Zealand in 2006. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 01:40, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Er, Cute Gurlzz is a free resource that makes no money and promotes no business. Its not spam, its not shameless promotion and its a fair reference to the term Cute Gurlzz which is unique. The site makes available free images for people to use as avatars and icons or in anyway they wish. The use of the word Funner is a fun derivation of the word fun, to have fun, having fun.</p>

<p>Its not my only contribution i'm mentioned elsewhere but you also seem to have deleted my other stuff as well even though people in exact same position are alloed to keep their stuff on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>All I can say is that maybe I could rewrite the entry more in the third party. Geez, you people are so low. Its a unique web site that has been running for over two years, Cute Gurlzz are unique, they are like Play Boy Bunnys, its like having a reference for My Space. My Space is a networking site etc. Cute Gurlzz is an established site for girls to get a free drawing. There are no Google Ads, no Adverts, no links, no requests for money, and moreover, Wikipedia is not going to generate any traffic for the site. I just thought as I had a bit of time i'd do a Wikepedia. All I can say is that maybe I could do with making the listing more objective.</p>
<p>I run a web directory myself thats free and I never behave like this with people, you know, if theres something lacking you should correct it, not judge, especially when you havn't looked at the site, I can see that only one of the top four 'judgees' actually looked at the site. And since then 1-2 more people have had a quick glance. Its only 1 page with a database of images.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a <i>barrani</i> I hear about him a bit even outside of Wikipedia.. There have been mentions in various papers. I have personally made use of this article (knowing that it attracts random unverifiable edits) in helping get a basic understanding of a person I considered notable prior to WikiPedia editing. As to verifiability, let's look at it.. The first paragraph seems fairly verifiable, the accusations link to news articles. Political Vision I suppose could be compared with the official website. As to quotes and trivia, I don't know how those could be verified. I do realize this is a controversial person, however I think Wikipedia would be doing the world a disservice to simply delete an article about what is in my opinion a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notable</a> person. <i>Just my Lm 0.02</i>.. 「<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrl_00fb.html" title="User:Srl">ѕʀʟ</a>·<a href="../../../s/r/l/User_talk%7ESrl_6b5f.html" title="User talk:Srl">✎</a>」 21:36, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cautious Keep</b> Would not be a notable person in a larger country, but for Malta, this does seems to be a notable local right-wing nut politician. The article needs a lot of cleanup though for verification. Statements such as "He is the founder of Ch'uan Shu in Malta" need checking.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Whooaaa... take a breather. Let's all be civil and assume good faith of one another; we're building an encyclopedia together, let's remember that. Anyway, a couple things: 1) If we were to assume that this was a bad article, the fact that there are other bad articles isn't a reason to keep it around. 2) I tried visiting the link you helpfully included after the guy's birthdate, but it seems to require that the user log in. Is there another source available? I'd like to confirm the date, but for various reasons I'd like to not sign up on the forum, if possible. 3) I don't see how the article is biased, either, and I think there's a good claim for notability, but there are some statements that haven't been verified yet. By the way, a heads-up: I think I'm going to delete the Alternet link, given that Alternet isn't really a reliable source; the other sources should more than carry the weight. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 10:50, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Sorry about that. 1) I just wanted to point out that there are loads of Malta-related articles of very little interest, arguable notability etc, yet nobody seems to nominate them for deletion. Why? Oh yeah, because nobody cares that they're there. Yet, everybody cares about the Norman Lowell page. Why? Because most Maltese people give more importance to him than the President? 2) Yes, sorry about that, but it's the only source I know of. There shouldn't be a fuss surrounding this issue though, why would I make up his age? Who cares anyway? 3) Virtually everything in the article is verified I believe.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrew88_ff5f.html" title="User:Drew88">Drew88</a> 11:40, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> 1) I would agree that a lot of it has to do with his presence on the fringe. A lot of people don't like him - myself included - and sometimes we allow our biases to creep in. As for 2), I don't know why you would make up his age, but one of the five pillars of Wikipedia is verifiability. It's one of the most important elements of Wikipedia, and while many people can argue over whether something is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> or not (I'm embroiled in one such dispute elsewhere), there needs to be at least an attempt to edit according to that principle. Also, Wikipedia has received legal threats from people upset over inaccuracies in their birthdate and other vital stats, as well as media ridicule, so it's one of the things that people try to watch over like a hawk. As for 3), the trivia section isn't well-sourced, particularly the bit about Dionysian Action Painting, and the assertion that he was banned from television specifically following the racist remarks isn't sourced right. But these are problems to fix, not matters to delete an article over. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 12:04, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you visit "Imperium Europa" you will actually find numerous newspaper articles mentioning him and his group.

<p>Sir, I it is commendable that you deem yourself the bastion of truth and judger of worthiness for content, however, when an athlete is ranked nationally in an individual sport, and accomplishes things none or few have, it is noteworthy. I'm sure your talents could be put to better use than harassing a viable article. In addition, there are more than 22 google hits and that is saying more than the majority of the "notable" athletes contained in this index.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.88.67.230 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.88.67.230.html" title="User talk:63.88.67.230">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.88.67.230_ec66.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.88.67.230">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>The result was <b>history merge</b> with <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events_in_Hong_Kong_ebf7.html" title="Current events in Hong Kong">Current events in Hong Kong</a>. Several things to take note of here. First, it is true that we now have two duplicate articles. Second, the page was moved by "copy-paste", which is the <i>wrong</i> way to move things because it fragments the article history. Note that calling for deletion because we already have an article and "there is no need to keep the history" is calling for a violation of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">Gnu Free Documentation License</a> which is absolutely <i>fundamental</i> to Wikipedia, and trumps consensus. Simple deletion of this article without deleting <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events_in_Hong_Kong_ebf7.html" title="Current events in Hong Kong">Current events in Hong Kong</a> is therefore out of the question.</p>
<p>The reason for the nomination is that the article so far only contains current events from <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, and nothing from <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macau.html" title="Macau">Macau</a>. Against this, it has been argued that the article previously contained current events from Macau. It has then been pointed out that there are enough current events to justify a separate <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events_in_Macau_f205.html" title="Current events in Macau">Current events in Macau</a> article (although it should be noted that such an article does not yet exist, if anyone wants to create one, by all means do so.)</p>
<p>I am calling this a history merge primarily because a cop-paste move was executed, which needs to be fixed. It may happen that the article <i>ought</i> to cover both Hong Kong and Macau (which would mean moving the article back), but I will leave that discussion for the article's talkpage or <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>. For now though, I'll consolidate the page histories. Since the article's current title suggests that the article is about Hong Kong only, I will delete the subsequent redirect (which will be without any history, so GFDL is upheld) as well. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I see the sources problem - I think it can be fixed, even though this kind of sports events are not commonly mentioned in mainstream media - hence the number of advertorialoid reviews in trend sport magazines. The article is however not about the company, but the sport, and should be treated as such. <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snakeboard.html" title="Snakeboard">Snakeboards</a> have a similar history - a single company holding a patent. I therefore do not understand the aforementioned sentence or the article as an advertisement for the company. -- <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavn_7482.html" title="User:Ravn">Ravn</a> 10:54, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmmm... The way I thought it worked is that Google takes the 500 top hits and displays the unique ones among those (430 or something, in this case).

<li>You know, I have a hard time believing that you are sincerely asking for links or references. Didn't you sum it all up above when you said there were almost no google hits, or "zero" news items? Before quoting, once again, from the guideline that we all know. I really wonder what kind of "google trawling" you do. In any case, let me be quite clear. I'll be happy to start posting links and other excerpts from a broad range of publications, all written by real live reporters, into this discussion, if you promise to then add them as references to the article. Because I'm sure you'll agree - given your interest in google - that Freebord and its <a href="http://www.google.fr/search?q=Freebord&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.fr/search?q=Freebord&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">125,000 google hits</a> is just as important as <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frog_cake.html" title="Frog cake">frog cake</a> and its <a href="http://www.google.fr/search?q=%22Frog+Cake%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.fr/search?q=%22Frog+Cake%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">836 google hits</a>. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:05, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not sure why you're searching in french, or why you've chosen to personalise this by bringing up a minor article that I've edited, but if you'll notice that when I <i>did</i> edit it I added sources from The national heritage trust of South Australia, The Australian National University, and Australian Radio National - all found via my "interest in google." If you can <i>please</i> provide some actual sources, as opposed to odd character attacks, this would be a non-issue. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 00:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not personalizing anything, but I do have an aversion to people who dump misinformation into these debates - such as your remarks on few google hits, or no news hits- particularly when they can't be "arsed" to look, but do have the time to quote ad nauseum from guideline pages. I'll take your comment to mean that you plan on redacting your initial comment and will add references and links to the article. Here is a small sample. Note that there are many, many more article sources, including all the coverage in specialized publications and certain mass market publications, that can not be linked (Playboy, Spin, Japan Times etc.)--<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:06, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why is this a problem? I just attended the Manchester Expo, had a piece performed, and delivered a paper.

Perhaps there should be a policy about the notability of college newspapers. Until there is one, I see them as notable because they are independant printed news sources in a unique environment of learning. Every one of them has the capacity to break a national or international news story even if only a few of them do. Just as university broadcasting is treated as an exception to general rules of notability in the introduction to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28U.S._broadcasters%29_bdbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (U.S. broadcasters)">Wikipedia:Notability (U.S. broadcasters)</a>, I think university newspapers should also be handled here by inclusion. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 00:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Come on guys, please help me here. I seem to be having a personal battle with somebody who is calling me a liar and doubting my bona fides. Surely this is not in the spirit of Wikipedia. Why am I even having to have this battle with one individual who it appears is a total idiot? EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID IS 100% TRUE and it seems that no amount of changing the text or giving demonstrable proofs will ever please this tosser. For the record I am 46, 47 next month but why I need to go into such personal information beats me. Please, somebody, help move this debate on and get this apparent wanker out of my hair.

<li><b>Comment</b> *As Judge Judy would put it, don't piss on our legs and tell us it's raining. Give us objective criteria to base the notability of the term on.

<li><b>Comment</b> I repeat - I ONLY PROVIDED WEB STATISTICS BECAUSE THE COMMENT MADE BY SOMEBODY ELSE CALLED THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE STATS INTO QUESTION. It was probably you.

<li><b>Comment</b> Mr Lilithborne, it seems that because I have chosen to add my comments to this debate and these happen to disagree with your own, you are now questioning my motives and who am am. This is surely not the way to proceed. If I choose to join Wikipedia to have the opportunity to add my voice to the content that is entirely my choice and I do not need to justify it to you. May I respectfully suggest you direct your vitriol towards those clearly self-promoting and self-advertising authors who have written so called articles which are nothing more than self-aggrandisement or seek to achieve a business marketing profile.DierdreCoDown 11:10, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Kevin, the reason Google hits were brought up is that it is one way to measure the notability of a site. Because of the way Google's <a href="../../../p/a/g/PageRank_8fe1.html" title="PageRank">PageRank</a> algorithm works it is a rough guide to the number of other sites that think your site is worthwhile. What is being (crudely) measured is how many other sites have written about your site. That's different from the number of people who visit your site, which is what the webstats show. Remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, which means it reports on things that have found widespread use beyond their own narrow subject area. So, for example, if The Times had decided that Pussing was notable enough to write an article about it, then Wikipedia would cover this term with an article, using The Times article as it source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately I don't think "Pussing" has reached that level of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> yet. If you read Wikipedia's guideline on <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologisms</a> and especially <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> you'll see more about this.

<p><b>Comment</b>Thanks for your latest comment Gwernol. I understand what you say about google but when the google stats were pointed out above by Tmopkisn, these were discredited by another user. Also, the problem about pussing is that it is a secret sexual practice breaking one of the last remaining taboos (non-private urination) so it is highly unlikely that the Times would offend their readers by covering it! What I can say is that if you do a search on google for the term pussing you will see that it has reached widespread coverage as the term is included on many other sites (inevitably adult ones), particularly if the search entry is combined with another sexual term (like peeing) in order to differentiate it from the sort of definitions mentioned above by Mithent.</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I suggest merging the content of this article with <a href="../../../u/r/o/Urolagnia.html" title="Urolagnia">Urolagnia</a>. That article could use some work anyway, and this editor might be the perfect person to do it. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 14:20, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Thanks for your comment Dina. One of the problems I apparently seem to be having is explaining that Pussing is not just about Urolgnia or <a href="../../../u/r/o/Urophilia.html" title="Urophilia">Urophilia</a>, it is about employing strategy and tactics to bring two people together in a semi-public place to perform the actual act of doing and watching. There are more than enough words already for the act of urination and this is not just another one! Pussing means sitting in a bar, working out where things are, working out what can be seen where and by whom, determining who is around, making the physical move of getting a member of the wrong sex into a cubicle with a FULLY CONSENTING member of the right sex totally unobserved, staying unheard and undetected whilst in there and remaining totally unobserved on exit. This is not what Urolgnia or <a href="../../../u/r/o/Urophilia.html" title="Urophilia">Urophilia</a> is!!Kevinbeds 15:15, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../u/r/o/Urolagnia.html" title="Urolagnia">Urolagnia</a> is defined as&#160;: (also known as urophilia) a sexual fetish with a focus on urine and urination. While there are variants to any fetish, Pussing seems to fall well within the scope of that article on the subject. Look, it's very likely that your article is going to be deleted. If it's important to you that this subject be represented on Wikipedia, why not incorporate some of the content in your article into that existing one? If you feel the <a href="../../../u/r/o/Urolagnia.html" title="Urolagnia">Urolagnia</a> isn't well written, you can edit its content as well. That way, everyone can be satisfied. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 15:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I keep trying to cite sources but these all seem to be poo-pooed on here!

<li><b>Comment</b> I fail to see how you can say it is unverifiable when it is included as a term in so many different websites, all independent of each other.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am NOT shouting about it but I am getting extremely frustrated that you chaps are being so obstreperous and doubting. You must understand that this is a sexual practice carried out in secret between consenting couples. It is NOT the sort of thing that you are going to find articles about or references to in The Times or the Hare and Hounds etc etc and it is NOT the sort of thing that people themselves are going to shout abroad that they indulge in, any more than the people who have commented on here would tell me what they get up to in their private sex lives (if they have any, which I am seriously beginning to doubt!). This is why you will find the term primarily amongst the adult community. Adult websites, for example, would not be including the word pussing in their search terms if pussing did not exist. The fact that it is related to the adult community does not in any way mean it is not widespread but this wonderfully polite society of ours means it is just not the sort of activity which people openly talk about. They are even less likely to write the term down. I had expected Wikipedia to want to embrace exciting new developments in our language, society and culture and want to be a leader in information but all I have encountered here has been hidebound and reactionary: a great disappointment.Kevinbeds 12:02, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Kevin, you are stepping out of line. Comments like "if they have any, which I am seriously beginning to doubt" are offensive <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> and if you continue to make them you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia. I ask you again to remain <a href="../../../c/a/l/WP%7ECALM_952a.html" title="WP:CALM">calm</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>.</p>
<p>It is very important that you understand that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is an absolute, inviolable cornerstone of Wikipedia. Quoting from that policy:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1. Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2. Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3. The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>You have not provided any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for the activity of Pussing. Until you do, the article will likely be deleted. Please read the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy carefully. Note in particular the simple idea that "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus <b>verifiability, not truth</b>." Until your article reaches this threshold none of the other arguments matter.</p>
<p>You may find this unfair, but it is the definition of what an encyclopedia is. There are thousands of free and low costs web hosting companies where you can write an article on Pussing if you want to.

<p><b>Comment</b> 1. You have overlooked the exclamation mark at the end of my parenthesis about other people's sexual activity. Have you never heard of humour? 2. It cannot be expected that reputable sources, as you call them, are likely to publish articles about a secret sexual activity breaking a taboo. If they did, their reputation would be called into question. 3. I did add what I considered to be a reputable internet source to the original article but the very first complaint was that this was an adult website, which is why I removed it, even though the website is non-commercial and non-profit making. 3. I have never asked anybody commenting to supply a source so I don't see the relevance of your point 3. 4. I do not want to write an article on pussing; what I was expecting is that Wikipedia would embrace developments in language, society and culture and be a pre-eminent reference source for such developments. I was clearly in error and, to be frank, now have an extremely poor opinion of Wikipedia. 5. I am not shouting louder and louder; I am simply trying to respond accurately to each point which is made. If you want proof that it exists, just search for it on the internet. If it didn't exist, it wouldn't be on so many independent webhsites. Or, to put it another way, why would websites seeking traffic in a highly competitive environment include pussing as a search term if nobody knew or did this? You talk about verifiability, not truth, but you yourself seem to be doubting the truthKevinbeds 07:31, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - MLB umpire only for relatively brief period; worked no postseason or All-Star games, no significant regular season games.

<p><b>Leave the page</b> - Five seasons seems significant to me. Players who have played few games/years are on this website. I'm not sure why the bias against umpires exists on this site.

<dd>Well, what about substitute umpires who are never on the regular staff but merely fill in during vacations or strikes? This is a really slippery slope. I'll note that all of the other post-1890 umpires with articles worked postseason (and usually All-Star) games. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 20:53, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> - Another point: There are fewer than 75 umpires that work MLB games in a year, but over 800 players, almost all of whom have pages on this site. In fact, being a major league umpire is a tougher accomplishment than being a major league player. Obviously players are more in the spotlight while umpires often go unnoticed, but this should not prevent them from having a page on this site. But it seems to me that if such a select group of people can accomplish something as difficult as becoming a major league umpire, if even for a short period of time, then that person deserves to be recognized on this website.

<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure the numerical comparison is entirely useful. Anywhere between 18 and 50 players appear in each game (sometimes even more in September), but only 4 umpires; there are fewer positions. Besides, shouldn't the article describe something the person <i>did</i> rather than just note their job title? Since you began the article, adding something in that respect would be useful. Players' accomplishments are easily quantifiable and varied and can be compared; umpires' work tends to be more uniform. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia bio guidelines</a> should be kept in mind; for sports officials, I'd suggest something similar to the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html#Criteria" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">criteria for professors</a> (Ivy League profs could be regarded as working at the highest level, yet they don't automatically qualify for articles). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 21:55, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The numerical comparison is relevent because it shows how much more difficult a position being an MLB umpire is to obtain as compared to being an MLB player. My point with that is that MLB players who appear in very few seasons and have "stubs" are not shut out from this site, so why should an MLB umpire be? Additionally, if you want more than his job, give it some time. This page has been up for less than 24 hours. Part of the reason it was put up is so anyone who knows something can contribute. Give them time to find it. Ags412 22:00, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, veteran umpires have union job protection, so talent isn't the only criteria for work; a pitcher who's no longer competent loses his job, but it's harder to get rid of a bad umpire who's been around for ten years. Besides, the uniformity of their work is a primary goal for umpires; uniformity is completely irrelevant (and essentially impossible) for players. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 22:08, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which means it is even tougher to get a job in the major leagues because there are less openings. Therefore, breaking into the major leagues as an umpire for any amount of time is an extremely difficult feat in any respects and thus a "notable" accomlpishment.Ags412 22:25, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> suggested, the umpire situation should be approached similar to that of college professors - working on the highest level is not enough, on its own, to constitute notability. As it stands now, the career highlights listed on Hollowell's article do not make him notable, as he was not really a part of them; he was really more of a bystander. The batboy and the equipment managers scheduled to work those games were as much a part of Darren Kile's death and the crazed fan incident, as Hollowell was. The fact that Hollowell was a part of these games is <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a>, by definition, unimportant. Also, I should point out that the numerical comparisons between umpires and players are moot by the simple reason that there is far, far less competition for umpire jobs. That is not to say very little competition, but the fact remains that countless children, young adults, and college-age kids, throughout the Americas work extremely hard to try to fulfill their dreams of <i>playing</i> in the major leagues. Despite any arguments made to the importance and skill of the umpire, this is simply not the case for aspiring umpires. Besides, most of the arguments equating MLB umpire status with notability (competition, job openings, etc) can really be made for MLB batboys and MLB bullpen catchers. This is a slippery slope being mounted here. Without real notable, consequential facts about a particular umpire's career, there is no article. -<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeidenstud_07d3.html" title="User:Seidenstud">Seidenstud</a> 22:15, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are many credible references. True, the subject is an economic principle specific to the airline industry and to the culture, but it is studied by government, the press, economists, and private industry. It is in common usage and refers to a tendency that can be attributed generally to any airline that causes that effect. A Department of Transportation publication (as cited by Justin Ritter) defined it as "the characteristics of a low-cost carrier’s market entry and the side-effects that come with it. (DOT, 1993)" Searching for "Southwest Effect" in Google Print yields over 50 book citations. A Google Web search for "Southwest Effect" delivers links to well over 700 Internet sites using the phrase.

<p>Prod was removed by sole author, so I'll list it here. No real opinion, although the article sounds like it was written by a member of the band (especially the "influences" section), the band does seem to be somewhat notable. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 21:06, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is suggested that this be merged to the I'm Every Woman page; I agree. Perhaps a redirect would be best.
