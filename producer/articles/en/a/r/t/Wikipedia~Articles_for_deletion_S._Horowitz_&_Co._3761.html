<dd>No. Bingham McCutchen has been recognized 3 consecutive years by Fortune magazine for its work environment as one of the best companies to work for. It was also recognized by Boston Business Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle. While these references were not included in the article originally, they do show notability (i.e., recognition by multiple independent news sources). I have not found the same notability for this law firm. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fine. Search in Hebrew, but put the information you find in the article or at the very least in this AfD. Claiming to have found something of import to establishing notability in another language and providing that information to actually establish notability are two different things. As for the "widely-accepted" ratings, you'll have to establish that "fact" as well too. It's not my lack of knowledge that's the problem here, it is the lack of evidence. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 05:15, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I question the use of a "size" ranking index to validate notability. Imagine a situation where every company in a category is ranked by size and listed in an index. If 200 firms exist, then even the 182nd largest company is listed in the index and therefore meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> under this interpretation, even if the size of the company is 10 staff. Is size of a company notable? Maybe this is more necessary for clarification on the WP:CORP talk page than this AfD, but when the only thing notable about a law firm is "it hires more lawyers than all but 2 others in Israel", then is it still notable? Surely, the #3 biggest law firm in all of Israel has done something to warrant better notability than that. The thing is that I can't find it. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 21:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> has over 7 million people in it. As the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem_Post_ac05.html" title="Jerusalem Post">Jerusalem Post</a> article suggests, Israel is saturated in lawyers (with 33,000 lawyers, there is alot more than 200 law firms in Israel; I'm guessing several thousand). Just the mere scope of a law firm being in the top 20 in such a country is inherently notable. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 22:42, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the #1 largest law firm had 26,000 lawyers, the #2 largest law firm had 5,000 lawyers, and the #3 largest law firm had 900 lawyers (the remaining 100 lawyers spread among #4-#whatever), then you could make an argument that #1 was notable based upon size alone, but that 900 pales in comparison and is therefore less notable (if not completely un-notable based solely on size). This is clearly not the case, but gives an example why size ranking alone is hardly a hearty criteria for notability. Even when companies are recognized by independent reliable sources, we sometimes require multiple recognition as such for notability. To hinge keeping an article solely on a very loose interpretation of WP:CORP criterion #2 (ranking indices) is not in accordance with the guidelines of Wikipedia. This is about as clear as I can make it in stating this argument, so I will probably refrain from any further comment on it. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 00:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That argument makes no sense. "If the #1 largest law firm had 26,000 lawyers..." is not based in fact. In fact, the #1 law firm in Israel, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herzog%2C_Fox%2C_Neeman_%26_Co._33e1.html" title="Herzog, Fox, Neeman &amp; Co.">Herzog, Fox, Neeman &amp; Co.</a>, has 100 employees and 34 partners. That is huge for a law firm. The #10 firm, <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fischer%2C_Behar%2C_Chen%2C_Well%2C_Orion_%26_Co._b210.html" title="Fischer, Behar, Chen, Well, Orion &amp; Co.">Fischer, Behar, Chen, Well, Orion &amp; Co.</a>, has just over 100. These are very signifficant in a country of just over 7,000,000 and well past the threshold of scope for notable law firms. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 03:04, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
