<p>An attempt to re-create a type of dog that died out. An attempt by <i>very few people</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The British Bulldogge is definitely a hoax. However, this breed isn't. Which created kennel club are you referring to? Also, that type of dog didn't die out, it evolved into the modern bulldog. And though registry with the Continental Kennel Club proves very little (they'd accept any group of dogs that may possibly, vaguely resemble each other to be a "breed") resgistry with the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Rare_Breed_Association_97df.html" title="American Rare Breed Association">American Rare Breed Association</a> is far more significant<a href="http://www.arba.org/OldeEnglishBull1BS.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arba.org/OldeEnglishBull1BS.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. --<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharaoh_Hound_a2fe.html" title="User:Pharaoh Hound"><font color="#D55B12">Pharaoh Hound</font></a> <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPharaoh_Hound_0c71.html" title="User talk:Pharaoh Hound"><small>(talk)</small></a> 19:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This is exactly the type of thing that ticks me off about Wikipedia. An overexhuberant, proffessional wiki cop article deleter, trying for a barnstar.

BTW, I don't breed or even own one of these dogs but I'm not so stupid as to think that it's not a legitimate breed.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> — The two books cited on the article page discuss a very real trend by breeders to move away from the physical ailments of the modern English Bulldog. The Olde English Bulldogge is a very big part of that trend as it is one of a number of alternative bulldog breeds (e.g. the Victorian Bulldog) that exist now. Read the two books if you don't believe me. The books and authors have been cited on the front article page. I won't do your work for you. This breed and other alternative bulldog breeds have existed for many years. The person who originally posted that this article should be deleted believes that recognition by major kennel clubs is a necessary criterion for having a Wikipedia article. If we follow that logic, then you all better be prepared to remove dozens of articles on various dog breeds and hybrid breeds. My goodness, the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shar_Pei_6599.html" title="Shar Pei">Shar Pei</a> was not even recognized by the AKC until 1991. But anyone with any true knowledge about canine breeds knows that the Shar Pei has been in existence long before the AKC and its supporters were ever around. For the record, I am not a breeder or even a pet owner. I discovered this breed through my own research because one day I probably would want to own a pet. This article should NOT be deleted and should be free for any person to peruse. Prospective pet owners are entitled to have as much information as possible available to their fingertips in order to make a wise and informed choice. This article should never have been nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanger_Rabbit_9a06.html" title="User:Ranger Rabbit">User:Ranger Rabbit</a></li>

<li>The 160-page Jenkins/Mollett book details the current English Bulldogs origins, its serious health issues and the creation of Victorian Bulldog and the Olde English as viable alternatives.

<li>Yes, I know the book has 160 pages, because this information is given in the link I provided. Also, yes I know the book explains the creation of the Victorian Bulldog breed for the same reason. I haven't read the book and I'm not convinced you have either. Could you provide an extract? Overall, I'm not convinced there are multiple non-trivial external sources; I suggest you have a look at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 18:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is one of the bulldog articles on Wikipedia we should keep. At least that is what the editors at Dorling Kindersley publishing house decided. I will have questions about several of the other bulldog breeds mentioned and/or with an article on WP (peruse my talk page where I'm working to sort this out for myself), but, this one, per my research so far, IMO, is currently a keep.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Keesiewonder. The link demonstrates multiple published sources, the excerpts would appear that at least in some cases the mention isn't trivial. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 14:01, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>. Per Keesiewonder, there appears to be some outside references, but more references from above should be included in the article, and the article needs a serious hacking at - much too much trivia. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 17:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b>. I'm sorry that a few of the people here are not familiar with this breed, but I must state that they have no idea what they are talking about SIMPLY because they know nothing about the topic, the "Olde English Bulldogge". Refer to Wikipedia's definition of a breed then refer to the American Rare Breed Associations website www.arba.org . Then refer to the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club www.oldeenglishbulldoggekennelclub.com . Also, two books written by Carl Semencic, "World of fighting dogs" and "Gladiator Dogs" not only describe this dogs origin back in 1984, but quotes the breeds creator. Unfortunately the breed was abandoned by it's creator back in 1994 and as aresult many unethical Bulldog breeders took the opportunity to capitalize on his departure from the dog world by creating Hybrid Bulldogs and attaching the name Olde English Bulldogge to them. As the President of the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club, I can attest to, in a court of Law, the bloodlines of this breed which are now being preserved by the O.E.B.K.C. Only Olde English Bulldogges that can be traced back to the original foundatoin can be registered with the OEBKC. The registry contains over 550 Bulldogges, past and present. There is much to this story, but the story is long and I don't believe that is what people are looking for here. However, I am disappointed that statements have been made here that CLEARLY have not been researched before they have been made and are TOTALLY INACCURATE. These are the type of people that have given the unethical breeders a market for their Bulldog Hybrids. People that are unwilling to do their homework before spewing their opinions. I could be wrong here, but I thought Wikipedia was opposed to that type of ignorance? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonpelon_8f2c.html" title="User:Donpelon">User:donpelon</a></li>

<dd>As I've said before, this article deserves to be kept. I am not (yet) comfortable with the variety of bulldog articles (see list at my talk) present overall, and I am not feeling like all users participating in various places are distinct users. What is the WP term for this? sock puppetry?

<dd>Thanks for the info. When I placed something on donpelon's page, you immediately moved it. Usually completely separate users don't maintain each other's pages so quickly, but fine.

<li><b>Keep</b> there seems to be multiple mentions of the breed on a variety of different webpages. There are published standard <a href="http://www.ioeba.net/ioebabreedstandards.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ioeba.net/ioebabreedstandards.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, its recognised by some kennal clubs, many breaders use the term, theres many other local groups who have accepted it <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/riograndebulldoggeclub/breeds.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freewebs.com/riograndebulldoggeclub/breeds.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>,<a href="http://www.heritagebulldogges.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heritagebulldogges.com/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. So maybe the bigger national Kennal Clubs have not recognised it, but wikipedia is not the mouth peace of these groups. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 12:29, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment/Weak Delete</b> This article should either be deleted or completely redone. I agree that parts of it sound like advertising and there are serious POV issues as well.
