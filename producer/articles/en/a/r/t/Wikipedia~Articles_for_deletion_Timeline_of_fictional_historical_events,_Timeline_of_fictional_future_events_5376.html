<p>I would generally refer to articles such as these as fancruft and be done with it, but I do not want to disparage the obvious effort that multiple contributors have put into these articles. The fact remains, however, that the articles seem a bit suspect as legitamate encyclopedia articles. They are not timelines that correspond to any particular fictional series, but detail events from a hodgepodge of different books and series smashed into one long timeline. For someone looking for information on any particular series, it would make more sense to check a page devoted to that series such as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Star_Trek_ac3a.html" title="Timeline of Star Trek">Timeline of Star Trek</a>. Furthermore, with the amount of fiction out there, it would be impossible to make this in any way complete, and right now the article focuses on sci-fi and fantasy, adding a degree of POV as well. It seems to me that the articles in question fail to inform the reader of any information in a relevent fashion (since as I said, anyone looking for this information would be better off checking pages devoted to individual fictional universes instead) and are therefore not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 22:00, Jan 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - as one who has done a bit of work on these articles, I obviously disagree about their worthiness. I think comparing various fictional millieus together like this is quite interesting. Also, you need to fix the VfD headers on those two pages to make sure they point here to this VfD discussion, otherwise it's harder for people who have those pages watchlisted or otherwise stumble upon them to come here and vote. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:01, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Terribly sorry about the linking problem and my thanks to <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> for fixing things. While it is true that comparing "fictional millieus" as you say can be both interesting and rewarding, I believe it specious to say that these pages actually do so. They seem to be nothing more than rolls of years that list events from various universes without really doing any comparing. While some implicit comparisons can probably be drawn just by seeing some of these events side-by-side, the usefulness of these articles to draw comparisons appears rather limited. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:06, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fascinating, and encyclopedic in principle. The introductions could do with some clarification, and as to exactly what is included, I'm sure we'll have no more trouble deciding that than we do in drawing the line on detail vs <i>fancruft</i> here.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a rare bird indeed. If it were to ever become even remotely close to being complete, it would be so ludicrously enormous (likely thousands or even hundreds of thousands of pages) that it would be of little use to anyone because of its unwieldliness. Otherwise, it would be useless because of its incompleteness. I tend to try to keep articles on culture and the arts, but I bote to delete this everythingcruft. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:31, Jan 22, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, and I think that's almost inevitable if the article grows at all. But I question its usefulness... would anybody really want to read a 50-page article on Fictional Events in March, 1938, when the same info would be better put on the individual entries for the fictional works themselves, and when a lot of real historical events of the period aren't in WP yet? Who is this article for, exactly? People who want to know what Scrooge McDuck was doing in 1947 without being bothered to look up Scrooge himself? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 03:32, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I doubt anyone wants to read 50 pages worth of fictional things that happened in March of 1938, but IMO that's a silly strawman with no real bearing on whether these articles should be deleted - the timelines are currently nowhere near that dense, nor will they be in the forseeable future. If people are interested only in what Scrooge McDuck was doing in 1947 then this probably isn't the article for them, they should go to a Scrooge-specific article and I don't see why they'd think it'd be easier to find in this one instead. This article is for bringing together a broad range of fictional events from a variety of sources. One can use it to find out things like "what have various writers imagined the next hundred years to be like?" or "what major works of fiction have been set in the time of ancient Babylon?". How would someone do that if the date references are all scattered throughout Wikipedia's article space? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 09:58, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that it's interesting and even useful in theory, but it's like building a bridge from Tokyo to Los Angeles: it sounds cool but you know it won't ever get even close to being finished. Even a single epic novel like <i>Gone With the Wind</i> might have 10-20 pages of timeline material or more, while something like the Marvel Universe would have tens of thousands of pages at least, and lots more new pages every month. And there's soap operas, where an hour's worth of stuff happens every say, and some of them have been running since the 50s or even earlier! When one considers the almost infinite amount of fiction out there... it's staggering. Even if all our WP editors made it their life's work to finish this article, it still wouldn't happen. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 20:59, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would like to contend that not all fictional historical and future events have their own timelines, and many of their timelines are not long enough to warrant a complete timeline article anyway. Having these fictional events here is an easier way to keep track of these individual "events" in a linear fashion. I would also like to argue that specific events from other timelines (most notably events from <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dates_in_Harry_Potter_db36.html" title="Dates in Harry Potter">Dates in Harry Potter</a>) be kept off these timelines; a brief mention for linear purposes is more practical.--<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynamite_XI_c221.html" title="User:Dynamite XI">DXI</a> 00:10, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge/split into appropriate articles, then delete</b>. These timelines should be segregated into their own pages, or when insufficient content exists for a specific fictional universe to merit its own timeline page, merged into the page for that fictional universe as a section. The ability to cross-correlate fictional historical events from multiple different timelines is of no encyclopedic value that I can fathom. —<a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 01:56, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Obviously</b>, a thorough timeline of future events (with proper citation) would give the reader an accurate idea of how people's visions of the future have changed with time. That took me 2 seconds of fathoming. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#BA0000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#BA0000">™</font></a> 16:29, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those 2 seconds weren't enough. What <i>would</i> provide a reader with "an accurate idea of how people's visions of the future have changed over time" would be the timeline of each individual universe <i>presented separately</i>, along with the date when that timeline was broadly conceived, so readers could (say) contrast a future history constructed in 1935 with a future history constructed in 1972. That's not <i>these</i> articles, by a long way. Indeed, a reader wanting to make such a comparison would support <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>'s point of separating the timelines. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:37, 2005 Jan 24 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sounds like a worthy topic for a journal article, perhaps even a monograph, as then the data could be analyzed and interpreted, but the raw data presented in this timeline is useless for that purpose. As it stands now, it is useless due to its incompleteness. If it were completed, it would be useless for its unwieldliness. Since you are obviously quick on your feet, could you explain to those of use who are not very good fathomers how you would get around these hurdles with this particular article? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:54, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>There's a simple fix that benefits all of us. If you don't like the article.. guess what.. you don't have to visit the page! There are plenty of people who like the articles and have contributed to them.

<li>Just off the top of my head, it'd be useful for geeky pursuits such as crossover fiction (ala <i>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>) or or gaming (some friends and I are doing an RPG set in the 1920s and it would be handy to see which fictional characters or events they may run into) - <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogotu_210d.html" title="User:Logotu">Logotu</a>

<li>One of the major problems with these pages is that one of the biggest sources of such pseudo-history, <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a>, is vastly under-represented, but that if it <i>were</i> properly represented, the articles would be a complete mess. (The Doctor Who writers didn't work from a series bible, and historical continuity is often non-existent. Moreover, several years, such as 8891 for a trailer broadcast in 1988, were mere whimsies. There is a book, whose title I cannot remember off the top of my head, that actually constructed exactly such a timeline as this from all of the Doctor Who episodes. It was a self-contradictory hodge-podge, and massively long.) A kind of uncertainty principle operates here: These articles can either be neat and comprehendible, or inclusive and comprehensive, never both.</li>
<li>One of the minor problems with these pages is that it doesn't include the "Pulse" from <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Angel_%28TV_series%29_b030.html" title="Dark Angel (TV series)">Dark Angel</a>. The significance of this is only to be found if one considers this as being a small facet of a much larger problem. A <i>lot</i> of post-apocalyptic science fiction stories have posited a nuclear war or other such disaster in the near future. Dark Angel is but one of a <i>great many</i>. Are these pages to include <i>all</i> of the fictional disasters? It's hard to see them not doing so, given that in most of the fictional universes they are the central pivotal historical event that distinguishes them from this universe. But that means that these pages become <i>long</i> lists of fictional third world wars, atomic bomb explosions, worldwide plagues, robotic revolts, and asteriod impacts.</li>
<li>There are whole fictional timelines, such as Larry Niven's timeline for "Known Space" or the timeline(s) for James Blish's <i>Cities in Flight</i> universe(s), whose events aren't included here. But to include <i>even only them</i> would increase the sizes of these pages to the point that people would be calling for a split. And the logical way to split such articles <i>is</i> by universe, not by historical period. Splitting by historical period loses any sense of cohesion (except for those comparatively <i>few</i> pseudo-historical events that are attached to single, common, real historical events, and so can be meaningfully compared across universes), whereas splitting by universe does not. (Splitting by universe is of course what printed science-fiction encyclopaedias, which have already faced this problem, already do. It's <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_timelines_91af.html" title="Category:Fictional timelines">what Wikipedia is already doing</a>, too.) Which then leads to the inevitable "Merge Timeline of events in Dark Angel with <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Angel_%28TV_series%29_b030.html" title="Dark Angel (TV series)">Dark Angel</a>!" calls. And thus we catch up to where <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> already is.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was all set to take a quick look at it and then vote delete, but then it was one of the coolest things I've seen on the 'pedia. Don't dare delete it. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 08:12, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Keep this page because it holds so many different timelins in one and you can see what happens through different novels and shows all at once without having to go all over the place. -- User:130.101.85.131</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Harmless, verifiable, and interesting. Wikipedia contains timelines. --<a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> <small>|</small> <a href="../../../l/3/3/User_talk%7EL33tminion_b015.html" title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 20:19, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is definitely very cool and interesting. If it ever does get to the "Fictional events in March 1938" stage mentioned by a poster above, it'd be awesome wicked cool, but even as it stands now, it's very interesting to read a comparative study of how different things from different fictional universe relate date-wise to each other. Separately, when reading <i>Phantom</i> or watching <i>Highlander</i>, it'd never occur to you that both legacies originated in the same era, but this list shows you that the first Phantom became active right around Connor MacLeod becoming immortal. I would've never made the connection on my own. How cool is that? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamy_Merchi_a415.html" title="User:Samy Merchi">Samy Merchi</a></li>
