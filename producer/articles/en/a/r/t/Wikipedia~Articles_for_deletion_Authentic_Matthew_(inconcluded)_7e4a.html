</ul>
<p>This was merged by me, as a result of someone else requesting a merge, as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>The source text is already at WikiSource</li>
<li>Salvagable content about Eusebius and Biblical Canon was already moved to <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius.html" title="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Canon_d086.html" title="Biblical Canon">Biblical Canon</a>.</li>

<li>Unsalvagable original research deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was then changed into a redirect to <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>.</p>
<p>There followed an edit war between editors restoring the article and me returning the redirect.

<li><b>No vote</b> (for the moment) - I've a Phd in New Testament - and I'm going to need time to get my head round this - it is all quite technical.

<dd>I couldn't find any mention of Matthew in <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>, even in older versions, much less any mention of "Authentic Matthew".

Could you say more specifically which links you were verifying?

<dd>No offense, but I don't think it's wise to vote based on the conflict between these two. That can be resolved in mediation, as you say, unless you were to pass judgement yourself. If that's the case then it's your choice to risk making a decision that isn't fully informed. One would say of the other that Ril has a vendetta and that Melissa is taking it personally. I don't know who's right, if anyone is, but who's right shouldn't really be the point. We know we want to vote objectively. I say, vote on the objective aspects.

<dd>Excuse me for jumping in here, but where is the concrete proof that said users are sock-puppets? You suspect they may be, yes, but from what I can see, there has been no point where this has been verified by admin. I've noted that every single "Keep" vote was followed up with an attempt to discount, either waving the sock-puppet flag, pointing out prior edits, or, in my case, by asking for a review of the vote on my user talk page. Might I suggest leaving the discounting of votes to those who are qualified to discount votes? That would help to cool down this debate. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a> 22:16, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</sup>

<dd>a) I have never used a sock-puppet, and Poorman is my husband. I am willing to provide Wiki administrators with full documentation to prove my innocence via snail mail. (Also, Poorman has agreed to joint web cam interviews or a conference telephone call.)

<dd>b) the sources I have used are all published works which are still in print -- Jerome, etc., etc.
<dl>
<dd>N.b. academics almost universally consider Jerome to have made an error. He never pushed his opinion as a rival theory, and indeed seems quite unaware his opinion was unusual. Academics universally consider that this was most likely an innocent error due to lack of information on his part, and not a deliberate "they were definitely one book" theory. The article being VFD'd presents this as a deliberate theory, which is original research. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 06:40, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As my mother-in-law has been in a life-threatening car accident, I request an adjournment of the arbitration proceedings for one month, as neither Poorman nor myself will be available for the next couple of weeks.

<li>While I hope nothing but the best for your mother-in-law/mother, and fully support adjournment of any arbitration (none of which is presently extant) for such a reason, I would like to ask (i.e., demand) that any conflict of interest discussion of arbitrators be left to any relevant RfAr discussion. As yet, I have not seen any indication as to why Theresa should be excluded from <i>voting</i> in an RfAr between you/se and -Ril-, but should such evidence be presented in the proper forum, I would expect Theresa to recuse herself, without prejudice, from voting. In light of that, if you're attempting to cast Theresa in a negative light here, you'll receive no kudos (although the same cannot be said for your negative characterizations of -Ril-, who seems to have something of a vandetta against you, for whatever reason, which I expect to be explained COHERENTLY and WITH COMPLETE CITATIONS <b>HERE</b> as soon as he makes it back to this page. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:24, July 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The rate of appearance is roughly 1 sockpuppet per day. This is totally inappropriate behaviour. Also, creating so many sockpuppets just to preserve the article, which should be argued for on its own merits, convinces me beyond any doubt whatsoever, that not only is it original research, but that it is also pushing some POV that melissadolbeer wishes to push. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 17:00, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was personally considering proposing to remove the VfD tag on this article, as well as proposing a one-month editing ban on both <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">User:-Ril-</a> and the various editors whom -Ril- claims are sockpuppets of whomever. This article is clearly at the core of a much bigger argument between at <i>least</i> two editors, and as such, their relationship needs to be worked out before anything constructive can EVER take place wrt this article. Meanwhile, I think going forward with a vote on whether to keep or discard this article will negatively/positively reflect on n/either party in what is clearly a conflict of much greater scope. I move to suspend this vote until such time as the relevant RfAr is resolved. (Without prejudice, I also vote to take both parties, but especially -Ril-, out behind the woodshed for a sound <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanking.html" title="Spanking">spanking</a>. This entire mishegas is utterly unseemly, and does nothing but serve the best interests of those who hold the entire WP project in disdain.) <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:16, July 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>N.b. You may NOT remove VFD tags until a VFD is closed.

<li>This move to "suspend" VFD is purely a callous one by Melissadolbeer because she doesn't like the way it is going, and I have nothing but contempt for such behaviour seeking to abuse VFD's process. It is my opinion, that a more likely truth is, that Melissadolbeer, a school teacher, has a holiday booked, it being end of term, and will be unable to sockpuppet during that period, consequently requiring suspension so that this does not detriment her position. Articles can always be put to Votes for Undeletion once the VFD is complete, there is no reason to suspend it.<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 16:34, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not exactly correct. VfU is only a move to put the article back on VfD if the article is determined on technicality to have been deleted improperly. That said, I still think you do yourself and your "side" a great disservice by arguing with the sockpuppets and by running around behind everyone who votes "keep" like a tattle-tale, asking them to change their vote. I note that you have <i>not</i> run around behind everyone who votes "delete" telling them all about your "problems" with the socks, etc., and thanking them for their vote. From where I'm sitting, it appears far more likely that the reason all the socks are showing up is to have additional names fighting against the vitriol you've unleashed. It looks to me like you've <i>created</i> a problem editor by the fierceness of your onslaught against hir. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 17:51, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment and suggestion to closing admin</b>. This debate has resulted in more heat than light. However, it does actually matter, since references to 'Authentic Matthew' have been inserted into other, more important Biblical Studies articles, giving it an unmerited prominence (and IMHO distorting WP's presentation of the discipline). I have some knowledge in the field - and I had intended to set down my thoughts for others, but I withdrew rather than poke a stick in a hornet's nest of sockpuppetry, accusations, flaming, and trolling (by whom I leave for others to judge).</li>

<dd>A proper informed debate on the article does need to happen and reach a resolution -'freezing' it for long, whilst it might (??) cool individuals, does Wikipedia content no favours! I'd suggest that this current nomination be <b>terminated</b> (quickly) and another begun (soon), in which -Ril- on one hand and Mellisodobeer (and associates) on the other are each invited to make a statement then withdraw (on that basis I'd chip in my bit too) - and then some disinterested party (not -Ril-) monitor the debate. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 08:34, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>N.b. In the same edit, Melissadolbeer's sockpuppets are also deleting all the comments marking users as sockpuppets (e.g. user has n prior edits). It is standard procedure in VFD to mark suspected sockpuppets, due to lack of prior edits, as such. Removal (by Melissadolbeer's socks) of such comments can only possibly serve to attempt to hide that the users are sockpuppets, which is pretty much conclusive evidence that they are. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 17:08, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Even if we both find ourselves in a warzone (I am currently somewhat trapped inside a police bomb cordon resulting from today's london explosions - the coffee is nice though), I see absolutely no reason why this should prevent other people from being able to vote, which is all that VFD is about. <b>There is no reason to suspend or postpone this - it does not require me, or melissadolbeer, to be present</b>.
