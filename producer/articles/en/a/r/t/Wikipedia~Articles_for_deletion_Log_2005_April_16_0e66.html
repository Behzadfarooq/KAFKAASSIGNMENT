<li><b>Abstain</b>. Lol. I wrote this section and I'm certainly not Israeli bias.

<li>Seen from that point of view, the article considered as an annotated list (rather than a self-contained attempt at description and analysis) is certainly salvageable. Pardon me--I'm relatively new at Wikipedia, and don't always see these possibilities. Once the five days is up, then, I shall plan to edit a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_literary_movements.html" title="List of literary movements">List of literary movements</a> page, if no one else does so first. I do think that the article as it stands is extremely limited in scope, treating as it does only movements of the 20th century, and then only movements either European or popularized in Europe; if deletion is not called for I do think the list will need at least to wear a stub template for quite a while. <a href="../../../d/w/b/User%7EDwbird2_f2b7.html" title="User:Dwbird2">Dave1898</a> 11:00, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Note: I wrote the entry; I did however not write what <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> deem a simple theory of an obscure academic. This is now declared by the opponent a Vanity Page. In the entry for such it states: <i>A page should not be cast away as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.</i> Note also that a link to this alleged obscure academicicians web page is already listed on the entry for <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermi_Paradox_f362.html" title="Fermi Paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>. Unfortunately searching on Wikipedia for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Filter_8999.html" title="The Great Filter">The Great Filter</a> yielded no entry (Google web and group searches do) and that was the reason I wrote this entry. If, as is claimed, there are many detailed, well thought out theories on this interesting topic I would be genuinely interested to see them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the author of this alleged too simple theory <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hanson_bcec.html" title="Robin Hanson">Robin Hanson</a> does also have an entry, in spite of his status as an obscure academic. While I am not him (nor have I contacted him) I would also like a far more specific reason for his alleged obscurity than one sentence. His [<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/|home" class="external text" title="http://hanson.gmu.edu/|home" rel="nofollow">page</a>] does not like that of a charlatan, and numerous mainstream articles are listed. My considered view is therefore to keep this entry. 80.212.11.201 20:56, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have taken the trouble of reading Hanson's Web page on his "great" filter and it does not explain anything, or bring anything new to the debate. It is just a compendium of some other views on this. Hanson is known for his contributions in other fields, but not in this one. There are many well thought out theories around Dyson's <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyson_sphere.html" title="Dyson sphere">Dyson sphere</a> and even a relatively lighter idea like Bradbury's <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrioshka_Brain_7b4d.html" title="Matrioshka Brain">Matrioshka Brain</a> is more known and developed than Hanson's Web page on "The great filter. In fact the Wikipedia article on the Fermi Paradox sums things up much better than Hanson's pages on the Web. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 02:58, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Now that the argument is transformed from one of "a simple theory of an obscure academic" into "just a compendium of some other views on this" I move to dismiss the proposal for deletion as the basis was clearly poorly understood or researched. Moreover "The Great Filter" is a known expression (ref earlier notes on Google). And while the entry on <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermi_Paradox_f362.html" title="Fermi Paradox">Fermi Paradox</a> does sum things up more briefly, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Filter_8999.html" title="The Great Filter">The Great Filter</a> theory is more complete. Were one to take even more "trouble" in reading it one would also see original contributions (see for instance chapters starting with "Reconsidering " as well as "Technical Appendix"). <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Filter_8999.html" title="The Great Filter">The Great Filter</a> states that thye filtering can be prior to our stage in development but <i>also</i> later on.

<p>Before concluding a merge, note that The Great Filter covers the development (and/or prevention) of civilisations, aliens as well as our; while the Fermi Paradox covers why an alien civilisation, if it exists, has not contacted us. Thus there is a difference in scope. One could of course merge these but then also Drake Equation for completeness, at which point it gets rather big.

<li><b>Delete</b> It might have made the local news a century ago, but there seems to be nothing of any enduring significance even in that area, wherever it was. Maybe something that was news when the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica was written, when electric power was something new? I'm the one who stuck that uncyclopedic tag on; later I saw something about use of that being discouraged, but it sure seemed appropriate here. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 03:46, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Copyvio</b> of [<a href="http://www.eepublishers.co.za/view.php?sid=1317" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eepublishers.co.za/view.php?sid=1317" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] Still it's a very interesting story of engineering malpractice, whereby the engineers spec'd an expensive though elegant system, giant internal combustion engines powered by [[|Town gas|producer gas]]. Except that they intended to use <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bituminous_coal.html" title="Bituminous coal">bituminous coal</a> (Instead of <a href="../../../c/o/k/Coke_%28fuel%29.html" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a>) in the producers without concern for the massive amount of coal tar fouling and corrosion that would result from the direct gasification of <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bituminous_coal.html" title="Bituminous coal">bituminous coal</a>. When the fouling and corrosion started; hilairity ensued and by mid 1907 the City Council had to reject the whole scheme and instituted legal proceedings against the suppliers to recover their losses.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (once the copyvio has been dealt with). Totally encyclopedic (with a bit of context added) - there are lots of historical items in Wikipedia far more trivial than this. But possibly better merged into an appropriate article on South African history. If they really mean gas turbine that would be a remarkably early use (I think they mean reciprocating gas engine). -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 07:16, 2005 Apr 16 (UTC)

<li>Yes, basicly a very big for the time four stroke engine. Gas Turbines would require WWII era metalurgy/enginnering. All this takes place in 1906. Seems like the city had a good case against the engineers. People knew that if you used anything but coke in a producer, the output gas would contain the volitiles from the feedstock coal. And unless you planned to install a full getup to scrub the gas, primitive gas treatment equipment was going leave fairly large amount of tar and condensibles in the gas. Whats interesting is that the city purchased this system over a steam one, on the basis of saving fuel. I'm guess the reason then went with the producer gas engines, is that the system could easily adapt to fluctuations in demand whereas a steam boiler requires a pretty much constant fuel input to maintain high steam pressure. Big savings on high pressure piping since a producer gas system runs at almost atmospheric pressure.

This vote received no votes other than the nominator, <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a>. I do not believe that this is adequate to establish a consensus for deletion, or is adequate to establish a precedent that could wipe out an entire category of articles. There are 144 articles in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_image_galleries_625f.html" title="Category:Wikipedia image galleries">Category:Wikipedia image galleries</a>, and not all image galleries have been categorized. It also doesn't seem to me that the folk at Commons have come to a consensus as to whether or not images will be grouped into articles or categories there. If they decide against having galleries, we will be left without the content, having deleted ours. Now as to if there is some encyclopedic value to image galleries, I would say yes. One of the great advantages of Wikipedia is that it is not paper. One of the great drawbacks of traditional encyclopedias is that the number of images limited because they are expensive. When discussing an art object (which is what I consider the Vienna Dioscurides to be) the best way to understand it is to see it. With a complex object like a codex, you need many pictures to understand it. I felt when I created this article that separating the pictures into a gallery made the main article less ugly, but I consider them absolutely essential to understanding the piece. I am uncomfortable having the main gallery being on another project and which will include text in multiple languages as Wikicommons evolves. Perhaps I erred and should have just included the gallery in the main article, as has been done for <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Aureus_of_Lorsch_261e.html" title="Codex Aureus of Lorsch">Codex Aureus of Lorsch</a>, but I find this very ugly. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 00:10, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, by encyclopedic value I meant words a number of words (other than captions) to explain the images. Yes pictures have encyclopedic value, however, I don't believe they have a need to be duplicated on commons and Wikipedia if there is not going to be a big article with them. There will be arbitration on this issue in the near future no doubt <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 02:14, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Insisting that words are the key to having encyclodedic value is, in my mind, simply wrong when dealing with art objects. Commons is not an encyclopedia and certainly not an English language encyclopedia. Using Commons to provide galleries for the English Wikipedia will result in the linking to articles like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Louvre" class="extiw" title="commons:Louvre">this</a>, which is simply unacceptable for an English language encyclopedia.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - if you really believe that is an issue (which I don't) you can make a link like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Dioscurides" class="extiw" title="commons:Vienna_Dioscurides">Gallery of page from Vienna Dioscurides</a> linking to the commons but showing that it is the gallery. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 22:02, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, One can do that. But consider this scenario: some one has a list of specific manuscripts they want to read about. They read the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna_Dioscurides_98a4.html" title="Vienna Dioscurides">Vienna Dioscurides</a> article, follow the link to commons, are not aware that they have left Wikipedia, look at the pretty pictures, decide to go to the next manuscript, and type in "Book of Kells" in the search box and hit go. They get <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells" class="extiw" title="commons:Book_of_Kells">this</a> rather than <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Kells_61e3.html" title="Book of Kells">this</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This DJ is actually quite well known among the underground rave community, especially among lovers of jungle. He's been interviewed in Junglized magazine, he's toured internationally, and he even has a CD available for order on Amazon.com. If by 'vanity', it's meant that he wrote this personally to promote himself, I sincerely doubt that he's suffering from enough of a lack of publicity to bother. He, to my knowledge, remains one of the top drum and bass DJs worldwide. He is certainly of interest to more than 100 people.

<p>Ok, we've been having a bit of a dispute about this one; you may (or may not, since most of it is not about the merits of the article, but about the fact that I tried to merge it) want to visit the [[Talk:Jim Robinson|talk page] to see some history of the debate. Jim is notable <b>only</b>, as far as I can tell, for his website <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a>, and I feel most of the information on this page (e.g. allegations that money donated to Free Republic was used improperly) really belongs on that page. As we have been unable to discuss this effectively up to this point, I'm putting it on VfD, so that a) we can get more eyes looking at it, and b) perhaps we can have a real discussion about the merits of the article, rather than the politics surrounding my abortive attempt at merging it.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> In keeping with the wikipedia VFD Policy, I'd also like to point out that a clear majority consensus to <b>keep</b> this article already existed on the discussion page <a href="../../../j/i/m/Talk%7EJim_Robinson_33a3.html" title="Talk:Jim Robinson">talk:Jim Robinson</a> at the time this VfD process was initiated (4 editors to 2), the main dissenting voice being the individual who both sought the original merge and initiated this VfD process.

<ul>
<li>And I'd like to point out that <b>this is a lie</b>, as there were at most three people (accounts) in favor of keeping the article: Rangerdude, Wakeforest (a puppet) and ObsidianOrder, who came from the RfC page, posted one brief comment, and has never come back. There were two obviously in favor of merging: myself and Katefan0. However, we can continue discussion on this matter at the corresponding point on the talk page, as this is not very relevent to the article anymore. Thanks for telling the truth in the future, anyway, Rangerdude! --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_Christensen_06ee.html" title="User:Jonathan Christensen">Jonathan Christensen</a> 05:39, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Tis no lie at all, JC. You've forgotten/ignored <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasito_3c90.html" title="User:Casito">User:Casito</a>, who originally objected to your merger and requested that you discuss it first. You essentially shunned him then since he imposed upon your unilateral actions, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised you would ignore him again here. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 06:25, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, as you would know if you actually read the Talk page, I've far from forgotten Casito--I simply do not believe that his suggestion that I try discussing before merging counts as a vote on the side of keeping them as seperate articles. In fact, he later said, on the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFree_Republic_3a03.html" title="Talk:Free Republic">Talk:Free Republic</a>, <i>I probably should have read this talk too before I reverted the page when I did. I’ll make some notes in both talk pages to prevent others from doing the same.-Casito 23:23, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</i>, which makes the view that he is in absolute support of keeping them in different articles unreasonable. Along the same line, he also said, on his <a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasito_0bf9.html" title="User talk:Casito">talk page</a>: <i>Silly me, I should have read the Talk:Free Republic page before I commented. Or maybe I shouldn’t have been reading recent changes in the wee hours of the morning. -Casito 23:17, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</i> In any case, I've asked him to come clarify his views here, so hopefully we will soon learn the truth from the horse's mouth, so to speak. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_Christensen_06ee.html" title="User:Jonathan Christensen">Jonathan Christensen</a> 11:34, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>To set the record straight:</b> I found this page while following RC. I took actions after only reading <a href="../../../j/i/m/Talk%7EJim_Robinson_33a3.html" title="Talk:Jim Robinson">talk:Jim Robinson</a>. This page contained no mention of the fact that it would be merged to Free Republic. This looked like simple page vandalism or a rather unilateral and inelegant political statement. I didn't bother to check out <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFree_Republic_3a03.html" title="Talk:Free Republic">talk:Free Republic</a> which is quite understandable since JC left me no clues. If I had read <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFree_Republic_3a03.html" title="Talk:Free Republic">talk:Free Republic</a>, I would have seen the ongoing debate and let the disputants decide what to do, since it wasn't my plan to get entangled in a long-standing dispute that I didn't care about. I take no position on the merits of the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Robinson_6b83.html" title="Jim Robinson">Jim Robinson</a> article, but I believe the action taken by JC was inappropriate.

<li><b>Merge and redirect.</b> This man is only notable for the Website he runs; I therefore see no reason for there to be two separate articles. As to Daily Kos et al, I feel that he and his Website are not as familiar to most folks as the others. Although, for that matter, I'm not entirely sure that their webmasters need their own article either. As to the VfD, it's true that merging is not usually a reason to list on VfD, but considering that the redirecter and the person who keeps reverting the redirects have been unable to come to an agreement, it is appropriate, I think, to put the matter to the general populace. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 19:41, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A school 'enterprise' company, non-encyclopedic self-promotion--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 13:35, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Folio Young Enterprise is active within the Colchestrian community. The article provides information to many in Colchester, as well as members of the School. I intend for the Young Enterprise of CRGS to be integrated with <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester_Royal_Grammar_School_2675.html" title="Colchester Royal Grammar School">Colchester Royal Grammar School</a>. -- Comment by User:213.78.82.189</p>
<p>Keep it.. 'self-promotion' was never intended to be a motive for writing this article. It is certainly not 'non-encyclopedic', if only for the reason that it provides information to many people who will never buy a product. The style of the article is informative, not self-promoting, and to delete it would be to go against wikipedia's original aims: to inform without bias based on importance. I would politely suggest that perhaps wikipedia is going downhill if people spend their time looking for knowledge to be lost rather than found. This is as much about the principles as about the specific argument: the loss of knowledge is against wikipedia's deeply-held core beliefs, and as not a single word of the article is opinion, to delete would be to go against all of this. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">diji_tak</a> 15:00, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I vote <b>keep</b>. As a resident of Colchester (undeniably one of the more famous towns in Britain) I found this article useful. No attempt has been made to sell the products of the company (especially since most would be irrelevant to the target audience) and there is only one link to the website, so I do not think this article is particularly self-promoting. On the contrary, I found it to be most informative and educational. Admittedly, it is a little short, and with a little expansion it could be truly encycolpedic, but I see no reason to delete the article. Keep it. --flex21 16:43, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems to be a reasonably prominent Polish journalist and writer. Some expansion of the biography would be fine, though.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article could need some expansion by someone familiar with the person, but there is really nothing seriously wrong with it. In fact, it is probably better than 99% of the articles on baseball or cricket players. The nomination is based on a faulty search and reinforced by unfounded suspicions of vanity. Polish economists mainly active during the 1960s through 1980s aren't necessarily very googlable. Moreover, <b>the <i>subject</i> of the article is <i>dead</i></b>, perished, a Polish ex-journalist, has gone to his maker etc. At least according to the article he <i>died 25 January 2005</i>. Even supposing he wouldn't be dead, he is born in 1923. How many 82 year old Polish economists do you think we have on Wikipedia? — The existence, name and books of Albinowski can very easily be checked using the catalogue of the National Library of Poland <a href="http://alpha.bn.org.pl/" class="external text" title="http://alpha.bn.org.pl/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which also confirms the birth-year (death-year is not given, but these kinds of things often lag behind a few years). I also find reference to nine articles in economic journals in the <a href="http://oh1.csa.com/" class="external text" title="http://oh1.csa.com/" rel="nofollow">IBSS: International Bibliography of the Social Sciences</a> database, all written in Polish. (These academic publication databases usually have a bias towards Western European languages, especially English, so there are likely more articles.) The <a href="http://infotrac.london.galegroup.com/default" class="external text" title="http://infotrac.london.galegroup.com/default" rel="nofollow">K G Saur World Biographical Information System Online (WBIS Online)</a> also confirms his existence and refers to <i>Who's Who in the Socialist Countries of Europe</i> (München [et al.]: Saur, 1989). I also found a reference to him in an article in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> Oct. 27, 1960, according to which Albinowski was the economic commentator for the Warsaw paper <i>Zycie Warszawy</i> and an outspoken critic of the way the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comecon.html" title="Comecon">Comecon</a> worked at the time. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:23, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>If he is dead, why is there a <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanislaw_Albinowski_d442.html" title="User:Stanislaw Albinowski">User:Stanislaw Albinowski</a> still editing as of today? Either 1) his death is incorrect reported or 2) there is a wikipedia editor pretending to be the Stanislaw Albinowski (with the Stanislaw Albinowski article on his userpage), in which case the admins should look into it. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 10:45, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The author is a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbie.html" title="Newbie">newbie</a> who registered both here and on the Polish Wikipedia yesterday.

Mr. Albinowski was rather "old-fashion" East-block socialist-economist and the present times show, that his opinions were quite wrong, but it is not the reason to delete the article. --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulo_dc4c.html" title="User:Julo">Julo</a> 14:23, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The significance of the user name is that I probably would not have looked twice at this article if I hadn't noticed that the names were the same. Then, when I saw that the subject was deceased, I rather suspected that the author was the subject's son. Nothing at all wrong with that, it's quite nice, in fact, but it lead me to question whether the article would have been written were circumstances otherwise. I suspect that the subject does not pass the "more notable than the average professor" test, which is why I nominated the article for deletion. But this is why we have a voting process, in the hope that collective wisdom is greater than individual wisdom. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> 21:40, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Kajsa Bergh</i> has illustrated a book published at Surrealistförlaget in 1988. No hits in newspaper texts.</li>
<li><i>Bruno Jacobs</i> is a poet, editor and translator. Libris has seven titles, not all his alone. Only a few hits in newspaper texts. (BTW, Google shows that there are other many people with this name, including a Swiss classical scholar who seems noteworthy.)</li>

<li>Conclusion: Although some of these people obviously must have have other day-jobs, as a group they seem to have a fairly large corpus of publications, many in collaboration with one another, and a decent presence in the culture sections of Swedish newspapers. Individually, Carl-Michael Edenborg and Aase Berg probably could deserve articles of their own, if somebody would bother writing them. I don't know what the Wikipedia music guidelines would say about Bergmark. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 10:06, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Added note on above conclusion: Excellent research Uppland! While it is a fact that these individuals' own accomplishements appear to justify an article on themselves, the issue here is, The Surrealist Group in Stockholm. Granted, each seperate member does have a history of accomplishments outside of this group, but again, the focus here is on the Stockhlom Group as a whole. Yes, Carl and Aase do deserve an article on their own merits, but not this group. This group's collective history does not provide enough credible material to justify an article, that is what must be considered.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 15:56, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Remember, the issue here was not to dismiss the notability of the individual members. Each particular member is notable in their own right, but please remember the quality of the research when someone is going to study surrealism after 1966. Let me remind you all again, It is not the individual members that is being considered for VfD, but the article, The Surrealist Group in Stockholm. In your research, can you find enough solid, credible and notable material on The Stockhlom Surrealist Group? That is what I am asking. As for the various individual members own merits and contributions outside of this collective group, that is all great and I fully support any articles on Carl and Aase, but you need to convince me about this group as a whole. Where did they meet? Where did they exhibit their paintings and works, poetry, writings, pamphlets, etc.? Are there any newspaper articles, or any mention of them in any art media or literary media as, "The Surrealist Group in Stockholm"? Do you understand what I am asking? Again, are there any sources that are credible enough that provide information and material on and about, The Surrealist Group in Stockholm? Uppland, you did an excellent job in your research on the individual members, I need to see what you can find on this group as mentioned as, The Surrealist Group in Stockholm? Do you understand?<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 18:01, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Do I find articles which discuss the group as a whole under that name? Yes, I do. However, most articles which mention the group do it just as part of the description of the background of the individual members, as when an article from 2002 mentions that Aase Berg as new editor of BLM has brought with her the traditions from <i>Stora saltet</i> (the journal of the surrealist group) etc. I still think this makes the group significant. (The group appears to have been most active from the late 1980s through mid 1990s and the newspaper texts I have are more complete for later years.) BTW, I found another writer said to belong to the surrealist group, Maja Lundgren (not mentioned in the VfD'd article), a novelist who is also now published by Bonnier's (and who has had a novel translated into several languages and apparently nominated for the prestigious Italian prize <a href="../../../../it/p/r/e/Premio_Bancarella_9cc4.html" class="extiw" title="it:Premio_Bancarella">Premio Bancarella</a>). / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 20:09, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excellent research, Uppland. Is there any evidence that they are still active? I could be wrong (and I think that I am in this case) but I think they might have broken up in 1998, with various members going their seperate ways while accomplishing their above mentioned works. Now, the key here is to decide that since there exists a consensus to keep this article, how can we further establish the information about this group in a coherent and chronological manner that will help the student who is studying surrealism after 1966 and comes across this particular group? Uppland, I myself looked at their website, and it is beyond me how little information is on there, since its asserted that they were significant (I still want to debate that if you or anyone can produce more quality information on them, like you already have). You see, I need to know, specifically (and precisely), what newspapers, what media, what publications in Sweden or anywhere, specifically report on The Stockholm Surrealist Group or their publication, <i>Stora saltet</i> while they were active? Uppland, when you say, "an article from 2002 mentions that Aase Berg as new editor of BLM has brought with her the traditions from <i>Stora saltet</i> (the journal of the surrealist group) etc. I still think this makes the group significant", can you tell us is this from a newspaper account on Aase Berg that mentions her past activity in this group, and can this newspaper produce any information on this group? Did she say she was in this group? Granted, when a reporter or any writer is doing a piece on Aase, most likely they will contact her directly and ask her about her and her work (and her past) and get a statement from her, but we as encyclopedia researchers are of a different breed of investigative researchers, if Aase is mentioned in any newpaper account as being a past member of this group, is that all what we have to go on? Research is painstaking and at times often tedious but we must present quality information and facts to the world in this encylcopedia. So again, specifically, what newspapers in Sweden have reported on this group while they were active?<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 22:42, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'll have to admit that I am out on a limb here, as I am not really familiar with the group or very familiar with contemporary Swedish literature in general. Nevertheless, I have tried to expand the article with the help of some newspaper articles, especially one by another writer who has followed the group from the outside almost since its beginning. There are some texts on their website which should also be used in order to describe the self-image of the group, but they are a bit less straightforward, so I have mostly left them outside for the time being. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 09:01, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The research that you have done has provided more quality information to help save this article. Again, the key issue here is information on and/or about this group, The Surrealist Group in Stockholm and their activity in Surrealism. There is good information on the various individual members of this group, their accomplishments, writings, etc.,etc., but we need to see more information on this group as a whole. I recommend to send an E-mail to an expert on Surrealism, Prof.Mary Ann Caws. She is an expert on surrealism and has written books on surrealism and I think she can lead us into a good direction into this particular group of ex-surrealists.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 00:00, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. There is plenty of information on the individual members and their work outside of this group, and that really is not relevant to their work in Surrealism while they were active as The Stockholm Surrealist Group.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

Really? I mean, seriously, is the chair of this society more important to the university than a professor of physics? Did anyone join the university thinking 'the course is crap, but they have a good roleplaying society?'). I'm of the opinion that this is vanity, and an over inflated sense of ones importance in the scheme of things. I was a chair of a society at University (and one that had more active members than this one) and while it's a good way to pass the evening and all that, I wouldn't think of creating an article for it.

<li><b>comment:</b> What the article still needs, and would work towards it's defense, is the information about some of it's other national events such as TRICON 2001. With regards to the impression of role playing, there are already a ton of articles on the subject. It's not necisarily more important than a business that 'employs' 150 people, but we often have had more than 200 members sign up in a year. A perfect encyclopedia would contain information on such things. It's not intended to be vain or over emphisised, there's just more information available on it then alot of things of similar importance. We do have a budget in the thousands and vanity pages according to the tutorial pages are personal as opposed to an orginisation.--Kaiser Sma 23:00, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment:</b> In further reference to average earthman's comment, alot of people (right or wrong) have put a considerable amount of effort into this society, many people do join UL in part for it's clubs and societies. I know many people who have spent considerably more time and effort into making them work then their respective studies. This was not made as information for potential students, it was made because we believed it deserved a permenant reference. Most of the people involved in it's construction are graduates as well.--Kaiser Sma 23:22, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, this society has its own website (where they are boasting about being in wikipedia), so this information in available to interested parties. Wikipedia is not the sum of all mundane information, it should be an encyclopedia. There a a role-playing society, and anime society and infinite religious and sporting groups at every university, some of these may be valid long-running clubs that have hade members of note and are suitable for an encyclopedia, but <b>most</b> aren't, you're looking at one of the unencyclopedic ones here.

<li><b>comment</b>: Bainer, you're wrong on two counts (as far as I can tell). You say the society only affects 120 people. We won the best improved society of the year, as voted by all the other clubs and societies in the university. We have 120 members at the minute, as Zilog Jones said - but 600-800 past members and goodness knows how many in the future. We're involved with other universities in paintball competitions, wargames and some sci-fi interests. (so not just role-playing). You also said people were voting twice, which I would have picked up on straightaway had it been there.</li>
</ul>
<p>The person who started the article (me) did indeed not realise what he had started. I wanted an encyclopedic account of my favourite society, and one which I believe affects enough people to warrant a wiki article. If I looked it up (and found there wasn't a page there) how many other people would try? Another point of information - societies are asked by the university staff to set up stands during open days. This is to "show off" the clubs and societies to prospective students. Many students frequently do choose one university over another because of a better list of societies, if they can do their course at either. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrumad_691d.html" title="User:Trumad">Trumad</a> 21:21, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Clearly "affects" more people than just its members, it's of possible interest to other members of the Irish gaming community, and perhaps to the UL "societies crowd" in general. However, I'd certainly rename, as per Klonimus, and trim excess detail, as per several contributers. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:37, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Actually, I withdraw my last statement. What defines a club or society as "significant" is too vague and discretionary, and could even be verging on discriminatory in some cases. It's not exactly hurting or degrading the Wikipedia by having such entries. Though as others have said, we may decimate some sections of it - as it stands now, it's already bigger than the actual UL article! --<a href="../../../z/i/l/User%7EZilog_Jones_9c07.html" title="User:Zilog Jones">Zilog Jones</a> 09:22, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>article manages to establish NON-NOTABILITY. <i>This mall is frequently shopped at. It has been around for several decades and at one time, was a unique shopping mall.</i> I would guess that the origin of this article is the link to Livona Mall in the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livonia%2C_Michigan_d5dc.html" title="Livonia, Michigan">Livonia, Michigan</a> article.

<li>My confusion is stemming from the fact that it isn't apparent to me from the text of the article in what sense the mall actually <i>was</i> unique. The article baldly states the mall was, at one time, unique. It doesn't say <i>how</i> it was unique. Is it merely saying that it was, at one time, the only shopping mall in <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livonia%2C_Michigan_d5dc.html" title="Livonia, Michigan">Livonia, Michigan</a>?

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, sorry, as the creator of the post I'm totally new to Wikipedia. I admit as a fan of the group I may have used over exhuberant descriptions, however consider that edited! Sorry about deleting the vote, I tried to type this comment between the two comments (it originally only refered to the first vote) and accidently deleted the block of text. I do, however think that this 'fake rapper' accusation is slightly inflammatory, and innacurate. Just to clear up some confusion you may have, the group consist of two producers, not rappers. I'm not really sure how much knowledge of hip hop you have, but the two things are fundamentally different. I also find the 'wannabees' comment slightly offensive, unless you have knowledge of the group and their rather large (albiet underground) following, it's unfair for you to typecast them in such a way. Again, however, apologies for deleting the original comment, I hope my open admission and full apology of this will stop me from being banned from editing! <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanwarren_3e38.html" title="User:Ianwarren">Ianwarren</a>

<li>So would I, but I'd caution that we cannot be absolutely sure that it's her. The nature of Wikipedia is such that anybody can claim to be anybody. While I believe that <a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbey_f99f.html" title="User:Cumbey">User:Cumbey</a> most likely is the author Constance Cumbey, I'd give her the benefit of the doubt. There's a small possibility that some crank has stolen her identity and used it on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 15:02, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
