<li><b>Keep All</b> These pages are very important to wikipedia and should not be deleted. They are not how to guides. There are not strategy guides. They are not game guides either. They do not give the reader one strategy. They do not tell you how to pass a mission in the game or how to use an unit effectivly. They simply tell the reader that a unit in the game exists and describe the units. These articles are also not gamecruft. Wikipedia defines <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">gamecruft</a> as "a selection of content that is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans."

<li>Really? Some quotes picked out, more or less randomly from one of the pages: <i>Tiberium Refineries process raw tiberium, turning it into credits that a player can use to purchase new units and structures. Without a refinery a player's economy will slowly deteriorate until all credits have been exhausted</i>...<i>The tiberium refinery is only capable of storing 2,000 tiberium credits, therefore Tiberium Silos are used to store any additional tiberium refined in the facility.</i>...<i>Orca pads allow for the construction of Orca aircraft. Without Orca pads any Orca aircraft returning to a GDI base will be unable to rearm itself.</i> Sounds like advice to a player to me; i.e., a game guide. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:23, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- These articles are within their rights to stay, in my opinion. While it may be true that a good deal of the information within the articles are indeed "game specific," the "game specific" information is only there to detail the key differences between each vehicle/unit/etc. between each game. To reiterate, there have been a great deal of changes over the course of time to a lot of these units. For example, as stated, the GDI and Nod APCs eventually differentiated from one-another over the course of time, one becoming amphibious, and one being equipped with a drill for burrowing underground. But I digress.<br />
My point is that this information is here because people showed interest in learning the history of some of these units and equipment. Is that not what encyclopedias are for? Storing information and recalling it when interested? Go read an encyclopedia some time. I'm sure some of the "irrelivant" information you'd find there would turn your head. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Collins_3462.html" title="User:Joseph Collins">Joseph Collins</a> 03:30, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The presence of other poor articles is never an excuse for the existence of a poor article. Two wrongs don't make a right. C&amp;C first, then I'm going to try and clear out the Warcruft. And if you think the C&amp;C fans love their game guides, my goodness that will be fun. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/</i><b>/</b><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 11:57, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thank you for replying regarding my position! I agree with you in saying that, "Two wrongs don't make a right." However, why can't you correct the "other wrong" of you don't open up your concern on articles like Warcraft that you want to delete by nominating them as early as now? I also agree with what you say, which is, "The presence of other poor articles is never an excuse for the existence of a poor article." But why can't you start eliminating those "other poor articles" that you describe so that it would not be used as "an excuse for the existence of a poor article", in which I assume that the "poor article" you describe is this? This is contradicting to "C&amp;C first, then I'm going to try and clear out the Warcruft." If you want to prove that these "poor articles" from a less famous game, like C&amp;C be deleted first, then you should make a basis for that by making more famous game, like Warcraft as a concrete proof, rather than using a senseless, invented, and irrelevant argument as a proof. Note that I am not judging the fame of both games mentioned; however, it is evident that recent games like <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_of_the_Ancients_75a0.html" title="Defense of the Ancients">DOTA</a> is more famous than the latest C&amp;C games, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Command_%26_Conquer%7E_Generals_08b8.html" title="Command &amp; Conquer: Generals">Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Command_%26_Conquer%7E_The_First_Decade_4e56.html" title="Command &amp; Conquer: The First Decade">Command &amp; Conquer: The First Decade</a>. I also want to grab the opportunity to suggest to you to delete the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_of_the_Ancients_75a0.html" title="Defense of the Ancients">Defense of the Ancients</a> article and <a href="../../../d/o/t/DotA_Allstars_e83f.html" title="DotA Allstars">DotA Allstars</a> article since they are more of a "strategy guide" article rather than an encyclopaedic article. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarth_Narutorious_5f72.html" title="User:Darth Narutorious">Darth Narutorious</a> 12:53, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
