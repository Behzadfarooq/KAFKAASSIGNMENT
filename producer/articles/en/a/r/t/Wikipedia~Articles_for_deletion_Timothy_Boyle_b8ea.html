<li>I would consider you wrong there. The article being in chemistry needs to be peer reviewed and reference the work it built upon, however, the number of bits of work it cites is not how it should be judged. Some of the most unique work cannot site much in the way of prior art.

<li>I realise that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> can be tricky to hit with academia, but I would expect if Dr.Boyle had "significantly advanced the field of chemistry" as the article states, there should at least be some peer review or similar documentation available? I'm not trying to be awkward here - even though I voted Delete above, I'm quite willing to be persuaded. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 18:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree with your comment on "significantly advanced the field of chemistry" and feel that it is probably just him being big headed - so have editted it so that it just says what he actually did. However, an improvemnet in methodology can be important in the field as it is these changes that allow for whole new fields to open themselves up. I am also arguing the same case for the page Dr Alethea Tabor. - <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurious_Gregor_ba7f.html" title="User:Curious Gregor">Curious Gregor</a> - Synthesis for all 18:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Might I enquire, in terms of the h-factor, how are patents ranked against journal articles. I have rarely seen patents cited in the chemical literature, but surely a scientist's number pf patents need to be included in the h-factor in some way. - <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurious_Gregor_ba7f.html" title="User:Curious Gregor">Curious Gregor</a> - Synthesis for all 12:43, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>From the first sentence of the <a href="../../../h/-/i/H-index.html" title="H-index">h-index</a> article, "The h-index is an index for quantifying the <b>scientific productivity</b> of physicists and other scientists based on their <b>publication record</b>."

</li>
<li><b>Patents</b>: One could use the h factor principle for patents; however, I have not seen it used that way yet, and there would be technical difficulties. It is quite difficult to find all the patents for an individual person, include the ones that may have been entered under the name of a company, and sort out the duplicates, and then see which other patents cited them.. The public access databases, such as Scirus or USPTO, list <i>some</i>, but even Chemical Abstracts and Web of Science do not have the necessary facilities for an adequate citation search. This sort of searching is a profession of its own, and if we have anyone here with the knowledge and the access to the extremely expensive commercial databases,please let us know. Even having done found them all, I cannot imagine a rational way of combining this with journal article citations, for the principles about what one cites are different. Therefore, in WP , we use whatever patents we get told about of happen to find in an ordinary search. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
