<p>Since Wikipedia Watch was not considered important enough to have its own article, I think that the same applies of this article, and also <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Information_Research_b1d1.html" title="Public Information Research">Public Information Research</a>. Thus, I believe that the contents of this article should be <b>merged</b> into the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> article. Also, I see a way in which this entire mess with Brandt can be sorted out (Copied and pasted from the Wikipedia Watch Deletion Voting):</p>
<p><b>Create</b> a brand spanking new article entitled <b>"A List of Websites which Daniel Brandt is Affiliated With"</b>, and then merge the contents of both <b>Wikipedia Watch</b> and of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a>, plus that of information on <b>Yahoo! Watch</b>, <b>NameBase</b>, <b>Wikipedia Review</b> and <b>Public Information Research</b>, into the new article. Then, <b>delete</b> all personal information about Brandt (Age/Gender/Location is one thing, but I seriously doubt people were going in 1947: "Good Lord! A Child has been born to missionary parents in China! Let us visit him!" Equally, I seriously doubt there is anything else within his <b>"Background"</b> section that he is notable for. As far as I see it, he is notable only for his contributions to those 6 websites) and then <b>merge</b> what non-personal information there exists left from the Brandt article (including the Seigenthaler stuff) into the new article. This way, several birds are killed with one stone: We cannot complain that Brandt is over represented in his articles in Wikipedia because he will only really feature in one as this proposal details; it will end the controversy in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> article over the inclusion or not of Wikipedia Review because now we will have information about it; Brandt will most likely cease to complain because what he feels to be "private matters" will no longer be on Wikipedia for everyone to see; and it can stop this bitter war that exists between Brandt and Wikipedia: Brandt can be left to his own devices and Wikipedia can finally have a Brandt article free of controversy and one which they can be truly proud of.</p>
<p>Obviously this process can only be achieved through AfDs, so I beg your co-operation in this matter. Jonathan 666 17:09, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Google Watch is extensive and notable, and it has been profiled in major publications. It led to <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scroogle.html" title="Scroogle">Scroogle</a> and other work by the same activist(s). This is a rambling <s>bad-faith</s> nomination. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 17:51, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No it isn't. Nowhere do I deny the notability of Google Watch, but what I am saying is that Brandt should have less space on Wikipedia, and that this whole conflict between Wikipedia and Brandt should be put to rest. Because what is it now? Six, seven months? It's getting tiresome. We need a singular article on Brandt which covers his work with the 7 websites (as you've just reminded me of Scroogle), and is devoid of his personal information (such as the China and missionary parents issue) and is thus able to solve many problems as a result. Jonathan 666 18:50, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is standard to include someone's birthplace, birthdate, information about parents, etc. Brandt himself supplied this information to Chasnoff for publication in the San Antonio newspaper. And if Google Watch is notable, shouldn't it have its own entry? Wikipedia Watch is a three-page rant site comprised mostly of an enemies list-- not too notable. Google Watch and Scroogle have been written up on lots of major publications. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 19:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps, but who honestly goes to the Brandt article wanting to know that he was born in X and raised by Y, when in reality it is likely that the majority of people who go onto Wikipedia to look at his article are probably just interested in what he did with the 7 websites mentioned above.</li>

<dd>Wikipedia Watch not notable? Searching for it on Google generates 27,300,000 hits, and that was not considered important enough for its own article. Please see however the point about the amount of birds killed with a single stone if this proposal was to go through. We honestly do not need to give Brandt all this space on Wikipedia, due simply to the fact that people more notable than him get less space on Wikipedia, and really in the great scheme of things Brandt is really not that important to have so many articles on Wikipedia.
