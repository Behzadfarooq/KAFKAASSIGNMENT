That's too bad, but as per long-standing "there are worse..." arguments, let's continue the cleanup efforts - and we can begin with this one. <i>If this guy is notable, let's see it.</i> Otherwise, let's delete this article. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know what the policy is, but I believe that AfD's closed with a No Consensus To Delete may be tried again, as opposed to those with an actual Keep which either need to go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> or else to wait a few months before trying again. That said, I don't think its very good form to immediately go right back to AfD. But its "legal" as far as I know. The problem with the guy's article is that it was apparantly copyvio, so I had to cut it back to almost nothing. But I think that it's <i>possible</i> that he <i>may</i> be slightly notable as some kind alternative-medicine guy. I thought he had written a book, but I guess not, as it's not listed in the article. Anyway, I'm not voting. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 01:42, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> - you are the one concluding he is an expert, and that's POV. You'll need a source other than yourself that says he's an expert to prove your point.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - First, the only reference I've seen to 100 papers is something he's published on his own website. Second, the "favorably reviewed" "paper" wasn't published in a peer review journal. So where is this so-called "review"? Third, my insurance doesn't cover "alternative medicine". Lastly, and most significantly, where, aside from your own high praise, has anyone (other than the subject himself) published anything stating he's an "expert" or otherwise notable? <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 03:19, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Hmm, calm down you two&#160;:-) Taking everything together, I am happy enough that he is an expert in his field. The fact that it is 'alternative medicine' shouldn't count against him, in my view. I would also add the point - why would we want to exclude him? Does his inclusion harm Wikipedia bearing in mind that rappers who have released two CDs get in? I have nothing against rappers BTW, I am just making the point that Wikipedia is a broad church. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 04:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak delete</b> I'm not really sold either way on this one but I'd like to point out a few things. First, 100 papers for an 80 year old academic, while certainly worth a mention, is not that exceptional and highly depends on what you call "a paper". Since that claim is taken from a source which is most definitely not independent of the subject, we just have to assume that this is perhaps a bit generous. Secondly, an academics' job is to conduct studies, publish papers and sit on expert committees so it would take more than the current claims that he did those things to convince me. I'm not saying this man is not a renowned expert in his field but simply that the evidence given in the article is pretty flimsy right now. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 06:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree, seems like they're desperate for publicity. After reading the article Secret menu I immediately thought that it wasn't so "secret", the "rumour" they had a "Quadruple bypass" was probably started by the restaurant's owner, immediately after inventing the dish in question. But all this makes me hungry for hamburgers.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> - I looked at the points made for retention and looked at the article. Nothing asserts any significance to the power station - it simply has - the output statistics the plant, and also some peripheral info about the meterological circumstances of the area, and some eniginerring stats about the actual structure. I actually know of a few high schools in my city which have a token 2-3 wind turbines and I can't see how 56 is a "signficant investment" unless Iowa is in the stone age, which I believe it is not. Also Truthbringer's point about the news info has been countered (to be honest, if one line is enough, then high school kids who win math/science competitions would also be notable (they aren't)). As for the hydrodams, they usually require a lot of deforestration and also are usually 1km wide (or something massive), whereas these are a few sticks in the ground. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 07:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tourist attraction?? Aren't they usually considered eyesores which damage the local scenic countryside &amp; wildlife?

<dd>I have no opinion on this particular article, but, to be fair, wind farms sometimes do attract tourism in their areas. I doubt this one does, but it would be unfair to lump all wind farms into the eyesore category. GassyGuy 08:05, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. There are many articles about hydro-electric dams and their electricity generating facilities because they are notable works of engineering, because they are notable as business entities and because their construction raises environmental, farming and hunting issues. Generating stations which depend on fossil fuel are also notable because of pollution concerns. Similarly, wind farms are generally significant business entities, a source of noise, and a hazard to birds which can be killed by the blades of the turbines. And the questions of regulation and government-versus-investor ownership of electricity generation and distribution companies can be matters for significant public concern. Electricity generation is more complicated than it might seem. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 22:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> While I agree that it's a challenge to maintain a neutral point-of-view on such an article, objectively chronicling verifiable and nationally-covered controversy or criticism of an international corporation is perfectly encyclopedic. A better solution would be to watch the article and try to neutralise any ranting or POV that may surface, but the topic itself has merit. — <a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>NM</b></font></a><a href="../../../n/m/c/User_talk%7ENMChico24_41e0.html" title="User talk:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>Chico</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NMChico24_752e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>24</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg/25px-Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" /></a> 04:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While I too feel that NPOV is tough to achieve in an article that basically just slams a company, it is needed to keep the overall NPOV, and a deletion and merge would make the wal-mart article far to long. EnsRedShirt 04:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I find that the sheer amount of coverage of the topic is also a form of POV bias. The main points need to be presented in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>, and the rest needs to find another home. We aren't the BBB or Consumer Reports and we shouldn't try to be.

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously the POV of this article has to walk a fine line, but the concept itself is well-established, and the potential length warrants seperation from the main Wal-Mart article.

I would say that it is <i>more POV</i> to delete the article then it would be to keep it since by doing so you eliminating an important coverage aspects of Wal-mart.

<li><b>Comment, yarrr</b> Much criticism from Wal-Mart comes from union funded campaigns/organizations such as <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wake_Up_Wal-Mart_cec4.html" title="Wake Up Wal-Mart">Wake Up Wal-Mart</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_Watch_04d4.html" title="Wal-Mart Watch">Wal-Mart Watch</a>. It is in my opinion that such criticism rationale should go into the articles about the organizations criticising Wal-Mart, not in an article about Wal-Mart itself, with links provided from the main article. Specific lawsuits should go in separate [[whatever v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.]] articles, with links again to the main. Everything directly related to Wal-Mart should go in the main article, while criticism that is common to big-box stores in general should go to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big-box_store.html" title="Big-box store">big-box store</a>.

<dd>I think there is some backwards logic here in regards to moving to the criticisms to the union pages. You want to keep information as centralized and relevant to the topic as possible. When the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_Book_Review_9cd4.html" title="New York Times Book Review">New York Times Book Review</a> makes a comment about a book, should we include the comment in the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_criticism.html" title="Literary criticism">Literary criticism</a> section of the book's article or on the New York Times page? When President Bush criticised <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trent_Lott_dcd8.html" title="Trent Lott">Trent Lott</a> for his Strom Thurmond comments should those criticisms go on the <a href="../../../g/w/b/GWB_14d0.html" title="GWB">GWB</a> page or on Lott's? The normal "ideal situation" would be for this information to be in the main Walmart article, however the <i>breadth</i> of criticisms would makes that cumbersome and unfairly tilt the POV in the main article. Hence, the reason for this article's existence and a strong reason to keep it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:49, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difference between the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_Book_Review_9cd4.html" title="New York Times Book Review">New York Times Book Review</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wake_Up_Wal-Mart_cec4.html" title="Wake Up Wal-Mart">Wake Up Wal-Mart</a> is that the purpose of the latter is to exclusively criticise Wal-Mart; hence such criticism is more directly related to the campaign. The problem with this nomination is what is not realized here: Not only is Wal-Mart's criticism considered a notable subject by a lot of people, but so is the very existence of this article on the English Wikipedia. Despite we still can't decide how the hell to resolve the disputes in this article, it is amazing to see this much energy into keeping an article with so many problems around. Obviously, you work for <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_Depot_1d41.html" title="Office Depot">Office Depot</a> but I don't know if it's unionized or affiliated in any way with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. It makes me wonder where this energy is coming from, for it is either the Pro-Wal-Mart side or the union-funded Anti-Wal-Mart side. Or maybe just Wal-Mart bashers in general.

<dd>LOL, actually I don't work for Office Depot. I just gladly leech off of their wireless network.&#160;:P (Seriously, it's 2:30 in the morning here. Do you think they're open?) As for the example, the purpose of the New york times book review is to criticized books (positive or negative). I agree that the article needs some clean up but AfD <i>never has</i> and <i>never will</i> be a substitute for clean up. Personally, I like Wal-mart. I am actually a small business owner and from a cost perspective, they are valuable. However, I recognize that criticism about this company is notable and commented on by a variety of reliable sources--not just those union organizations. As I noted before the deletion of a notable and encyclopedic topic just because you disagree with it, <i>is more POV</i> then this article will ever be. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:42, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The way you're going on, you make it sound like the point of Wikipedia is to assume that all sources are either lies or merely incorrect. So, do me a favor and explain to me why all of the sources on Wikipedia, which could be lying or incorrect, get put on Wikipedia without a second thought, but a scan with absolutely no reason to assume is fake cannot be used as a source? Just because you do not like my evidence does not make it bad evidence. Instead of presenting the possibility that it, like literally every other source for every single piece of information in the universe, could be fake, why don't you prove it? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 07:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Source? Are you saying that screenshots plus details about the game is insufficient evidence to show that the game exists? This is not a matter of Wikinews on Wikipedia, this is a matter of a notable game on a notable system getting an article because it was announced to exist. The argument that it could be a fake scan is a laughable one. One would have to go to insane measures to get it as detailed as it is. Not only that, but saying a magazine scan could be fake (not on the basis that it looks fake, but on the basis that there have been fakes) creates precedent for not only all magazine scans to be labelled as possible fakes and not suitable for Wikipedia, but also news. Just because you hold a certain site to a higher standard than magazine scans doesn't mean it necessarily is a decent source. Remember when Yahoo! said Andy Kaufman was alive? Either a lie or misinformation on their part. There is no indication that this scan is fake. The place that I found the scan on, NeoGAF, is a constant supplier of magazine scans from Dengeki, CoroCoro Comics, Famitsu and others. Not only that, but it is from 2ch. Guess what they announced?</li>

Do you have a reasoning for why 2ch is not trustworthy? Or why this magazine scan, with incredible detail, screenshots from the game and information from the game, is not a good source? Do you see any single sign that the magazine has been altered in any way imagineable? If not, do not denounce it, treat it as if it wasn't fake, like you do with any decent source. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 07:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How is this not verifiable? Shall I point out how a whopping none of the people voting delete have even given an ioda of reason to assume that the scan is fake or incorrect? There is no reason to assume that it's fake other than the fact that we do not know what scan it is from.</p>
<p>However, I have done research and can confirm that this is Weekly Jump. It uses a similar style to other Jump magazines, and Weekly Jump is usually the magazine to first confirm a new Naruto game (similar to CoroCoro Comics and Pokémon Diamond and Pearl). This is hardly a bad source. If we do not assume that this magazine scan is a fake, it provides plenty of information. It is not some mysterious game that's nothing more than a name, system and genre; we have screenshots, details on what the touch screen will look like, some of the characters that are available, the visuals (full 3D fighter), the release date (TBA 2006) and other information that can't be assertained from the screenshots. And then we've got the fact that it's published by Takara Tomy. If we got somebody who can read Japanese, we'd have even more information. And if you claim that a scan cannot be a source - if it were uploaded to Wikipedia, it would not need a source to show it exists; because the user could look at the scan and know it exists. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 18:02, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Everything A Link to the Past has said makes sense -- it's pretty silly to discount this source over any other. That said...is there enough info on the game that it needs an article? This was brought up in another recent game that had a screenshot. The arguments were that the game wasn't developed enough to be notible, and I believe it ended up getting deleted because of that. This was a PC game, however. Honestly, my opinion is that, while the info might be verifyable...the game, at this point, might not be notible enough to have its own page. I'm sure a 'Games Based off Naruto' or somesuch page would be quite sufficient, but that's just IMO. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 19:31, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> We have sources, that being Weekly Jump. I'd say that's a great source, to boot. When it comes to games, this is the best (and only) source we could get, so I don't see point of even considering deletion of this specific article. If a game's existence can't be proven with just what one company says alone, then all articles of games not having been mentioned by two separete companies need to be removed to keep consistent with the rule. Donkey Kong Country has for instance (and this is just an example for the discussion at hand, which is why I won't go out of my way to hunt for sources - it serves its purpose even if it would've been fake) been talked about by both Rare and Nintendo personell, in which case we have two sources proving the existance of said game(s). But does a game really require a second company to comment it for it to be available to read about on WP?KiddDaBeauty</li>

<li>I think you need to take a look at the useful information that such an article as this can provide. It can either provide information on how the maps should be played (game-guide), or some information about the maps themselves: their history, significance, and so on. An example of notable, important maps that deserve their own article is at <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_maps_845e.html" title="Counter-Strike maps">Counter-Strike maps</a>: that article provides wider notes on the actual importance of its subject matter, which itself is important. In what way do these maps meet the same standard of notability?

<p>Recommending delete. Article appears to be about a non-notable organisation in the Channel Islands which offers legal advice or quasi legal advice for a fee.

<p>OK people - lets be a little dynamic - Mircosoft's website is an advert but the entry is useful for other reasons. Similarly this word is actaully being consider for inclusion in the Oxford concise for 2006 entry. There is some interesting academic debate about the origins, I wrote it up in a very simple way which may be suggestive of advertising but I was following exsisting Wiki protocols. Perhaps some of you may be able to encapsulate or re-write it better than me to address the debate over the term its history and correct usage. --Alexwebpro 12:46, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I guess removing the AfD notice will not help your cause <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelR_5647.html" title="User:NigelR">Nigel</a> <b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENigelR_05f7.html" title="User talk:NigelR">Talk</a>)</small></sup></b> 12:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No certainly not Nigel and I was not immediately aware that I had done that when I first edited, so point taken. But what is interesting Nigel is how so many new terms are coming into exsistance and how slow the print editions are to capture them. I recently came across the word '<a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigsmall.html" title="Bigsmall">Bigsmall</a>'which is currently the subject of a car advert but also very similar to the Notorious B.I.G's name Biggie Smalls. Now of course if you look up the definition of that word you will no doubt come across Toyota. I think this raises funadamental questions about where one draws the line. To all of you above try typing 'bigsmall' into google and I am confident that you will come across alot that is connected with Toyota. This could be seen as a form of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viral_marketing.html" title="Viral marketing">viral marketing</a>. And yet the word still has meaning independent of the now infamous advertising campaign. My arguement is that 'Legalsoup' falls into this same catagory.--Alexwebpro 13:47, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - while he's umpired at a national level in what is almost the national religion of parts of Australia, this has only been for ten games. Most of his umpiring has been at VFL (which in this case means the Victorian competition, not the old name of the AFL, which is an important distinction). The award being cited by another editor is at the state level (sub-national), where most of his experience is drawn from. A achievement, nonetheless, but less of one than is being suggested here.

<p>So what should be done to the article, then? The appearance is good now, but I take it that the band is not good enough&#160;:)&#160;? Well it's quite true that the band is not Metallica-big-and-famous, but it's done a quite notable career to their first album and recording deal. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kimtuomi (<a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimtuomi_f4b3.html" title="User talk:Kimtuomi">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kimtuomi_c439.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kimtuomi">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Originally prodded by Rey Brujo with the following text:</p>
<p>Unluckily, being the first one to get a Wii is not enough to become notable for Wikipedia. Thousands are featured in several TV shows, but that doesn't mean it is necessary to have his article. The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a> guidelines give two guides that may be applied: <i>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</i> (appearing on a TV program or getting a Wii before launch date aren't a newsworthy event) and <i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)</i> (which is what is happening with him).</p>
<p>I'm personally not quite sure about whether or not this qualifies as a single day's news event, nor am I convinced that TV appearances such as the Ellen Degeneres show are non newsworthy.

<p>This article is extremely poorly written, contains information taken from other articles, and is about nothing other than a website that lists strip clubs. Clearly, this was written to promote a website and not for any informational purpose. The user User:Alan harada spammed multiple articles with external links on the same day this article was created.

<p>I was somewhat amazed at the overzealous rapidity of this marking for deletion. I think the actual article was up for literally seconds before it was earmarked for annihilation. At least this provides evidence that the Wikipedia is an active thriving community.</p>
<p>I also respect the Wikipedia for being an open project. It is a project built upon open source software and open thinking. No corporation nor any government could have created such a successful project as the wikipedia which largely survives on the free energy and enthusiasm of unpaid yet very loyal people. Irrespective of what the wikipedian community has decided of and about itself, there is indeed an uplifting and empowering feeling that comes from such success. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorgrian_3359.html" title="User:Zorgrian">zorg</a> 16:57, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Does meet WP:BIO criteria. WP:BIO talks about athletes, but I think it clearly extends to competitors like Kai. There are plenty of sources out there on him; see <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411666798&amp;id=yTPvW4r3kQsC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Kai+Budde%22&amp;sig=5j6eyd2XVN8HNfQ8rNHx44_y27c" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411666798&amp;id=yTPvW4r3kQsC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Kai+Budde%22&amp;sig=5j6eyd2XVN8HNfQ8rNHx44_y27c" rel="nofollow">this</a> for instance, which is a published book, that describes Kai as "the best player in the world as of this writing." Lots of columns published on the Wizards site too. If it needs better sourcing, it should be fixed, not deleted. We shouldn't have articles on every Magic player with some success, but even if we could only have 5, this guy would definitely be one of them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. According to <a href="../../../h/m/o/Hmong_people.html" title="Hmong people">Hmong_people</a>, the Hmong are sometimes called the Mong. Of course, in English 'Mong' is far more often used as a slur against the mentally handicapped, as a contraction of 'Mongoloid'.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I just looked at the previous AFD for this article and it was very poorly handled. The nominator actually wanted it redirected to <a href="../../../h/m/o/Hmong.html" title="Hmong">Hmong</a>, which s/he should have done him/herself rather than taking it to AFD. Understandably, once it was up here, other editors supported this nom as if it were a deletion, but without producing new arguments, and an admin wrongly took this to be a consensus decision to delete.

<dd>In response to this, I looked the word up in the <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a>. The OED points to an obselete verb usage meaning to trade, a contraction of 'among' and two noun usages, namely as a contraction of 'mongrel' and pejoratively in this sense, and as a pejorative British term to mean a stupid or mentally incapable person, but the OED does not give an etymology from 'Mongoloid', or any etymology for this usage at all.</dd>
<dd>Interestingly, the OED does not list the <a href="../../../h/m/o/Hmong.html" title="Hmong">Hmong</a> meaning, or indeed the word "Hmong".</dd>

We'd be willing to modify the article to have more emphasis on her local work.

<li><b>Delete</b> I question the editorial wisdom of any project that opens up Wikipedia to articles on every grade school within any country. What about the New South Wales school system in Australia? Should we have a Wiki article on every grade school there? Or how about every grade school in China - a country that is increasingly objecting to Western cultural imperialism. I personally would like to create articles on P.S. 115 and P.S. 172 in Queens, New York. I fail to see the logic of creating Wiki articles for every grade school in any one nation. There are probably more than 100 million grade schools throughout the world. If "creating complete entries for all Canadian schools" is an "encylopedic goal in itself," why not create a separate Wiki encyclopedia on "Education in Canada" and head off the problem of nationalistic educators competing for the most Wiki articles? If I'm missing an important reason for creating a separate Wikipedia article on every school in Canada, please let me know.<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 17:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>* <i>What about the New South Wales school system in Australia?</i>, <i>I personally would like to create articles on P.S. 115 and P.S. 172 in Queens, New York.</i> - I would support any other project from Australia or New York that wanted to do the same thing.</dd>
<dd>* <i>I fail to see the logic of creating Wiki articles for every grade school in any one nation.</i> It continues to stun me what harm these types of AfDs are trying to protect Wikipedia from. I could also list reams of other types of articles that I have no interest but I would stop short of saying they shouldn't be allowed (Ball Parks, Xbox Games, Anime characters come to mind). I don't object to them and I would expect the same consideration.</dd>
<dd>* <i>why not create a separate Wiki encyclopedia on "Education in Canada" and head off the problem of nationalistic educators competing for the most Wiki articles?</i> If necessary I would put up my own wiki but I thought the reason wikipedia was here was to collect information not fragment it. Again the great concern seems to be <i>what if everyone did this</i> - that would be awesome, that would be wonderful. Wikipedia could engage educators and students all over the world that would create a generation of wiki contributors. That is why I do it and I contribute $$ to the wikimedia foundation instead running my own server.

<dd>Excuse me, but ball parks, Xbox Games, Anime characters and such are of interest to many people around the world. What I'm asking is who is interested about this elementary school - other than its students, their parents and teachers, and some of the people involved in the school system in Vancouver, Canada? If your goal is to put everything in the world inside of Wikipedia, no matter how unimportant, we already have something a bit like that. It's called the Internet. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 04:13, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I said that was fine, if you want your silly little games in Wikipedia. I don't AfD those, and I was asking for the same consideration. But when you compare a school (real physical structure that thousands of students go through and that serves a community) to a fictional animated character - I don't feel there is any need for me to have to continually justify the existence of a school in Wikipedia. You can continue to assurt that notability is your standard, it juts isn't mine. --Wakemp 15:25, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The most well-written and verifiable description of the puddle of rainwater on the street where I live (it's pouring out) would neither be noteworthy or Wikiworthy.

I'm not asking for affirmations. I am asking what possible reason is this article noteworthy.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per Askolnic and other comments. I see no reason to keep it, nothing that is at all notable.

If anything <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC</a> is a good demonstration of the absurdity of attempting to keep all these schools.

<li><b>Comment</b> Joshua, this mind boggling debate reminds me of Lewis Carroll's story about cartographers who created the most wonderful map ever. It was a gargantuan map of England drawn to the scale of 1 inch = 1 inch. It was truly a work of wonder. The only problem was that people wouldn't let them unfold it - farmers said it would destroy their crops, and others had equally trivial complaints. One of the cartographers finally suggested that they could use the actual land itself, since it was a reasonable facimile of the map. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 03:07, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

That includes the few that have not yet produced a nobel prize winner, soap opera star or serial killer.

<li>Yeah, I figured that out.

<li>Why would there need to be? If there was an argument about the verifiability of a professional hockey player's information, NHL.com would be all the sourcing required.

<dd>That the MTG community is smaller and somewhat more insular than many other sports doesn't mean it's notable members are not themselves notable.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I nominated this. Once more, segregating women from the "list of significant <i>figures</i> in history" is misogynistic.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. Neither the number of entries, not the size of the table of contents seems too long to me. I would suggest 2000 entries and 200 categories, respectively, as a criterion for "unmanageble". Then we could discuss some other method of acheiving the pedantic goal of finding counterexamples for stereotypes. Also, the number of "broad" puns in this poll seem at least sufficient already.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article does not asssert the subject's notability, and a look at the site and Alexa (rank 600,000+) makes it unlikely there is anything notable, it's just one more local commercial restaurant listing site. A good reason for deleting such articles has just been demonstrated by a new user. Apparently on seeing the article along with the "not many articles link here" template, the editor went to various articles and wrote the link in (see new editor's explanation<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:New_contributors%27_help_page&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76433630" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:New_contributors%27_help_page&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76433630" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: how is the fact that the subject comes up first in a Yahoo search relevant, apart from the fact that it shows that there are no other memorable things using this three word combination? And can you give us a reference to Creativity magazine which mentions Big Plastic Factory?

<li><b>Reply</b> You had stated your argument at the top. I stated mine, which says 'not exactly the most noteworthy', that means of minor notability but not void of any notability as 'not notable' would – Do not put words in my mouth. In fact I did express one reason why it is clearly noteworthy to a large group (its carillon) and that it is generally noteworthy for smaller groups. An encyclopedia is not a bestseller roman that needs to be interesting to many from the first page till the last, but has and must have a lot of articles about minor details for the few who are interested in some of these: where else would they find their information? Voting to oust articles based on notability alone is a popularity contest and undignified for an encyclopedia, especially one of larger size. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../s/e/p/Sep_20.html" title="Sep 20">20 Sep</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 05:14&#160;(UTC)</span></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Since when is a foreign language, especially Spanish, too obscure to serve as an illustration? At the very least, one can recognize his name as being the editor. I added a section 'References', having a translated interview that largely confirms the content of the article, published on a Marxist website. Being extensively interviewed at least proves that Petroni was <i>noticed</i> and thus <i>notable</i>, moreover since that website and the title of the interview also occur on another website (see my edit comment). Notability already followed from the man having been a "leader of the Argentinean Partido Socialista de los Trabajadores (PST) from 1973 to 1976 and its continuation, the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) from 1983-1988", stated in the article.

<p>Is a man who was one of 23 people executed in the state of Ohio in the last 7 years really that notable? In addition, there are sources given, but I don't think most of the content is in those sources. It is mostly unverifiable and reads like an original narrative of the proceedings. I don't know of the author's relation to this case, but if you look at the article talk page, the author says s/he witnessed the execution.

<dd>As the author of this article, I stand by the content. The Ohio Supreme Court case cited as a source <b>does</b> provide all of the facts of the trial as noted in the article. The AP article summarizes the appeals and last days of Fox. I will be happy to provide copies on request, or add attribution within the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding notoriety, I cannot vouch for Fox being notable except that there is a page of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_individuals_executed_in_Ohio_a228.html" title="List of individuals executed in Ohio">executions carried out by the State of Ohio</a> and there were links to uncreated pages for the executed men. If Fox is not notable, then the only notable person on the list is Alton Coleman, who was a spree killer. All other pages probably could be deleted under the issue posed by <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also suggest that someone then examine <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_executed_for_murder_c754.html" title="Category:People executed for murder">this page</a> to remove the non-notable persons there.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Regarding my comment about witnessing Mr. Fox's execution. I put that in very late at night, I regret doing so because it doesn't belong in Wikipedia, and I have removed it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. With a little more than 3,000 prisoners among the 2.2 million persons in the American prison system, the fact that Fox was even on death row make him notable. Considering fewer than 60 of these prisoners were executed enhances his notable status. (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2006). If being executed or being one of the few people who kill another person do not make someone notable under the Wikipedia guidelines, how many murders must a criminal commit, or how "heinous, atrocious or cruel" does such a crime have to be to justify inclusion? Furthermore, because Ohio has become quite active in carrying out executions, I think being one of the first in the modern era makes Fox notable. So what if he wasn't the first (or 3rd or 5th)? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarklemagne_1648.html" title="User:Marklemagne">Marklemagne</a> 12:38, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> the news sources are a weak indication for WP:BIO. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 22:20, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>I worked in the Wood Co. Prosecutor's Office at the time this matter was prosecuted. While it may not have been notable at the time of the original prosecution, it became so at the time of his execution as death penalty opponents made widespread use of this matter in the media as a prime example of what they assert is the arbritrary nature in the implementation of the death penalty. While not particularly sympathetic, his execution does seem to be for circumstances that are not as egregious as dozens or even hundreds of other murders for which a lesser sentence was imposed. For that reason, I believe this is notable and should be retained at this time. Source citations would perhaps cure some objections. And I can say from personal knowledge of the case that a few details are incorrect, so citations may cure these errors.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article was originally listed under the title 'Deindustrialization'. It ignores a large and important literature on this subject by historians and economists, and refers only to a small number of speculative theories as if they were accepted facts or analyses. It certainly cannot serve as an encyclopaedia entry on 'deindustrialization', any more than a wholly homoeopathic account would be an acceptable entry on oncology. It does consitute a (sub-standard) essay on unconventional theories on this subject, but I don't think merits an encyclopedia entry.--<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENmcmurdo_69fe.html" title="User:Nmcmurdo">Nmcmurdo</a> 22:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems that the two sections 'Deindustrialization in the US' and 'Other examples of deindustrialization' are mainstream economic coverage. The sections 'Deindustrial revolution' and 'Industrial decomposition' are offbeat, but potentially important, contributions. The intro is a mixture of both. Perhaps separate the two approaches onto 2 pages, or clarify on a single page that the first part is mainstream and the second part is emerging ideas.--ekotekk 12:20, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am the original author - my entry was very short, began with what was essentially a dictionary definition and then listed three or so examples of urban areas that experienced significant industrial decline. There were a few helpful additions in the first year and since then it seems to have gone off the rails.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Deindustrialization is a worthy subject for an encylopedia entry, but we basically need to get rid of this one and start again. What next? Do a straw poll? I'm not an expert on the process! --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENmcmurdo_69fe.html" title="User:Nmcmurdo">Nmcmurdo</a> 13:35, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think there is a process for this case.

<dd>What else can be done? I have updated the entry a bit to show the only things that come directly from the band. The other stuff, (musicbrainz is a massive discography of distributed popular music and a review featuring seemingly pretty accurate information about the band) is verified without the band and most likely with the band saying it is accurate by not telling these sites to edit the information. Let me know if there is anything else I can do.[User:WSeconds]17:08, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately there does not appear to be much else that can be done. The links you added to the article point to sites that appear to be open bulletin boards (<a href="../../../m/u/s/MusicBrainz_0ae4.html" title="MusicBrainz">MusicBrainz</a>) or personal webpages/blogs (the band's home page and WRANKmusic which uses MySpace for contact information) under Wikipedia'a policies and guidelines.

<li>In the 14 earlier nominations to delete articles about Guantanamo Bay detainees one of the recurring themes is for people to cite <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> -- as if it were an official policy. It isn't. It is described as a shorthand to test whether the article might violate <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I don't believe this article, or any of the other Guantanamo Bay articles violates those real policies.</li>
<li>I have started to expand the article.</li>
<li>Why is Al Juhani notable? <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> proscribes me from spelling this out in the article. But, it seems to me that Al Juhani didn't understand what was going on. He is not the only detainee who couldn't understand the difference between the Tribunal, and their regular interrogation sessions. He seems to not understand that this was his sole chance to explain why he should be released. He really blew it. Is this unique? No. A minor fraction of the detainees made the same mistake.</li>
<li>Is Al Juhani among the dozen most notable Guantanamo detainees? No. But those working on the wikipedia's coverage of the Guantanamo detainees, and the camp can't reach the conclusions for the readers. They have to be allowed to reach their own conclusions as to whether the process was fair, whether it was complete, whether the Tribunal's officers mandate allowed them the authority to access all the material they needed to reach a fair conclusion. In order for readers to do that, they need access to what actually happened at the Tribunals, even for detainees who may not have had copious numbers of newspaper articles written about them.</li>
<li>In addition, please bear in mind that whether each of these detainees was entitled to a Geneva Convention <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunal</a> is a matter of great controversy. If these detainees were American citizens no one would question, for one second, whether they merited articles on them. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 20:58, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is part of a set, however the article itself contains no information. Wikipedia is not a depository for US captives. Someone said they are easy to expand, but the expansion is not related to the subject of the article at all. The article is about the man and none of the article except the first sentence contains information about him. The rest is fluff, how many articles are there gonig to be that contain the same information no the tribunals? The tribunals are notable, the people involved are not. Perhaps merging these people into a list is best, as there currently is no content on these people to support seperate articles. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 11:45, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>You assert that <i>"...the article itself contains no information."</i> This is incorrect. The link, to the article, is unique. The DoD released 6,000 pages of transcripts, in response to a court order, forcing them to identify the detainees, after they had exhausted all their avenues of legal appeal. But they didn't fully comply with the court order, at first, because those transcripts didn't have the detainees names, only their detainee ID numbers. Seven weeks later they released a list of names, and detainee ID numbers, making it possible to match the transcripts with the detainee, by name. But doing so required visually scanning through all 6,000 pages. I did the work of correlating all the transcripts with the detainees by matching them by their detainee ID number. It took about 20 hours.</li>
<li><b>There is no other public place on the internet an interested reader can use to find a detainee's transcript without spending hours visually scanning through all 6,000 pages of transcripts.</b> Those transcripts are not machine readable. Scanning through them takes hours.</li>
<li>So, sorry, your assertion that <i>"...the article itself contains no information."</i> -- is incorrect. The link itself is an unique, valuable resource, since it potentially saves readers hours of useless work.</li>
<li>As for the material that briefly summarizes the purpose of the Tribunals. Yes, those same paragraphs occur in other articles about Guantanamo detainees. And, if you were to look at the articles about the chemical elements, or the members of the US congress, you would find that they repeated material that was in articles about the other chemical elements or the other members of the US congress. So far as I am concerned this is not a meaningful criticism. When I started writing these articles I didn't put in the introductory paragraphs about the Tribunals, and, from the reactions I got, some readers really needed to have the context laid out for them in the article itself. Those paragraphs are brief. I believe they are accurate and written from an NPOV. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 20:58, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Where did you get the idea that the DoD released all 6,000 pages of documents in one PDF file? They released the documents in 75 PDF files, which varied in length from 16 pages long to well over 350 pages long. What do you mean when you refer to "easy to find testimony"? Are you stating that the unique links I spent 20 hours crafting are redundant, because the testimony is "easy to find"? Or, are you arguing that we shouldn't be helping readers find that testimony?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Why is it hundreds of megs if none of these articles actually have individual content. The same PDF can be linked for people to reference each persons testimony, testimony which apparently ammounts to, "I will not answer your questions." All of the names can be put into a single article with an explanation of what the tribunal is and a link to the testimony, why are we creating individual articles for each name, splashing in the same tribunal information into each of the 50+ then a smalle xcerpt of their testimony which ammounts to "no I didnt do it" "No I will not answer your questions", this is honestly bordering on fluff since the testimony isnt saying anything more then, "not guilty" but doing it in 3 paragraphs instead of a sentence.

<li>Regarding your characterization of the detainee's testimony as nothing more than "not guilty":
<ul>
<li>How many articles did you read?</li>
<li>Are you aware that the Bush administration routinely describes these guys as the "worst of the worst"? Only last summer the camp commandant Admiral Harris, said "there are no innocent men at Guantanamo". At that time <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murat_Kurnaz_6d93.html" title="Murat Kurnaz">Murat Kurnaz</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Kamel_Al_Kandari_1cf7.html" title="Abdullah Kamel Al Kandari">Abdullah Kamel Al Kandari</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasrat_Khan_c62f.html" title="Nasrat Khan">Nasrat Khan</a> were half way through their fifth year of extrajudicial detention. When examined, in detail, each of their cases exposes highly alarming hints of dreadful miscarriages of justice.
<ul>
<li>Murat Kurnaz was accused of being friends with the Elalamumble suicide bomber. Except this suicide bomber was alive, and well, and still living in Germany. And both Kurnaz and his friend were thoroughly investigated by German counter-terrorism officials, who cleared them both.</li>
<li>Al Kandari was one of the two dozen detainees who was being held, in part, because he was captured wearing a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casio_F91W_87a3.html" title="Casio F91W">Casio F91W</a>, a cheap digital watch, that has been used for the timer portion of time-bombs. Except, if you do a google image search, you can quickly determine, from the description in his transcript, that he was wearing the much more expensive Casio Prayer Watch.</li>
<li>Nasrat Khan acknowledged that he had joined with other patriots to throw foreign invaders out of his country -- except those foreign invaders were the Soviets. Khan had fought against the Soviets when the mujahideen were receiving training, funding, weapons from the USA through the CIA. This was when the CIA, in order to put a spoke through the wheel of the Soviets, encouraged fundamentalist Islamic militants from other countries to go to Afghanistan, to fight foreign invaders. Khan, a very old man, had sufferd a debilitating stroke before the Taliban ever took over Afghanistan, which would have prevented him engaging in any hostilities, without regard to his political preference. But he was one of the many guys in Guantanamo who said they welcomed the US intervention to remove the Taliban. His son was one of the half dozen or so detainees who were picked up because they were guarding armories who acknowledged guarding armories, but on an official, salaried basis, under the rubric of the Afghan Ministry of Defense. He and his son requested <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahim_Wardak_eca7.html" title="Rahim Wardak">Rahim Wardak</a>'s testimony to clear them of this charge. Their Tribunal documents describe Wardak as a "Defense Ministry official" -- and said that he couldn't be located. Wardak was then, in fact, the <b>Deputy Minister of Defense</b>. He is currently the Minister of Defense. Maybe his testimony wouldn't have cleared Khan and his son, but the DoD didn't make more than a token effort to try to apply any sanity tests to the allegations against these men. This is not only morally reprehensible, keeping innocent men imprisoned at Guantanamo, but it makes us all less safe. The Guantanamo detainment camps cost $100 million per year. The Guantanamo detainment camps ties down two whole battalions of camp guards. These resources could be much better spent elsewhere. Wasting them there makes us all less safe.</li>
<li>Or consider the case of <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Khan_e212.html" title="Abdullah Khan">Abdullah Khan</a> -- captured in the winter of 2003, he spent his first year and a half at Guantanamo denying his interrogator's accusations that he was really <a href="../../../k/h/i/Khirullah_Khairkhwa_953c.html" title="Khirullah Khairkhwa">Khirullah Khairkhwa</a>, the guy who read the Taliban's press releases, and briefly the GOvernor of Herat. When Khan was captured it was based on a denunciation that he was really Khairkhwa. Unbelievably no American intelligence official made the effort to test the truth of the denunciation. The real Khirullah Khairkhwa had been captured over a year earlier, and was undergoing his own interrogations in Guantanamo. Khan quickly learned this, when he arrived. He kept telling his interrogators this, and they couldn't be bothered to take a look at the camp roster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having read about half their transcripts for myself I know that the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denbeaux_study.html" title="Denbeaux study">Denbeaux study</a>'s conclusions are entirely accurate. A very significant fraction of the detainees are very likely innocent men. The public needs to be able to read the allegations against the detainees for themselves.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You arent even arguing these people are notable, just that you did alot of work and want it to stay, that its hard to match a number to a testimony, none of these are grounds for keeping 50+ articles that have 0 content in them. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 21:44, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For the record, I am arguing that they are all notable. The Geneva Conventions require a captor, like the USA, to use a "competent tribunal" to distinguish between its captives, and determine whether:
<ul>
<li><b>The captive is an innocent civilian</b>, caught up in a case of mistaken identity, or forcibly evacuated from a fire zone, or reasonable equivalent. The Geneva Convention says that civilian evacues can be sent, temporarily, to refugee camps, but that they should be returned home, as soon as it is safe for them to do so.</li>
<li><b>The captive is a combatant, but a lawful one, who has not violated any of the laws or customs of war.</b> Lawful combatants can be detained, until hostilities cease. But they are supposed to enjoy certain protections and privileges -- ie. POW status. A captive who is a lawful combatant, who has POW status, can't be charged with murder. Killing an enemy, when following all the laws and conventions of war, is not murder. And, if I understand the GC correctly, even killing a comrade, or an innocent civilian, is not murder, if the combatant followed lawful rules of engagement, and the death was a tragic accident.</li>
<li><b>The captive is a combatant, but they violated the laws or customs of war.</b> Once the "competent tribunal" makes this determination the captive can be stripped of many of the protections of POW status. They can be tried. They can be tried for murder, if they killed an enemy soldier.</li>
<li>I believe the Geneva Conventions are quite clear. The captor is obliged to treat all captives as if they were entitled to POW status, until a competent tribunal meets, and makes the determination that the captive is not entitled to POW status.</li>
<li>The George H.W. Bush administration convened something like 1300 competent tribunals during and shortly after the first Gulf War. Those competent tribunals determined that more than 70% of those captives were innocent civilians. Those competent tribunals determined that all the remaining captives were entitled to POW status. The DoD has army regulations on how to conduct competent tribunals so that they comply with the USA's Geneva Convention obligations. AR190-8, IIRC. The Bush administration has yet to comply with its Geneva Convention obligations, and convene a single competent tribunal on any of the captives taken in Afghanistan. No, the Combatant Status Review Tribunals don't count -- for the reasons you characterized as "fluff". The Combatant Status Review Tribunals did not have the authority to determine whether captives qualified for POW status -- only whether they met the Bush administration's definition of an "enemy combatant".</li>
<li>IMO, if we believe in the rule of law, if we respect the rule of law, we comply with our Geneva Convention obligations, and allow all our captives to have the protections of the Geneva Convention POW status, until that competent tribunal determines they don't merit those protections. We extend those protections even to the captives that we suspect are "the worst of the worst". Captives whose detentions violate the Geneva Conventions, for whom we have information from authoritative, verifiable sources, merit articles.</li>
<li>Some of the articles on Guantanamo detainees have not been expanded beyond the stub status that gives the surface appearance that they are identical to some readers. There are approximately 400 articles on individual Guantanamo detainees. Approximately one hundred of these articles were based on reports from human rights groups, the captive's families, press reports, habeas corpus requests. When the DoD released the transcripts, I started going through them, and expanding the original 100 or so articles, and creating new articles, based on the transcripts. When I had spent the time necessary to enable myself to match the detainee's name to their transcript, and after I had created a couple of dozen new articles, I realized that the task was quite repetitive, and could be automated. At first, I kept all the stubs on my computer, and only added fleshed-out articles. But then I realized that it could be interpreted that I was hoarding the connection between the names and transcripts, making it almost impossible for other authors to write articles about those detainees. So I uploaded all the stubs. I am plowing through them, as fast as I can. Following the previous nomination to delete a detainee's article I went through all the articles, to measure my progress. At that time something like 145 articles hadn't been expanded beyond stub status. The week when I was responding to that nomination was a washout. As has been this week. Including <b>Muhamad Naji Subhi Al Juhani</b> I swatted 15 articles, leaving about 130. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 09:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the link is now working and the article is expanded.

I think I said that they were hard to transliterate, and I think you will find that the wikipedia article backs up that assertion.</dd>
<dd>As for your concern that the two names may refer to two different individuals. This is a straw argument. No one is disputing this. As I pointed out on the article's talk page readers deserve to know the facts, and they can make up their own mind as to whether the two are the same individual.</dd>

<dd>The two names are very similar. The likelihood of them referring to the same individual is high -- FWIW. But, let me repeat. I never stated that the two names refer to the same individual. I invited discussion as to whether the referred to the same individual -- with the {mergeto} tag. And, forgive me being so blunt, but you shouldn't keep removing that invitation to a discussion, based on your personal interpretation. You should state your opinion, on the talk page, and let other readers offer their opinion. If you refer to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you will see a subsection entitled: "<b>Wikipedia is not a battlefield.</b>" -- Removing the invitation to the discussion, is confrontational. It is consensus destroying, not consensus building.</dd>
<dd>As I stated on the article's talk page, without regard to whether the two similar names refer to the same individual, both names should be mentioned in this article, for the benefit of readers who assume they are the same. With both names mentioned the reader gets to make up their own mind. I know I am repeating myself, but you haven't addressed this point in your earlier comments, and I think it is a very important one.</dd>

<dd>When the Saudi official used the name <b>Muhammad Al Juhani</b> that was inherently confusing, if our two names do refer to two separate individuals. Both men would be alleged terrorists. Both men could be referred to as Muhammad Al Juhani. If, on the other hand, the two names referred to a single individual, then referring to him as Muhammad Al Juhani would be perfectly acceptable. So, would the Saudi government know the identity of all the Saudi Guantanamo detainees? Well, variouse Saudi detainees told their Tribunals that a delegation of Saudi officials visited them at Guantanamo, so I think the answer to that question is a clear yes. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 09:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because you were confused doesnt mean the Saudi's were. Its like me seeing a report on Mike Tyson and being confused because the kid down the block has the same name, so I goto the Mike Tyson article and write information about the kid down the block to that article, dont say they are related as you did not, just slap a block of text in the middle of Mike Tyson (boxer)'s article about the kid down the block from me. can youprove someone was confused with a source?

<ul>
<li>Regarding your Mike Tyson analogy... You and I don't know how common Muhammad Al Juhani is in Saudi Arabia. I have no problem assuming that Muhammad Al Juhani is at least as common as Mike Tyson. But, all the males born in Saudi Arabia is not the namespace we are talking about. The namespace we are talking about are Saudis who are wanted by, or in the custody of, the USA, because they are suspected of being terrorists. That is only a couple of hundred individuals. Please, let's compare apples with apples, and oranges with oranges. Agreed? Now, if the guy down the street, was not only named Mike Tyson, but was a world famous boxer, that would be a fair comparison.</li>
<li>I didn't say the Saudi official was confused. I said that if the two transliterations refered to two individuals, then the Saudi official confused the issue for their listeners. I thought I already explained this. When the Saudi official spoke about the suspected terrorist Muhammad Al Juhani they would have then introduced confusion as to which suspected terrorist named Muhammad Al Juhani they meant. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 16:57, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I, on the other hand, would like to see this discussion closed, on schedule. NuclearUmpf has been mischaracterizing what I have written. Since I am going to AGF, I should start with the assumption that this is either due to inattention on his part, or lack of clarity on my part. IMO, in either case, NuclearUmpf should have made a greater effort to understand what I have written. I am doing my best to understand his concerns. I'd like him to reciprocate that effort. Civil, tactful questions would have prevented the mischaracterizations. Perhaps someone else can spell out to NuclearUmpf how mischaracterizing what someone has written gives the unfortunate appearance of bad faith, even when those comments were made in good faith, but with a lack of attention to what the other contributor actually said, or actually meant. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 09:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I dont appreciate your comments, you have stated yourself that you have added information to this article about people unrelated to the article person in any fashion. People that you have not connected via a source and admittedly have no source linking them in any way. You have added information to this article that violated <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> to extend its size purposely without providing any link other then your understanding that arab names are hard to illiterate, so apparently anyone wioth Muhammed (a common arab name) and Juhani are actually being mistaken for the same person.

<li>NuclearUmpf, in several of my responses I stated my concern that you weren't reading my comments. In this comment above, you repeat your assertion: <i>"noone is even arguing these people are notable"</i>. Well, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Muhamad_Naji_Subhi_Al_Juhani&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78271995" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Muhamad_Naji_Subhi_Al_Juhani&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78271995" rel="nofollow">this comment,</a> predating your comment, I started the major portion of my reply with: <i>"For the record, I am arguing that they are all notable."</i> Surely you can agree this gives the appearance you aren't reading other people's comments? I followed this statement with a detailed explanation. In your comment on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> you told the administrators that I was simply reverting your changes -- neglecting to mention that I have diligently explained my actions. Would you please pause, and consider, whether telling your audience that I simply reverted your changes, without saying I make honest, civil attempts to explain myself, is a fair characterization? Please put yourself in my shoes. I am doing my best to understand your concerns. Can you really say you are trying to understand my replies? If so how come my repeated explanations that you are mischaracterizing me go ignored?</li>
<li>You keep repeating that I have acknowledged that the two transliterations represent two different individuals. And I keep telling you that you are mischaracterizing my statements. I don't think you understand that there is a difference between not asserting, in the article, that the two transliterations name a single individual, and acknowledging that the two transliterations name two different individuals. I did the former. You keep insisting on asserting on the latter, on <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">User:Kappa</a>, and on [[WP:AN/I. I am not going to assert, in the article, that the two transliteration name a single individual. That is, at present, unverifiable. Asserting this, in the article would violate NPOV. So, I didn't do it. Please stop mischaracterizing my restraint, to comply with NPOV, as an acknowledgement that the two individuals are unrelated.</li>
<li>Regarding your comment that it is absurd to conflate individuals based solely on their name... There are on the order of one hundred Guantanamo detainees, whose continued detention is justified, in part, because their name, or one of their "known aliases", was found on a list that American intelligence analysts found suspicious. What kind of lists? Well, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had a list of 324 Arabic names on his laptop. A handful of those hundred had their name, or alias, matching one of those 324 names. But some of the other name matches are far less credible. FYI, one of the justifications for continuing to detain <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faruq_Ali_Ahmed_3d86.html" title="Faruq Ali Ahmed">Faruq Ali Ahmed</a> was, <a href="http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2006/0203nj1.htm" class="external text" title="http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2006/0203nj1.htm" rel="nofollow">according to the National Journal:</a> <i>"The board told Farouq that a new piece of evidence had turned up against him, he later told his lawyers. Somebody had said, at some point in the past four years, that they had heard the name "Farouq" over a walkie-talkie during the battle of Tora Bora."</i> Another list was simply a website that listed the known Guantanamo detainees, with the avowed attempt to put pressure on their governments to lobby for their release. If you think it is absurd, have you considered writing President Bush, and telling him so?</li>
<li>Regarding your assertion that I am violating <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, could you please explain why the Department of Defense and the FBI should not be considered verifiable, reliable sources?</li>
<li>Regarding your assertion that I am violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> -- it seems to me that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> does not preclude me noticing the occurrence of two similar names. I don't think it precludes me from finding that article from the Saudi embassy's web-site. I am going to repeat myself. The namespace we are concerned with here is small. It is not the namespace of all Saudi males. It is the namespace of all the Saudis that the USA regards as threats to its National Security. And this is a small namespace. Namespace collision in such a small namespace is noteworthy. I don't think I have to prove this.</li>
<li>Do you wish to explain which of my comments you don't appreciate? If it is the comment that you keep mischaracterizing me, I'm sorry, but I think that is undeniable. I didn't close my mind to the possibility that I what I wrote wasn't clear. But, since I am doing my best to understand your concerns, I would continue to appreciate you to try to understand my concerns. Your final question implies something that is not verifiable -- that the two transliterations refer to two different individuals. Forgive me, but I am going to suggest that this is not a good starting point for the questions you are going to ask that show you are making an effort to understand my points. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 16:57, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do I think every victim or survivor of the WTC attack merits an article? Sure, why not, if there is meaningful content, verifiable from an authoritative source? For what it is worth I started two articles about WTC survivors, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Clark&amp;diff=8618876&amp;oldid=8031704" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Clark&amp;diff=8618876&amp;oldid=8031704" rel="nofollow">Brian Clark</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stanley_Praimnath&amp;diff=8618910&amp;oldid=8036468" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stanley_Praimnath&amp;diff=8618910&amp;oldid=8036468" rel="nofollow">Stanley Prainmath</a>. Regarding the prisoners at Abu Ghraib -- well, I read much of the <a href="../../../f/a/y/Fay_Report_77c6.html" title="Fay Report">Fay Report</a>. The <a href="../../../t/a/g/Taguba_Report_a613.html" title="Taguba Report">Taguba Report</a> estimated that more than 60% of the Abu Ghraib prisoners had been rounded up in error. The Fay Report went into more detail. The US practice was to cordon off an area and arrest ALL the military age males. Can I imagine circumstances where this approach would make sense, be acceptable? Yes. Provided the technique was put to use under very limited circumstances, and there was a prompt mechanism to release those who were innocent, and they were treated with dignity and respect until that determination was made. What the Fay Report documented was that over 90% of those rounded up were determined to have been rounded up in error. And, the reason they weren't released is that a high-level committee of busy senior officers, who didn't get along with one another, had to meet to agree on the releases. General Karpinski, the senior Military Police officer was on it, and General Barbara Fast, the senior intelligence officer in Iraq, and Colonel Warren, the senior JAG officer. They were busy, and they didn't get along, so the meetings that would have approved the release of the prisoners kept getting postponed, for months. That is the reason the prison population swelled. That is why Abu Ghraib, and, presumably, the other prisons, continued to be full of men whose innocence had been determined months earlier. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 16:57, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

Noone is debating that another person with a much shorter and not very similar name exists, you just havent given a single source saying they are the same person. That is why you fail WP:RS not because you dont have a reliable source saying they exist, its because you dont have a reliable source saying they are the same. I know ... you arent saying they are ... then good there is no problem with me removing it. You have a problem with this then as I said call an admin. I have tried in good faith numerous times to explain this and you seem to be not reading policy or just flat out misrepresenting it. If you really think WP:RS and WP:V just has to go toward existence and not the actual thing you are attempting to state (a link) then you need to read the policy again. Its like me putting a large section on cocaine into the Mike Tyson article then showing a ATF report saying Cocaine exists and then showing a boxing magazine saying Mike Tyson exists and reporting that I am not saying he does it, just that they both exist according to WP:RS and I think it should be in the article. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 12:23, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Despite what someone posted in discussion, this article is NOT research (for a class or otherwise). It is the account of an event and does not propose an idea, theory or argument and therefore does not fall into the category of original research. The only basis for deletion seems to be a matter of impact. This event has had a lasting impact at the school where it happened and was experienced by a large percentage of a university population of nearly 39,000 students plus staff. You need only ask any student on campus or look at the tshirts being worn to see it's impact. There are many other Wikipedia articles far more worthy of deletion (and volunteer time) than Ladies Bible Study. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUserDeleted092906_72b6.html" title="User:UserDeleted092906">UserDeleted092906</a></li>

<dd>I think you need to read the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> page closer. In the discussion page, I quoted part of it, but it apears that you have not read it. I'll quote the second sentence of the WP:OR page: "<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Citing sources</a> and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> which provide information that is <b>directly related</b> to the topic of the article and to adhere to what those sources say."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now take the very first sentence of the ladies bible study page: " "Ladies Bible Study- tonight!" was a 'mail storm' that was created on September 11, 2006 and has still not abated. ". This sentence is all original research because there are *zero* sources that are considered reliable for the purposes of the wikipedia that I can independently confirm that this event started on Sept 11. There is no way I can verify that, over a week later, this mail storm has yet to abate. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 19:11, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did read your post in the discussion, but I believe it is you that needs to read the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> page more closely. Specifically, get past the intro and read the section called "What is excluded?". It clearly states:</dd>
<dd>--</dd>
<dd>"An edit counts as original research if it proposes ideas or arguments. That is, if it does any of the following:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>* It introduces a theory or method of solution;</dd>
<dd>* It introduces original ideas;</dd>
<dd>* It defines new terms;</dd>
<dd>* It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms;</dd>
<dd>* It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;</dd>
<dd>* It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;</dd>
<dd>* It introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source."</dd>
<dd>--</dd>
<dd>This clearly shows how the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> rule does not apply to Ladies Bible Study since it is not introducing a theory, idea, argument, etc. It is not research; much less original research. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUserDeleted092906_72b6.html" title="User:UserDeleted092906">UserDeleted092906</a></dd>

<dd>*sigh* Please read what you quoted and what I wrote. In particular, pay attention to the places that talk about "reputable sources". Again, not only are there zero reputable sources cited in the article, but from what I can tell, there aren't any in existance. Even if there were one or two, that would still fail the search engine test. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 02:54, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're missing the point. You can't just take the words "reputable source" out of context. The point of the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> rule is to keep people from publishing their own theories or arguments on Wikipedia. That theme is common among all the bullets that are in the "What is excluded?" section. You can't just research a topic, make your own theory and then tell the world using Wikipedia, effectively bypassing the standard practice of having your discoveries scrutinized through peer review. Read the "Why original research is excluded" and "Policy origin: the opinion of Wikipedia's founder" sections of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Sure, you'll find more requirements of "reputable sources", but you can't just take that out of context. Ladies Bible Study doesn't qualify as a theory; it's an event. In general, I understand what you're trying to argue, but it just doesn't apply in this case. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUserDeleted092906_72b6.html" title="User:UserDeleted092906">UserDeleted092906</a></dd>

It isn't just theories or arguments. It includes the first publication of any sort of data or statements. You say to read the "why original research is excluded", but it says right there that "That is, any facts, opinions, interpretations, definitions, and arguments published by Wikipedia must already have been published by a reliable publication in relation to the topic of the article." The facts and interpretations in this article have not been published elsewhere. You say to read "policy origin" section, and it says "Some who completely understand why Wikipedia ought not create novel theories of physics by citing the results of experiments and so on and synthesizing them into something new, may fail to see how the same thing applies to history." This is an historicial event, and you have failed to see why no-original-research applies. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 14:06, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think it's clear that they are discussing analysis/interpretations of historical events that have the possibility of inciting debate.

This is about a single school -- and if this persists, what's to keep articles from being created about flamewars and mailstorms at every school/organization on the end of this earth? -- and the argument of subculture would mean terms used at any school would be fair game, i.e. "night shifted" (for sleeping during the day and working through the night) for MIT, "that's how I roll" (slang for that's how I go about my life) for any school, and <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bag.html" title="Bag">bag</a> used in very derogatory senses.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't believe using the 'its only happening at this school' reason is sufficient for deletion of the article. Many similar events happen around the world and they are not just lumped together. To reference them separately is a critical component of being able to discern the different ways people, groups or 'subcultures' react to similar situations. The fact that UofM has had this reaction with vicious emails, a weak response from the IT department, and Tshirts being made exposes different facets of the life there that make it unique. I personally did not know about the 'night shifting' at MIT, for example. But if I were a prospective student, I would have like to have known about that from a source i could trust. As Wikipedia expands and more people are coming to use it as a source of information, the trust will follow simply because it literally does have everything. Another issue: Wikipedia is used by many people to gain details of the facts whatever they may be as long as they are verifiable. Now the question of verifiability may be in dispute in a case where things are happening at the same time they are placed onto the Wikipedia. However, the only way to have one hundred percent verifiability is for every human being on earth to conclusively believe an even occurred...this never happens. Reasonable verifiability depends on the general public's trust of several independent sources. 'Reputable' is up to debate, i agree. However, if we want to wait on this to publish the information, the Wikipedia has no business publishing news information on current events such as the Thai Coup. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyB_f327.html" title="User:SandyB">SandyB</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> -- This is a description of an insignificant event with an attempt to fit it in under the context of encyclopedic recordkeeping. The only topic under which this could justifyably fall under is "e-mail storm", where this event would be given no more than one or two lines as a reference that this happened at the University of Michigan. However, because of its insignificance (i.e. no press coverage at all), even such mention would not be proper. Although some of the quotes and graphics are amusing, there are more appropriate locations on the web to post those than wikipedia. -- Hero27 00:20, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have to say that I found it interesting but, sadly, it has to go as unencyclopaedic. There is, though, scope for a generic Mail storm article. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:55, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I believe the concept of wikipedia which makes it more popular and useful than a traditional encyclopedia such as the Encyclopedia Brittanica is that 1. It is not under the natural constraint of printed paper books that take up space which limit the amount of data that go into it and 2. It allows for users to input the information that they believe is worth documenting within the limits of verifiability. Relevance should be a minor concern...it is not a good idea in the long run to decide whether a subject matter is 'relevant' or not. In the old days, Encyclopedia writers from Diderot onwards would be challenged by the issue of relevance as the physical limits of the size of the encylopedia had to be considered. Today, if the Wikipedia administrators are concerned about the size of the project becoming too large, then by all means this article should be deleted. Other articles worth deleting are:</li>

<dd>These articles include: a year when nothing happened, a bronze medalist in the olympics, a 31 year old playwright who has written one obscure play, a gun being described as slightly different from the model design 2 years prior, a building that was torn down long ago, a hungarian porn star, and an episode of a cartoon show. I got this list by hitting the random page about 30 times. The list of deleted articles could conceivably form another wiki, one could reasonably argue that each of these should be tagged for deletion. The point here, however, is that these should not be deleted because they help to conceive a unified database that people can come to as reference point of our culture, both past, present and future, that should not be cut down by our 'traditional' ideas of what an encyclopedia should be. To rephrase: Wikipedia is not simply an encyclopedia, it is a new medium of information conveyence that people have yet to fully comprehend. It can have tremendous influence in the future as it becomes more detailed and refined, in shaping the way our society learns but only if we let the authors have some leeway to decide what they think is a relevant article. Sure this episode is about an incident at one school that lasted only for a month or so and then kinda died away. A century from now, historians combing through the wikipedia may stumble on the 'email storm' article and find it about as drab as i found the Brittanica entry on Hong Kong I had to go through for a report in the eighth grade. How different would their perspective be by reading this article...a living example written by the people who went through it. Equally importantly, how discouraged would this group of University students taking time to document the incident be? A slap in the face now may keep them from ever contributing in the future. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyB_f327.html" title="User:SandyB">SandyB</a></dd>

<dd>The question of whether other articles are notable or not does not mean that this one is. The other key difference between this article and the ones you list is that they are all based on independent sources, or at least that published sources can be found. (This doesn't mean that the sources are necessarily correct, just that someone else has written something about it in a reasonably permanent medium.) Wikipedia is not (just) "a unified... reference point of our culture", it's an encyclopedia which includes *facts* about culture. And there needs to be some way to verify those facts -- even about seemingly trivial subjects such as Hungarian porn stars and a run-of-the-mill year in country music.</dd>
<dd>Am I suggesting that this didn't happen? No; I was on one of the lists myself, so I got to experience it in all its glory. Am I suggesting that the interpretation is wrong? Not necessarily. I'm suggesting that, *since* no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> have been found, and *since* the conclusions therefore constitute <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, it does not belong on Wikipedia. If you want to show that it's good, useful information, then find reliable sources for it. If you think this is such a vivid narrative of exactly what it's like to survive an "email storm" that it must be preserved (here instead of some other site), then perhaps you could go on and merge it into email storm or some such.</dd>
<dd>On the feelings of "the authors" -- one of the things that makes Wikipedia special is that we're *all* "the authors"; it's not just the original writer of the first draft of the article who gets to decide its "final" form. Do the authors (even the brand-new-to-Wikipedia ones) have the freedom to decide what we think is a relevant article? Sure! that's what this process is all about&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/a/e/User%7EJaeger5432_a1a4.html" title="User:Jaeger5432">Jaeger5432</a> 04:49, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Research" here refers to "material placed in articles by Wikipedia users that has not been previously published by a reliable source". The whole section "A Socio-scientific classification" is "conclusions", as is the (POV) statement that the IT department was "the real culprit". Take those out and what's left? a story about something interesting that happened at school one day. Hey, we had a fire drill this morning, maybe I should put an article on Wikipedia about that! It certainly affected hundreds of students and I could probably come up with some sort of "socio-scientific classification" of how people reacted.

<dd>I do, however, agree with you on the issue of those statements about the IT department being the "real culprit". I apologize for not have seen that earlier... it shouldn't be there.

I'm with Jaeger here... although I don't believe this could ever be actually encyclopedia unless something newsworthy happened as a result - like dozens of people throwing their computers out of their rooms in protest, like one of the serial spammers getting assaulted for their participation (hopefully not!). And then, it would belong in Wikinews... and MAYBE Wikipedia. Oh.

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> per the following:
<ul>
<li>The Fempiror Chronicles is actually not a Monster Zero show, but a collection of stories that predates Monster Zero's existence on Wikipedia and has already established its own notability. This collection is also not exclusive to Monster Zero, but is actually listed in multiple places across the Internet, and has been widely read. It should not be lumped into the mix with Monster Zero just because it was listed in Monster Zero's article. Monster Zero is simply another site from which it can be read. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubkas_796a.html" title="User:Tubkas">Tubkas</a> 13:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Monster Zero is actually quite a project that has been on the 'net for about 2 and a half years, and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_series.html" title="Virtual series">Virtual series</a> are quickly becoming a staple of the Internet. The series in Monster Zero (original as well as spin-off) do not use clips from existing shows, but are scripts that are entirely the original work of the authors who write them, even though the spin-offs use existing universes for their frameworks. Budding writers can "pitch" ideas to the heads of this network and work on developing them in a professional-like environment. In the world of virtual series, MZP is one of the most notable. I believe Monster Zero can definitely stand on its own as an article and the individual shows judged on their own merits and notability. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubkas_796a.html" title="User:Tubkas">Tubkas</a> 13:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Commment</b> - this discussion is not about whether the sites and items exist - it is clear that they do; however, the discussion is whether they are notable enough to be included in an encyclopedic reference. They have had no mainstream media coverage that I can find. A Google search on "Monster Zero Productions" only returns 107 unique returns. "The Fempiror Chronicles" brings up only 49 unique, and most of those are copied from Wikipedia. Homeostasis +"virtual series" brings up only 27 unique, same conditions. These entries are clearly not notable, IMHO, and apparently that of the nominator. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 14:15, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Commment</b> - What? So only things that have mainstream media attention can be on Wikipedia? Well cripes, better get deleting then because there's sure as sh*t a load of articles that breach this. What a ridiculous thing to say. There is an article on Wikipedia for Virtual Series, Virtual Seasons, fan fiction -- so by association, why not articles on the most noteable websites for these? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 85.210.160.63 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_85.210.160.63_36d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/85.210.160.63">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I will admit that these things are better known in smaller circles, but some statiscal info about Monster Zero's site that is readily displayed on the main page shows it has (when I just looked) 50,872 posts and 733 members. The Fempiror Chronicles shows a total number of hits across the three boards it is listed on of 5242, and that does not include hits the site itself might have received since that information is not readily available. Granted, since these are all message boards, not all of those hits are reads, but likely at least half if not more are clicks that resulted in a read of at least one of the stories. Not sure how notable that makes them, though. They both have pretty high numbers, so it's not like we're dealing with something that no one has ever seen before. I know when I consider a VS hub, MZP is what comes to mind, though. I can't help but wonder how much research the nominator did, since he refers to the series as using "clips of real shows" which they do not. His wording almost reads a bit vindictive. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubkas_796a.html" title="User:Tubkas">Tubkas</a> 15:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm really failing to see the logic in this proposed deletion. A previous poster, who is in favor of deletion, questions the notability of MZP, Fempiror, and whether or not they warrant an encyclopedic reference. I say yes, especially in regards to a virtual series, which if searched on wiki will reference not only the series proposed for deletion, but Buffy, Angel, Banana Chan, and Galaxy Task Force Astroranger. In my opinion, all of these series are more than worthy of a listing based on their following, which is there despite the lack of media coverage that you so desperately require. Does media coverage really constitute what is an acceptable entertainment medium? Absolutely not. This is the internet we're talking about, and virtual entertainment in one form or another is what it's all about. There are literally millions of websites out there that have a built in fanbase and regular daily visitors without any media coverage. Perfect examples would be Maddox and Tucker Max. Both have huge internet followings, but are they regularly covered by the media, if at all? Not that I've seen, yet their pages are on wiki for all to see, and justifiably so based on their internet followings. I say let it ride, but if for some reason the articles do end up being deleted, you might as well hit up the fantasy football, baseball, etc. entries as well, because let's be honest, those are nothing more than virtual reality themselves. --Mike Shelton 16:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Also, approximately 125 full-length television scripts have been written for, posted on and read at Monster Zero Productions, which is a rather large number and continues to grow every week the site is running. -- <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldenCaele_f358.html" title="User:AldenCaele">AldenCaele</a> 06:33, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - In this age of the internet, in which Wikipedia is often a virtual reality unto itself, novel uses of this medium will continually come to light. The so-called “virtual series” is one such phenomenon that will undoubtedly continue to grow, and it is somewhat ignorant to claim that a lack of mainstream media coverage is the sole criteria for inclusion into a vast information repository that prides itself on up-to-the-minute relevance. The virtual series not only deserves a Wikipedia definition, such as it is, but also examples of this novel form of storytelling, if only in the interests of completeness. The Fempiror Chronicles – one such series nominated for the axe – is as compelling and textured as any fiction that I have encountered on the internet. Not only is the series entertaining, but it is also instructive in terms of the providing a sterling example of the proper industry format for screenplays or teleplays, which also has value in and of itself. I, too, suspect this nominator has some kind of axe to grind, and question his motives at nominating something so clearly relevant to this age of virtual technology and entertainment. -- Robert Newcomer.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I also just noticed the comment "a website where people can post homemade TV shows made from clips of real shows" and feel the need to make a comment on this - it is ignorant and wrong. A virtual TV show is not a collection of clips from real shows, not at all, and by reading the virtual series/seasons articles on Wiki he would know this. Virtual TV is real scripts, in real script format, trying it's very best to be as entertaining as the real thing -- the quality is extremely high. This is a medium that is growing every day, and deserves to be represented.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 85.210.160.63 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_85.210.160.63_36d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/85.210.160.63">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - As the guy who started MZP and has been running it quite merrily for the last two years, I feel I should also contest this propsed deletion on the grounds that the person voting for it in the first place clearly has zero understanding of what the site is all about. We're an online resource for scriptwriters to showcase their work, chat with other writers and fans and generally look to make themselves better writers and get our work out there into the wider world. The implication that we, and I quote, "post homemade TV shows made from clips of real shows" is pretty inaccurate - a large percentage of the work on MZP is 100% original, written work in professional script format. I'd say that the 165,000 hits our website has already registered is an indicator of our relative popularity! -- Captain MZ</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - A search on google for "virtual series" gets 34,900 hits, a search for "virtual season" gets 45,600. This is obviously a popular field of interest and will continue to grow.
<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b> - "virtual series" gets only 544 unique returns, which is the more important number. "virtual season" only brings back 622 unique. Very few those are MonsterZero releated, though - the concept *may* be popular, but that's not the focus of this discussion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 05:27, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Monster Zero Productions is quite possibly the most well-known virtual network there is and has a number of shows which continue to impress and delight readers. The numbers quoted above show just how many people are invested in it and just how important it is to the web-community that it remains on wikipedia. A lot of hard work has gone into the wikipedia page and it most certainly shows, looking professional and accessible. The site is loved by many - as is this one - and it would be a shame to have it be taken off of wikipedia when there is such support for it to be here. It is a fantastic website with high quality and deserves the exposure wikipedia grants it. A number of other series allowed to remain here certainly do not warrant the same amount of readers and fans and yet they remain, so why shouldn't Monster Zero Productions? Long live MZP! <s>-- Mr.Dark</s> <sub>Fake signature.</sub><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.32.44.154 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.32.44.154_cfaa.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.32.44.154">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> -Why should MZP be deleted when there are other shows that you aren't complaining about (and that is not a reason to).

<li><b>Comment</b> - Why would I use Wikipedia to search for information on things that are only available in mainstream media? I Wiki things that are hard to find info on. The Fempiror Chronicles have not been mentioned in any mainstream media that I know of, yet somehow I know for a fact that people from around the world that have read it. This series may even some day get snapped up by a major studio (it's that good). Why wouldn't Wikipedia want this virtual series to grace their site?Mz. Pia</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - MZP is a growing community for script writers and continues to be the number one place for virtual series and support for talented script writers. I don't see any reason why this page should be taken down.-- William C. Lonero</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> -George is a tremendous writer, the question should not be why to leave in on wikipedia, but why not? Wikipedia is a user submitted site,the Net is user driven, so why shouldn't something that has a following on the net be noted here? you have a freaking article on the Numa Numa guy for Christ sakes, and yet you are wondering if this should be removed? I think George's script should take more priority over the Numa Numa guy,because it is more than a significant contribution to online literature and that should be noted. Numa guy lip-synched and gained fame, only thing he should be noted as is Milli-Vanilli Reloaded. why the need for the wiki page is not seen right now, i feel it should stay because the need for it will grow as the story and fan base does.(theprodigalson) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.63.96.118 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.63.96.118_d06e.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.63.96.118">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>I'm not sure since this is my first time I've posted on Wikipedia but what's the deal with the attention signpost on the top of the article. The reason there are more posts here decrying the proposed deletion is because we all feel very strong on this matter and believe that this article should not be deleted- not as it is suggested "because someone told us to or there was some message posted in a forum". That is quite a narrow minded view to take of things to assume that is why there are so many comments against this deletion. Perhaps the editors should be aware that the posters of these comments are quite intelligent, informed individuals who are well aware this is a discussion- people discussing the reasons why this article is within the guidelines for articles to be on the site. Others have pointed out very good points why this article should remain to which I concur but I will add this- this is an informative article discussing the new phenomenon amongst fans first there was fan fiction that is now even being recognised/mentioned by tv series creators in the mainstream media now the next step is virtual series- people writing their own scripts. I'm sure in the next year or so people in the mainstream will start to take notice just as they did with fan fiction. However I find it highly amusing that the editors of wikipedia seem to think-that posters like myself and others here that disagree with this are mindless lemmings that all bombard this discussion board with rants because someone told us to or because it's part of some campaign. I assure you it's not. The posters of these comments wish to inform everyone who reads this of the complete inability of the first person who nominated this for deletion as evidenced by his comments- that he/she obviously have no idea what they're talking about. The fact that only two others have "agreed" with him on separate days about this deletion without adding any comments of themselves I think is suspect as well. Especially if you feel so strongly about something that you wish to delete it. I hope you, the editors can read all these posts for and against and come to a sensible, well thought out and fair decision after reading all these comments as the person who first nominated this for deletion, obviously didn't.Reeamya 03:18, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I find this series to be very interesting and worth keep here on wikipedia. The internet is the only place where the little guy can be read by a large audience. If you take Fempiror (and all the other MZP entries), you will make these works that much less accessible. Phil</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - "...to be notable, you need links where somebody else is talking about you." While I can't necessarily speak for Monster Zero on this account, my primary interest in this discussion is the Fempiror Chronicles, whose article opens with a list of comments where other people are talking about it. Those comments are drawn from three message boards and two blogs where someone else talked about it. None of those five sites are places that I have any control over, nor are the people anyone that I could influence to say something they don't mean (nor would I wish to). SimplyScripts is where it is most popular having nine pages of discussion/reviews and over 4,000 hits on its thread. -- Comments on this topic have been a mix of Monster Zero devotees and Fempiror devotees, and as I've stated before, grouping Fempiror with Monster Zero is kind of a case of death by association since the only reason it ended up here is because it is listed on that site. -- The other objection that has been brought up is the original nominator's knowledge of this topic. I find it very strange that this was brought to the table by someone whose definition comes no where near what Monster Zero actually represents, and actually cheapens the effort these people put into their site. This original argument is the backbone of this article for deletion discussion, and it just seems ironic that someone who nominates an article for deletion gives a definition that is not only completely incorrect, but actually seems to have been written to serve the sole purpose of influencing those who look at it to delete it. "Officially" notable or not, at least give us the credit of being writers and using our own creativity to make stories that are unique. Sure, some of them fall under a category of "fan fiction," but this in no way makes them "clips of real shows," which is a definition nothing short of insulting, especially considering that a good portion of the shows are not fan fiction, but completely original works. -- So if in the end we all end up being deleted because we're not notable enough yet, so be it. We can't control that. I did respect the comments left by those who did say <b>Delete All</b> after the original nominator, but... I think the biggest kick in the teeth was being nominated by an individual who (based purely on his definition) has no idea what we're doing, likely did not read the article, and clearly did not look up what a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_series.html" title="Virtual series">Virtual series</a> is (even though that term has enough notability to remain on Wikipedia). <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubkas_796a.html" title="User:Tubkas">George Willson</a> 11:30, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> not only OR, but also nonsense. The first knives (for whittling) were made of flint, which gets quite sharp by being chipped with other stones that can be far duller.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is actually a parodox featured in a good number of philosophy texts. It's also sometimes refered to as "The Idiot's Parodox," that is, one cannot become smarter than his smartest teacher, thus, as time goes on, the population becomes progressively dumber. It is also sometimes refered to in Artifical Intelligence texts regarding the question of whether an intelligent program can be created by an inferior intelligence. I'd hate to see this article deleted because of your majority; if it helps, I'll offer to add context when I get a chance (I'm very busy right now). <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBristow_0734.html" title="User:Bristow">Bristow</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this article. I could also do my best to look through my old philosophy books for references to it. I majored in philosophy four years ago and it is indeed a genuine area of epistomology. It might be called a few other things though. Maybe we should keep on the lookout for other names of the parodox (it is not uncommon for paradoxes to have multiple names. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrowoftime_9e95.html" title="User:Arrowoftime">Arrowoftime</a> 01:29, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is a matter of arithmetic. The article says 15 years old. This means 1991, which is rather different from 'the 1970s'. Since the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_Liberation_Front_b854.html" title="Gay Liberation Front">Gay Liberation Front</a> is a 1960s organisation it is improbable that Queer Alliance is the oldest queer alliance, but it is possible, I suppose. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 20:00, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>There isn't even any support for the "15 years" claim. Although the "oldest" claim seems to be the "oldest GSA at a community college". Like I said, if that's true (which I would really love to see evidence for) it <i>might</i> make it notable. Until evidence for that surfaces, school clubs don't get to advertise on the 'pedia. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara">CheNuevara</a> 20:18, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Articles that present extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are original research and therefore inappropriate." Go look at the <a href="../../../s/a/w/Saw_3.html" title="Saw 3">Saw 3</a> article. It has six external links, including the Saw III official website. The Saw Series template lists the movies as the Saw <i>Trilogy</i>. You've made the prediction that (a) Saw III will be a success and (b) therefore, there will be a Saw IV. I'm not saying either of these things won't happen. I'm just saying that making a WP article because you say they are going to happen isn't good enough. That's crystalballism. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 23:29, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There are only two pages for Columbine victims (Laura Townsend's page actually redirects to an article on her mother, who was the subject of a Lifetime movie). Both have considerably more information than this article, and discuss in detail an urban legend that sprung up around them, and both have been the subjects of books written about them. This page was originally a eulogy/tribute to the deceased, which is a large reason of why I AfD'd it. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 03:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not about memorializing people; it's an encyclopedia. Gill having his own article while De Sousa doesn't is not inconsistent with that. In fact, it's <i>entirely</i> consistent with any reasonable encyclopedia's policy on the notability of candidates for inclusion. Gill <i>did</i> something notable; De Sousa didn't. Just to clarify in case anybody misunderstands, "notable" does not mean "positive" or "good" — it means "significant". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I thought maybe they misspelled something called "even handlers," which of course has lots of results on Google that have nothing to do with exercise.

<p>This article is completely true. It is a new name for the article, that is why it is not well known. Please do not delete this article because it can be very informative to individuals wishing to stretch out before sporting events or any form of exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>The issue is not truth -- it's the appropriateness of the subject for this encyclopedia. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for a start. If this is indeed beneficial, it has its place on the Internet. That place just isn't Wikipedia at this point in time. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 19:08, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I first heard of the Evan Handlers stretch four years ago while attending a course on cheerleading instruction. The stretch is both effective, and as said above "beneficial." I don't understand why a person would say that the issue is "not the truth, but the appropriateness" of the subject. How does one decide what is appropriate for Wikipedia, when encyclopedias are supposed to be limitless wealths of knowledge. Excluding valid information from Wikipedia seems detrimental to the very mission of the website.</p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.</a>" That's an official policy of this project. That's a big part of the appropriateness I mentioned above, though there are other concerns that keep verifiable information from being appropriate. Also, go read the WP:NOT document I linked above. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. That's also official policy. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 20:26, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Erechthues' claims are obviously bias becuase he has not heard of or used this stretch before. Please Erechtheus before you continue your arguement think about what you are saying and know that this stretch is real. I have been using this stretch for many years now and i would like to share it with a mass amount of people. Please do not delete this article because as the person above said it is a new name for this article.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I hate to disagree with the, uh, unity, of the above editor(s?) but I don't find, in the links, any verification on the alleged baronetcy, and what's left looks like an upper-class delinquent who was active in politics as a teenager. And we <i>never</i> keep an article in hopes that "future source material" will come. If you want it kept now, find sources now. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:36, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baronet.html" title="Baronet">baronet</a> does not appear to make one notable itself (note that it is not a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peerage</a>); this young numbskull has done little but inherit some money. The picture, incidentally, appears to be of one "William Summerskill". Also, the emphasis on titles smells of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 03:21, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as a non-notable (if rich) person. If the claim to the baronetcy is a serious one, I'm not convinced that every single baronet on the planet is notable just for being one. If the claim is false, then we're left with someone who hasn't actually done anything much notable aside from being a rich socialite, which should be reason for deletion in itself I sometimes think. His father doesn't appear to be notable either, but that's academic since only the immediate family of royals tend to inherit notability without doing anything. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 07:02, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have witnessed this gentlemen's involvement at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, and hold him to be a trustworthy person. I met him during the Spring 2006 semester of college in the class entitled PHIL 305B Modern Philosophy: moral/political philosophy; instructed by Professor Andrew Youpa. Also, I have engaged in discussion with him and Professor Randal Auxier during Apologia meetings, a Registered Student Organization, here at SIUC. I frequently help him with his RSO's Gospel table within the SIUC student center. I also attend Mr. Mount's Temple of Faith Ministries, as conducted in the Interfaith Center here in Carbondale, IL. I have spoken via telephone to Bishop Gentry, and can verify their acquaintance and friendship. I am also a member of his Google group entitled Jesus on the Web. Likewise, almost all the things within Mathew Enoch Mount's Wikipedia page can be accessed through public records. Again, I hold him to be a trustworthy and reliable person. His page should be allowed to stay and, due to his dyslexia, only minorly revised. My name is Adam Colbert and I am a music student at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 131.230.135.202 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.230.135.202_3db1.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.230.135.202">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Do Not Delete - My name is Colin West and I live in Mr. Mount's Dorm. He is the real deal, I've seen his drivers license - so his name, address, and age are accurate. He also wears a priest outfit every day and goes in to very long discourse about his beliefs. No man could make up the stuff that comes out of his mouth, so it must be real. He is, indeed, an odd character, but this is no reason to delete his page.
