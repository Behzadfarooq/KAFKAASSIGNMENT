Austin Kjorven is a Bellman and a Teaching master in Toronto. He is employed by the Fairmont Royal York Hotel and the TDSB or Toronto District School Board. We'll let you figure out who employs him in which profession.</p>
<p>As a bellman, Austin ranks among the very best. He probably would be the best had Matt Thompson not been born. However, this is nothing to be ashamed of. Austin loses a bag at a rate of .001 per hundred bags delivered. Matt loses at a rate of .oo1 per hundred (the smaller zeros indicate that Matt is better).</p>
<p>As a teacher, no one quite knows his proficiency. It is rumored that he can "almost dunk" in phys-ed. Recently Austin had a contract to teach at a school on the Toronto Island. This required a ferry ride to the island. After some contemplating Austin decided to indeed take the job. It was a joyful experience.</p>
<p>Austin writes songs with his mind. He was employee on the month in 2006. Read more about Austin here. <a href="http://www.zombo.com" class="external text" title="http://www.zombo.com" rel="nofollow">Zombocom</a></p>

<p>John Reynolds, M. D. was born in Santa Barbara, California on May 2, 1926. He attended the Crane Country Day School in Montecito, California and The Webb School in Claremont, California. His pre-med studies were at the University of Texas and his medical degree was from Harvard University (Class of 1949). His internship and residency were at the Boston City Hospital. He was an Assistant in Medicine at Harvard University and a Teaching Fellow in Medicine. He came back to California and practiced medicine at The University of California, Los Angeles. He was the hematologist for the MGM mogul, Louis B. Mayer. He discovered that the private practice of medicine was far more enjoyable than university research and opened his first office in Westwood Village practicing both Internal Medicine and Hematology. He practiced medicine on the westside of Los Angeles for the next 50+ years. He practiced at both Santa Monica Hospital and St. John's Hospital. For many years he was a clinical professor of Medicine at U. C. L. A. and the Veteran's Administration Hospital. He was the physician to George Cukor, Irene Dunne, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, and others, both famous and non-famous. He was the President of the Los Angeles Academy of Medicine, a member of the American Society of Hematology and the American College of Physicians. He has written or co-authored several papers on hematologic diseases. He was a contributor to "The Management of Medical Emergencies". Dr. Reynolds is married and has 3 children.</p>

<p>Lorenzo Raymond Sylvanus Nelson was born on August 1, 1902 in Greenville, Texas to Martha Louise Key Nelson and Pierce Shaddock Nelson. He was the grandson of Lorenzo Dow Key, MD, a 1878 graduate of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee and (Mrs.) America Davenport Gray Key. Dr. Nelson was the great-grandson of Hillery Wattsworth Key, D.D., who had served as a Trustee of Meharry and Walden University. Dr. Nelson's maternal great-grandfather had also been one of twenty-two (22) members who founded the Methodist Episcopal Church North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee on October 11, 1866, a distinction that was honored by the Tennessee Conference of the United Methodist Church, Clarksville, Tennessee on October 12-14, 1979 by naming the Key Memorial United Methodist Church as a historic site. Two other churches in Gallatin KEY-Stewart United Methodist Church and Hartsville, Tennessee are named for Hillery Wattsworth Key, D.D.</p>
<p>Lorenzo Raymond Sylvanus Nelson first came to Lake County on September 9, 1935 and served a distinguished military career following his induction as a First Lieutenant in Medical Corps at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. He served from 1935 to 1941 as a MEDICAL OFFICER, Civilian Conservation Corps, VI Corps Area, and was ultimately called to active duty in the Regular Army on March 4, 1941 at Fort Devens, Massachusetts. He was named Regimental Surgeon,366th Infantry Regiment prior to embarcation in March 1944 and was promoted to Major, Medical Corps, while serving in Italy. As noted the 366th Infantry Regiment, arrived in Casablanca, North Africa April 6, 1944 and was attached to the Fifteenth Air Force Command in the Italian Campaign finally returning to Lake County October 1945 after completion of his service in Italy. He terminated his Active Duty status in February 1946.</p>
<p>During a Reunion of the 366th Veterans Association a plaque was given to him on April 14, 1979, noting that he was the "Physician and friend to the Regiment who will forever be remembered as 'Doc' Nelson, the Regimental Surgeon. The former Captain Hondon Hargrove, author of THE BUFFALO SOLDIER IN ITALY, gave a person tribute to him in stating, "He was the most gentle of all men for helped men to face with courage the most difficult circumstances." Judge John Letts, who gave a tribute to him at his final Memorial Service in the Chapel and Internment at Fort Custer National Cemetery on August 11, 1994, said as he reflected upon his deep caring not only of the Men and Officers of the Regiment, but also of their families said, "Of all men that I have known, he was one of the rarest." Colonel Charles Fisher, Retired, Regimental Chaplain, 366th Infantry, who Officiated at Dr. Nelson's service at Frank Howe's Chapel, Garratt Theological Seminary, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois on July 2, 1994 stated, "he was a universal man, a man of the universe, who cared for the enemy, prisoners-of-war, refugees, children of the war, as well as his own Men and Officers equally. He was a man beyond race, color or creed."</p>
<p>The same tradition was carried into civilian life where he practiced for sixty five (65) years. On April 27, 1979 former Governor William Milliken gave him a Centennial Award in "recognition of your outstanding contribution to public health in Michigan over the years."</p>
<p>He was Chief of Staff at Reed City Hospital, Reed City, Michigan from 1946-1964, was Medical Advisor to the Draft Board from 1946-1972 and served as Lake County Medical Examiner. Her was a former President of Tri-County Medical Society (Lake-Osceola-Mecosta County), MICHIGAN STATE MEDICAL SOCIETY, AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION and on the Board of the Areawide Comprehensive Planning Unit in Grand Rapids as well as a recepient of an honorary humanitarian award from the Michigan Department of Public Health. He also served as acting Public Health Director for District 5 in Michigan during which time he gave approval for the establishment of REGIONAL HEALTH CARE, with the hope that the promise would be fulfilled from the Regional Office Administrator, HEW, Dr. Frank Ellis that quality medicine would be provided for that area with Attending Physicians supervising Resident Staff from both Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee, the medical school from which he graduated in 1929 and his maternal great-grandfather, Lorenzo Dow Key, graduated in 1878, Meharry Medical Department, Walden University. That promise was not brought to fruition.</p>
<p>Lorenzo Raymond Sylvanus Nelson participated in the Tenth Annual Medical Military Inactive Training Unit,Mayo Foundation from October 2-10, 1938 and was trained by Charles Huggins, a Nobel Laureate, Professor Emeritus of Urology at University of Chicago, who remembered and esteemed him profoundly.</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson was honored by having an elementary school in Webber Township, Lake County named the Lorenzo Raymond Nelson Elementary School. Although it only provided education for Kindergarten through Third Grade, during the time that it was rated as providing the best quality education by the Accreditation Committee which rated Baldwin Community School. He served as the unpaid consultant of Deerwood Developmental Center, Inc. from 1980-1984.</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson's mother was a graduate of Chicago Conservatory of Music in Voice and Piano. He became an accomplished musician on both piano and Cornet and played with the Ted Lewis Band among others. He delived Count Basie's first child when he was serving as an Intern in Kansas City, Missouri. It was his maternal grandmother, America Davenport Gray Key, an educator, who allegedly changed the course of his life when she demanded that he relinquish his Cornet, an instrument that his mother apparently also played as a girl of approximately 18 prior to her marriage November 1901 after the early death of her father, Lorenzo Dow Key, M.D. April 11, 1901 from pneumonia, called at that time, "CAPTAIN OF DEATH".</p>
<p>Lorenzo Raymond Sylvanus Nelson, M.D. married Blanche Juanita Crawford, R. N., who had the distinction of receiving the Nelson Gold Medal for highest academic attainment during her studies in the School of Nursing, Meharry Medical College, where she also graduated May 1929. Dr. Nelson had received his Bachelor's degree from Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee and his degree as Doctor of Medicine from Meharry Medical College in May 1929. After completion of his Internship at Kansas City General Hospital # 2 they were married in Wichita, Kansas on July 6, 1930.</p>
<p>Final Internment for Lorenzo Raymond Sylvanus Nelson, was held Thursday August 11, 1994 at Fort Custer National Cemetery following his death in Oshtemo Township, Kalamazoo County, Kalamazoo, Michigan on June 29, 1994. The one-time military surgeon was buried with full honors at Fort Custer following a moving service held by Chaplain Amidon, Chief Army Chaplain. He had the distinction of being the first to be allowed to have services at Fort Custer Veterans Hospital Chapel. A beautiful solo, IN CHRIST THERE IS NO EAST NOR WEST, a hymn arranged by Harry Burleigh was sung by a boy soprano, Andrew Sorrell, who sang a capella.

<p>There is a Biographical Study which includes his name and accomplishments. It was similar to Langston Hughes "Pictoral History of Negro". He was included at that time because he was elected President, Tri-County Medical Society, AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION as distinct from National Medical Association. Although he was noted in that Biography BECAUSE he was the "first" person of color to have that distinction, the powerful contribution of BOTH of my parents was that they both saw and served ALL persons equally WITHOUT REGARD or reflection of "Color", socio-economic "circumstances". Therefore, the abstract of the article which I have tried to adapt to your format is a reflection of the MAN as he worked and existed under the most difficult of circumstances both in Military and Civilian service. He also received a Congressional Citation from a Senator, which I have tried to obtain from Seantor Levin. I will continue to pursue this for it IS important to recognize persons who may not have PUBLISHED, but have given such a profound contribution to SOCIETY at TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES! www.americanelson.com This website is based on considerable research from many sources including the Memphis Public Library, History Section, the book which has been cited by John Abernathy Smith, CROSS AND FLAME, TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF METHODISM IS MIDDLE TENNESSEE and through personal ORAL HISTORY of CHAPLAIN CHARLES FISHER, CAPTAIN HONDON HARGROVE, CAPTAIN DENNETTE HARROD, SR., (CAPTAIN, M.C.)

In such an event, the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acting_President_0dc3.html" title="Acting President">Acting President</a> would preside for a period not exceeding 90 days. The Acting President shall not have the powers to do the following:</p>

<p>Where possible, the President appoints the Acting President (overseas trips, illness or vacations), but in the event he/she can not (e.g. sudden death) the decision is made thus:</p>
<p>Where there is only one Vice President he/she becomes Acting President</p>
<p>Where there are two Vice Presidents:</p>
<p>by the Vice President whom the President has designated for such an eventuality take office; or</p>
<p>by the Vice President who last acted as President where neither Vice President has been designated in <i>case of such an eventuality.</i></p>
<p>The Constitution also allows for ministers to hold the office of President in an acting capacity:</p>
<p>"During the absence or incapacity of the Vice President or of both VicePresidents, as the case may be, by such Minister as may be designated for such an eventuality (i) by the President; or(ii) by the Cabinet, where no Minister has been designated by the President"</p>
<p>however, unlike the vice presidents, any minister acting as President can only carry out those functions with the approval of a majority of ministers in the Cabinet</p>
<p>In all cases, if the President dies or is impeached or in some other way incapacitated perminantly, there must be Presidental election held within 90 days and the president elect takes office on "the day upon which he is declared to be elected." after swearing before "Chief Justice or other judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court the oaths of loyalty and office".</p>

Terratelephonaphobia (sometimes terratelephonophobia) is a psychological dysfunction defined as 'a fear or strong aversion to the use and/or presence in a building of a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landline.html" title="Landline">landline</a> telephone'</p>
<p>Sufferers present with different symptoms, and the severity of the condition varies. Most often, suffers justify their irrational fear (e.g. I don't know who is calling, the caller may have the wrong number etc.) - however in more severe manifestations, terratelephonaphobia involves a psychopathology which results in symptoms of an <a href="../../../a/n/x/Anxiety_state.html" title="Anxiety state">anxiety state</a> when the patient is in a situation which puts him/her in contact with a landline telephone (typically sweating, irregular breathing, and sometimes heart arrythmia). Etiology is mixed, often a traumatic early experience or a learned behaviour due to more recent unpleasant experience(s).</p>
<p>Until the widespread adoption of the mobile phone, terratelephonaphobia was simply described as telephonaphobia - the presentation and etiology are the same, however the crucial difference is that sufferers of terratelephonaphobia do not fear mobile phones. For this reason, terratelephonaphobia is not a component of telephonaphobia, but a seperate condition.</p>
<p>There are numerous support forums where sufferers discuss their condition, and some may derive some benefit from this informal '<a href="../../../t/a/l/Talking_cure.html" title="Talking cure">talking cure</a>', without seeking professional help.</p>

<p>KVM, or Kernel-based Virtual Machine, is virtualization software that allows one or more x86 "virtual machines" to run simultaneously on top of the host operating system. A layer of abstraction is added such that each virtual machine will appear to have its own hard disk, network card, etc. It is implemented within the Linux kernel and will be a standard component of the Linux kernel as of version 2.6.20. It is capable of running standard Linux and Windows O/S images without modification.</p>

<p>Richard Curwin and Alan Mendler were authors of a very famous book entitled "Discipline with Dignity". This book that was authored by both was a flexable program for effective school and classroom management that teaches responsible thinking, cooperation, mutual respect and shared decision-making. Discipline With Dignity equips educators with classroom skills, techniques and structure that enables them to spend less time dealing with behavioral problems and more time on positive interactions with students and on instruction. It presents educators with the framework, tools and skills for being effective within their own style of classroom management, and furnishes administrators, teachers and parents with information and a basis for setting school-wide policy. This approach helps children develop their self-esteem, while giving them the tools and encouragement necessary for making responsible decisions in their lives, both within and outside the classroom. I think this process of teaching is important to students in the classroom environment. It helps students understand discipline and maintain a self dignity. The students start to view discipline as a intigral part of instruction. Along with developing they also enhance their self esteem through the process of developing responsible behavior.</p>
