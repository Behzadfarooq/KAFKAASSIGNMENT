Although the Buffyverse articles can be navigated by category (and this page directs people to search by category if they prefer), the categories are divided into numerous sub-categories' this is the <b>only a-z list of all Buffyverse articles on one page</b>, a massively useful tool for Wikipedians reading about the Buffyverse. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 19:23, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> that we have categories for this, but we also allow for Lists and that is really what this is.

<li><b>Keep but Rename</b> I agree with the proposal by <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllycat_7066.html" title="User:Allycat">Allycat</a> above to rename.

<dd>The 'Buffyverse' category is divided into dozens of sub-categories, it divides <i>Buffy</i> and <i>Angel</i> very strictly, and encompasses a few dozen pages, all this can sometimes be extremely unuseful. This article up for deletion needs to be renamed <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_topic_lists.html" title="List of topic lists">to what seems to be already accepted by Wikipedia</a>. According to that formula, instead of deletion this article should simply be renamed to <b>List of Buffyverse-related topics</b>, and also redefined in its opening sentences.

<li><b>Renamed</b> I don't think I've copied the article to that place, pretty sure I've renamed the whole article to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buffyverse-related_topics_fb66.html" title="List of Buffyverse-related topics">List of Buffyverse-related topics</a> including its case for deletion? That is twice proposed above to bring it into closer line with wikipedia policy. I used the 'move' button, made some edits, and linked the discussion pages. I believe it should bring it into line with other 'structured lists' like those here; '<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_topic_lists.html" title="List of topic lists">List of topic lists</a>', unless we believe we should start deleting the majority of those lists? -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 01:20, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The whole basis for deletion is categories vs list not notability?

Amongst other things it says <i>Wikipedia offers three ways to create groupings of articles: categories, lists, and article series boxes. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages..

<li><b>Keep.</b> Paxomen has at least two points that have convinced me. First, there are plenty of <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_Categories_and_lists_f710.html" title="User:Paxomen/Categories and lists">other lists</a> that are much less useful than this one (for example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japan-related_topics_8848.html" title="List of Japan-related topics">List_of_Japan-related_topics</a>). Second, Paxomen says he is willing to address many of the complaints that have been lodged against the page during this vote. Therefore, to vote to delete this page <i>now</i> is tantamount to purging an incomplete page on the grounds that it isn't very useful when incomplete. That is true of <i>every</i> page on Wikipedia! My <i>personal</i> preference would be to use categories and subcategories for this, because I won't myself find this page all that useful, but I don't vote to delete pages that I don't find useful. Perfecto pointed out that this violates the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines; this is true, but I think that the genie was out of the bottle a year ago and a deletionist philosophy will never win at Wikipedia. I'm a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mergism" class="extiw" title="meta:Mergism">Mergist</a> myself, but we can't have true Mergism until Wikipedia software can force an unadorned link to redirect to a subsection of another page.

<dd>How so? Please provide an example of a time when you would need to find something about the Buffyverse and need an alphabetized list. If you already know the name of the topic, just go straight there. If you don't, then a list of a whole bunch of related topics in an arbitrary (as opposed to conceptually systematic) can't be useful. <a href="../../../d/m/l/User%7EDmlandfair_8636.html" title="User:Dmlandfair">Dave</a> 23:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lists complement categories; "<i>categories, lists, and article series boxes.. should not be considered to be in competition with each other</i>" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes" rel="nofollow">[WP</a>]. List not <i>arbitrary</i>. All topics in one place, red links for unstarted articles, annotation, links to discussion/revision, alternative names for the same item... Also use of lists impose less of a load on the servers than use of categories, which is a very important point because wikipedia is becoming increasingly popular, and the servers are increasingly struggling to cope with being overwhelmed. For list of potential usefulnesses of list, see above,'Disadvantages of categories', and 'Advantages of lists'-- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 14:31, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Edited/Editing</b>: Check out the article, I have added <i>discussion</i>, and <i>history</i> to each topic this kind of thing <i>cannot ever be done with categories</i>. This article can hugely benefit even more by annotation (although i have already semi-annotated many of the articles by using '|' after the link and using a more appropiate entry for the index e.g. '<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_594e.html" title="List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes">List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes</a>' is entered into the article as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_594e.html" title="List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes"><i>Buffy</i> episodes</a> to make more sense of the indexing system. Annotation, 'discussion' links, and 'revision' links are all impossible within categories, lists are supposed to complement categories and help the wikipedians to navigate topics. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 22:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have only just begun the process of annotation, and feel that an annotated index with all topics in one place is seeming more useful than even i had imagined, there are hundreds of opportunites for cross-referencing between completely different sub-categories, yet because it's a list, the reader/editor can go straight to associated topics. Just one example is annotation has the potntial to link the Buffyverse actors to their characters, and the Buffyverse characters to those who portrayed them. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 18:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
