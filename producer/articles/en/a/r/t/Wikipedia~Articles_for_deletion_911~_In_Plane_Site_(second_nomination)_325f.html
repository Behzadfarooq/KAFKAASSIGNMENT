<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Regarding notability and reliable sources, the video has been broadcast on Australian television, and a big stink was raised <a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=143539" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=143539" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>Though it's true Michael Danby calling the movie "laughable" does not make the film notable, neither does it make the film non-notable.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 02:51, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> (added after <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">User:Zunaid</a> voted): TBC argued for notability on 3 grounds. Here are 3 counter-arguments:</li>

<ol>
<li>The Danby comment "does not make the film notable" (TBC, just above).</li>
<li>I believe that anyone can write an Amazon review. (The fact that Amazon sell the video is probably more significant than the review.)</li>
<li>CNN interviews lots of people. Being interviewed by CNN or FOX is not a strong claim to notability; being the subject of news stories from <i>multiple</i> news shows, news agencies and/or newspapers would be a lot more significant.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Regarding the three counter-arguments:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Danby comment isn't the notable part. The broadcast of the movie on one of Australia's three major broadcast networks is.</li>
<li>The fact that it is sold on Amazon doesn't seem to be a counterpoint.</li>
<li>Not that it's a particularly respected show, but it is a nationally syndicated one: <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_to_Coast_AM_b201.html" title="Coast to Coast AM">Coast to Coast AM</a> has also had at least one discussion on the movie.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>On another note, whether the movie is a hoax or potential disinformation is not relevant. Personally I think it's garbage, but that doesn't make it any less relevant.</dd>
<dd>Finally, as <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> stated, <i>AfD should not be a "Pitch til you win " kiddie carnival game. It was nominated before and the result was keep.</i> Yes, consensus can change, but this was just voted on six months ago. Seems there should be a bit more time between repeated AfD's. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead">Sparkhead</a> 11:11, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Note</b> as one of the article's biggest claims to notability is that it aired on Australian free-to-air tv, I'm listing it on the list of Australian-related deletions. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 09:15, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep and update</b></s> <b>Weakest possible keep</b> If this were held a month ago, I would have voted delete. But being screened on free-to-air tv in Australia is a claim to notability. <a href="http://news.google.com.au/news?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22plane+site%22+location%3AAustralia&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com.au/news?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22plane+site%22+location%3AAustralia&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">a google <b>news</b> search</a> for Plane Site gets at least 3 separate hits from mainstream Australian news sources. Complaints about it being a second nomination are a bit much - there's always deletion review. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 09:32, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak Keep</b> marginal. but it's got over 600 google hits, an imdb listing, and a national showing in Australia. i don't see the harm, as it doesn't look like a promotional listing. if it's soon to be forgotten, then this will be just one more page no one looks at. no big deal. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 09:53, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's got international coverage and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22911%3A+In+Plane+Site%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22911%3A+In+Plane+Site%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">121,000 google hits</a>. Its being described as "laughable" adds to its notability, albeit not its credibility, but the latter is not our concern. The article needs to include the National Nine News article, the CNN interview and <a href="http://www.911inplanesite.com/fox_hatchetjob.html" class="external text" title="http://www.911inplanesite.com/fox_hatchetjob.html" rel="nofollow">"Fox News hatchet job"</a>. The nom fails to acknowledge this exposure, which not only invalidates the nom, but also the deletes which cite "per nom". We need to be presented with all the evidence, not selective evidence to argue a POV. Three deletes also subscribe to a strong predictive element, namely "soon to be forgotten". We do not delete on what we think is going to happen in the future, i.e. speculation, but on what the reality is now. If something is "soon to be forgotten", it is a testimony to current prominence, as it is stating that it has not yet been forgotten. The previous AfD was near-unanimous, so a second AfD should not have been made without more serious consideration than is evidenced here:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Peephole#911:_In_Plane_Site" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Peephole#911:_In_Plane_Site" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Morton_devonshire/Archive04#911:_In_Plane_Site" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Morton_devonshire/Archive04#911:_In_Plane_Site" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:24, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Has a very decent article--I'm not saying that's relevant to notability, but's it's not like it's a small stub--and as shown by the ext. links has numerous reviews/comments.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Credible? Hardly. But being shown nation-wide on an Australia free-to-air television network is good enough to establish it's notability for me. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 09:40, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article documents an actual documentary and shows the criticism of it. It was aired on national TV, it's published. Maybe it's about time a team of experienced and impartial admins had a look at all this 9/11 crap and counter-crap and told those on each side of the alleged discussion to look at the criteria more closely and to interpret them properly.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It being presented on a national broadcast television channel <i>normally</i> would be an indication of notability, but, <b>CWC</b> makes good counterarguments. (The arguement that it's been too soon since the last AfD is completely wrong, and should be disregarded by the closing administrator.) — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 16:49, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The broadcast counterargument is simply wrong. It's been broadcast more than once, and it was not broadcast directly against 'Path to 9/11'. Regarding other comments about the <b>lack of validity of this AfD</b>, you really should read what is written. The issue is not the timeframe of the second AfD. I don't believe the nominator is acting <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">in good faith</a>. The fact that the nom states "the video isn't available at Blockbuster", shows that he did some searching outside of Wikipedia to verify notability. At least one of the references provided were easily available in <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_news.html" title="Google news">Google news</a>, showing <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainstream_media.html" title="Mainstream media">Mainstream media</a> coverage of the video. This is why discussions before a renomination after a consensus was reached are important. Deliberately ignoring such procedures is a violation of procedures, and intentionally disruptive. The nominator in this case has done it multiple times, and in the vast majority of cases the AfD fails. Remember this isn't a vote. It's a presentation of the facts involved with the article. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><font color="green">Sparkhead</font></a> 17:45, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
