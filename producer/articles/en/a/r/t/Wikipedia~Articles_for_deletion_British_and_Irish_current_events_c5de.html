<li><b>Comment</b> The discussion to date seems to hang on two points:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> page exists so this should as well.</li>
<li>It will (we promise) continue to be maintained.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>However neither one nor the other of these points adresses the central issue of <i>this</i> articles continued existance
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> page exists for a specific purpose. It, like <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a>, is deeply rooted in the community <i>regardless</i> of its merits for inclusion. (Any VfD on these pages would fail, and even I am not <i>that</i> much of a deletionist, <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F</a>.)</li>
<li>Regardless of how willing editors are to update, this does not belong <i>here</i>. In general, refer to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> for why there also exist <b><a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="n:Main_Page">Wikinews</a></b>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Thus, to restate - not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 8 July 2005 02:35 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> exists for a reason beyond <i>that it is rooted in the community regardless of its merits for inclusion</i>.
<ul>
<li>The only reason an entry like this is not considered encyclopedic by print encyclopedias is because, by their very nature, they cannot keep them current. Encyclopedias, however <b>do</b> contain pages listing events by year, as does <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_%272005_in%27_articles.html" title="List of '2005 in' articles">Wikipedia</a>. Therefore, <b>due to Wikipedia's nature</b>, these current events pages <b>are encyclopedic</b>, otherwise we draw some arbitrary line upon which events become encylopedic, so as to add them to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> pages.</li>
<li>Therefore the issue becomes precisely one of keeping such pages maintained. Far better, in my opinion, to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_archive_Current_Events_113a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to archive Current Events">archive</a> pages of this type which become inactive, and leave a redirect behind so that they can be reactivated if people are prepared to maintain them, rather than drag them through a VfD.</li>
<li>Further to that, note <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> does not apply here as this page and other's like it do not deal in first hand news reports.</li>
<li>And finally, in light of huge list of current events pages as posted by <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a>, I would suggest that this page <b>is encyclopedic</b> as defined by wikipedia community. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 8 July 2005 08:45 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In response to the above, yes, current event pages have precedent, but I believe that does not mean we should have one for each country. Our sisterprojects are there for a reason; <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> is the place to store news events. Major news events such as the London bombing will end up with encyclopedia articles anyway, of course, because of notability. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 8, 2005 10:08 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikinews does not have anything like the equivalent of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2005.html" title="June 2005">June 2005</a>, with lots of links to Wikipedia articles. Think of timelines as a different entrance point into Wikipedia (categories are another entrance point, a topic-oriented entrance point). <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 8 July 2005 10:11 (UTC)</li>
<li>So at what point do we write these articles? Where do you draw your arbitrary line in time beyond which an event can be encyclopedic? One year, one month, one day, one hour, one minute or one second? Should we then delete any mention of events happening in July on <b>any</b> page? As <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> states, timelines are encyclopedic, therefore this page is, otherwise Wikipedia has to set some policy on an arbitrary point at which events become encyclopedic. Consensus seems to be to record events as they happen, witness the updating happening constantly around us. Have people who are voting to delete considered the precedent that will be set if this page is deleted? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 8 July 2005 10:42 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Have I considered the precedent this would set? Yes. Would I be pleased with that precedent? <b>Yes</b>. We draw <i>arbitrary lines</i> around ourselves all the time. Look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">WP:Comic</a> for arbitrary guidelines. I would suggest, as a discussion starter, that <i>with the exception of</i> <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_event.html" title="Current event">Current Events</a> no news item under six months old be considered encyclopedic. So keep your shirt on, Pcb21, I haven't gone mad!&#160;;) The purpose of Wikipedia it to contain <u>knowledge</u>, not to hold <u>information</u>, and it takes time for knowledge to develop out of information. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 8 July 2005 11:40 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Oh, and as to my short-sightedness, I like to think I'm taking the long view. How many pages have been added in the last month? How many in the last year? How many new <i><b>administrators</b></i> have been added in that same amount of time? What's the backlog on VfD right now? Every additional page of marginal inclusionary merit makes it harder to detect and correct vandalism and nonsense. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">JustMeAgain</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Hmm, and all you've done since you got here is vote delete on VfD and list pages for VfD. Let's not forget wikipedia is for the readers, and this page is of use to readers. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 13:20, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I understand much of this is about keeping the specific British &amp; Irish page updated, but it appears that some of the delete camp are also against <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_event.html" title="Current event">current events</a> itself! This is lunacy. This month's current events page will become the backbone of our <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2005.html" title="July 2005">July 2005</a> article, which itself will be an invaluable resource (containing links to our articles on particular topics hot at the time, as well as to more primary sources) for future people researching this period. There is no question about the encyclopedic nature of these articles and am honestly a bit shocked by the short-sightedness of some commentators. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 8 July 2005 09:51 (UTC)</li>
