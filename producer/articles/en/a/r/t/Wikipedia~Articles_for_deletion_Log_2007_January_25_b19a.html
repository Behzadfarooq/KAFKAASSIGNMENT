<li><b>Forgive my ignorance on what is a "notable" school of style.</b> I was under the impression that I could put a small DESCRIPTIVE page for the use of anyone who may be interested in learning about my life devotion to martial arts. Furthermore, whoever that was that claimed I am being investigated by the IRS, you have no grounds to make such a false notion. I pay my taxes on every dollar I have ever earned AND I donate to charity when I can. I wrote this page not for advertisement, but to give a brief explanation of what I do, since it is not world renown. I carry a Federal business license as well as all necessary tax identities. I have partnerships with several other instructors of different systems and no one has yet questioned what I do, but rather they are curious of what will progress for me in the future. Yes the art has only been spoken of for 5 years. Everything has a beginning. But like I have written, the practice has been around much longer. What I do and teach is not some made-up farce chucked together to make a buck. This is something that I decided <b>12</b> years ago that I wanted to devote myself to and consider it my life's work.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is an unacceptable rebuttal in the name of my page, then, so sorry to have wasted all of your time in trying to do something that I thought was perfectly fine and INFORMATIVE and in no way had I attempted to make this some manner of commercial enterprise. I have a day job that pays my bills. I don't need to propagate a hoax or scheme to cripple our ever wary society. If this was a commercial enterprise, would I not have given precise information about how much I charge or my class schedule? Or how about a detailed account of my belt progression? Or my phone number so folks could call me and ask questions about how to join? I don't recall placing any of these or any other promotional items on this with any intent of compelling the masses to join my program. Oh, one more thing... whoever you are that accused me of being hunted by the IRS, I invite you to provide proof. And if you really know who I am, then why don't you accuse me to my face or call the police on me or whatever you feel is the necessary course of action to deal with someone of my incompetent or dubious nature.

<p><b>Thanks for your comment</b> As I wrote this page, I had not cited myself well, I know. I thought I could get the page up and add necessary citations and/ or have others who know about me, but not necessarily involved, provide some manner of backing to support my descriptions. Given time, I will provided all that I can in the way of official documentation, as I am quite new to Wikipedia. Actually, this page was the first thing I have ever written for it, although I have read probably over 1000 articles.Talonado0013 00:38, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The article should be created using multiple non-trivial published works that discuss the Hector band (which the article does not). I was unable to locate any usable published works on the Hector band or on the Patriots of Loose Rock EP mentioned in the Hector article.

<dd>Because it is web content and is only listed as such within the article, which makes the application of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> perfectly acceptable. <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> is just a proposal and not something I would have considered since there was no mention of it being bundled with a linux distribution - my psychic abilities are somewhat diminished today. I would be looking for a pair of reliable secondary sources any which way, so the article isn't a simple recreation of information available from the source without any critical review. A popcorn ranking of blah out of blah doesn't convince me otherwise, a couple of good reviews would, I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation for a game article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 14:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly where it says it is web content? "Boson is an open source OpenGL real-time strategy computer game programmed in C++" ... I challenge you to find a web site that uses OpenGL and is written in C++. This isn't an article about Boson's website, this is about a <i>computer game,</i> as indicated in the <i>article title</i>, in case you missed it. The package dependencies sure don't seem to indicate a web browser is required to play. And it's "popcon", not "popcorn", and that condition has been listed <i>unchallenged</i> in the WP:SOFTWARE proposal as an reasonable way to measure the popularity of a software package for quite a while now, we can't expect that to change drastically when WP:SOFTWARE becomes a <i>real</i> content guideline. I'm not expecting you to be a psychic, just use a little bit of common sense and a little bit of diligence, as in reading and understanding what the article covers. This isn't a vote (in a poll, everyone's generally expected to give a completely random inconsequential, misinformation-based vote that won't affect the end result anyway =), This is a discussion where you're supposed to actually <i>examine the case at hand</i>. If you're rejecting WP:SOFTWARE (which <i>is</i> practically being applied every day despite of its status), please at least provide a content guideline that has <i>anything</i> at all to do with the article. We're also not supposed to be concerned about the state of the article; what we have here is the fact that the bit of software is actually somewhat notable and we, thus, may have an article about it. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:25, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Common sense would dictate that using <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for material that was unsourced, has a website with a 'download' option (and not just a demo version) and which didn't label itself as part of a 'major distribution of Linux' is a request for notability for a game obtainable on the web, not a random policy or guideline or innability to distinguish between a piece of software and a living person. Trying to make me out as thick as two short planks is not negated by a smiley. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not ideal for software but the notability aspect fits well enough, it's used quite happily on casual games (even to 'keep' ones that have had a boxed version released for retail). "A content guideline that has <i>anything</i> at all to do with the article" it is, that's what I've used it for in the past, unchallenged. I have not seen <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> used unchallenged in this way as sole reason for keeping an article, nor this popcorn rating being used either, so your say so isn't enough to change my view of this. I should have been more open-minded towards <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> but being called thick doesn't exactly put me in the best frame of mind. No, AFD isn't a vote, but that's not news to me and wasn't the intention of my input - but why say that to me when I'm at least trying to use notability guidelines?

<li><b>Comment/realign</b> Some of my own comments were entirely unwarranted, starting with my response to your first post Wolf. I should have explained my reasoning instead of going off on one, coming back and looking at my first reply, that was out of order. Looking back now, what I <b>thought</b> I saw and what I actually saw are two different things. I sat back a few minutes ago and thought "God, I don't feel so hot", then had a one-sided conversation on the telephone with someone, my head emptier than.. a very empty thing.

<ul>
<li>And I absolutely have to apologise for my own thickness, too. I tried to hint that <i>maybe</i> you should have just reassessed the article as what it <i>is</i>, instead of creatively applying a seemingly unrelated notability criterion, but I suppose in this case, I only could bring forth ill will with my extremely boneheaded language. I'm sorry if I'm not as clear as I used to be. It is <i>I</i> who should have just rethought the whole thing before hitting save. Anyway, here's a hopefully clear recap of what I think: 1) While WP:SOFTWARE is just a proposed guideline, it's on a solid ground, has stood a long time, and will likely one day be accepted as a content guideline without much controversy. It is already a de-facto rule for many. 2) About the "unchallenged" bit: I was only referring to the criterion on free/open source software that's included in Linux distributions or like. It has been around for a long time; one might surmise it would have been scrapped earlier if it doesn't work. 3) Yes, the current article sucks and has little sources, and could use some expansion that's based on the game itself and other sources, not just a brief blurb that you can find on any Linux game site. <i>However,</i> if Boson appears to be included in Linux dists, it's a notable software and we should have an article about it, so even if we delete the article now, it should be without further prejudice in case someone else decides to write an article that isn't quite this stub-like. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 22:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwolf</a>, I wouldn't say that the free software notability sections of <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> aren't challenged - just look at the discussion page.&#160;:) I'm one of those who disagrees that inclusion in a Linux distribution is an indicator of notability, especially with community supported distributions - any project maintainer with a bit of dedication a can create a tarball or a .deb or a RPM and get it included in a distribution. In a similar fashion, ratings like popcon are misleading because there is a certain number of packages that everybody uses, and then tons of packages each compete for a tiny number of installs. Boson had 180 installs at #8085. If they had had 10 more installs, they would have come in at #7871, and 10 less installs, they would have topped out at #8335. If I came and tried to push a binary shareware package that only had 180 downloads, I would be laughed off the wiki - this is really no different, except that the numbers can be sorted and put on a list. That said, its definitely verifiable, and since there is no official software policy, I can't argue against something that passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, so I remain <b>Neutral</b>. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 23:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yep, and that's why it should be important to explain what I think is notable in relation to popcon rating. These days, I interpret it simply like this: Anything higher than 10000 is (often debatably) notable. Anything below is probably not. Anything lower than 15000-20000 is probably chaff. I would not look too much at the install numbers, though - they're meaningless in itself and only tell how many of popcon users installed the package. We also have to remember that not all of Debian users participate in the popcon, we can only assume it's enough to form a representative sample (if it were not, Debian would scrap the whole thing as a completely unreliable costly system). <a href="../../../f/r/e/FreeCiv_b917.html" title="FreeCiv">FreeCiv</a> at #7662 and has 200 or so installs - <i>and</i> has been featured in a number of magazines and everyone knows about it. And by "challenged the criterion", I mean "propose something better than we already have and see if it sticks". We need <i>something</i> to gauge the popularity of free software that doesn't depend on marketing budget. I agree this rule is fuzzy can lead to excess leniency, but we've got to have something to go by <i>now</i>. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 09:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I started all of this and I appreciate your input. I am more interested in bringing to WP notable architectural developements around Union Square, including those related to gentrification of the areas and also to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rockwell_ec7a.html" title="David Rockwell">David Rockwell</a> and his firm The Rockwell Group. He is based in Union Square, is highly respected in the field, and has done now both North corners of Union Square (the high-end bakery, Tisserie, and the W Union Square hotel.) I have brought the article back to a short stub stage. It is, from the beginning, an architecture-stub. I agree that background info on the business behind Tisserie should not be allowed, but the project is an outstanding piece of Rockwelliana. I am reposting the picture Rockwell interior design.--Gkklein 23:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I know almost nothing about architecture, but it sounds like you want an article about <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rockwell_ec7a.html" title="David Rockwell">David Rockwell</a> or the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockwell_Group_3425.html" title="Rockwell Group">Rockwell Group</a> instead. I'd suggest working on such an article, and possibly redirecting Tisserie there, if you intend the content here to be primarily about the architecture and not the bakery Tisserie. Currently though the David Rockwell article's notability is also questionable since there are no cited reliable sources. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> 23:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It is one thing to argue that KeenSpot is a self-publisher when it comes to the website. (Highly questionable even then, since KeenSpot does not indiscriminately let anybody publish their work via their website) The book, however, is another matter entirely. KeenSpot is not an indiscriminate publisher of whatever someone pays them to publish, which is what the above text is attempting to address. It clearly does not fall into the category of self-published, as an entity separate from the creator is responsible for the publishing of the book. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 22:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've never encountered this term even though I'm earning an MA in international studies and development. However, this doesn't necessarily mean its not a valid concept so I did a quick search. At first glance the term seems quite common when googled, however virtually all the links that come up apply to the "Building Block Theory" of genetics, the "Building Block Theory" of language and a Building Block Theory of psychology. I, however, did not find anything referring to a Building Block Theory in the areas of international development or nation building, which is what this article discusses. The only 'source' I found was the one cited in the article. The source is a brief paper by the UN, however it doesn't explicity refer to this theory. It does mention the concept of "building blocks" as a relatively new and novel policy approach and, at one point, menionts "Building Block" theory, with the quotations around 'building block,' but not theory, which implies that it was a neologism coined to encompass this new way of thinking. However, I would wager that this neologism never caught on seeing as there are no other sources. I, of course, may be wrong but unless someone can provide proper sources this really needs to go. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:06, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>No consensus</b>. From the discussion here it looks like there is some serious skepticism that this can be made into a viable article, but enough people willing to give it some more time to be worked into an encyclopedic article to stay the delete button for now. The current article is already clearly further developed than the previously deleted article. I suspect this article will be back on AfD in the relatively near future if it doesn't progress soon, but for now it gets to stay. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 20:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The top of the article states that "Visualizing multiple formulae on one page may be helpful [...] after one has completed at least a basic course in physics.". In other words, this is coursework revision material, suitable for a physics course textbook. That is standard Wikibooks fare, and <i>Wikibooks already has this</i>.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I still say this list is unmaintainable, listcruft, and unencyclopedic. What constitutes "physics"? You seem to be including only classical mechanics. Does it include <a href="../../../r/a/o/Raoult%27s_Law_3008.html" title="Raoult's Law">Raoult's Law</a>, which is generally considered part of chemistry? What about <a href="../../../o/h/m/Ohm%27s_Law_3547.html" title="Ohm's Law">Ohm's Law</a>? Quantum mechanics? Fluid mechanics? <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bragg%27s_Law_f088.html" title="Bragg's Law">Bragg's Law</a>? String theory? Astrophysics? You've included things like the ideal gas law without stating it only holds reasonably true for noble gases at low temperatures. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 04:27, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> That's cause it's not done yet. I'm sure that eventually it will have to be cut down greatly, to include only the most important equations from each area. As for the <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideal_gas_law.html" title="Ideal gas law">ideal gas law</a>, it'll be marked as only holding for ideal gasses when I get to it. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 04:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>... for now. As it is, it's a little jumbled and difficult to read, and therefore not a good quick reference.

Perhaps not as deadly serious in tone as other articles -- more a collection of interesting, related facts -- but still a decent list. One might say: "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information," but that article is not indiscriminate, and while this one might be <i>now</i>, it just needs time to be pared down. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 04:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. per nom/ above comments. Trigonometric identities are a very specific topic. You wouldn't make a "list of mathematics formulas" page would you? This list is grossly incomplete, has no context, and is useless for people who want to learn physics.

<li><b>comment</b> - perhaps this might be a good reference for kids taking the regents exam (even though it doesn't have electricity &amp; magnetism, waves &amp; sound, optics, or modern physics), but are such laundry lists encyclopedic? I agree that this page would be very hard to maintain/ organize and standardize. Should Newton's second law be in differential form? Is "Momentum is the amount of mass moving" a good definition? These issues can be fixed, but there will be more. Even with a lot of work, trying to achieve the goal of "quick reference", will this page ever be useful? For me, if I want to know a formula, I will search for that specific topic, so I can understand the formula, and not just see it. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanski14_d77d.html" title="User:Danski14">Danski14</a> 06:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have seen lists of equations in print encyclopedias. So it makes some sense to me for this page to exist here. At the least, I find the argument that similar pages exists in Wikibooks to be most inadequate due to those lists being nowhere hear as cmoprehensive as this one already is. IMO, if this page can be referenced from other pages, then it belongs here. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those lists are almost certainly not the same as this list. Their contents almost certainly have more in common with one another than just being formulae used somewhere in the field of physics. Furthermore: Your reason for finding the argument inadequate is spurious. Firstly, that someone can link to an article is not exclusive to Wikipedia. We have interwiki links in many articles. Indeed, there are two right at the top of this very page, and two more further down. Secondly, as pointed out above, this list isn't comprehensive, contrary to your assertion. A comprehensive list would be so broad as to be useless. The idea that one can keep it to just "important" formulae is founded entirely upon sand, since the only workable definitions of "important" are either "important to physics topic X", in which case the mathematics actually belong in the encyclopaedia article that deals with that physics topic, or "part of the crib sheet in school curriculum Y", in which case they belong in the relevant textbook for that curriculum on Wikibooks. If you think that the textbooks in Wikibooks can be improved, then improve them, and encourage any other editors who want to write textbook content to do the same. Wikibooks is a wiki. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I find the demand that this article contain every physics equation to be both unfair and unrealistic. It seems to me that as this article grows, it can be split itnto sublists as needed, which only the most important entries from the sublist maintained here. IMO, this particular article is off to a very good start, which is why the deletion request is being strongly contested. Given that it seems to be headed in a good direction, I say that we should keep it and see how it develops. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 16:12, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The "demand" is inherent in the list's scope, as given by its title and introduction. You find that scope, when it is pointed out to you, to be "unrealistic". Therefore I suggest that you think about the article again in light of that. As I've already pointed out, any constraints (such as the "importance" criterion that you vaguely mentioned before, but didn't define) to "realistic" lists lead either to content that belongs in an article about a specific physics topic, or in an examination crib sheet. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>New opinion - <b>Weak keep</b> if not transwiki. This article has not been improved on in a week. An energetic and ongoing attempt to catalog the important equations of physics is one thing. The current article as the best that can be created at this time is another. It is a good list, and should at least be transwikied if it is not retained in Wikipedia. I will support keeping the article at this time to permit it to be built up more and prosified somewhat. If nothing of the sort happens soon, then I will support its being tranwikied. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> in some Wikimedia project, whether Wikipedia or another. It is useful to have an article (or book or whatever) with a large, useful set of formulas in a consistent notation and with a useful organization. Earlier objections: "Unmaintainable." Why do you say that? What about a list of formulas makes it unmaintainable? There are books with formulas inside their covers; their publishers can and do maintain them, and in fact, little change from edition to edition to edition establishes that nearly no maintaining is needed. "What constitutes a "physics" formula?" The authors are answering that by editing the article, which they could do a lot more efficiently if they didn't have to face two deletion proposals and an Articles for Deletion debate. "What are the variables used the formulas below?" They're explained in the article. "What's their significance?" That's explained in articles to which this list links. "This is just an indiscriminate list." No, it discriminates very carefully: to be an entry in the list, an item must be a physics formula. "Wikipedia is not a crib sheet for a physics exam." Is that policy? Wikipedia is not an article on any topic, so how is this an argument against an article? "How can this ever contain every physics formulae?" Must it? Does or must the article on physics contain every fact about physics? This information belongs in a Wikimedia project. A link to it from <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">Physics</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanics.html" title="Mechanics">Mechanics</a>, and other major articles will let readers get to it just as easily whether it is on Wikipedia or Wikibooks.

<p><i>it discriminates very carefully: to be an entry in the list, an item must be a physics formula.</i> — That argument is clearly based upon the false premise that there are only a few formulae in physics. That is untrue. There is a large number of such formulae, and many of them have nothing in common apart from being "in physics". "In physics" is almost as indiscriminate a criterion as "written down".</p>
<p>A <i>discriminate</i> criterion would be topic specific.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Several problems here. Foremost, as noted above, this is Wikibooks material, and already exists there (at least in some form). Wikipedia is not the CRC Handbook (we also don't keep trig tables, for example). Second, it lacks limitations that are not going to be easily resolved. There are entire textbooks about the math behind fluid dynamics, for example, not to mention quantum physics or anything more esoteric. What about derived forms? Variants with differing sets of assumptions? This article does not set boundaries, and efforts to ascribe limitations after the fact strike of original research. Similarly, third, we cannot "wait for it to be finished". In a very real sense, Wikipedia articles are <i>never</i> finished ... especially those that approach limitlessness. Finally, I'm not sure exactly what the content of the previously deleted article was, but haven't we had this discussion before? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 09:27, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The advent of calculators has rendered the trig table a rarity.

I view a long list of formulae without context to be more like the latter than the former. As a possible suggestion, however, a list of formulae by name that provides some context for each and that links to the articles in which they are discussed might be of value as a navigation tool (assuming no such list exists at current). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 04:35, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As I mentioned above, trigonometric identities are a very specific topic, but still there is a huge page dealing with them. (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_trigonometric_identities.html" title="List of trigonometric identities">List of trigonometric identities</a>) But, you wouldn't make a page called "List of mathematics equations" would you? That is basically what this page is like right now. A better title for this page would be "physics equations in elementary Newtonian mechanics" (basically regents and AP level). The only use for this page is as a <i>crib sheet</i>, and it isn't even very good for that, as it has numerous technical difficulties and does not include Electricity &amp; Magnetism, waves, optics, or any modern physics (which is most of physics). Over all, it has no context, little or no educational value or practical use. When people forget an equation and need to look it up, they will search for that specific topic. When people want to learn about an equation, they need something that relates it to nature; something with context and an explanation of the conceptual ideas involved and how the equation is used, etc. Just having the equation thrown out there leads one to a "plug and chug" mentality which gives little understanding of the underlying physical phenomena. Currently, I see two possible futures for this page: 1. delete it and merge into wikibooks or 2. Somehow reduce this page in it's size and scope (perhaps to elementary Newtonian mechanics?), and then assuming there are people who know physics willing to work on it, they will fight the ensuing edit wars, and hope that is turns out ok and is not a big confusing mess (or conversely, a pitifully incomplete indiscriminate list). Right now I am opting for 1, because I think most people involved in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_physics_a0db.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject physics">Wikiproject Physics</a> have a lot of other more important things to do then deal with this.

Beyond that, I am amenable to the possibility of transwikiing this article, but I don't think that a good case for that has been made yet. I for one want to see how this article develops before lowering the boom on it. If it integrates itself into this project readily over the next few months, then obviously it will deserve to stay. If it instead stagnates I may prefer to see it transwikied later. BTW - I also think that it would be nice if the folks who think that material belongs in Wikibooks would have as their vote "transwiki" instead of "delete". The later is a call for the total removal of this material without even trying to put it in a better place, and I totally disapprove of that. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The school is merely mentioned in these articles, the articles are not about the school, and in fact nothing is said about the school beyond being part of a list. I feel <b>Neutral</b> about this AFD, but if it stays, it's either on the strength of it's alumni or on the basis that all high schools should be included. <a href="../../../c/i/t/User%7ECiticat_8adf.html" title="User:Citicat">Citicat</a> 05:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The phrase "Porch collapse" shows up 16 times in the New York Times alone, and many times in the Chicago Tribune, as well as USATODAY and an Indianapolis paper. The phrase gets 11,600 Google hits. I added references, so now there are 12 references to stories from major newspapers where the peculiarities of porch construction, or the circumstances which have led them to deteriorate, or the circumstances which have led people to collapse them by overloading were the primary subject. These are accounts of different incidents. I left out more than are in the article where it just noted that people were killed or injured by a porch collapse without further discussion of the root causes, or how they could be prevented. Any Delete votes made before the addition of the references and the revision of the text does not really apply to the revised article, and those calling for deletion should take another look. As for strawman arguments for deletion, not too many people have been killed by coffee spills. And as for "any structure will collapse" porches are more prone to collapse and kill or injure people than, say floor of houses, for reaasons outlined in the article. If "deck collapse" were added to the article, there would be a great manmy more sources discussing the problem in depth, beside merely reporting the occurrences. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:12, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>You were apparently in the process of adding a number of sources while I was reading through the AfD comments and adding my own. For my part, I'm now willing to give the article the benefit of the doubt that incidents are considered to be part of a broader phenomenon outside of Wikipedia. By all means, incorporate deck collapse if you have sources -- porch/deck/balcony are close enough, and including is as part of the same article now (with one term redirecting to the other or both terms redirecting to a combined title) will avoid a merger in the future. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 00:26, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, so I've looked at the article again as suggested by <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> and I still say <b>delete</b>. My original objection stands; citing 12 news articles on the topic is easy (I'm sure I could find more) but equally it does not make this "phenomonen" out of the ordinary. Do it for "burst pipes", which incidentally gets 92,100 Google hits and, no doubt, hundreds of news stories.

<dd>Since when is "a coherent reason" a requirement? Sorry to be a bit confrontational, but many of the arguments on this (and on the physics formulae afd above) can be resolved by a simple move, or even a sentence in the intro. In this case, the article could be moved to "List of formulas used to calculate pi," or the intro could be adjusted to make it more clear what the criteria for inclusion were.

<li><b>Split/merge most into some other page(s)</b>. Mathematical numerical methods for approximating π are one category; physics and geometry are distinct. The former is clearly important per Gracenotes and relates (and partially restates) that section of the History page. <i>That</i> is a focused topic with clear inclusion criteria (or at least it <i>could be</i> if the intro described it as such). Maybe those parts of this page and the other one should be merged together into their own Numerical methods of approximating pi page? The physics/geometry parts of the page here see, weaker keep...more indiscriminate list-like. Area/volume/surface-area of many curvy-things involve π, what are the inclusion criteria? Appearance in relations among physical constants is a controlled class of equations, but geometry and "physics equations using it" (Coulomb's law, etc) gets less discriminating. No limit on what geometric shapes or physical relationships are included here. Coulomb's law is just a special case of inverse-squares that happens to have a constant involving π...<i>that constant</i> would be included in the "relations among physical constants". <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 09:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the more interesting things about <i>π</i> is that it figures in so many places, and equations which on their surface seem to have little to do with circles. This is a worthwhile supplement to the article on <i><a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">π</a></i> itself, and could not be merged with it without detracting from the article in chief's readability. In fact, my recommendation would be to move more equations out of the article in chief to this page. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's a small section and not inherently invalid. In fact, it's instructive to compare formulas of electromagnetism in SI and Gaussian units, to see how eliminating π in one place makes it pop up in another, like playing whack-a-mole. It could be helped by links leading to context. For example, the connection between the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the relevant theorem giving a similar relation between a function and its Fourier transform (thus the Heisenberg uncertainty principle follows automatically once you say that momentum is essentially the Fourier transform of position).--<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 04:26, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Self nomination</b> Fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> in my opinion. "Hermes cover" retrieves 742 results on Google.

<li><b>Comment</b> hmm, this seems to be something that requires a bit of expert attention. <a href="../../../e/u/l/Euler_Hermes_1519.html" title="Euler Hermes">Euler Hermes</a> seems to be a notable company, and it is possible this term is in common parlance, but the company itself is involved in a bit of an esoteric division of the insurance field, so they're not as well known as say <a href="../../../g/e/i/Geico.html" title="Geico">Geico</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Corporation_293d.html" title="Progressive Corporation">Progressive Corporation</a>. I certainly don't feel I can even figure out what this article is talking about, so it certainly needs to be rewritten. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:48, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The purpose of AfD is for us to evaluate the worthiness of the best attempts of authors to create contributions to the encyclopedia. It is not a place where we are suppose to present poorly formatted half-baked things for consideration of worthiness. They may get canned for their half-bakedness. I think you should do your best to wikify it. In so doing you will have to attempt to link it to other articles so it is not {{<a href="../../../o/r/p/Template%7EOrphan_203f.html" title="Template:Orphan">orphan</a>}}ed and categorize it. After doing so we can see how it compares to things it is categorized with and things that it is related to. I would have voted to delete this if it were not a self nomination. It may need an {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">expert-subject</a>}} in the end. However, right now if I were on <a href="../../../n/p/p/WP%7ENPP_2bb0.html" title="WP:NPP">WP:NPP</a> I would tag this with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../o/r/p/Template%7EOrphan_203f.html" title="Template:Orphan">orphan</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../u/n/c/Template%7EUncategorized_8ec2.html" title="Template:Uncategorized">Uncategorized</a>}}. I don't think a self nomination should appear here that is so poorly formatted. It would stand a better chance at surviving AfD with modest improvements. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 01:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and improve</b>.

There should also be a redirect from "Hermes guarantee", though I can well imagine that "Hermes cover" is the more common English term, Hermes guarantees are definitely notable, in my opinion. I would have to do more research but, if I recall correctly, they were a major factor in post-war German foreign trade policy and used to be managed directly by the German government, until their management was "privatized". I believe the actual guarantee itself is still backed (directly or indirectly, perhaps in the form of re-insurance) by the German government. According to the German Wikipedia article, the volume of exports covered is over EUR 19 billion (USD 25 billion ). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoson_0dfa.html" title="User:Boson">Boson</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBoson_1b2e.html" title="User talk:Boson">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Boson_b9fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Boson">contribs</a>) 08:05, 27 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>This page has a relatively tortured history on Wikipedia, namely two AfD's and a DRV, as well as other discussions regarding behaviour linked to it.</p>
<p>This is a procedural nomination, stemming from <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">Trialsanderrors</a>' desalting of this article with the concensus of deletion review. This was done so a draft, written by <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> and now located in the articlespace at this article name, could be moved into the articlespace. It gathered a concensus to relist pending possible further notability discussion at this AfD. As this is purely procedural, I <b>abstain</b> presently, not withstanding the fact I may give further opinion if I feel it is merited.</p>

<dd><b>Further note:</b> there was a not-quite-as-strong-as-the-<b>unsalt</b>-concensus-but-still-strong concensus that this probably passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and hence relisting may be moot. Whether it is or not, I felt that there is adequate reasoning to relist, as some pointed out that they purely wanted it "relisted" to get a definitive answer at DRV, and that others were wondering about potential <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> problems in addition to a discussion about notability. I have no opinion on the validity of either view presently, but they <i>should</i> be discussed, and here is a better medium than any other given what this article has been through, and how it has resurfaced (as a rewrite via DRV). If this turns into a <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">snowball</a>-style keep after a couple of days, I would encourage closing this early, given the rewrite is so dramatic. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a></b> 08:03, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I can't access the provided links to the sources, but titles like "<i>7 also-rans in governor's race chase elusive spotlight</i>" and "<i>PBCC president list final at 76</i>" and sources like "<i>Local section, page 3B</i>" always make me suspicious, so I had to rely on my own Lexis-Nexis/Newsbank search. There's quite a few scraps (45 hits total), but if I restrict the search to "Piotr Blass" in headline or first paragraph, I'm down to three. They are:
<ul>
<li>"<i>GOVERNOR WRITE-IN SEES EINSTEIN SOLUTION</i>" ← Full portrait. (Palm Beach Post, The (FL) - August 27, 2006 length: 838 words)</li>
<li>"<i>Saying he wanted to be a voice for the common people, write-in gubernatorial candidate Piotr Blass on Thursday appealed to a Palm Beach County judge to set the stage for him to participate in Monday's debate between his two more well-known opponents.</i> " ← passing mention</li>
<li>"<i>The candidates include Edward J. Foley, principal at South Area High School, a Lake Worth school for potential dropouts; Piotr Blass, a math professor at Palm Beach Atlantic College</i>" ← passing mention</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> His candidacies seem to be the heart of the notability claims. A perennial marginal/write-in candidate for various offices, with the trivial news coverage that such candidates usually get, does not look notable to me. In an open democracy, anyone can declare themselves a candidate.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Fan1967. The claims to notability are extremely weak. As mentioned, anyone in the street can declare candidacy, and it is a matter of course that these get minor news coverage. As an analogy, we don't have articles for every minor political party that runs in every election, since it is such a trivial matter to get a party registered. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 16:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is the third time I am writing this. Blass is not notable as a mathematician.

His politics is even less notable, although I am not an expert. The warning is the long-long-long section about his gubernatorial campaign which ended with his getting "eighteen votes".

This article doesn't even make clear what this claim is. Mathematician? Clearly he's nowhere near what our standards for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">academics</a> are, per above. An "early proponent of the Internet who formulated in 1987 what is believed to be one of the first high-level online math journals"? It seems the sole source for this statement is Blass himself, as conveyed to a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#The_neutral_point_of_view" title="WP:NPOV">sympathetic</a> Palm Beach Post. The vagueness of this comment (which "high-level" journal? Why 1987 when the internet goes back to the 1970's? Who are the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">prominent adherents</a> who confirm Blass's involvement?) puts this almost outside <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and certainly outside <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<li>The math journal claim is a bit odd. Certainly <a href="http://www.ulam.usm.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.ulam.usm.edu/" rel="nofollow">Ulam</a> exists and existed, the earliest reference I can find is this USENET posting from 1993<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.pacs-l/browse_frm/thread/3c9d926870b3f090/964d91f632d8f106?lnk=st&amp;q=ulam+quarterly&amp;rnum=32&amp;hl=en#964d91f632d8f106" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.pacs-l/browse_frm/thread/3c9d926870b3f090/964d91f632d8f106?lnk=st&amp;q=ulam+quarterly&amp;rnum=32&amp;hl=en#964d91f632d8f106" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> which doesn't mention Blass. Per my knowledge of such things (yes, I go back to the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bang_path.html" title="Bang path">bang path</a> days), it's entirely possible that it was the first journal in mathematics available strictly online, but I would expect he would turn up in the electronic record somewhere if he were a significant part of bringing it to life. Given other odd claims in the article, I'm not inclined to give this claim the benefit of the doubt. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't so much doubt his involvement than that the founding of the journal was a significant event. ISI Journal Report doesn't have a listing of it, JSTOR and ScienceDirect have one cite each to an Ulam Quarterly paper, Newsbank comes up with nothing. Factiva has two passing mentions in 1994, neither backing the claim that it was "the first" or even "early", and it's certainly not "high-level".

While there may be articles on those cases, unless the participants in those cases are notable <i>for other reasons</i>, there is no need for an article on the parties.

</dl>
<p>Work through this with me and let's see if we can figure this one out. Here we have a person with two careers, neither of which seem notable enough for an article. First, some metainfo:</p>
<ul>
<li>An article on this subject was speedied as nonnotable bio, recreated, speedied as repost (which was wrong, repost only applies to AfD-deleted articles), recreated. So clearly deletion of this article via speedy is contested, thus we are here.</li>
<li>It appears that the subject of the article is also the author of the article, for whatever that's worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on the content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brown was the singer/songwriter for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Misunderstood_b390.html" title="The Misunderstood">The Misunderstood</a>, who have an article, and per <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll" rel="nofollow">their entry in allmusic.com</a> certainly should, notwithstanding that Brown appears to be a major contributor and perhaps creator of the article.
<ul>
<li>But, are The Misunderstood notable enough so that any of the members deserve their own articles? They are not really a <i>very</i> notable band, so I do not think that they are. There is nothing useful in Brown's article that isn't in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Misunderstood_b390.html" title="The Misunderstood">The Misunderstood</a> article. <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Saxon_bc24.html" title="Sky Saxon">Sky Saxon</a> has an article (which I personally think he shouldn't), but then <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Seeds_1508.html" title="The Seeds">The Seeds</a> are a <i>lot</i> more notable than The Misunderstood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, there is material on Brown's later career, as a jewelry maker.
<ul>
<li>It seems clear that this material is vanity/spam, which doesn't <i>prove</i> that Brown is not notable, but is seldom a good sign. We have <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Sirikit_Navaratna_9f4e.html" title="Queen Sirikit Navaratna">this article</a> on a piece of jewelry he made (same author), and we have this: Planetary Gemologist (same author). It is as a Planetry Gemologist that Brown claims notability - but he himself wrote the Planetary Gemologist article, and recently too.</li>
<li>But then, on <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/main.html" class="external text" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">his website</a>, he claims several books (but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Astral-Gemstone-Talismans-VOOM-Designs/dp/9740716334/sr=1-1/qid=1169713247/ref=sr_1_1/105-4108581-1264432?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Astral-Gemstone-Talismans-VOOM-Designs/dp/9740716334/sr=1-1/qid=1169713247/ref=sr_1_1/105-4108581-1264432?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">the only one on Amazon</a> is listed as "self-published", and at least some of <a href="http://www.agt-gems.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=41" class="external text" title="http://www.agt-gems.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=41" rel="nofollow">the others</a> appear to be just catalogs of his jewelry) and several <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-tv.html" class="external text" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-tv.html" rel="nofollow">interviews etc. on Thai television</a>, which ought to count for something, I suppose.</li>
<li>And as an aside, <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-schools.html" class="external text" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-schools.html" rel="nofollow">claims to have founded several <i>schools</i></a>, which if true would in my opinion be the main thread on which to hang his notability - but no information beyond the bare name of the schools are given, which seems odd. Certainly founding several schools would get a bigger place in his CV, you'd think.</li>
<li>And this is all on <i>his website</i>. I didn't find any useful third-party material, although I could have missed it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It all seems a bit fishy to me. I do not think this person is notable, what do you think? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 08:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, there is hardly a quarrel with notability, certainly though with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

They even appear in one book titled "100 Greatest Psychedellic Bands", but the selection process for this list is unclear. Since RSB is the center of the draft-doging history of the band, RSB on this subject alone, is <b>notable</b>. The fact that RSB escaped to India, like many other hippies, is part of his notability, and being baptized a Hindu is very important to his character - <b>but his notability stops there</b>. His later life as a "gemologist", a spiritual profession, is worth only a blurb in his biography. Readers, may they be fans of the band or not, would probably find the story more fantastic if he doesn't bring himself down to earth with awards and accomplishments. As for the other articles of his, I have also tagged them for speedy deletion, as it only adds fluff to his own self. Rsbj66 has no need to infect Wikipedia when he has so many of his own sites at his disposal. -- <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmana_7e3b.html" title="User:Emana">Emana</a> 19:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This seems to be well referenced and I'm not seeing a lot of promotional hype etc. The award is not prominent in the article and demonstrates that he has minor notability beyond the music. I think that there is more interesting information here than can be practically merged to the article about the band. An autobio is not prohibited, although it should be a red-flag for closer scrutiny --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 21:14, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with those references are that they are mostly original research by Brown himself. Also, they lack information on how to get a hold of the source material (URL, publisher, ISBN, etc.). I know they are not there, because I asked Rsbj66 for the info when I was reformatting the page. It could be all made up. Just listing names of books don't mean that the article is well sourced and well cited. I agree that Brown does have an interesting story to tell, and doing so without following good Wikipedian practices does himself a disservice. -- <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmana_7e3b.html" title="User:Emana">Emana</a> 21:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>What award? The only awards I see are <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-awards.html" class="external text" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/rsb-awards.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and these are the kind of awards anyone should be able to pick up in return for a ride to the airport. Finalist (not winner) in one small category, by a marketing association that only <i>exists</i> to give out awards and do other marketing-type stuff, I assume. Who doesn't have a plaque like this in their cubicle? And that's the best one.

<li>The Misunderstood are extremely significant historically. Their single, "I Can Take You To The Sun", was released at the beginning of December 1966 by Philips/Fontana Records in England.. It is considered one of the first authentically "psychedelic" records, predating the first releases by Pibk Floyd and Jimi Hendrix. Legendary BBC DJ John Peel referred to it on many occasions as one of "the best records ever made." In fact, he kept a copy in a special box of records, see this article in The Times of London online: <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14932-1836864,00.html" class="external free" title="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14932-1836864,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14932-1836864,00.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In Rolling Stone (Sept 2, 2004) David Fricke wrote: "Two weeks after that September '66 session, Jimi Hendrix arrived in the UK and became all the rage, the immigrant acid king. But the Misunderstood got there first. Hear the proof." <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikestax_3a06.html" title="User:Mikestax">Mikestax</a> 18:04, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is all very good and interesting, but not quite relevant with respect to notability as meant <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">in Wikipedia</a>. For instance, in WP, "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and <b>independent of the subject itself</b> and each other" (my emphasis). So, one tries to understand if the person/event/thing has attracted external attention from magazines, book, web sites, independently from the work by the subject himself. If you list your work, it might be useful for people interested in your work, but as for notability it just amounts to "I did lot of stuff". Everybody here has done lot of stuff (books, children, pies, travels...). It remains to be seen whether the person doing this stuff is notable or not. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 14:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, You wrote, "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and <b>independent of the subject itself</b> and each other" &lt;---More than 200 magazines and newspapers have written news and praise about us, such as feature news articles in International Herald Tribune, Singapore Business Times, Asia Magazine, National Jeweler (USA), Jewelers Circular Keystone, and a list of others. We have all these published articles. Mainly, no Westerner has ever gotten so much coverage in Thai history. You ask for only a few, so in the article I list two references to international articles on our notability. So according to what you stated I DO qualify for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I see your other pages, such as by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Giuliano_c42c.html" title="Geoffrey Giuliano">Geoffrey Giuliano</a> that are 100% original research without a single reference but his one-sided self-plaise page is on Wikipedia!?&lt;---it is VERY misleading. At least everything I have written is "true" and my notability is "respectable." Please take another look at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Shaw_Brown_310c.html" title="Richard Shaw Brown">Richard Shaw Brown</a> and I give over 15 references on the page now. And it's all true and notable. Best wishes--<a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">Rsbj66</a> 15:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Richard, thanks for signalling the Giuliano article, which has been immediately tagged as possible original research, and perhaps will be proposed for deletion. You could have done so yourself! In fact, it is perhaps better for you to edit articles not directly pertaining you or your activity. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> himself has been frowned upon for having edited the article about himself. So, thanks for the material you provided. But apart from it, of course you cannot judge yourself its notability or relevance.</dd>
<dd>It seems that the general consensus is not against you. So what I suggest is, leave things alone, let people consider your article for its merits and, if you like, you are welcome to contribute to other articles! --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 16:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, who is <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikestax_3a06.html" title="User:Mikestax">User:Mikestax</a>? His name sounds awfully familar. Oh, yes, he's the guy from UT magazine. -- <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmana_7e3b.html" title="User:Emana">Emana</a> 21:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>---Mike Stax is also owner of UT Records as well as his magazine. He did a multi issue story on The Misunderstood in his Ugly Things Music Magazine, prior to which he did 4 years of research on the band, tracking down all the members and really getting the facts straight. His study is considered the full story, and may be expanded into another book on the subject. He has also written a 550 pages double screen play for a motion picture on the band and my aftermath.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to consider in my case is that during the time I played a major role in building 2 schools in India and One school in Nepal (all still running) during that time I was a fugitive from the Vietnam massacre and in India under an assumed (different) name. So it's a really strange situation where I built 3 schools but can't find credit for it in my real name. An example story of how one of the schools was built is at <a href="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/mysticarticles/nandagram.html" class="external free" title="http://www.richardshawbrown.com/mysticarticles/nandagram.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.richardshawbrown.com/mysticarticles/nandagram.html</a> and I think you might find it interesting as an adventure, worlds apart from the USA. Remember, apart from being a war objector fugative, I was a sudden Rock Star with ego, turned into a pennyless egoless monk in a stone age ashram with no electricity or running water. It was cave man style, where humility way MOST highly respected, and I was only Westerner. So it is quite a contrast from lead singer to nobody outcast. But the Point is I cannot take credit for building 3 schools because of different name and primative conditions. This was back in 1971, long before the PC, and WAY long before the WWW.--<a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">Rsbj66</a> 22:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

It remains to be explained why he (<i>or his advocates</i>) wishes to make the impression that all of his books have an english title, as if they have been translated.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I wanted to give this a chance. Sites like google have limited effectiveness in searching for people who only operate abroad. But its hard to see how the case for notability has been made. I don't know how reliable the NewAbsinthe link is, but if there were more like it, I guess I could give this a pass. One of the proponents seems to think that merely publishing a book makes one notable and lists sites that sell his books. That is not the case. In other cases, proponents have described him as an emerging writer. Perhaps he can wait until he has emerged? Right now the massive sock operation leaves a bad aftertaste.<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 03:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>If I'm the proponent cited as saying that a published book makes one notable (there's another one who does more, but I was the first one), I feel I should clarify my position. I'd misread the nomination as suggesting that the <i>books</i> were unpublished, rather than the <i>plays</i>, about which I can also find nothing online. Obviously if a book is available online, it's been published. That said, as I understand the nomination now I see that the mere existence of the books wasn't really in question - and neither does it automatically confer notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A 'review', as you define it, is essentially nothing but a de facto admission of a work's existence. A review of 'Animal Farm' saying: "I can confirm this book is real; is made primarily of paper; was written by a man originally called Eric and is mostly about pigs" would not have gained Orwell an admission, and the reviews you source review nothing but the size of the book. Useful only if you're looking to buy a paperweight or a draft excluder. I still say <b>weak keep</b> on the Author page (and not the individual play/novel pages) provided there's an agricultural scale cull of the pooterism &amp; puffery.<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScandrett_b5f9.html" title="User:Scandrett">Scandrett</a> 02:32, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, although I'll admit to not quite following what's going on here. A brief Google using the Turkish dotted-I spelling throws up <a href="http://kitap.antoloji.com/kisi.asp?CAS=33853" class="external text" title="http://kitap.antoloji.com/kisi.asp?CAS=33853" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, which seems to verify the existence of "Roses under Paris" ("Paris'in Altındaki Güller", I believe, although my Turkish is pretty bad) and probably others as well, so he seems to have published something at least. Whether or not this is a vanity press is something I can't comment on, since it requires more language ability than I have. The fact that the article has claimed that an unpublished book is his magnum opus is neither here nor there, since it's a content issue which is curable by editing rather than deletion. In terms of the English titles, I'm not sure what the normal policy is regarding books with foreign language titles, although I'd point to <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Search_of_Lost_Time_a227.html" title="In Search of Lost Time">this tome</a> as evidence that perhaps it's legitimate to keep the titles as is, as long as the books have been published. On the surface, though, he seems to qualify as notable enough in Turkey, which I'd say makes him sufficiently notable here as well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article,When we check the page <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/alumni/pubs/nineties.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.essex.ac.uk/alumni/pubs/nineties.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essex.ac.uk/alumni/pubs/nineties.htm</a>, we can see that the author has Master and Doctorate degrees in Economics from the University of Essex. Therefore, in the infobox, it is fair to write "Economist" as one of his occupations along with novelist and playwright... So I am not agree with the user Melanicool to remove the "economist" label. That info was correct. If you also see the page <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=113181" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=113181" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=113181</a>, the page rank on the right, it is fair to say that author has certain notability. Also, as we all know that PEN Clubs are important and serious literary organisations. In Turkish PEN's official web site, <a href="http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56" class="external free" title="http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56" rel="nofollow">http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56</a>, we see author's some works published expilicitly in English. I believe this gives us some opinion that though he is an emerging writer, he has already some notability. I know from a friend living in the USA that author's novel Roses Underneath Paris can be found in certain bookshops in New York. The novel is not in English, it seems to be a great paradox, but it is not, because the book is read by the Turkish community living in the USA. Same applies to London or Münich as well. So I believe we must be fair on judging about the notabilty... We should also bear in mind that, checking his life story, author has lived about 9 years in England and he writes books where the events pass in England. So he is pro-England or England-lover writer as well... even only for this reason, I believe that an article about him deserves to be kept, improved and enriched... 25 january 2007.</li>

I think there exist a germen internet book site as well, wehere especially Turkish-Germans can buy his or other Turkisk books.<br />
I have also seen that all the information in the article is verifiable. For instance in the article it mentions Absinthe: New European Writing Journal. I made a search on it. You can see his name appears in <a href="http://www.absinthenew.com/pages/issue2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.absinthenew.com/pages/issue2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.absinthenew.com/pages/issue2.html</a>. In the article it mentions about AQT competition. I found information in this web page: <a href="http://undergroundtransit.blogspot.com/2005_04_10_undergroundtransit_archive.html" class="external free" title="http://undergroundtransit.blogspot.com/2005_04_10_undergroundtransit_archive.html" rel="nofollow">http://undergroundtransit.blogspot.com/2005_04_10_undergroundtransit_archive.html</a> that his play became finalist. In short, all the information in the article is surely verifiable. About Magnum Opus, I have not seen such a thing; if there was, most probably it was an editing mistake. As user BigHaz said, it's a content issue which is curable easily by editing rather than deletion. I am sure his books will soon be published in England as well. Wikipedia is a paradise of information; we must not delete, but we must verify and edit any kind of information if found wrong. We must also know that no one can ever promote himself through wikipedia, but only by the good quality of his or her works. I have read his book Antiquary Arago's Diary (original title Antikacı Arago'nun Günlüğü), I believe he is good quality writer and he knows England very well. So my vote is to keep the article strongly.Faydunnaway</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, certainly notable in Turkey, the question is if it isn't a case for Turkish Wikipedia ... as for will be published soon in England: Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, we have things that happened and that are verifiable in an Encyclopedia <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 15:20, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article, every writer has her or his advocates, that is quite normal. I have read some parts of author's play Master William Shakespeare, which is available in <a href="http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56" class="external free" title="http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56" rel="nofollow">http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56</a>. He seems to be a serious and good writer. What use to delete the article about him which has obviously correct information? I believe that English wikipedia users can and should benefit from the information and literary material given in the article. We must also keep in mind the considerable effort made to create this article. I suggest we respect the effort and the work. So my vote is definitely to keep the article... deleting is an easy way, we should be helpers not the terminators.good day.Jabbar. 27 January 2007, 18.07</li>

<li>I shall elaborate a bit myself. First of all, the person which is object of the article we are discussing shares 8 or 9 of the 10 features attributed to the average Wikipedian. Secondly, countering systemic bias means countering the tendency to consider a major Turkish (or Italian, or Somali, or...) writer de facto less important than a minor English-speaking one, not allowing a minor one (independently from his nationality) to advertise freely, should this be the case here. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 23:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - As a tr.wp admin and probably the first reader of the WP article on him, I would like to provide you guys some information about this issue. First of all, it is Mehmet Murat İldan himself, who has been writing all these articles. So it's an autobiography. I personally don't see WP:AUTO as a reason to delete an article, as long as the person in question is notable. In that case i think he is, even though i've never heard of him in my life before his Wikiactivity. He is definitely not famous in Turkey, that i can assure you. But as an author of several books, i personally would consider him as notable. He has several awards, books published by Ministry of Culture etc. He clearly speaks very highly of himself and all his contributions are about himself, but my tendency to stay neutral no matter what pushes me to accept this person as notable. The article can be neutralized or stubbed.--<a href="../../../v/i/t/User%7EVito_Genovese_5339.html" title="User:Vito Genovese"><font color="#008000"><b>Vito Genovese</b></font></a> 11:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If you need an information about Turkish playwrights, where an earth are you going to look at? Don't you see that Wikipedia is a wonderful opportunity to get information?

<li>An administrator at the Norwegian (bokmål) Wikipedia noticed the concerted effort of spreading this biographical article to a great number of Wikipedias, and believing the effort to be self-promotion from an artist who probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's requirements for notability in any language made an extra effort of countering the apparent spam in like fashion.

So, right now, I'd say <b>Weak Delete</b> unless there's definite proof that these books are indeed published or something along those lines. If this is indeed a case of vanispam, the author must be strongly cautioned to not touch the article too much further, but if the article subject's merits are okay, then there's really no reason to delete the article anyway. User conduct is not grounds for article deletion. So, basically, improve or let it go.

<li>I would like to give additional information about the library records as a proof of the books existence. Here is the National Library records.</li>

It should be 1965. But in the government record it is written as 1956. Please also check the spelling Ormanýnýn hayaletleri (Ghost's of Forest) The correct spelling should be Ormanın Hayaletleri. Thus, when you search the books in the google or in other search engines or even in databases, because of the wrong records, spelling mistakes it is not always easy to find a book in a quick search. National Library of Turkey Database in Ankara is the largest database. Please check the following page: <a href="http://kitap.mkutup.gov.tr:4500/ALEPH/tur/NLT/NLT/NLT/FIND-A?FIND=T%DCM+ALANLAR&amp;BASE=T%FCm+Kay%FDtlar&amp;VALUE=murat+ildan" class="external text" title="http://kitap.mkutup.gov.tr:4500/ALEPH/tur/NLT/NLT/NLT/FIND-A?FIND=T%DCM+ALANLAR&amp;BASE=T%FCm+Kay%FDtlar&amp;VALUE=murat+ildan" rel="nofollow">National Library of Turkey Database</a> You will see only 6 books of the author. But he has more than 10 books published. We don't see them in the database, because databases are unfortunatley not updated and there exists several spelling mistakes... Anyway, this is my final comment on this issue. You can delete or keep the article, it is your decision. I hope that people from different countries will create different articles on the Contemporary Turkish Literature and contemporary Turkish Writers so that literature world can be enriched further.

<li><b>Comment</b> I wonder if it is a coincidence that the last two, very indignant, remarks come from unregistered, unsigning editors with very similar IPs: in one case this is the unique contribution to Wikipedia, in the other there is also a minor editing to the İldan article. I won't comment about the racism accusations. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 16:14, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Are we deleting this article because it is self promotion or because he's not notable? I mean, if the article was created by an established user, would you want it to be deleted? If an established user re-creates the article two months after the closure of this Afd, would the article get deleted and why? (WP:CSD A7?) What i don't understand is, why would self promotion be a reason to delete an article. Why don't we focus on notability and just neutralize the article? Does notability refer to how famous the person in question is or does it refer to the work he/she has done to deserve an article? I simply don't understand why we keep an article about Prince Harry's girlfriend and delete this one (or recreations in the future)? Not that i support this guy just because he's from Turkey (i got so close to blocking him on tr.wp), but i don't see any reason to relinquish information, just because it's been used for self promotion. --<a href="../../../v/i/t/User%7EVito_Genovese_5339.html" title="User:Vito Genovese"><font color="#008000"><b>Vito Genovese</b></font></a> 19:04, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Things are actually getting muddled by several non-pertinent factors: the suspect of self-promotion, the sudden appearance of the articles in several wikipedias, the comments by possible sockpuppets, the accusations of racism... All of which heats the debate and distracts from the actual issues of possible non-notability and possible lack of reliable sources. Nevertheless, some good points have been made. For instance, somebody pointed out the "Encyclopedia of Turkish Authors" <a href="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313D4AF1EF75F7A7968AD2159C2926A9E50" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313D4AF1EF75F7A7968AD2159C2926A9E50" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> of the Turkish Ministry of Culture, in which İldan does not appear. It allegedly includes the 2023 "owners of the most important works in Turkish language". So it appears that İldan is, at best, the 2024th most notable Turkish writer, which does not appear very notable among Turkish writers (we are not even thinking of comparing him with writers in other languages). This is just to exemplify some of the points made about his notability. Then again, these points must carefully be found amid other less relevant arguments. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 20:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think you are talking about this page. <a href="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D3130239EEA0FCDF038BE96AF061DFC99903" class="external text" title="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D3130239EEA0FCDF038BE96AF061DFC99903" rel="nofollow">Turkish Authors</a> I have just made a quick look at it. Özen Yula is not in the list, but Ahmet Önel is in the list. Özen Yula is a famous Playwright in İstanbul... I am saying to you that that list is definitely not correct, not complete, politically biased, since Fethullah Gülen's name is there!... Also it is not the list of the Famous Authors, but it is the list of Turkish Authors. Do you also know that Ministry of Culture is no longer printing theatre plays? Why? because the government does not like theatre!.. Oh, dear friend there are millions of things you don't know about Turkey, about what is going on in Turkey... any way, I will sleep now! But before sleep I will give you one more name, probably you may know him İsmail Cem, former Minister, died few days ago. he has many books, but he is not in the list! . He is not writing literary books, rather political books. But the list above already a mixed list. Good day to you... Yours sincerely... Tagorgora</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i><b>COMMENT</b></i> - I have read some of the discussions above. First of all, there exists neither racism nor prejudice against the Turks or what so ever. I believe there is confusion here. If you see the notability criteria for people in the following page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" rel="nofollow">notability</a>], things will be clearer. It says that “The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person” From the above web sites we can see that he has at least 10 books published. He has published about Galileo Galilei, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei_%28play%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei_%28play%29" rel="nofollow">Galileo Galilei</a>] , since Bertolt Brecht this is the second play ever written on Galileo’s life. Can we call this a trivial publication? There exists no play on William Shakespeare’s life. See this page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_William_Shakespeare" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_William_Shakespeare" rel="nofollow">Master William Shakespeare</a>], are we going to call this publication trivial and rubbish? Has anybody tried to read the play? Why not? Do you think that high literature is something garbage? Please see the page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi_%28play%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi_%28play%29" rel="nofollow">Gandhi</a>], this is the only comprehensive Gandhi play in the world, no one can assert othervise; are we going to say that this Gandhi play is trivial publication? Another criteria says “Published authors who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.” Büyünün Gözleri (Eyes of Magic) Play, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_of_Magic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_of_Magic" rel="nofollow">Eyes of Magic</a>], obtained a National award in Istanbul. Do you think that it is easy to get a national award where hundreds of participants enter the competition? Is it something trivial? Now please see this page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabahattin_Ey%C3%BCbo%C4%9Flu" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabahattin_Ey%C3%BCbo%C4%9Flu" rel="nofollow">Sabahattin Eyuboğlu</a>]. You will probably say who the hell this Sabahattin Eyuboğlu is. He is a very important Turkish writer, and when I read the artcile I have seen nothing about Shakespeare and I added that info, added Shakespeare link as well. He has translated Macbeth, Timon of Athens, Hamlet, Julius Caesar, most wonderful translations… We have loved Shakespeare through his incredibly beautiful translations. Now, if you look at his article, a very short article, so he means an unimportant writer? We can not get anything from the length of the article. It is not the length but the quality matters. Unfortunately we don’t have much time. We have works to do. There are hundreds of Turkish related articles to be improved. There are also so many misonformation as well. Now see this page, [<a href="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" class="external text" title="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" rel="nofollow">Mehmet Murat ildan</a>] in Magyar language. It is clear that a Magyar guy translated this page. It probably says Murat ildan is a Turkish writer. And there is also Bibliografi. Where is the spam here? Is the play Master William Shakespeare spam? what is the spam here? I see only a very limited info on the writer. Are we going to call this a spam, a garbage? What is your knowledge about literature? Have you ever tried to read the writers one of the plays in English, available in different sites. See the page [<a href="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" class="external text" title="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" rel="nofollow">Mehmet Murat İldan</a>] in Latin language page. Do you call this a spam? It says Murat İldan is a Turkish writer. Galileo text is given there. So is it the play spam, or rubbish? Do you think that it is easy to be a writer in Turkey. Burhan Günel is a famous (and notable) writer in Turkey. His story books are printed in 2000 copies. May be you find it funny? Have you ever heard Burhan Günel? No! check the google now, you will see only 992! he is 60 years old. Now see this Turkish short CV: Ödülleri: Kültür Bakanlığı Çocuk Öyküleri Başarı</li>
</ul>
<p>Ödülü (1979), Türk Dil Kurumu Ödülü (1981), Mehmet Ali Yalçın Roman Ödülü (1981 ve 1982), Nevzat Üstün Öykü Birinci Başarı Ödülü (1983), Ömer Seyfettin Öykü Ödülü (1994), Yunus Nadi Roman Ödülü (1997), Yunus Nadi Öykü Ödülü (2000). He has at least 6 very important Literary Awards! But according to google he is 992! There are lots of important Turkish writers that even most Turkish people don't know because they are not advertised, because big publishing houses are supporting many trivial, magazinal type books and writers. I am avery disappointed and sad about the above discussions!.. They mentioned above writers dictionary. They are all biased dictionaries. There is another dictionary where 4000 writer names exist. We don't have 4000 writers, I am talking about literature! Turkish Playwrights number is not more than 100! You can check from the playwrights association in ıstanbul by sending them an e-mail. What about living novelists? May be 200, but not more!.. Being famous is something to do with advertisement, somethimg to do with money, not with quality. Not every good writer has money, or dark powers for advertisements... What is the conclusion? The writer in question is notable but not famous in Turkey! Who cares about being famous? are we going to be interested in the works or whether the person in question is famous? Ask 1000 people in the streets of Turkey, They will not know about Sabahattin Eyuboğlu... Some says His Hamlet is even better than the original language, it so poetical... goodnight. Tagorgora.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Now see this page, [Mehmet Murat ildan] in Magyar language [<a href="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" class="external text" title="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" rel="nofollow">Mehmet Murat ildan</a>].

I know this is nitpicking, but the whole thing just stinks to high heaven of a concerted, and conceited, attempt to carpet bomb every wiki in existence into submission. First of all I thought this was just simple vanity, more and more I'm starting to think hoax. Surely no-one could be so self-regarding to need about 15 sock-puppets and daily postings on AfD just to prop up their insecurity? Also, accusations of racism are a very cheap shot &amp; need to be nipped in the bud right away.<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScandrett_b5f9.html" title="User:Scandrett">Scandrett</a> 00:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment</i> I have just added World Short Story Day article in the Wikipedia which was proposed by the Turkish Authors Association (TAA) in Ankara. About the article on Mehmet Murat İldan, I would like to give a brief info on him which is that the author is a member of TAA, <a href="http://www.edebiyatcilardernegi.org.tr/uyelerimiz2.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.edebiyatcilardernegi.org.tr/uyelerimiz2.asp" rel="nofollow">Turkish Authors Association in Ankara</a>. His name is written as Mehmet M. Ildan in the list. Membership number is 704. The association is a liberal sided organisation, some of his members prisioned in the past years. Another info that I know about the writer is that one of his plays, Tanrı'ya Yolculuk, Journey to God banned in Istanbul on the grounds that society is not ready for this play. The play considers the science as the sole Prophet. It is anti-religuous but pro-God play. In his theatre articles, this particular one <a href="http://www.tiyatrom.com/murat_ildan_57.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tiyatrom.com/murat_ildan_57.htm" rel="nofollow">Thoughts on the banns in theatre</a> writer explains his opinions on such matters. but I don't know whether an english version of the article can be found on the web.

<li><b>Comment</b>: For god's sake, what's this longish debate about someone who has <b>10 books published</b>? Isn't that enough criteria for notability? Who cares about the writer of the article? even if he wrte it himself... it doesn't say he's the bigest turkish writer - to have POV in it. It says he has X number of books published. So why are we still debating about NOTABILITY? I speak turkish and read the turkish sources. He exists. he has those books published, he is a member of the PEN club. what else do you need for notability? I do say there IS racim against Turkish articles going on in enwiki, and quite frankly I don't really know why. what's your problem with turkish literature? that you can't read it? that's no excuse for deleting something, just because you <i>can't read it</i>. 100 million speakers of the Turkish language CAN. --<a href="../../../t/e/e/User%7ETeemeah_4db1.html" title="User:Teemeah">Teemeah</a> <a href="../../../t/e/e/User_talk%7ETeemeah_7a70.html" title="User talk:Teemeah"><small>Gül Bahçesi</small></a> 20:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page had a prod tag which was uncontested, but the creator of the article has not edited since October and is probably unaware of the concerns that have been raised, but he obviously put a lot of effort into it and I don't think it's fair for it to be deleted solely for lack of attention, so I moved it here for discussion purposes.

<li>As it now stands, the table and the title of the page are showing different things, 'List of countries by ratio of carbon dioxide emissions to GDP per capita' for the title, and 'List of Countries by Ratio of Emissions per capita to GDP per capita' for the table.</li>
<li>If you divide 'X per capita' by 'Y per capita' you get X/Y, in this case carbon dioxide emissions to GDP, a list for which already exists <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_ratio_of_GDP_to_carbon_dioxide_emissions_8a11.html" title="List of countries by ratio of GDP to carbon dioxide emissions">here</a> albeit the inverse, i.e. Y/X.</li>
<li>The table of the title, 'List of countries by ratio of carbon dioxide emissions to GDP per capita' makes no sense, as if would be an 'efficiency per capita', which would lead to countries with a large population looking like they were doing well compared to a small country.</li>

<dd>"Descriptive" in a POV way, describing a non-notable company with no citations. The linked article about an OXFAM auction of a Keira Knightly dress doesn't even mention Gold Group, not that it would be sufficiently notable had they been mentioned. And I'm not sure to whom you refer when you talk about "people with their own descriptive bios posted on wikipedia." I have no such thing, and the only thing I can find on Cornell Rockey is a User Page, outside of the "main" namespace, completely appropriate and non-contestable... and he didn't "call this page out." I did. He merely voted as a disinterested party. I should hope more people would do so, but few really seem to care about this non-notable entity.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 17:00, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article seems pretty clearly to be a hoax. None of the "sources" actually say anything and my own independent work is unable to verify any claims made in this article. My skepticism is furthered by the fact that I am aware of an area college student of the same name.

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems it's been nominated for deletion because Wikipedia is not the place to introduce one's own theories or philosophies. We are supposed to create articles on ideas, theories, and phenomena that exist outside of our own research, and to give clear references to published sources. We're not even supposed to draw basic conclusions that haven't been published elsewhere. For instance, if someone printed an article demonstrating "A," and someone else printed an article demonstrating "B," then we still can't say "A supports B," or "A contradicts B," unless someone somewhere has made this sythesis in print... and we have to give a citation. Examine the links given above to the policies on Original Research and Essays, and also consider whether this meets the requirements of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral Point Of View</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>. <a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 13:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Completely non notable. "Damn Dirty Apes" gives many Google hits (many for a PC game of the same name, which also makes searching for Damn Dirty Apes plus World Of Warcraft difficult), but Damn Dirty Apes plus either of the authors gives only two relevant hits, one of them the homepage of the comic. <a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22Damn+Dirty+Apes%22+capps+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22Damn+Dirty+Apes%22+capps+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> <a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22Damn+Dirty+Apes%22+rumpf+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22Damn+Dirty+Apes%22+rumpf+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.

Per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> they don't seem substantial enough to sustain individual articles.

<li>To clarify, I don't think the drinks are important enough to have a list article or I'd have done it myself, but if people want a list article I wouldn't oppose it. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> Kanar as it only really impacted one series (DS9). But <b>Keep</b> Blood Wine, Romulan ale and Synthehol (especially Syntehol) as those beverages are mentioned and featured frequently throughout the Trek franchise. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into a single article on Star Trek beverages, or life in the Trek future, as that would probably be more useful at this point, and there's enough substance to their use in the series to keep at least some of these. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Even lumped together, I don't think "Star Trek beverages" would meet the threshold for notability. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 17:41, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, that might be why it would be worth considering an article on life in the Trek future covering a variety of things like foods, drinks, even clothing. There's certainly enough hmm, widespread coverage of Star Trek that a variety of minor subtopics can fall under its umbrella. It'd be one thing if a substance only appeared in one episode, but with say, Sythehol, there's <a href="http://www.livescience.com/scienceoffiction/060412_synthehol.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.livescience.com/scienceoffiction/060412_synthehol.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=593" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=593" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> to give it real world context. Might even have been something in that William Shatner show on the History channel. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My only concern with that is <i>because</i> there is such widespread coverage of "Life in the Trek future," any such article could become <a href="../../../l/e/n/WP%7ELENGTH_908f.html" title="WP:LENGTH">very long</a>, necessitating section splits, and leaving us eventually back where we are right now. <a href="../../../w/l/2/User%7EWl219_bdc1.html" title="User:Wl219">Wl219</a> 01:38, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to separate species' articles per EEMelton. Do not delete this content outright. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 19:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into something. Kanar can go as far as I care, but Kligon Blood Wine etc. are terms well known among lots of people and therefore deserve an article as having had an impact on the Real world.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>.

<li><b>Merge</b> (and create redirects afterward) to List of fictional food and beverages in Star Trek.

<p>This article is inappropriate for inclusion for at least another eleven months, and it seems to fails a grand total of three policies. First, it runs counter to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, because it is covering future events that don't have an adequate amount of information provided about them as of yet. Secondly, it contains original research (forbidden by <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:no original research</a>), because the article is based entirely on assumptions cobbled together from facts which haven't been connected by <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">wikipedia:independent sources</a>. Finally, the bulk of it is unverifiable, therefore (or is it thereby?) conflicting with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:verifiability</a>. While some of the facts are verifiable, the ones directly about the speech are not.</p>
<p>It has prodded and deprodded by others. Finally, there are zero sources. While that isn't a reason for deletion itself, it's a sign this wasn't exactly written from published sources - backing up my previous three statements about the fact that it is in conflict with Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 17:34, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. It seems fine as a template to me. Are we to delete articles on the 2008 presidential election and 2008 nominating conventions too? Edit away, but no real reason in my mind to delete. However, if there's any possibility it won't occur, then delete. But I think it will since Bush is president until Jan. 2009. Certainly he won't give one in '09, but I'm nearly certain he will in '08, with a year left to go in his term. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 21:07, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This article does not violate the "not a crystal ball" policy, which allows a future event "if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include 2008 U.S. presidential election, and 2012 Summer Olympics." The State of the Union address, mandated by the Constitution, is as certain to occur as the presidential election, and will take place months earlier. It garners press coverage worldwide and so is obviously notable. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 01:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Counter Argument:</b> Just to point out that since Armagetron Advanced has superceeded the original Armagetron project, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armagetron.html" title="Armagetron">Armagetron</a> entry redirects to the Armagetron Advanced entry. Since Armagetron was included on many linux distribution install cd sets, it counts as having distributed through a well known medium independent of the Authours, as per the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Wikipedia Notability</a> definition. A list of independent packages: <a href="http://rpmseek.com/rpm-pl/armagetron.html?hl=com&amp;cx=0" class="external free" title="http://rpmseek.com/rpm-pl/armagetron.html?hl=com&amp;cx=0" rel="nofollow">http://rpmseek.com/rpm-pl/armagetron.html?hl=com&amp;cx=0</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 143.167.228.169 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_143.167.228.169_f4bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/143.167.228.169">contribs</a>) 22:09, 27 January 2007.</small></li>
<li>Most distributions have upgraded their installed Armagetron to 0.2.7.1, which is the second release under the name Armagetron Advanced. Mandriva and Kubuntu (therefore, Ubuntu as well) and Gentoo have all been spotted by developers as having upgraded to 0.2.7.0 or higher. It takes time, and Armagetron Advanced hasn't been around that long compared to the original Armagetron project. I'd also like to point out that many notable open source games aren't going to have any third-party distribution, and are going to struggle to meet the letter of the notability policy. That's because while many open source games have significant following, few, if any, ever appear anywhere else. Packages to Linux distributions are largely maintained by someone within each game project, (with a few exceptions, such as Mandriva and Ubuntu). I think the list of games that were nominated by PMC for the most part should either not be deleted, or should be exempted from the notability requirement because there is a sizeable community built around each of them. --70.244.120.143 04:42, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>To the newcomers, welcome! If any of the newcomers are part of the Armagetron Advanced project, please read <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>; it doesnt preclude you from participating in this Afd process, but it nice to alert others who you are.</li>
<li>The point about distribution is well made. "143.167.228.169", you have claimed that Armagetron Advanced superceeded the Armagetron project -- can you provide evidence of that, either by:</li>

<li>showing it is a fork of the original codebase</li>
<li>demonstrating that the same developers have migrated to the new project</li>
<li>the new project is feature-compatible with the earlier project</li>
<li>a distro dropped the earlier project at the same time they picked up the Advanced project</li>
<li>some other way that I havent thought of</li>

<li>My apologies, I (143.167.228.169) am one of the Armagetron Advanced project administrators, I go by the name of Tank Program within the Armagetron community. I was previously unaware of the conflict of interest guidelines as I have not previously contributed to Wikipedia. In that light, please treat my comments as someone who wishes for the article to remain in place and is willing to support its retainment with supporting evidence. To be honest, I am unaware of Armagetron appearing in any major publication. Most reviews that can be found come in the form of blog entries, forum entries or small site reviews. This suggests Armagetron follows more a word of mouth pattern, where a person hears from a friend and shows the game to another friend. Some examples:</li>

<li>Thanks guys. Any chance one of you can upload a screenshot of "Walls" and/or one of the original game, for old times sake. Let me know the filename.</li>
<li>Ok, I vote <b>keep</b> on this one. The original sf.net project was started in 2000 and after what appears to be an amicable fork the team have continued under the new name; it is carried in a number of distributions and being offered on the Apple site as an OS X download is pretty notable IMO; finally, a few of those reviews are independent and more than directory entries (I've added three to the article). Having security advisories and a Wireshark filter already is pretty nifty really; it shows that this game is being used in the dungeons while the vampires wait for their wings to dry out. Whats more, the developers who have joined us on this Afd have been pretty level headed. Also, its available via <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linspire.html" title="Linspire">Linspire</a>'s <a href="../../../c/l/i/Click%27N%27Run_febe.html" title="Click'N'Run">Click'N'Run</a> <a href="http://www.linspire.com/lindows_products_details.php?package_name=armagetronad&amp;pg=review&amp;fullReviewsMode=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.linspire.com/lindows_products_details.php?package_name=armagetronad&amp;pg=review&amp;fullReviewsMode=1" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 13:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>
<p>Note about OS X download on Apple site: anyone can add programs there, so it's one of those directories.</p>
<p>The graphics didn't change much with the advanced fork (mostly textures at some point). Only the window title of this article's screenshot shows that it's most likely of the <i>original</i> and not an early advanced. It also shows a messed up renderer and rather ugly texture filtering settings, so it should probably be replaced by a quality screenshot.</p>
<p>As for screenshots of Walls, there are a few <a href="http://armagetron.sourceforge.net/old/screenshots/index.html" class="external text" title="http://armagetron.sourceforge.net/old/screenshots/index.html" rel="nofollow">very old screenshots</a> buried in the original web pages. They might be of Walls or something not much newer. To be sure we need an answer from the person who put them there.

<dd>There are a number of aspects in your comment.</dd>
<dd>1. If you think that drawing an intersection from various sources on individual languages and language groups is original research, then the some of the points are original research. But then my understanding of OR has been different so far.</dd>
<dd>2. I can understand if Wikipedians are a bit worried if they see too much quoted from author's own books. I have therefore added a number of other sources now plus two reviews on my own book, which show you that it's not garbage.</dd>
<dd>3. Nowhere do I claim that using the Latin alphabet makes somebody European. I have simply given a current definition that is based on a whole series of cultural-anthropological features. If you're more happy with a well-known name, then let me just point out Huntington (I have added his name and book in the article).</dd>
<dd>4. I don't see the concrete POV violations. I don't evaluate in the article, I just observe and describe -- I'm a linguist. I don't see where the lack of basis should be unless you mean a lack of sources (which I have now added apart from my book).</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> First of all, it is not identical or even a rewrite of the 2nd half of Languages of Europe, but a considerable expansion, and undoubtedly worth an article, as this is a large subject. Not being an expert on the subject, i cannot tell to what extent it represents a different sub-discipline. The content looks solid and academic, at least to a non-expert. But i do know that it is unreferenced by any standard, regardless of subject. The way to show that sources can be found is to start finding them now and put them in. Certainly the first step is some general references.</li>

<dl>
<dd>If this is not an alternative and unrecognized theory, surely any of the books on the subject that are appropriate can be given. if it is an unrecognized theory, it still must be represented by more than the one book presently there. And if it is of this status, the differences from the standard view of the subject should be explicitly shown, to guide the outsiders to the field, with the proper balance.

<li><b>keep</b> It is definitely not identical to the second half of Languages of Europe. If it is badly written or if someone does not agree with the definition of Europe given in the article, the talk page should be the place to discuss this.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's the inclusion of articles like this that does "injustice to the Wiki-community". The valid linguistic information in this piece is available elsewhere on Wikipedia. The way it is stitched together here either constitutes original research or gives undue weight to a fringe theory. This page is completely unreferenced and I could cover the whole article with "citation needed" tags. The onus is not on me but the article's authors to provide proper sources, especially for the controversial claims this page makes. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 19:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On the word "fringe theory": I don't put up any theory; I just describe the facts as far as they are known to us. Again, if you think that a synopsis and synthesis of facts is original research, then yes, some of the information given in the article (namely the one on communicative strategies) has been "synthesized" by myself and is in this sense OR. But most points are already common knowledge. Again, to show this I have now indicated a number of sources (including encyclopedias). -<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatra_843e.html" title="User:Sinatra">Sinatra</a> 21:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks are due to Sinatra / Joachim Grzega for pointing out that he is the main author of the article.

<dd>I've never quite understood the fear of many Wikipedians if somebody quotes from his/her own (expert) research as long as it's facts that are presented and not just guesses or evaluations. And again, I'm nut putting up any theory. Please note also that I've pointed out two reviews where my book is seen in a positive light. I'm really not keen on doing PR for my own book. I just want to offer and share my expert knowledge with Wikipedia users and contribute the results that (also my own) academic research has brought to light. But in case you would be happier if I quoted my own works less frequently, I could do so. -<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatra_843e.html" title="User:Sinatra">Sinatra</a> 18:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what I originally had.

Of course I think it would be a pity to delete all the information, but if the majority thinks it should be crossed out I will accept it.

<dd>Technically, we don't delete here, we hide things in the edit history until they're sourced. Given the number of "source" and "dubious" tags it might be better to grow the article organically, and to state claims when they can be sourced, rather than to have a lengthy article full of post-it notes with question marks. Since you're the author of the book, that puts you in a bit of a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> situation, although we're loath to run experts out of town. But as an expert you should also have access to what others have written on the topic, and in case of doubt refer to their work rather than your own. It's always a question of balance, and when the notability of a field is somewhat doubtful articles that make excessive use of personal sources tend to raise suspicions. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Prod expired, but article has too much claim of notability (especially in history), for me to be willing to deleted on a prod of "Unnotable 23-year-old private citizen, does not appear to meet WP:BIO". The article doesn't show that he meets WP:BIO, but I'm not convinced anyone has really tried. Last paragraph has troubles with <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a>, but that is not a basis for deletion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm a third party proponent. I use Ten Ton Hammer as a source for many of the MMO's that I participate in. It is accurate and reliable. Yes, it has forums, but many places that are listed here have forums as well as content. TTH articles themselves are not OR, but well documented with references to other articles. I find I link to many other sites listed in their articles during the course of my time spent on TTH. I am not a paid employee. I am volunteering my time to see that a valuable resource be included in the Wikipedia. It would be a shame to not include this type of resource in this encyclopedia. It's larger and more helpful than the other two sites mentioned below. --Zannniee 17:25, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Indeed we are JzG. *smiles* Anyway, you should not redelete the page, as there are sites of comparable size and stature (<a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratics.html" title="Stratics">Stratics</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcry.html" title="Warcry">Warcry</a>) that have pages on the Wiki and are not being threatened with deletion. We are still looking for clarification on several issues brought up in the "discussion" section of the page that have not been addressed. I'll reask here: would being considered an "affiliated" website (a status symbol) be the equivalent of a notable award. There are several gaming companies that consider Ten Ton Hammer "affiliated". We are collecting quotes from their community managers as we speak.

<li><b><s>Cleanup &amp; Neutral for now</s></b> WarCry is AfD too right now, but I've been working to find and add proper references for it to show its notability per WP:WEB. If someone could do the same thing with TTH, I think that'd go a long way towards establishing notability. And clean up the article to be a bit more neutral too, right now, it reads like an ad/press release.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 12:57, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Keep</b>. Cleaned up some stuff, added a reference or two, but it does need more references. And serious rewriting of some of the parts. I've already started NPOV-ing the thing, need some help rephrasing some stuff to make them not sound like a promotional thingy. To the TTH people here, if you guys are serious about the entry, please look for some 3rd-party references and add them to the article. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 17:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Hello, Nicole Hamlett here, I work for the aforementioned insubstantiated network.

<dd>Hello, Danny Gourley here. I also work for Ten Ton Hammer. I find it interesting that so much effort is being made to keep this entry from existing. I mean, I can use Wikipedia to find an exact recipe for how to make crack cocaine, but the information on TTH is deemed to have too little value to be here?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm in no way affiliated with anyone to do with gaming, except I bought a Wii for my niece.

One reason is that Quil Ceda Village is becoming Washington's state top tourist attractions, and I feel that information needs to be provided about major tourist destinations on Wikipedia for the general public to research about this tourist location. Second, the sheer size of Quil Ceda Village and its anchors (like the Seattle Premium Outlets, big-box retailers, and the casino-hotel resort calls for attention on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>, actually, whether it's an important village or not (and real places are generally notable by default), the political ramifications (state sales tax tussle) should be sufficient to establish notability.

<p>Non notable PR puffery translated into an article. Do we now reward adept PR people with articles? This is a non notable, here today gone tomorrow initiative, most recently of an <a href="http://www.tutor2u.net/newsmanager/templates/?a=2115&amp;z=1" class="external text" title="http://www.tutor2u.net/newsmanager/templates/?a=2115&amp;z=1" rel="nofollow">Australian bank</a>, previously possibly of some other bank. It has little or no merit, and is only notable in terms of lazy media swallowing in full the "interesting" press release to get a few easy column inches. What next on wikipedia? Rollerskating ducks?. A Press Release to Article API?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Japanese wikipedia article on X Japan (<a href="../../../../ja/x/_/j/X_JAPAN_f487.html" class="extiw" title="ja:X_JAPAN">ja:X JAPAN</a>) mentions Jun as a guitarist when they were an indy band, and there is an article (<a href="../../../../ja/%E9%AB%98/%E4%BA%95/%E5%AF%BF/%E9%AB%98%E4%BA%95%E5%AF%BF.html" class="extiw" title="ja:高井寿">ja:高井寿</a>) about him.

<li>Not sure whether I am reading this right but hasn't this article already been <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%AB%98%E4%BA%95%E5%AF%BF&amp;oldid=7401804" class="external text" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%AB%98%E4%BA%95%E5%AF%BF&amp;oldid=7401804" rel="nofollow">considered for deletion</a> at some point but the respective tag was quickly removed by the anonymous article creator without any comment?

<li>Yes, that looks like a speedy deletion tag. Via Amazon, I could verify that the part about 高井寿 writing several instructional guitar books is true; but, that alone would not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. A <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> reference that puts him in X Japan at any point is needed, to keep the article. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 14:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are missing the point. This <i>best source</i> (as I have stated numerous times by now) does not qualify as a reliable source per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, it is self-published material, neither backed by the official website of the band nor those of the former members which we can be certain about. The other references you have introduced in this dispute are no better, as they all rely on user contributed content. Given that the flow of information between Japan and the band's non-Japanese fans is not only hampered by the years which have passed since the group's split but also a considerable language barrier, widespread gossip and misinformation would come as no surprise. Any further discussion on this particular matter should take place on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jun_%28musician%29_b35a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jun (musician)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jun (musician)</a>. ~ <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 00:52, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>OK, finally and with lot of help I have got the reliable sources you have said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rommel, was a japanese band, Jun or Shu or H. Takai was one of their members (you can see also this in his OFFICIAL webpage), well, look at this: <a href="http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,41051.sm;jsessionid=1342D8071BA23965902521B05A61684A" class="external free" title="http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,41051.sm;jsessionid=1342D8071BA23965902521B05A61684A" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,41051.sm;jsessionid=1342D8071BA23965902521B05A61684A</a> Rommel information from Rockdetector a copyrighted news article webpage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frontman "Shu" (Hisashi Takai) had credits with EMPEROR and X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, then we have Extasy Records official webpage (<a href="http://www.extasyrecords.co.jp/eng/company/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.extasyrecords.co.jp/eng/company/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.extasyrecords.co.jp/eng/company/index.html</a>) look what it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1986.04 Establish EXTASY RECORDS upon releasing X' new single, [ORGASM]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you check the Wikipage about this: <a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgasm_%28song%29.html" title="Orgasm (song)">Orgasm_(song)</a> oh, look at the cover there's a guy at the right, who is he? JUN. (you can also check this in his official website). Do I have to say more? You can see, copyrighted webpages talk about Jun, and lot of more sites also, as you can see the 4 ciations I added yesterday in the main article (<a href="../../../x/_/j/X_Japan_f22f.html" title="X Japan">X Japan</a>). <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcat21_ccea.html" title="User:Darkcat21">Darkcat21</a> 19:23, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's see what Rockdetector's FAQ has to say about the origin of its content:</dd>
<dd><i>CAN I CONTRIBUTE TO ROCKDETECTOR?<br />

<dd><b>Comment</b>: To be fair, "Anglo-American philosophy" is a term in use, but of course it doesn't refer to the language in which the philosophy is done, but the location (Britain and America). It can indeed have the connotation of "analytic" philosophy - but all this reinforces the point that even a correct account of the meaning can only be a dictionary definition with links to the main articles on Philosophy or Analytic Philosophy. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 21:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: But this is precisely the misconception from which the article starts - "anglo" in that phrase does not mean "anglophone". It just means English (although I would concede stretching it to British). So the article can only be a dictionary definition which redirects to articles dealing with British and American philosophy. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 15:10, 26 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I would not stretch it to British, Britain includes Wales and there are also Anglo-Welsh relations. Not sure if there is a article on "American Philosophy". The word Anglo-American can mean governmental relations between the U.S. and the U.K. or their cultural commonality, but it can also include Welsh-American and also Jamaicans who live in the Americas and speak English. It depends on the context. I hazzard a guess that no one here knows what it means and that is why no one has been able to replace the bare two sentences on it given in the article and instead just say delete! --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">Talk</a></span></sup> 15:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If it does not connote Analytic philosophy then go and clarify this fact in the article before others make the same mistake, it would only take two seconds to change the wording. Nor is there anything strange about geographic designations in philosophy, it does not mean the philosophy there is any worse or any different in a bad way, it is just a way of referring to it.</dd>

<dd>Judging by the number of delete supports above I'd say the article will get deleted, strange, 'cos there is such a thing as Anglo-American Philosophy, there is probabaly even Franco-American philosophy though I've not read any of it.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>:It seems we are caught between two poles, most editors here disavow talk of a distinction between Anglophone philosophy and Continental, more than they would disavow one between Analytic and Continental. Now we see proposed a distinction based on the geography of Anglo-American (which is really also cultural not just geographic) to ensure a method is not compared with a geographic distinction. The problem is that somehow both coincide, geography and method coincide in Anglophone (English-speaking countries but also those who partake of it in non-English speaking countries).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to method, Analytic pretends to a method but you find all kinds of things there (trascendental arguments, ontological relativity, a denial of meaning to the word Analytic itself!, Wittgenstein II, ordinary language, new metaphysics, etc.), perhaps as many varieties as you find in Continental which may also be given as method, though not as clearly maintained as the original Analytic one, and with many changes in its history. One might say the method was initially a clearly articulated phenomenology, then existentialism, then structuralism and then deconstructive or post-structural. The three: Analytic, Anglo-American and Anglophone have also passed through such varieties in method. The heightened distinctions here between these three is inveitable when you are close up to them, but from the level of talking about Continental as one thing, these three also blur, and can be named as one, we just haggle over the name.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems the distinction we try to make here can be geographic, methodological, language-based, and/or cultural. So you cannot be faulted for mixing categories (eg, comparing method and geography) because in reality they are mixed and that is perhaps why there is such an issue as the schism in the first place.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If the first question was directed to me, then I didn't mention anything about a definition; I just said "make redirect" (note, though, that "Wikipedia isn't a dictionary" isn't a policy, but a guideline, and that such an approach would be possible as a meaty dab page). As to the second question: at least one of the links that I gave explicitly distinguishes between pragmatism, continental philosophy, and Anglo-American philosophy. I don't think that anyone uses "Anglo-American philosophy" to mean "pragmatism", though many people use "analytic philosophy" to mean "Anglo-American philosophy". But there is no wholly satisfactory approach that doesn't involve rewriting <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analytic_philosophy.html" title="Analytic philosophy">Analytic philosophy</a> to some extent.</dd>
<dd>To be honest, if proper discussion were possible on these articles, which at the moment it isn't, the place to settle this would be at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAnglo-American_philosophy_eff5.html" title="Talk:Anglo-American philosophy">Talk:Anglo-American philosophy</a>. A case could be made for an article that explained clearly what the term means (that it includes analytic philosophy properly construed but is much broader than that, that it's misleading in that it isn't limited by geography or by language, etc.), and how it's distinguished from other philosophical traditions, including Continental philosophy. Failing that (and I hold out no hope for such a course), a redirect is the best of the bad options. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:42, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May I draw attention again to the fact that analytic philosophy occurs outside of the UK/US; and that therefore equating it with with anglo-american philosophy introduces a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 19:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Seems to a matter of Wiki policy or style rather than any factual dispute. "Anglo-American" is a phrase unquestionably used <i>as if</i> synonmous with analytic. Banno is obviously right that, strictly speaking, it's wrongly so used. Should Wiki follow common usage or strict facts?

<dd>I don't think there's anything <i>systemic</i> about this, nor do I think a redirect has to "equate" two topics (indeed, as I said above, it would be best for the existing article to explain when "Anglo-American" might be used instead of "analytic"). At most this is a slightly inaccurate redirect, and that's still the best possible option under the current circumstances (circumstances which have already rendered many quite bad philosophy articles effectively uneditable). If the redirect is really unpalatable to a significant number of Wikipedians, I'll change my vote to a simple delete. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 20:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree it is not systematic, the world does not happen to work that way. Am I no longer allowed to call Budweiser an American beer when it is made in Nigeria? The point is not that Analytic is done outside of the Anglo-countries, but that, institutionally, it has the stamp of U.S/UK origin. Almost all philosophy in its subject matter has a global appeal, and rarely is it strictly local (you'll find Eastern/Continental/Analytic all taught globally). We use the word to help us trace its origins that is all. But since Anglo-American philosophy was not always Analytic it might be an idea to explain this in the article. What I mean is to answer the question why many phil.depts. in the U.K. switched to Analytic and coincidently many of the U.S. ones did too. These U.S. phil. depts did not choose French or German philosophy and perhaps this is down to language, imitiation, vestiges of colonialism, or the "special-relationship" <span style="font-style:italic">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 02:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is about the situation that occured around staff members creating a feud and it's effects on the users of the site.

<li>The entry is a valid argument that people have been following on roosterteeth.com. I see no reason why this article should not be included on wikipedia. maybe it should be linked on Roosterteeth.com wiki article but still included in wikipedia. maybe it is not noteable to EVERY wikipedia reader but then again most articles are not notable to everyone. the mere fact that the pie vs cake argument does in fact have a following should be more then enough reason for a wikipedia article to exist.</li>

<li>It needs to be verifiable from multiple, independent reliable sources.

<li>Not that it's entirely relevant, but in the interests of disclosure I'm the moderator "BigBen" on Roosterteeth.com.

<li>That article isn't referenced at all.

</li>
<li>As I mentioned on the discussion page, the "Pie vs Cake" debate is found across many forums on the internet, not just on RoosterTeeth. RT are just the people who escalated the debate with the comic. However, for many forums and websites with a discussion element, the "pie or cake?" question is a common icebreaker.</li>
<li>I suppose that's the question then, how do you reference a phenomenon that has a very obscure beginning, and primarily consists of a debate occurring on discussion boards. Or is this enough to eliminate it for consideration entirely? <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollitzerBK_9bcc.html" title="User:PollitzerBK">PollitzerBK</a> 18:22, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It is. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says: "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> discusses the reliability of forum posts. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 18:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> also has at the top "However, it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception." I would certainly agree that because it does not strictly meet the rule it needs extra attention, but in this case I think it's a candidate for an exception. This is because, like the case of the Pirates v Ninjas article, it seems that forum posts are ample evidence to merely document the existence of an internet phenomenon, which is all the article should focus on in any case, not the personal disputes of some roosterteeth staff members. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollitzerBK_9bcc.html" title="User:PollitzerBK">PollitzerBK</a> 18:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia employs sources where the identity of the author/publisher can be ascertained, where it is evident that fact checking and peer review have occurred, and where it is evident that what has been published has been acknowledged by others and has become a part of the corpus of human knowledge. An anonymous or pseudonymous posting to a World Wide Web discussion forum fails that on just about every count. And as <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> pointed out, you are using as a benchmark an article that isn't satisfactory when it comes to sourcing. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've never edited anything on wikipedia before, but I feel I need to have my say on this one. The Pie vs Cake argument, although I do not know whether started on the Roosterteeth website, it was the first place that I (and i would warrant many other people) heard of the argument.
<p>Just because this article is based on references to discussion boards, forums and the news pages of a few websites does not mean it should be deleted from this one, it is a large argument, which first started out as a joke based on actual events taking place in an office which were quite comical and surreal.</p>
<p>The fact that some people decided to take the argument seriously is, i believe reason enough for it to have a place on Wikipedia. It should at the very most be moved to an article concerning the way in which people sometimes do not recognise humor, or refuse to, thus creating a serious disagreement.</p>
<p>In closing, this article's subject matter does belong on this website, quite simply because it is information, and information is what this website is all about. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.33.54.69_ac71.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.33.54.69">82.33.54.69</a> (talk) 18:21, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Not only is the entire album a rumour, but I have received confirmation from an official source that the album is entirely rumoured, and that <i>nothing</i> is in production.

<li><b>STRONG Delete</b> Wait a sec, let me get this straight... Dave McDonald=East Side Dave=Midnight Rider? And you expect Wikipedia to maintain separate pages for EACH? If you had ONE page for McDonald, noted there that these others are personae, and redirected those names to McDonald I MIGHT vote for it. Better yet would be a page for the show they appear on (sorry, it is so un-notable I cannot remember the name) with a list of the shows cast and all characters each plays. However, and I am gonna say this as plainly as possible... Midnight Rider is NOT notable. Where are independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>???

<p>A small town, such as <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambuslang.html" title="Cambuslang">Cambuslang</a>, does not warrant an entire article specifically on its 5 schools and college. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComputerjoe_570e.html" title="User:Computerjoe">Computerjoe</a><a href="../../../c/o/m/User_talk%7EComputerjoe_0094.html" title="User talk:Computerjoe"><span style="color:red">'s talk</span></a> 17:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - sadly we don't have a clear policy on inclusion of schools (since the unfortunate demise of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>), but there's not much in this article that couldn't be covered in the articles on the schools themselves. "History" section reads like an essay (violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>) and there's really no other useful content. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 19:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambuslang.html" title="Cambuslang">Cambuslang</a>. Seems to me like good info, no reason to delete. The more obscure info about particular schools can be discarded or put into individual school articles. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 21:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambuslang.html" title="Cambuslang">Cambuslang</a>. At first I thought this may have been split off from there, but I couldn't find anything in the history of the Cambuslang article that supports that - and there's nothing on the discussion page that shows a plan to do so.

This would not have failed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, due to age and architecture; it has pictures of a school built in 1848, and intends to cover others that date back further.

<li><b>Delete</b>. As ever, we need to see notability. Most towns have a history of providing education and educational facilities in their environs.

<li><b>Delete</b> - <b>(1)</b> Per <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, articles may not contain any unpublished arguments, ideas, data, or theories; or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published arguments, ideas, data, or theories that serves to advance a position. In particular, a Wikipedia article about a person should not include unpublished analysis. Mutsengi has done many noteworthy things and that is what the unpublished analysis in the article seeks to prove. This unpublished analysis violates <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. <b>(2)</b> Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other such that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. The article should be created using multiple non-trivial published works that discuss Mutsengi himself (which the article does not). The article <i><a href="http://www.firstglobalselect.com/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=globalone001/globalone/htm/news_article.r?vcnews-id=344258" class="external text" title="http://www.firstglobalselect.com/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=globalone001/globalone/htm/news_article.r?vcnews-id=344258" rel="nofollow">RBZ Must Encourage Use of Plastic Money</a></i> does mention that Asher Tarivona-Mutsengi is a research scholar at the University of Texas at Austin, College of Natural Sciences, but that is not enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. Mutsengi is from <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwe.html" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, so a problem might be that the multiple non-trivial published works that discuss Mutsengi himself are located in <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwe.html" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> and not accessible over the Internet. If the author of the article can find some multiple non-trivial published works that discuss Mutsengi himself, please include those in the article. However, it does not appear that the topic meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and I do not think it can meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm not sure what the contention is for opposing this article. First, Dr. Bays was already listed in the article on <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taizan_Maezumi_ebc2.html" title="Taizan Maezumi">Taizan Maezumi</a>, a controversial Zen Roshi who established six Zen temples in the US, including the Zen Center of LA (ZCLA). In that article she is listed as one of his twelve successors, to whom he passed dharma transmission. There are others in that list, in that article, who have articles in Wikipedia, which to my reading are scarcely more detailed at this point than this one on Dr. Bays, yet none of these has been suggested for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, this is fundamentally historical information on at least two points: (1) nationally and anthropologically - it is directly concerned with the early spread of Buddhism to the west, in particular throughout North America and (2) locally - it is of considerable local import that Dr. Bays is the founder of one of the first Zen centers in Portland, Oregon (the ZCO) and founder of a Zen Monestary in Clatskanie, Oregon. Certainly, researchers just 20-40 years from now who are interested in Buddhism's early fits and starts in Oregon will find this information useful and there will, no doubt, be researchers in Oregon seeking exactly this information. I would add that as a student of early Christianity I can only wish that information like this existed about the earliest churches, what they were about, who started them, when and where. We have the opportunity to preserve this kind of information for future researchers who are studying, among other things, the manner of religious spread and growth (or, as we do not yet know whether Zen or Buddhism will find fertile soil in North America, assimilation or extinction). With a mind to the above points, to anyone recommending deletion, please review these criteria in the Wikipedia policy on "notability" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29</a>):</p>
<p>(1) Expandability -- Will the article ever be more than a stub? Could the perfect article be written on this subject?</p>
<p>(2) 100 year test (future speculation) -- In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?</p>
<p>(3) 100 year test (past speculation) -- If we had comparable verifiable information on a person from 100 years ago, would anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful today?</p>
<p>(4) Biography -- Has this been written by the subject or someone closely involved with the subject?</p>
<p>(5) Search Engine Test -- Does a search for the subject produce a large number of distinguishable hits on Google ([1]), Alexa ([2])?</p>
<p><br />
I believe the article passes all five of these tests. The historical importance of the connection to Maezumi Roshi and the founding of two considerable and historic institutions in Portland is certainly as important as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champlain_Bridge_aab0.html" title="Champlain Bridge">Champlain Bridge</a>, another article perfectly charactistic of thousands found in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>These institutions are equivalent in historic value to "the first church" or "the first synagogue" in any city, which are common entries all throughout Wikipedia for obvious reasons, even when the churches or synagogues are now defunct. ˜˜˜˜dcwood</p>

Why not have a single short generic article , and then separate links to articles for UK Carers, US Voluntary Caregivers etc etc? <a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcalibur_1839.html" title="User:Excalibur">Excalibur</a> 10:34, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I like to think I have a fairly massive vocabulary, but I've never heard the word "carer" before.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I like this idea very much, and agree that it would prevent any possible POV issues. How about naming the article simply Carer/Voluntary Caregiver? It's admittedly an unwieldly name but it would cover both bases. I never have heard the term 'carer' used anywhere myself, and it seems that there's too much of a international divide to use the words interchangeably. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielEng_df2b.html" title="User:DanielEng">DanielEng</a> 12:00, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Just checked, and the word "Carers" is used internationally eg <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu/care_for_me/carers/io_en.htm" class="external free" title="http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu/care_for_me/carers/io_en.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu/care_for_me/carers/io_en.htm</a></li>

<p>Carers&#160;: "Carers are non-professional people who take care of patients at home. Carers can be relatives of the sick person or other volunteers. They usually give help or support to relatives or friends because of long-term physical or mental ill-health or disability, or problems related to old age. As they deal with serious matters and under difficult circumstances, carers need particular attention from national and regional authorities to help them with their tasks. In general, to carry out their duties smoothly and efficiently they require flexible working time and financial support."</p>

<p>International Alliance of Carers Organizations New International Caregiver Organization Launched On February 27, 2004, the International Alliance of Carers Organizations (IACO) was launched by family caregiving organizations from Australia, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the US. The mission of the organization is three-fold:</p>
<p>to increase visibility of family caregiving across the lifespan as an international issue; to promote the sharing of best practices in caregiving programs between countries; and to encourage and provide assistance to countries interested in developing family carer organizations. IACO will be headquartered in London; seed money has been provided by Pfizer US. Initial IACO projects will include promotion of a United Nations Day for Carers and a presentation on the IACO as part of a half-day workshop at the International Federation on Aging conference in Singapore on August 4, 2004. National family carer organizations in all countries are encouraged to join the alliance.<a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcalibur_1839.html" title="User:Excalibur">Excalibur</a> 12:17, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think on reflection "carer" might be better than "carers" - By way of a precedent, I note that the entry for <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugees.html" title="Refugees">refugees</a> is redirected into <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee.html" title="Refugee">refugee</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

I don't see a NPOV problem with "Voluntary caregiver", but maybe those who do could explain. I'd object to keeping it "carer" because I suspect it's a neologism created to send a specific message and not in especially wide use (my uneducated guess). A slash in the title won't work since that would create a subpage (but you could use parentheses instead). Excalibur, you're right that the singular is preferred where possible under <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">naming conventions</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 14:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't agree with the neologism argument - there are a lot of wiki entries a great deal more neological than "care" and "carers" which have been used for well over a quarter of a century and are now enshrined in law. According to Carers UK website, the chronology is as follows:</li>

<p>1965 National Council for the Single Woman and her Dependants formed. 1976 Invalid Care Allowance introduced - the first benefit for carers and still the only benefit specifically for carers. 1978 Introduction of Home Responsibilities Protection to protect carers’basic state pension 1981 Association of Carers formed <a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcalibur_1839.html" title="User:Excalibur">Excalibur</a> 17:40, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I would not say that "content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators", because the content isn't being distributed, nor was it ever systematically distributed: this is a one-time occurrence of an interview.

<dd>Erm, I don't see where I've implied that. I'm disappointed that my actions have indicated, to you, that I thought that book sources were unverifiable. The sources provided by you and Caknuck are helpful (although that the author is notable doesn't mean that the content is). The article, in my opinion, was very unencyclopedic, although notability concerns distracted me a bit more. While you have more or less removed from my mind any qualms about the latter, the former (as well as verifiability concerns), which does not seem to merit deletion, is still... concerning. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 23:07, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The "Anil Chaudhary" is said to be a production controller. I'm not even sure if there are many "notable" production controllers in this world, no matter how many movies this person worked on, and working as a filmcrew member on a notable director's films doesn't impart notability on the crewmember in and of itself. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no real claim of notability. Many people work on films even in the nascent Indian film industry. This association in and of itself does not confer notability. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:06, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Well, if we go by Google hits there is very minor reason to vote keep. However, like many other stuffs in India (or, for that matter, South Asia and many other countries where Internet penetration is not comparable with that in countries like USA, UK), we should consider this article from another point. Anil Chowdhury is considerably known in the Bengali film industry for his association with <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyajit_Ray_4c04.html" title="Satyajit Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>, a noted film director (and a featured article in Wikipedia). In fact, I rememeber I started this article while helping improve the article <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyajit_Ray_4c04.html" title="Satyajit Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>, and could not find many internet sources on the person. However, I have read some printed sources (mainly in <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_language.html" title="Bengali language">Bengali language</a>) where he has been mentioned, in most cases in relation to the films of Satyajit RayIt is Anil Choudhury's association with memorable cinemas like <i><a href="../../../p/a/t/Pather_Panchali_3e8b.html" title="Pather Panchali">Pather Panchali</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/p/a/Aparajito.html" title="Aparajito">Aparajito</a></i> etc that makes him notable. So IMO this article should not be deleted. Regards.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayan</a> (<a href="../../../d/w/a/User_talk%7EDwaipayanc_1f27.html" title="User talk:Dwaipayanc">talk</a>) 06:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> same reason as above. Pather Panchali brought deep changes in Indian cinema, and Anil Choudhury's contribution to it as well as his later collaboration with Satyajit Ray has entered Indian movie lore.--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 23:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is not about Pather Panchali or Satyajit Ray. The article is about a filmcrew member, and provides no information about what Choudhury might have done that was encyclopedic. Just because one works for a notable person does not make one notable. At most, a mention can be made in a article on Panchali or Ray that they hired Choudhury to work as one of the filmcrew, but I fail to see how even that much is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is low on info, I admit. But the sparsity of the article itself is not a measure of Choudhury's contribution. Nobody "hired" Choudhury. Choudhury unsuccessfully tried to find funding for Pather (as a friend) for a while before Ray told him that he'd venture out without funding and do it (the first person Ray shared this resolve with). As the "production manager" (aka the guy in charge in exchange of nothing), Choudhury personally and otherwise (for example getting Ray's wife to sell her ornaments without telling either Ray or his mother) managed to fund the film for a while before suggesting to a desperate Ray that he approach the chief minister of West Bengal, which finally how the film was completed.--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 05:39, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I love The Human League, but I quetion the notability of this article. It's definitely written with a POV tone and the image is way too large but aside from that, did the club have any other claim to fame besides the Human League connection? It's not like this place was the Hacienda or CBGBs or some other notable, iconic pop music club. -- <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 19:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep - My Reply</b>, If the article needs rewriting then so be it. But as regards the notability I strongly disagree. The '<b>Crazy Daisy'</b> nightclub is listed in the Official Sheffield City Council history of the city.Which is why it is in the Sheffield Catagory as well as The Human League. It is mentioned in over a dozen Human League and Electronic Music websites in UK and US. It is referred to in a number of interviews of Gayle, Oakey and Catherall particularly the BBC Online. A Google search will throw up more. This may prompt a wiki search by an interested party. Of course the club is only notable for discovery of Gayle (Sulley) and Catherall, but that incident alone is deeply embedded in British popular folklore, which even non Human League fans know. When Susan is interviewed by the media she is nearly always still asked to tell the story, 27 years later. If that is your rationale for deletion then please also delete the <a href="../../../v/i/p/Viper_Room_2ce8.html" title="Viper Room">Viper Room</a> entry which is only notable for the death of <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Phoenix_2f32.html" title="River Phoenix">River Phoenix</a>. The article will be expanded by virtue of it's presence on wiki, where someone with more info than me can add to it. For obvious reasons a historical location from a quarter of a century ago doesn’t have that much readily available information, that is what I thought Wikipedia was created to provide. Rest assured when I next speak to Susan Gayle I will ask her for some background info on the club.</li>

<li><b>strong keep</b> The references are sufficient to prove the use, and it is just as significant a concept as metasearching, which has long had an article.

<li><b>keep</b>.

<li><b>keep</b> Though the subject of the article fits the definition of a neologism, the WP standards do not prohibit all neologisms.

<dd>Thanks for help, The major reference for justifying the notability of the Charity is its own website which is referenced in the article. I have also now listed the Patron HRH Princess Anne, and several notable (major celebrity in rugby term) names who are Honorary Presidents of the Society - all of whom have their own articles in Wiki. Please help if I have not "properly" cited sources etCheers - the website says it all for me!</dd>

<dd>'<i>comment</i> Sorry Cornell, but you are making a subjective, incorrect assumption, and I do not believe you are qualified to remove that. The founders were not watching on TV, they had been to the match itself, and were directly influenced by the loss to found the Charity.it was indeed a notable event - an event that has directly led to $25m being raised for disadvantaged children, and the fact that 7 of the England Rugby world cup winning team are currently Honorary Presidents of the Charity is testament itself to the importance felt by the England (and now British and Irish) rugby community to the importance of this singular event in 1983.Gonker44</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article definitely needs a clean-up, but that is all. The charity is notable, just looking at it's patron is enough to convince me of that. Also, with so many members, and the level of money raised, it is very hard to argue that having an article on it is inappropriate. - <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShudda.nz_8088.html" title="User:Shudda.nz"><font color="blue"><b>Shudda</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/u/User_talk%7EShudda.nz_dbfc.html" title="User talk:Shudda.nz"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 01:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I have given the reference directly from the website of the history of the charity. It will celebrate its 25th Anniversary next year. is there any reason to doubt this? The fact that England did not win the Wooden spoon in 1982 or subsequent to 1983 independently verifies the date it was formed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gonker44 (<a href="../../../g/o/n/User_talk%7EGonker44_972e.html" title="User talk:Gonker44">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gonker44_9e8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gonker44">contribs</a>) 00:41, 28 January 2007.</small> Taking a look at another article - the American Red Cross - I note that the history of it mentioned in the article is referenced directly to its own website, is this incorrect? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gonker44 (<a href="../../../g/o/n/User_talk%7EGonker44_972e.html" title="User talk:Gonker44">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gonker44_9e8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gonker44">contribs</a>) 00:53, 28 January 2007.</small></p>

<dd>Gonker44, your link to the website is a self-published source, which means it is not good enough as evidence on the Wikipedia, according to the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">"Verifiability"</a> policy (you should read this policy). You need to look through the online news clippings (i.e. take a look at these: <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;q=wooden.spoon.society" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;q=wooden.spoon.society" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>). This will take more of your time, but the end result is much more useful in an encyclopedia, because then our readers can verify the facts from sources they trust. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 01:21, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Many thanks to thse who are helping me here. I believe that the consensus of feedback received is that most readers would understand that the Wooden Spoon is a major charity in the UK and Ireland, and deserves an article - one that I do hope will be expanded greatly once I advise the 11,000 members it exists!</li>
</ul>
<p>What you are asking for is verifiability to the statements of when it was founded etc. Well, back in 1983, it was launched by just 5 people, with no funds, so it is unlikely it attracted much press attention at first. However, I can verify that Spoon has been registered with the official UK Charity Commission since 1984 and have now added this to the article. I hope this satisfies this aspect! gonker44</p>

<dd>Gonker44, thanks, that's the sort of source we need. I've reformatted the sources so that additional factoids regarding the source can be annotated and seen by the reader. The syntax for use {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}} can be a bit tricky; if its annoying you, dont bother with it, just use the [url] syntax. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 19:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Technically, it doesn't meet any specific notability requirement.

HipHopDX.cm goes as far as to say that the song "really puts <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_%28rapper%29_14c6.html" title="The Game (rapper)">Game</a>’s behavior into perspective, painting a picture of him as a young man struggling to handle all the spotlight and drama he was suddenly thrust into." Additionally, it is commonly listed as one of the top tracks on the album in messageboards, and comment boxes (of course Wikipedia disregards forums, messageboards and user opinions in general as irrelevant and noncredible [sp?] sources, but nevertheless...).</dd>

<dd>Technically this article doesn't meet any of the notability requirements. Won't deny that. But it is regarded as one of the album's best tracks and has the most commentary on the album's main focus, The Game's conflict with Aftermath Entertainment (specifically Dr. Dre). You can delete it if you want, because there's nothing to say you shouldn't. But I think because of the song's content and the positive reviews the track has received (even if they are from "unreliable" sources), the article should be kept.--<a href="../../../n/p/s/User%7ENPswimdude500_6c75.html" title="User:NPswimdude500">NPswimdude500</a> 06:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>This page is a POV-fork from <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">Far right</a>. There is a similar list in <b>Far right</b>, titled <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html#Parties_labeled_as_.22Far_Right.22_or_.22Extreme_Right.22" title="Far right">Parties labeled as "Far Right" or "Extreme Right"</a>, which was originally removed by the creator of this article; I replaced the list in <b>Far right</b>, and nobody there has objected. This list-article conflates "Far Right" and "Extreme Right", which both connote extremism, with "Nationalist" and "Right-wing", neither of which connotes extremism, which creates the possibility of using this list to tar non-extremist nationalist and conservative parties with association with fringe extremist parties. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 21:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>. I was originally a skeptic upon seeing the "Subscriptions and Trials" section of the article (seems like promotion) but upon seeing the references, it seems pretty notable and well-known. That "Subscriptions" section should be axed though, and the rest of the article filled out. I'll see if I can clean up the references to look more professional. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 17:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I fixed the article as much as I could. The site itself is very, very notable, it seems. Actual recognition by the United States Chess Federation...can't get any more notable than that. A number of masters and grandmasters are members of the site, including three (notable enough to have their own Wikipedia entries) I've included in the article. If they play on it, it's good enough for me. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 18:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Caught smuggling arms from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland and subsequently being imprisoned for this (<b>notable</b>)</li>
<li>PIRA membership is pretty notable on its own but MacGiolla Bhrighde was aligned with the militant South Derry and the East Tyrone Brigades who favoured a more radical approach that the <a href="../../../i/r/a/IRA_Army_Council_9017.html" title="IRA Army Council">IRA Army Council</a>.(<b>notable</b>)</li>

<p>This article, despite the implications of the article title, is not a list of things abbreviated as 'T' -- it is a list of what T could possibly stand for in abbreviations that contain the letter 'T', plus an additional list at the bottom of the page of items that are vaguely related to T. No matter what the article is called, I don't think such a list belongs here. We have a (fairly massive) article on the letter <a href="../../../t/_/_/T.html" title="T">T</a>, a <a href="../../../t/_/%28/T_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="T (disambiguation)">T (disambiguation)</a> article that was extracted from <a href="../../../t/_/_/T.html" title="T">T</a> after much acrimonious debate, and finally this article, which was presented as a list at the bottom of the disambiguation page, and separated out so that the disambiguation page could be useful.<br />
This list, due to lack of discrimination and its consequent sheer size, isn't useful, and if trimmed, wouldn't serve any more purpose than the disambiguation article. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 21:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> annabel port is a celebrity for many people in London and has been for some time now she is a great radio presenter and should at least be acknowledged for this somewhere, this profile is not doing harm, it is not offensive, it is just a biography of a radio presenter.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - I agree with most comments made here, the point is not that she is not a notable person, as it was stated before if Big Brother contestants are notable for living in a TV house for a few weeks, Annabel Port whom many people listen to and love on a daily basis and have for many years now, certainly deserves an entry. But I do agree the article can do with a facelift and tidy up. I get the feeling that The people who appreciate her somewhat original style have tried to create an entry that reflects that style and is unfortunately not adapted to what WP articles usually look like. She deserves a proper entry, so please WP people keep the entry and please fans don't mess up the page of someone you like, see what it leads to&#160;!</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As an individual, she is not notable, and there do not appear to be any sources to verify any of the claims made. This article is the first Google hit for her, which is usually a bad sign. The second is the WP article on the show she cohosts. There's a few mentions here and there, but none of it really adheres. There's plenty of radio cohosts who don't rate articles, and she's just another one. Also, as there's clearly some humor intended in the article (which doesn't belong there), my final statement would be "I don't care if her boyfriend checks this page six times a day with Roxette on repeat, she's still not notable!" <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 00:34, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>REASONS THAT DELETION OF <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annabel_Port_5a34.html" title="Annabel Port">Annabel Port</a> IS INAPPROPRIATE</p>
<p>1. Notability: Annabel Port broadcasts to a nightly audience of over a million people in the UK (source: <a href="../../../r/a/j/RAJAR_0aae.html" title="RAJAR">RAJAR</a> the UK's radio audience research organisation) as well as many more online, with <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Radio_d24e.html" title="Virgin Radio">Virgin Radio</a> being the world's most listened-to radio station (source: <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitron.html" title="Arbitron">Arbitron</a>). That's an audience bigger than most non-syndicated US personalities, and even some syndicated ones. As part of the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_And_Geoff_91c5.html" title="Pete And Geoff">Pete And Geoff</a> show team, she has received multiple radio awards and nominations, including for the prestigious UK <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_Radio_Academy_Awards_4445.html" title="Sony Radio Academy Awards">Sony Radio Academy Awards</a>.</p>
<p>2. Other Media Coverage: She has been featured in large-circulation national UK publications such as the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mirror_c617.html" title="Daily Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> and the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Times_2a4f.html" title="Radio Times">Radio Times</a>, and appeared as a guest on both terrestrial and digital TV channels in the UK.</p>
<p>3. Cultural significance: In addition to this, as mentioned in her entry, she co-wrote a song with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. As one of only a handful of people to boast a composer credit alongside one of the greatest music and cultural icons of the 20th Century, thIs alone should warrant her a permanent entry.</p>
<p>ON VANDALISM: As far as people adding silly jokes to the entry goes, this is an unfortunate and unwanted of entries about pop-culture figures, major or minor. The boyfriend comment was clearly something mentioned on the radio, and jumped-on by a listener who edited here. There are hours upon hours of verifiable source downloadable in the form of podcast/archive audio, although this is, admittedly, an arduous task.</p>
<p>The problem here, surely, is not the validity of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annabel_Port_5a34.html" title="Annabel Port">Annabel Port</a>'s entry, but a need for greater vigilance policing this page for vandalism and flippant additions. 82.69.47.207 10:43, 28 January 2007 (UTC)Lespez</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Wikipedia is international and ground up in its concept. Annabel Port commands an audience both in the UK (on national independent radio) and internationally via the Internet. The radio station in question has recently featured the UK Prime Minister live on air (not as a specifically invited guest - he called in himself), so Mr Blair is not of the opinion it is insignificant. Vandalism (the boyfriend comment) and lack of sources are specifically listed as not good enough reasons to delete. The Geoff Show is innovative light entertainment radio and is significantly different from any other radio show I have heard. Annabel is an integral part of the Geoff Show (as she was of the Pete and Geoff Breakfast Show). I have personally not heard of all of the subjects of Wikipedia articles - surely this is the point? An Encycopedia is a place where a person can look up information that he or she does not already know. Panperoxide 19:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Do not delete!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Annabel Port is an essential member of a prime time radio broadcast that goes out worldwide, although she is not the main host, she provides much of the content and among the shows listenership she is very well known and loved. I see that many of the contestents in Big Brother have an entry, Chantelle, Jade Goody etc, even though they haven't achieved anything in life. Annabel has forged a successful career in radio over the past 5 years and could be considered one of the top 200 most powerful people in radio in the uk. I guess the question that i would ask the Wikipedia administrators is "Do you consider radio to be an unimportant genre of entertainment not worthy of comment or discussion now we have other forms, television, internet etc?"

<li>DO NOT DELETE&#160;: Annabel has kept the nation amused for years, she is a truly worthy person and has saved many a person from suicidal thoughts. she is VERY well known in Surrey, her biggest fan base.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Over the last year I have become a fan of the Geoff Show and in Particular Annabelle. I think she is a integral part of the show. The show is worldwide. If you are to delete Annabelle port then you must delete all other Radio DJ's that you have listed on this site.</li>

<p>DO NOT DELETE: Annabelle Port is a well known radio presenter and a lot of other Virgin Radio presenters are on Wiki Template:Rvsrvs</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>: Annabelle is indeed a celebrity, and a well known presenter for virgin radio, There are lesser celebrities on wikki!</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sock puppets and rentamobs aside (why is the concept of the word 'keep' always beyond them?) she's co-presenter on the morning radio show on a nationwide station with a listening audience (i.e. number actually listening, not number in the area broadcast) of over 2 million <a href="http://www.mediauk.com/radio/rajar/1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediauk.com/radio/rajar/1" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>, and on more than one occasion a nominee for the Sony Radio Awards.

<li><b>Comment</b> If 10 billion ears listening are still not notable I suggest we just nominate <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> for deletion. And frankly if 2 million people are listening to you everyday then that is more notable than a huge number of people in wikipedia articles.

<p>Do Not Delete: Annabel Port is very well known in the UK, and many other countries as well. If you put an article about pete bennett on Wikipedia, surely you should keep this article. It only needs a bit of tidying up and it will be fine. BackInBlack89</p>

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> When nominated this article was a stub. I did a google search, which quickly revealed an abundance of sources with significant mentions, including national press, TV documentary, questions in parliament and references by politicians. I have added this information to the article and greatly increased it, but I find it extraordinary that the nom either didn't do a google search, or, if he did, didn't see these results, or, if he did see them, failed to recognise their value. Badly researched AfD nominations not only waste community time, but stand to deprive the encyclopedia of worthwhile articles. I note the nominator has also proposed "a number of similar pages for AfD", and I trust he will check carefully to ensure that that is the right course of action for them. It could otherwise look very much like bad faith noms, which is a form of vandalism. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 06:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It was not a bad faith nom - Wikipedia is not a memorial site for IRA terrorists - and this person is not notable.

<p>Article is currently completely unreferenced. Moreover, by the article's admission, the term CORPG has extremely limited use in the industry at best, seemingly limited to Guild Wars and an as-yet unreleased game called Fury. Also note that while the company that produces Guild Wars might use this term to describe its game, it's debatable that the term is widely used anywhere else, with many other sources simply referring to Guild Wars as an MMORPG. So unless the article can produce some verifiable published references to show that the term CORPG is an accepted word in the computer gaming industry, this should probably be deleted as unverified and possibly simply a made-up-phrase used for promotional purposes by Guild Wars marketing. Otherwise you may end up seeing computer games shuffled into Category:CORPGs soon based on an unverified phrase. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I'm familiar with this concept from Guild Wars but it was the company that made GW who coined this phrase and it doesn't apply to anything else. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> having looked at the google searcg Mathmo mentions, I'm not further enlightened.

<li><b>Reply</b>, while I'll expect you are right and it originally came about due to Guild Wars it has however reached a broader range than that. As for a google search, you might find it helps in your search for non guild wars related pages to exclude those pages from the search along with any wikipedia pages.

<dd>If this article is deleted, I agree that a redirect to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild_Wars_01f9.html" title="Guild Wars">Guild Wars</a> is a good idea since the term originates with that game. I notice that the article does now at least list the references to the official Guild Wars manual and Fury manual, which is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to verify Mathmo's links above, but I notice that one of them is a "player review", which can't be used as a citation. But if one of the other hits he mentioned checks out, and can be added to the article as a valid reference, it would bolster the case for keeping. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>questionably notable music group with no references, so I send back to an AfD <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECornellrockey_19bb.html" title="User:Cornellrockey">Cornell Rockey</a> 23:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As discussed in the 1st AFD, no evidence of passing the ancillary criteria of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, much less the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">primary notability criterion</a>. (Someone at the 1st AFD said their website showed 2 albums released on Jade, but I don't see it there, and even if it were there, their website is not reliable.) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:13, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I did a fair bit of looking and appears can't find anything meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. First, two of their albums are self-published—on their official website listed as "Released 2000: © The Old Kings", and two are by <i>Jade Palace Records</i> which appears very minor only 42 Google hits for that label. Every write up on the group I find has the exact same blurb (none at sites one would list as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>), and their album is selling mainly at CDbaby, which appears to take CDs on consignment: "161,069 artists sell their CD at CD Baby". There is some ambiguity. They have a listing at allmusic (just one album) <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=THE|OLD|KINGS&amp;sql=11:ak1gtq9zxu45~T20" class="external autonumber" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=THE|OLD|KINGS&amp;sql=11:ak1gtq9zxu45~T20" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>;and one CD selling on Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Society-Old-Kings/dp/B000CA7RL8/sr=1-2/qid=1169776011/ref=sr_1_2/002-5212682-8301617?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Society-Old-Kings/dp/B000CA7RL8/sr=1-2/qid=1169776011/ref=sr_1_2/002-5212682-8301617?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music" rel="nofollow">[86]</a> with a sales rank of "no rank" and Amazon has thousands of self-published books--is it any different for CDs? No mention in any newspapers I checked.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 02:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> No sources provided, and I can't find any sources that would assert notability, either. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 03:42, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
