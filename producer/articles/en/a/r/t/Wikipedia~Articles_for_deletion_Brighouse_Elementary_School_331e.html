<li><b>Delete.</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, first and foremost. For a subject to have an entry in such a reference work, it must be possible to write an encyclopedic article on the subject - i.e., one that is well-referenced to multiple independent reliable sources. I am unable to see that the subject of this page satisfies that criterion. I am also unable to see anything that persuades me to take an eventualist view with respect to sourcing for this subject. Therefore I believe the page should be deleted. Should good sources on this subject become available in the future, an article can always be written then. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;">Encephalon</span></a> 02:44, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There appears to be an underlying agrument that there are so many schools that only notable ones should be included. Notability (or lack there of) is not a reason for, by itself, for deletion - <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> is not a policy nor is anyone elses acroynm that may be applied to test an article. The vastness of a subject is also not a reason to exclude articles, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> makes the contrary arguement: "<i>This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page.</i>" The only valid argument is the shortness of the current articles, which I agree with. There is an active project to create and edit these pages and I believe that we should be able to ask the indulgence of our fellow wikepedians until we can get all the information into these articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> Even if <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not official policy, it justifies itself on its page via existing policy.

It is thus disingenuous to say that notability is not a legitimate consideration when considering an article's deletion. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 19:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There are many considerations but it was sounding to me like notability (or not) was being used as the measuring stick to keep or delete. My assertion was that notablility is not a criteria in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and it continues to be used as if it were a offical 'rule'. If that is true, regardless of the effort we put into making it a better article it could still be the subject of a AfD request. That certainly puts a chill on anyone that might consider contributing. Wakemp 20:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It's being used as a measuring stick because it is a valid enough concern in evaluating the potential for an encyclopedic article to be written about the subject for it to have made it into official community guidelines. People are not citing notability as a concern just because they don't think that the subject is popular enough to have an article (indeed, popularity has nothing to do with notability), they are doing so because these subjects individually (this one, as well) do not have enough importance to be the primary focus of a single independant verifiable case study, report, or what have you. They are all taken in broad sweeps and wide-ranging reports that include thousands of schools that have no claim at all to any importance outside of the community that they are in. This is the reason people are expressing these complex ideas by explaining (in far fewer words) these sorts of concerns with the possibility of an encyclopedic article about the school in question. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 12:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: As an example of why the above reasoning does not necessarily give you a subject about which it is appropriate to write, take for example if you had an information database of a major veterinary health-care provider that had gobs and gobs of information about individual pets, including detailed health histories, biological information, ownership, etc. While this information can give you the workings of a Wikipedia article that meets many of the technical standards required by policy (Not original research, verifiability, reliable sourcing, citations, etc.), that does not mean that an article for each individual pet would make for appropriately encyclopedic topics. By this logic that is not be appropriate, and it is fairly plain to see that it would be a glaring error on the grounds (I would say of notability, but) that Wikipedia is not for arbitrary collection of information. The standard is something that has come out through consensus, and the fact that the WP:N essay itself is not policy is only evidence that people think notability standards should be addressed in proprietary categories, as I mentioned earlier. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 13:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Either not provide links to other then high schools or delete it. By building a template that is linked to over 1,000 times, it serves to fuel AfD discussions on schools. Why create a template, {{<a href="../../../r/i/c/Template%7ERichmondBCSchools_47c7.html" title="Template:RichmondBCSchools">RichmondBCSchools</a>}}, that allows editors to blindly walk into this ongoing consensus issue battle?

To take the classic example (Star Wars) from many discussion, see <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peragus_II_110c.html" title="Peragus II">Peragus II</a> and the navigation bar {{<a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStarWarsPlanets_8e8c.html" title="Template:StarWarsPlanets">StarWarsPlanets</a>}}. The same in this case, where our school boards have navigation bars. When stubs gets created, then we have stubs to work with, and when they don't have enough content or the quality is lacking, then they get listed at <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html#Cleanup_needed" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC#Cleanup needed</a> with a description of what is wrong with the article. Go ahead and visit that last link to get a better idea of what I'm talking about. --<a href="../../../s/_/c/User%7ES_charette_cc35.html" title="User:S charette">Stephane Charette</a> 06:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As I have said above, I would have no problem including the article if it could be shown that the school has been the subject of multiple reliable sources of independant coverage. So far it has not been shown to have been the subject of more than an entry in a census. Failing that, however, I think that the multiple substub entries on each individual elementary school would be better placed in the school district instead of spread out to an unacceptably sparse level over dozens of almost-contentless articles. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 15:06, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article will benefit from improvement, and is clearly identified as a stub. I am most impressed by the level of structure, organization and thought demonstrated by the <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC</a> initiative and its team members, which makes it clear to me that the promise of expanding these into yet more productive and useful articles is eminently justifiable. I would like to suggest that other areas (perhaps organized by state in the US) would greatly benefit from the methodolgy developed as part of <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC</a>, and I will certainly take advantage of these concepts in expanding the scope of <a href="../../../n/j/_/WP%7ENJ_29f7.html" title="WP:NJ">WP:NJ</a>, which has craeted articles for most New Jersey school districts and a significant percentage of the state's high schools.
