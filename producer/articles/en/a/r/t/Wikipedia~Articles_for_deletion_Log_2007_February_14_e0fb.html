<li><b>Comment</b> - I looked up the webpage on NESARA that is located on Quatloss. It is directly related to the article <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> however, not related to this conspiracy theory which is, <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a>. It does not support any of the information located in it, but talks about the "law" that the NESARA article itself discusses, not the conspiracy this article discusses. Perhaps later I will add it to the NESARA article as a source, however it does not support the ideas of any conspiracy nor even discuss a conspiracy. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Of the 12 references, at least 5 are reliable news media or alternative news media (such as <a href="http://www.quatloos.com/NESARA.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.quatloos.com/NESARA.htm" rel="nofollow">the Quatloos article</a>). That article notes the <u>real</u> NESARA concept, but is over 2/3 about the conspiracy theory (including some commentary by the people behind the real proposal). Even if you were to exclude that, it's over half about the conspiracy/hoax. <i>That</i> being clear, I'm forced to <b>conclude</b> this is a bad faith nomination. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 17:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>More harrassment, you already stated long ago you assume bad faith in everything I do, and magically found your way here. Now I have treated you with respect, and I ask you do the same. More then half of the soruces are not WP:RS, news doesnt mean some random person reported it as such. The WP:RS source is Tacoma as pointed out below and is a local paper, leaving the issue of an entire article sourced to one place, and it not meeting WP:N, since it doesnt have multiple non trivial sources, just a single source of information. Others can easily review the source if they feel I am wrong. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 17:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I hope that people do indeed take the time to review this source, as you are quite obviously wrong. Can you please clarify, did you just read the first sentence of this article or the whole thing? Did you read the second paragraph which begins "Scam artists often latch on to something that sounds good to relieve suckers of money...", or the third paragraph which begins "The NESARA proposal is currently being used in just this sort of a scam...", or the fourth which begins "The scam artists pitching the NESARA scam claim that the 'True NESARA Law' was already adopted by Congress in 2001, but that Congress has been keeping it a secret all this time..."? This article is about the hoax and further substantiates notability. - <a href="../../../s/e/d/User%7ESednar_f2f1.html" title="User:Sednar">Sednar</a> 03:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is Quatloss not using the Tacoma paper as its source? I am being generous in all honesty since much of the links its using to make its case are blogs and non reliable sources, bringing into question what its reporting on. However since it mainly uses Tacoma, and it seems to be the only reliable source in the group, it seems its still just a local issue and fascination. Apparently I am not the only one that feels that way, your friend and someone you commonly agree with Tom, Morton etc all seem to feel you are wrong, anyway it seems concensus is speaking. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:25, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The sources are The Tacoma Tribune (several articles), the documentary (if you haven't seen the movie you can verify the info in the numerous articles about the movie), quatloos, and the conspirator's sites. How does it lack references? If you see a fact in the article in need of a reference, why don't you put a citation needed tag. Also, this article on the conspiracy theory is more notable then the legal proposal ("legitimate version") because it's more well known and almost all the references you find will refer to the conspiracy theory. Although the exact phrase "nesara conspiracy theory" may not be used in the page, even a cursory glance will verify that. Go ahead and look at the first 10 google matches yourself, 9 of them are speaking about the conspiracy theory and not the legal proposal. I don't see any language in the article being used to promote the hoax or spread misinformation, do you? Where? It seems pretty clearly refering to it as a hoax and discussing it as a hoax.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is a strong anti-conspiracy bent among some editors, a belief that since "no one in their right mind could believe this," these theories could not possibly have enough adherents to make them notable. Thus, even an entry for a plainly notable "conspiracy theorist" like Ted Gunderson can get deleted. So we have comments about "a group meeting at KFC once a week," when the article makes it clear that this is just one group of believers. Unfortunately, even theories as outlandish as this can find believers. The WP:V and WP:RS arguments are unconvincing; the Tacoma "local paper" has been disparaged as a non-notable RS, but it is a RS. Furthermore, this article is not promoting the theory; it clearly presents the case against it. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 16:01, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I admit that the Tacoma Tribune is a reliable source. I believe that this story should only be kept if it meets the requirements of WP:HOAX, i.e. that it fools a lot of people; it needs to be a notable hoax. This fact I believe is not established by the current sources. Arguments that 'Some people claim this..' and 'Some people claim that..' don't seem very convincing. The total documented extent of the hoax (from the Tribune article) is that one person was scammed out of $10,000 (this is so far just a claim filed with the attorney general) and 'possibly much more' (a speculative extrapolation). <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 15:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Another concession, another objection put up in its place... But this one doesn't stand up to scrutiny either. You mention one of the articles, and the fact that it only refers to one person who had money taken, but again this is selective reporting on your part (perhaps unintentionally). In the rest of the Tribune's articles on the subject, and in the documentary film on the subject, and in the articles about the documentary film, there are many more people quoted and interviewed, who may not have given money, but who definitely profess a belief in it. The sheer number of blogs and web pages devoted to NESARA (and its supposed imminent announcement and "wonderful changes it will bring about") demonstrates the number of people that believe this. Thousands? I'm not sure, but many hundreds is clearly evident. "'Some people claim this..' and 'Some people claim that..'" are all backed up by the sources provided, including the documentary film about the subject, and it's simply a matter of reading them all to verify this. I've challenged people to put citation needed tags in the proper place on the article where they feel that there are unsourced statements, so far nobody has done this. I've been puzzling over the hostility towards this article, and I think I understand the real issue... I've noticed that a number of people wanting this article deleted have also edited 9/11 articles, and I see that someone put this article in the "9/11 conspiracy theories" template. So I think the real issue, which nobody is bringing up, is that people feel that this is not a prominent 9/11 conspiracy theory. I agree that it is not particularly notable as a 9/11 conspiracy theory (especially when there is only one other theory listed in the template). But I think <b>removing this article from that template, which I would support, is the proper response, and not throwing the baby out with the bathwater by deleting the entire article</b>. - <a href="../../../s/e/d/User%7ESednar_f2f1.html" title="User:Sednar">Sednar</a> 03:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. For the following reason - NESARA may have started out as a minor aspect of a larger Confidence Scheme but through the tireless promotion of the concept by Dove of Oneness and others who truly believe in it, it's started to pop up in the writings of other major conspiracy theorists. You'll see talk of NESARA in with David Icke, The New World Order, The Trilateral Commission, and yes, 9/11. NESARA seems to "feel" right to folks looking for another reason to balme 9/11 on anyone but the Hamburg Cell. Yes, the article needs some work, but a basic description of what the term means, how it originated, it's incorpration into the Con and then its extension into New Age conspiracism should stay.<a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisapollison_fe0d.html" title="User:Lisapollison">LiPollis</a> 18:49, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Private Jonhson, of the US Army, is one of the three thousand plus soldiers who died in Iraq. However, some believe that just him belonging in the 507 Maintenance Unit, the same unit as Jessica Lynch and the first female KIA since Vietnam. For those using the Google test, his name will appear in many locations, mostly due to many websites either being dedicated to the 507th or to listing the names of all Iraqi dead, US and collaition. My contention is that other than being killed in Iraq and part of a unit, he has not done anything else notable to warrant an article on Wikipedia. (Most of the content is about what happened at a memorial service, two medals presented and a park named after him). <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 05:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, First soldier from Alabama killed in OIF. The Governor of Alabama attended his funeral along with a US Congressman and Senator. Eulogized on the floor on the US Senate. Name not only appears on standard listings of OIF dead but twice in the Congressional Record and Alabama Congressman Joe Bonner's website. He is also in Jessica Lynch's book as well as Richard S. Lowry's book <i>Marines in the Garden of Eden</i>. The City of Mobile and the Alabama legislature have both passed resolutions honoring him. If the 2,000 death in OIF/OEF can have a Wikipeda page why not Howard Johnson II? Ehrentitle 00:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

However, the articles are definitely written in non-encyclopedic POV manner, contain a disproportionate amount of detail, and in total sound like advertisements that came off the main events' site. I'm afraid there's no comparing this to the NHL; I hear about the NHL all the time but I have never heard of the "UFC", and I think I probably speak for the majority of North Americans, at least. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcemuon_5e0d.html" title="User:Icemuon">Icemuon</a> 21:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> all <i>UFC xx</i> articles into one main article. The UFC events might be notable enough for an article, but not notable enough for individual articles.

<ul>
<li>I think a merge isn't a bad idea. No doubt we won't get a delete consensus on all the articles, but also it's a bit ridiculous to have an article detailing each happening of every single event. It would take a lot of trimming and not all the information of each article would be kept in the merged article. This <i>is</i> on topic, since why should this article be deleted if all the others are kept? This is as good a place to discuss it as any. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcemuon_5e0d.html" title="User:Icemuon">Icemuon</a> 21:15, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. This would not be an insanely long article, as all the repetition would be removed, and each article's contribution could be trimmed down to one row in a table, detailing the winners of each event. This would not only be neater and more encyclopedic, it would also be a far better way to present the data in the first place. —<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgan_almighty_3d50.html" title="User:Gorgan almighty">gorgan_almighty</a> 09:25, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete pending references</b> The subject itself will probably be notable, so odds are an article of some sort about the event will eventually be kept. But this particular article is entirely unreferenced and unverified. Delete unless it can be more properly referenced, and if deleted hold off on recreating until proper sources are available. FYI, I do <i>not</i> recommend merging otherwise properly referenced articles about individual pay-per-view events into a single article; that is not consistent with similar pay per views, such as Professional Wrestling pay per views. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As I mentioned on this article's talk page, I do think that this article meats notability requirements. This page discuses a website of fairly significant importance; though made public a mere month ago, Quizlet has more than 6,000 users. It has been mentioned in two Lifehacker posts, a quite popular blog, and included on del.icio.us's popular list. Quizlet was also mentioned on ajaxian.com, digg.com, decrem.com, macmegasite.com, screeniac.com, webware.com, fortysomething.ca, and other sites. Further, Quizlet's creator, Andrew Sutherland, made an appearance at Stirr, discussing Quizlet, to much popularity. The article's initial speedy deletion tag was added, as was also stated on the article's talk page, before much of the details were added.&#160;» <a href="../../../k/i/g/User%7EKigoe_8c8b.html" title="User:Kigoe"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, sans-serif;">K <strong>i</strong> G O E</span></a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../k/i/g/User_talk%7EKigoe_55df.html" title="User talk:Kigoe"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, sans-serif; color: #999999;">talk</span></a> 00:47, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I'm the president of the real Global Wrestling Alliance and it looks like someone has pulled a rather stupid prank on myself and the rest of the guys who call the GWA home. I support the decision to delete this page. For reference, the real website to this company is www.fwrestling.com/host/globalwrestling We did not do this post, and, like I've said, support the decision to have it removed. --- Michael Calcutt... the handler of Marcus Helms.</p>

<p>What is with the wave of people trying to delete articles. I've noticed this many times before. Is wikipedia really that low on database resources? This deleting craze is getting out of hand.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I suspect that if I dug deep enough, I would discover that SatuSuro is right: this is a small but not insignificant part of the historic fabric of conservation and biodiversity awareness in Western Australia. But even if notable, is it verifiable? <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 12:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I agree with SatuSuro; please dont <a href="../../../s/t/e/WP%7ESTEAM_fa07.html" title="WP:STEAM">steamroll</a> this one as it will take time to find offline references. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 18:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I am aware that guidelines exist for Wiki articles and also that there are guidelines for nomination for deletion. At the risk of sounding as if I am taking this personally (I am not) I will say that I am disappointed by the off-hand manner in which this process has been conducted by certain individuals, noting in particular that the first request for deletion came <i>within 24 hours of the article's first appearance</i>, by an editor who also removed the the <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7EStub_4d03.html" title="WP:Stub">stub notice</a>. I take it that I should have placed the article under 'conservation,' however I'll repeat that this is my first article at Wiki. Part of my learning curve has been to realise editors here bounce back and forth between their own discussion pages to 'talk'...and that more comments existed than those on the GWN talk page. <i>(continued without indent)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Of the editors and administrators who've commented so far, I'd like to thank <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> for following nomination guidelines by welcoming me as a newcomer, suggesting improvements and finally for looking for references himself to improve the Great Walk Networking page. Also, for his thoughtful commentary: <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> appears to know what Great Walk Networking is. In addition, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">Jayvdb</a> has added further references: both since the request AFD notice went up.</p>
<p>In addition, on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreat_Walk_Networking_d7b5.html" title="Talk:Great Walk Networking">GWN Talk page</a> I've clearly indicated that the Great Walk "does not seek new members, financial contribution, nor does it seek to self-promote: This is not a 'non-notable autobiography or advertising/promotional page.'" Reference to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConflict_of_interest_df77.html" title="WP:Conflict of interest">COI page</a> lists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Self-promotion</b>: Conflict of interest often presents itself in the form of self-promotion, including advertising links, personal website links in articles, personal or semi-personal photos, or any other material that appears to promote the private or commercial interests of the editor adding the material, or of his associates. Examples of these types of material include: 1. Links that appear to promote products by pointing to obscure or not particularly relevant commercial sites (commercial links). 2. Links that appear to promote otherwise obscure individuals by pointing to their personal pages. 3. Biographical material that does not significantly add to the clarity or quality of the article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Walk_Networking_65f0.html" title="Great Walk Networking">Great Walk Networking</a> article does not fit these criteria, especially with the addition of external references that would render the claims of the page verifiable. I believe this point has been fully addressed on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreat_Walk_Networking_d7b5.html" title="Talk:Great Walk Networking">GWN Talk page</a>. While I am a member of GWN, I am not on a membership drive or attempting to promote an event. My genuine belief is that, with the help of others as has occurred during the last couple of days, this single concern will be addressed when the documentary from 1990 on GWN is digitalised and made available online, early copies of "Bambaroo" are made available online, and members of the GWN and other people from Western Australia are able to edit and enhance this page.</p>
<p>The only other grounds that have been made for deletion are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notability</a>. Again, with references that are available, but offline and will take time to source, there is no ground for deletion on notability criteria. I am concerned, however, that some (judging by comments on talk pages) are already using biased language to discuss grounds for deletion: "greenies", "bunch of bushwalkers", "itching" for a deletion, "It really could be speedied, and I certainly wouldn't blink an eye if you went ahead and did it..." In addition, no reason has been associated for this AFD and the person who made the nomination hasn't entered into the debate at all (in any meaninful way), so I can't address her concern directly.</p>
<p>There is a regretable lack of history regarding this type of movement: State funds have not been made available for anything other than a statewide history of the environment movement, and no one has been willing to undertake that task because the topic is too broad to prepare a meaningful history. Great Walk Networking is a unique example of a group that has a 20 year history, starting off as a protest event but evolving into a grassroots conservation movement. It does not lobby, form direct action, petition or engage in activities normally associated with conservation groups. Instead it provides opportunity to literally 'Walk' the land...both pristine and damaged...to people of all age groups. It is more than a bushwalking association...and arguably more closely linked to the One Voice Movement in philosophy. It is notable and of historical significance to the conservation movement and would make a good entry to this encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Offline sources spread between Denmark and Perth have been difficult to source, but the process is underway. I also ask that the page not be <a href="../../../s/t/e/WP%7ESTEAM_fa07.html" title="WP:STEAM">steamrolled</a>. It's under development, hence the <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7EStub_4d03.html" title="WP:Stub">stub notice</a></p>
<p>I also thank <a href="../../../h/e/s/User%7EHesperian_7491.html" title="User:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> for removing the COI and comments made on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreat_Walk_Networking_d7b5.html" title="Talk:Great Walk Networking">GWN Talk page</a>.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Where are you people seeing "verifiablity and notability". Please discuss the sources because no one has backed up anything. There are NO souces at all. Numbers 2 and 3 are merely lists of non profit organisations with this organisation being mentioned in the list, not nobitibility is shown at all here to meet the <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> standard. The 1st reference does not mention the organisation at all. No other verifiability or assertion of notibility, so it fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Further reading is two newsletters, and the book is only published and distributed locally and does not show any notibility of its own. Is it bad luck for the author it is but Wikipedia has standards because small non notable organisations like this are not encylopedic. To be kept it should haven notable media coverage etc. I did not found any mention when searching QLD newspapers back to 1995.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 03:22, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are correct that reference 1 does not mention GWN.

<li><b>Comment</b> Your last comment says everything. QLD newspapers are not the location of source of western australian environmental organisations. By the citeria you are setting, notability of considerable numbers of articles thoughout wikipedia would be taken off - many Australian state based organisations and issues in between states are simply not reported - have a look in national library of australia - is it mentioned there? Also - I challenge you to find any reference to the west coast tasmania wilderness railway in a western australian newspaper - it consumed the daily press the examiner and hobart mercury weekly because of nefarious dealings all around - i bet that never hit qld or wa press once.... Please try to look beyond newspaper sources. And to go to 1995 shows the article has not been read properly 1988-1995 was the main period in which it was getting local coverage in WA.... <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">Satu</a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">Suro</a> 22:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">Satu</a> and am also unsure why <a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> has chosen to do a limited search (eg limited to a peculiar choice of years) of a Queensland paper (or papers? which? btw) to search for a Western Australian conservation organisation. Nonetheless, to say there are <i>"NO sources at all"</i> is not correct. <i>Bambooroo</i> is not a book (as a cursory inspection of the link would have verified), but was a local conservation magazine published by the Great Walk and it represented an early and important contribution to the conservation movement in WA. Its editors, btw, are still significant figures in conservation to this day. In addition, a PhD thesis including information about the Great Walk and a magazine article focused exclusively on GWN have also been cited towards notability. The references are given to verify material presented within the article, one <a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> mentions is listed to verify the formation of organisations in 1975 that simply no longer exist. Of course it is correct to reference the mention of them. Please also note this <b>stub</b> is only an <i>introduction</i>: the subject is notable in terms of Western Australian history, and is most certainly verifiable. <i>Bambooroo</i>, in particular, deserves an entire section on its own (and will get it, provided this article is given adequate time to get itself off the ground).

<li><b>Delete</b> I have played dozens of games with "Akimbo" gun modes, but I have never heard this term. I have heard of "dual wield" with the same meaning, in any case I do not see any reason to think that this is a notable slang term. The "dual wield" phenomenon however is a notable video game and movie concept but this article is not much of a starting point and the name is probably wrong. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - It's true enough that the cartoon character predated the games, but calling it the "Yosemite Sam Position" would introduce both notability and OR issues, since nobody actually calls it that - at least, no one who's used that phrase on a website reachable from a search engine (images by themselves would not contribute to an article without introducing POV commentary).

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b> most of the keep is per IZAK but the fact that it is "part of a series" treasured by a special-interest wikiproject is neither here nor there. The whole thing is totally unsourced anyway. Delete case is far stronger. Case for deleting the sublists is overwhelming, and just maybe the main article could be recreated as a sourced article without redlinks at a later stage - I'm deleting without prejudice to that possibility. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 00:17, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Peruvian_Jews_e73a.html" title="List of Peruvian Jews">List of Peruvian Jews</a> is clearly some attempt to make a point about Jews in Peru's society. Notice the amount of businessmen. Wikipedia's comment on overcategorization tells us that categories like LGBT literature are reasonable but LGBT nuclear physics is not. Therefore we can derive that LGBT writers is a category worth having but LGBT nuclear physicists isn't. This same idea can be applied to lists and "overlisting." While Jewish Americans is a valid division of people because America has the biggest Jewish population in the world, Jewish Peruvians is not because Jews probably have no more than 10,000 people of their ethnic group living there. If this were allowed to continue, we'd be inviting representatives of any Peruvian-BLANK ethnicity making lists for somewhat notable people form their community. This opens up the opportunity for List of Peruvian-Italians, Peruvian-Chinese, Peruvian-CanaryIslander and so on. This same idea could be applied to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Mexican_Jews_1a6b.html" title="List of Mexican Jews">List of Mexican Jews</a> another massive red-linked list with no ultimate purpose except to prove some type of point. A category for both Peruvian and Mexican Jews is perfectly sufficient for anyone who does happen to be both Mexican/Peruvian and Jewish. Filling up lists with as many Mexicans and Peruvians you can find who's names sound Jewish is not encyclopedic or helpful. It is the list version of "overcategorization."

<li><b>Delete</b>. I tried last year to tidy up the unholy mess that had been created around here (there was once a "List of Jewish Peruvian Astronomer", which included a grand total of one name) and was hopeful that someone would be able to write useful articles on some of the names here.

The anonymous author edit has been deleted- although it is noteworthy to mention that the anonymous author DID edit more substantively than this Article intially asserted, adding a reference to an outside source (a student newspaper). That reference has been incorporated into the body of the article. I believe this article is sufficiently noteworthy as to avoid deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> Per previous: It should also be noted that in non-campusnewspapers in towns of similar size to a university community, or even in large cities, that articles about groups in the town may be influenced by friendships between members of the group and the reporter or publisher, and that a campus paper with an independent editorial board can in fact be as reliable a source as a paper in the town, so there is no policy that they are automatically excluded.

<p>There was no Ontario Liberal Party leadership convention in 1942. Conant was an interim leader and was chosen by his predecessor. The actual convention was the next year and Conant was not a candidate, see <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Ontario_leadership_convention%2C_1943_432e.html" title="Liberal Party of Ontario leadership convention, 1943">Liberal Party of Ontario leadership convention, 1943</a>.

<ul>
<li>It wasn't cancelled, there simply was not one scheduled until the next year and that one has an article. This article is a bit like having US Democratic Party convention, 1963. There's no need for a redirect as nothing links to this article and no one would look up an article under this name since the assertion made by its title is false. <a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixth_Estate_40d8.html" title="User:Sixth Estate">Sixth Estate</a> 04:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see. However, if someone was searching for a leadership convention in 1942, is there a way to send them over to the right year? Maybe redirect all years without a leadership convention to the general article on leadership conventions. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_H_c9c6.html" title="User:Just H">Just H</a> 15:16, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect and Protect</b> as the nominator. The results section is just cruft. Remove all the other cruft and the instuctions on how to use the channel (which is not allowed) and you have info that can be (and already is) covered at Wii Channels. Also, this is a discussion and not a vote. So votes like Purplepurplepurple won't carry much (if any) weight when deciding what to do with this. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 22:44, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If all the Wii Channels simply have all their information on the Wii Channels page, then eventually that page will be crowded and hard to read and manage, very un encycolpedic (if that's a word). Also, information will have to be limited due to space constraints, and this will result in poor quality information. All in all, every Wii Channel that has some significance (Minus Virtual Console channels and built in wii channels, and any trivial channels) deserves it's own article, as this is the mission of wikipedia, to be a global knowledge repository, to provide the masses with an easy to use, and reliable encyclopedia, to give the gift of information, even on something so trivial as a ballot. That's my take anyways. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif902_387c.html" title="User:Leif902">Leif902</a> 23:16, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>My my my, aren't we aggressive today?&#160;:-) What I'm saying: 1 day after something has come out, the implications on society, life, gaming history and the legacy of the Wii cannot be seriously addressed, and therefore it is too early to give a definite answer whether to delete or keep the article. Since I do not wish for somebody to create the article again in a few weeks when we can address this question more clearly, I want to preserve the article now. And since we cannot foster a proper article by killing it prematurely, my vote here is keep.

If they had some serious voting, like on characters to add to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Brother_Brawl_ce66.html" title="Super Smash Brother Brawl">Super Smash Brother Brawl</a> or anything else that could affect future development, then it would probably warrant its own article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just look at the article, damnit. There's nothing wrong with it at all. Deleting it because 'it could also just be written in one paragraph on the Wii Channels page' is dumb. We could also just write one paragraph of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Channel_6f14.html" title="Internet Channel">Internet Channel</a> on the Wii Channels page, and delete that article.

<li>The Internet Channel has potential to be expanded since the current version is a trial and its very likely many more features, and thus more information, when the final product is released. This channel is pretty much in its final form and, unless we start listing polls or something significant is polled, very little, if any, more information will become available. Most of the information not found in the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_Channels_ef15.html" title="Wii Channels">Wii Channels</a> article is about how to use the channel. The two or three lines could easy be merged to the Wii Channels article.

<li><b>Keep</b>: This provides information, and will quickly become a very good article. I think maybe every Official Nintendo channel (excluding the default channels such as the News and Weather and Photo channels) merits its own article just as every individual piece of software in a series merits its own article. You wouldn't just make one article for every game in the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_Zelda_2f46.html" title="Legend of Zelda">Legend of Zelda</a> series would you?

<li>Agreed that WP is not an Instruction manual. I've just added an example to the description which is just to show the working of What's<i>Best!</i> and defintely <b>not</b> as a How to guide.

<p>What makes this list encyclopedic or of value? The sole reference is a forum thread, which last I checked wasn't considered a reliable source. If the article is only a rehashing of whats in that thread I don't see the value or benefit of it being on wikipedia. I realize that HL2 is a big important franchise in the gaming world, but every little detail and piece of minutia surrounding it are not necessarily important or needed coverage. To nip it in the bud, arguments from <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> aren't good reasons to keep this article.<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 05:16, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b>. Some of the stuff the article covers is notable--the source code leak, for instance, was a big deal at the time, and reliable sources could be found for it--see <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/10/07/half_life_2_leak_means/" class="external text" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/10/07/half_life_2_leak_means/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/11/halflife_2_arrests/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/11/halflife_2_arrests/" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, for instance, assuming that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Register_1954.html" title="The Register">The Register</a> is a RS.

The forum post might be a reliable source as well, since it was made by the president of Valve.

<dd>The post on sciforums links to a non-existent steam thread. At the most the original post made by an identifiable company individual can be considered reliable (one of the only things a forum post can be used for) but none of the resulting comments from Joe User can be used as a source for anything. So really we have no sources in the article. I know the source code leak was big, and it would make sense to merge that one item with the parent article, but if nothing else can be properly source it should be removed.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:32, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An article without proper sources is inherently without value on wikipedia. Unless sources can be provided, regardless of is "value" it doesn't belong here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:32, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with the main article. I don't believe any so-called criticisms of the game are widespread enough to justify a separate article which by its very existence comes off as a bit of a POV fork. If merging adds too much content to the HL2 article, there may be items here that could be instead merged with the article on Valve Software. To reply to the comment by Crossmr, lack of sources is not an immediate cause for deletion; even the current guideline/policy (whatever you call it) allows for time for sources to be added and this can be done as part of the merge. There are plenty of "of value" articles on Wikipedia that either lack sources (and are awaiting addition of same upon request) or have sources but in the POV of some editors the sources aren't valid. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:34, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia isn't a primary source. So the truest piece of information in the world really doesn't add to an article if you can't prove it. The article has been around long enough that someone should have provided sources. I asked 8 days ago, and none have been provided or even discussed as on the way. I'm not saying there aren't sources, but if this article goes through an AfD, and all we end up with is some sources on the source code leak, I don't feel comfortable merging anything else until sources are provided for the information. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> places the burden of evidence on the editor who wants the material kept. There is no requirement to keep the material indefinitely or move it around until someone can be bothered to look to see if there is actually a source for it.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:47, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but trim down to the things verifiable from reliable sources (like the source code leak).

<li><b>Oppose</b> I'm not so sure about this; I don't like the overblown list of people who've played facilities operated by or through hosting services by this company (whichever; I should read it more closely but it seems to be somewhat both), but it still seems to have an important profile in the local entertainment-services infrastructure sector. The Washington Group, another holding company and also Orca Bay Entertainment (hmm, maybe I don't have those names right?...I wonder hmmm about Perryscope, which should have an article), are the same kind of fish; not notable in the public eye, but very much so within the economic infrastructure. I think it needs paring-down, and a less press-release kind of sound, but the ownership of the Victoria hockey team and certain other items in its list of assets/enterprises make it notable, if only on a BC/Victoria level basis.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 09:27, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep.</b> I'll try to say this kindly, because it seems that the nominator (from now on, "you") is new to AFD and isn't yet familiar with how it works. The number one rule for deleting articles is that there needs to be something wrong with <b>that particular article</b>. For example, if you write an article that says, "I played baseball with my friend and we made a youtube video and we will sell you the video for $3.14," that's bad for multiple reasons: it's not verifiable (how does anyone else know it happened?), it's not notable (why should we care), and it violates "neutral point of view" (it's an advertisement). The article that was nominated has none of those problems - it's totally fine. It contains some material that's not in <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justinian_I_7f49.html" title="Justinian I">Justinian I</a>. However, if you think that <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corpus_Juris_Civilis_1a19.html" title="Corpus Juris Civilis">Corpus Juris Civilis</a> should not have its own article, you should suggest a <b>merge</b> with Justinian. If you want to know how to do this, leave me a message on my talk page. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 06:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note.</b> So much for assuming good faith: the nominator has no edits on Wikipedia except this AFD. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 06:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That's not a reason to vote that way. I have given links to 7 of these contestants, who have equal notability to Camille, and they have all been deleted. The 2 AFD processes (which are not recent, at least 5-6 months old) had very few users commenting, and the evidence was pretty poor, along the lines of "we don't need to delete everyone" or "she seems notable". The first one was a no consensus, and the other was posted far too soon compared to the first one. This article should be deleted like the others, no questions asked. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 23:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, AfD is all about asking questions and following procedures. Technically we don't "vote" at AfD we form consensus. You seem to perceive your judgement to be better than all of the AfD participants who suggested "Keep" and the admins who evaluated the consensus. Isn't that a bit arrogant?</li>
<li>At my age 6 years is recent, 6 months is a blink.</li>
<li>First AfD was 3 keeps and 1 delete.</li>

Her part in Wedding Crashers was a bit part, she isn't listed on the first page of the IMDB profile page.

The sources you give don't pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and you need far more than those (and can't just be mentions in passing) to pass WP:BIO.

Furthermore, there is a violation of <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> here as the article talks about the wikipedia article itself. The wiki article, was a probably a stimulus for this "craze" among NYU students. I put craze in quotes because the article does not actually explain the importance of the subject, or the relative size of the facebook group to similar groups or the student body as a whole (not that facebook size in an indication of importance anyways)). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanski14_d77d.html" title="User:Danski14">Danski14</a> 04:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>&#160;: Yes, I have read it; and in no way is the NYU tech department, a group of computer professionals, dependent or directly connected to the staff of the Washington Square News. That'd be like saying a journalist investigating Wal-Mart is connected to them because they frequently shop there -- the tech people who brought about the dinosaur's existence have merely created a service that NYU students (and, by association, the WSP staff) use. I can't say much regarding the inclusion of Wikipedia article; however, I can assure you its inclusion on Wikipedia had little to no effect on the spread of the 'craze;' that anyone is aware that it is on Wikipedia is a direct result of direct linking from the Facebook group, which is the start of much of the hype. Finally, what reasoning do you use for not having the "importance of the subject" directly given in the article? It is something that has captured the imagination and interest of students across one of the largest universities in America; how is this any less relevant than, say, another article in the In-jokes category?

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> with some other NYU related article. While it might not seem totally relevant to everyone, NYU <i>is</i> the nation's largest private University and this is on par with the other In-Jokes as a previous poster stated. This happens a lot when an article has an eye-catching name for those who patrol the newly created pages and is more relevant than a completely irrelevant article with an innocuous name. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseRafe_93c8.html" title="User:JesseRafe">JesseRafe</a> 18:54, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess I don't have a problem with a merge, although I don't know where it can be merged. I looked over the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">NYU</a> main page, and the page is already seems very list-heavy on "jargon", "trivia", and "traditions". Therefore, I would like to propose that we create a page "NYU traditions" or "Student life and culture at NYU", (simliar to <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_life_and_culture_at_MIT_3b33.html" title="Student life and culture at MIT">Student life and culture at MIT</a>). This is just a suggestion... I'm not sure how much should be merged into any new article. Obviously you would want to keep the most notable traditions on the main page... so it might not be a good idea right now. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanski14_d77d.html" title="User:Danski14">Danski14</a> 20:52, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nah. Its just one (of many) images that randomly appear on one (of thousands) of NYU-related web pages. The fact the campus paper wrote a cute little story about it (recursively citing the wiki page) doesn't establish notability even for mention in a different article. It is much too trivial and ephemeral. I bet fewer than 50 students would even know what it is come Monday. --<a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimZalaBim_b724.html" title="User:ZimZalaBim">ZimZalaBim</a> (<a href="../../../z/i/m/User_talk%7EZimZalaBim_f21c.html" title="User talk:ZimZalaBim">talk</a>) 02:15, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article features no reliable independent sources, and I'm unable to find any. In the absence of such sources, there's nothing to base an article upon. I withdrew a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kathmandu_University_High_School_adf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kathmandu University High School">previous AfD</a> since it was suggested that sources exist but were simply difficult to find. Since then -- over three months ago -- there has been no significant change to the article, suggesting none of its previous supporters were able to discover sources either. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:32, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think this is excessive deletionism. As far as I know we do not have editors from Nepal. If we did, I am sure they would find press reports. The links are from the School's own web site, but nobody has suggested they are a hoax. They suggest it is one of the most notable Schools in Nepal. WP has plenty of articles that only have internal links. OK, what I am suggesting is not rigorously supported by the rules, but common sense suggests it be left, unless you have reasons to suppose it is a hoax or not notable. On notability, it clearly is, unless it is all a hoax. I do not think it is a hoax. Let it be for a while. I say, <b>Strong Keep</b>. A stub will do for now. The article will come later, probably when we get Wikipedians from Nepal. Nepal is not the US or Europe. Give it a break. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 10:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There's doesn't seem to be a hint of a hoax as verifiable links exist, but why is it clearly notable, notable in Nepal for what reason? Until this is asserted in the article then I will leave my vote as is. About <i>the article will come later</i> the exact same was stated in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kathmandu_University_High_School_adf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kathmandu University High School">previous</a> AfD, and it has not developed. A quick google look shows that it is not the only university in Nepal, Tribhuvan University seems like it was first, which would be the only thing I would think of it being notable.

<li>It isn't a university. All universities are notable. It is a High School run by the university. Many High Schools are generally considered notable and one run by the university in the capital seems so. Google is not likely to be a good source for Nepal. This is a developing country. Yes, it will take time for us to get editors in Nepal to write a decent article. What is wrong with the stub? It is usefull and makes no crazy claims. What do we really gain by deleting this? Does it help getting better information from Nepal? I do not think so. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:38, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What is wrong with the stub is a lack of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. We do not encourage articles about people or businesses whose only reference is their own website, and we should not encourage articles about schools whose only reference is their own website. That isn't reliable, because it isn't independent -- and a lack of sources is an indicator of a lack of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a>. (And of course they suggest it's one of the best schools in Nepal -- what else would they say about themselves?) When and if we do get editors from Nepal who can provide such sources, the article can be rewritten. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 16:57, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As always, per basic Wikipedia principles, we need a claim of notability, and supporting references. These are neither provided nor apparent, so the article fails our guidelines and must go. No objection to re-creation if our criteria can be met, of course. I also wish to say that I deplore <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloachland_b3ab.html" title="User:Cloachland">Cloachland</a>'s attempt to cast this discussion as one of cultural diversity, which looks to me like a deliberate attempt to muddy a straightforward debate: no-one here, least of all I, is objecting to the article on the grounds of the school's location and culture, we are objecting to it because it ( like many many other school articles ) fails our basic criteria for retention. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:57, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The point as I see it that it is more difficult to find sources in Third World countries and that the School's own site is adequate for the small amount of information that it is contained. The fact that a national university of Nepal (see the University's web site) runs a School make it notable. If we could access more information we would likely find they use it to train teachers in their Faculty of Education. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:15, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with Bduke. There are only seven articles in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchools_in_Nepal_56a9.html" title="Category:Schools in Nepal">Category:Schools in Nepal</a>. When there are 100s in the category, I could appreciate an attempt to reduce the list down to the most notable, but at this stage the fact that someone has bothered to write an article about the school in itself demonstrates that it is a notable part of the countries infrastructure. I have just created the <a href="../../../d/h/u/Dhulikhel.html" title="Dhulikhel">Dhulikhel</a> article, and could only find WP articles relating to <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathmandu_University_876e.html" title="Kathmandu University">Kathmandu University</a> for this township.

The article does need some verifiable, reliable sources but I don't think that is a reason to delete an article on a subject from a region where online sources are understandably spotty. Perhaps someone will a get a chance to run it through Factiva.

<p>Article is unreferenced, and google turns up nothing promising. The creator of this article has previously created nonsense pages. The details are fishy, so I suspect a hoax. I can't find any evidence that k-mart owns any British shopping malls.

<p>I have tried using Prod, but it was deleted. My contention is that this particular calendar is just one man's opinion and is not notable. The idea that there are faults with the Hebrew calendar is certainly notable, and is or should be discussed in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_calendar.html" title="Hebrew calendar">Hebrew calendar</a>. The <i>different</i> proposal to improve the calendar, made decades ago by Dr. Feldman, may be notable, but that has no bearing on whether this proposal is notable.--<a href="../../../r/6/1/User%7ER613vlu_fd45.html" title="User:R613vlu">R613vlu</a> 12:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Sorry about deleting Prod, the mistake of an inexperienced Wikipedia editor. If Feldman's proposal "may be notable" (keeping in mind that he published it on a single page out of 239 in 1931 with hardly any arithmetic to back up his proposal), then why wouldn't a demonstrably superior reform that is comprehensively documented not be at least as "notable"? The Wikipedia Hebrew calendar entry is long enough, and most people who go there would not be interested in any reform proposal, nevertheless links from there to reform proposals would be appropriate.

<dd>As many others I consider the interpretation of the Wikipolicy that only printed matter can be reliable, ludicrous in the Internet age.

<dd>Firstly, this is a discussion, <b>not</b> a vote.
<dl>
<dd>Interesting. Why then does everybody in this and other deletion sections say "keep" or "delete"? (yes I now the end result is not just a tally of the "keeps" or "deletes"). And if this is a discussion then why is my expressed opinion irrelevant? - TP
<dl>
<dd>Keep or delete (or merge or whatever) is a recommendation for what should happen to the article, not a vote. Please read <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>; Your personal opinion on whether a proposal is any good or not is irrelevant because Wikipedia is based on verifiability, not editor's personal opinions. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 08:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Secondly, please re-read the non-negotiable policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>: it doesn't matter if something is true. If it isn't verified, it has no place on Wikipedia.
<dl>
<dd>So even a mathematical derivation is considered "not verified"? What weird universe does this come from??? - TP
<dl>
<dd>The Wikipedia universe. A question for you: is Andrew Wiles's proof of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_f4b0.html" title="Fermat's Last Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> is correct or not? Your argument would appear to be saying "it's a mathematical derivation, therefore it's automatically verified".

This simply hasn't been done here. It doesn't matter whether proponents can convince me (or anyone else here) that the proposal has mathematical or religious merit.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Notability is asserted due to longevity of the 'daily' comic (6 years). Notability is asserted in that it's in it's second print volume.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As is usual for <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a>'s webcomic AFD nominations, a deceptively low Google search value is given based on a rare search term combination. Even "pirate cove"+Angelo gives 656 hits. "Pirate Cove"+webcomic gives 3450 hits, and "Pirate Cove"+comic gives 74,600 hits, about half of which seem to be about other things. Top two hits for "pirate cove"+comic+wired give you Wired news and also (oddly enough) Buffetnews.com, which mentions it several times. At this point I'm not sure about notability of the article, but I am disappointed at Fram not having improved the AFD habits which I have criticized already. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 02:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Why would I change my search habits when they seem to return all the hits that could possible be non-trivial mentions from reliable sources, while excluding passing mentions and irrelevant hits, mostly about unrelated things? Take e.g. your buffettnews.com: this is a fan site for a musician, not a reliable source at all. So again, it looks to me like you can't find any reliable sources beyond those I already provided, but still you feel the need to attack me.

<dd>I've asked you numerous times to engage in more than a cursory effort to find sources before putting up an AFD, but you clearly haven't. In this case, for example, you searched for <i>Joe</i> D'Angelo rather than simply D'Angelo as would have been standard. As has been demonstrated in the case of The Parking Lot is Full and other AFDs, your searches are (a) inadequate and (b) do not establish a lack of notability. I cannot in good conscience vote to delete the article until an adequate argument has been offered for lack of notability, not simply "I searched using a poorly chosen combination of terms and managed to get a low hit-count." <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 11:47, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>To start with your last comment: what have I misrepresented? Further: I cannot prove a negative (i.e. "establish a lack of notability"), it is up to you to show the opposite, that there indeed is some notability. As for the rest of your comments: search for "Pirate Cove" "d'Angelo" -"Joe d'Angelo" (i.e. all the links my search didn't have, but your "standard" search finds):<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22pirate+cove%22+%22d%27angelo%22+-wikipedia+-%22joe+d%27angelo%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22pirate+cove%22+%22d%27angelo%22+-wikipedia+-%22joe+d%27angelo%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> you get 31 additional distinct hits, but <i>none</i> of them are about the comic. Conclusion: all your "standard" search has done when compared to my "inadequate" and "cursory" one "using a poorly chosen combination of terms" is increase the raw numbers to make the return look more impressive, without even adding one single relevant hit, nevermind it being from a reliable source or being more than a passing mention. For the final time: please refrain from making these completely baseless attacks on me and my search methods: you haven't given in any of these webcomics AfD's a relevant and even slightly reliable source that was not included in my original search. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Such as the 600 hits Fram excludes by asking for an exact search on "Joe D'Angelo" rather than simply "D'Angelo"? I stand by my criticism that Fram has <i>not</i> been making sufficient effort to verify webcomic articles' notability or lack thereof before putting up AFDs, and the arguments set forth in the AFD title almost universally invoke Google hit-counts based on poorly-selected search terms in order to claim greater obscurity than is actually present. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Search engine hits are not a measure of notability</a>, after all. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 11:47, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly, so why are you pursuing this? Googling is a means to find valid sources, and a notable article may very well get only 3 hits.

<li>See my reply to Balancer's similar complaint above, and note the irony of complaining that my search gives lower numbers than his, and then saying that "Search engine hits are not a measure of notability".

The standard outlined in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is to disinclude directory listings and similar such non-selective batch mentions. The comic is mentioned multiple times in the article, and the author is being interviewed specifically <i>as the author of the comic.</i> Ergo, it is a non-trivial mention; ergo, between that and the Silver Bullet article, we have multiple non-trivial mentions from published sources independent of the Pirate Cove webcomic; ergo, it is notable by the standards of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> the comic is non-notable, not sourced, and has no assertion of notability.

<p>Villa Roma is a hotel/resort in upstate New York. The article doesn't seem to make a case for notability. It also names no sources and reads like an ad. "Villa Roma" gets a fair number of google hits, but it isn't the only hotel by that name, and most of the google hits appear to be hotel booking services and the like. Although a few articles were apparently printed in local newspapers about their dining room fire, this still probably falls short of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>'s primary criterion of being <i>the subject of multiple non-trivial published works</i>. -- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:03, 14 February 2007 (UTC) -- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:03, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's pretty interesting that you're only real quibbling here is that I messed up on the gender pronoun (which I apologize for) and the way I worded my highlight of the article creator's actions (which, I will note, is technically correct. Nominating an article for deletion IS trying to delete it).

The reason why I was reacting was that you used the words: "trying to delete". It sounded like the user tried to vandalise, which she didn't. I understand now that you did not meant it that way.

<p>The result was <b>Speedy Delete</b> per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> and my bad judgment in removing the speedy tag and prodding it in the first place. It was an attack page to begin with and I simply didn't catch on because I wasn't familar with the band. I know it's kind of unorthodox to close my own nominated AfD, but if anyone has an issue with this close, feel free to contact me and I will undelete and relist. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronGargoyle_779d.html" title="User:IronGargoyle">IronGargoyle</a> 01:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am nominating this page for deletion because it is unencyclopedic and I feel the content is too biased to ever be redeemable. The writing of the article is done so as to make Mohammed to look like a saint, in propaganda form, and editors on the page have routinely and abusively edit warred to keep out any factual information that is not flattering to their "prophet." This is not a good thing for the encyclopedia and therefore should be deleted. Particularly problematic are a lack of reference to groups with which Mohammed later broke treaties, a lack of information on problems within the various documents themselves, and a continual claim that Muhammad was solely responsible for changes in the region which is not backed up by fact. The whole article is the same sort of rampant whitewashing of the military expansion of the Islamic lands and conversion by the sword which were Mohammed's primary methods. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 18:03, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The title of the page causes POV issues, as every event described on the page carries with it an accompanying debate about whether Muhammad was behaving "as a diplomat" in the given situation. By its title, the page asserts the POV that many of Muhammad's actions were fundamentally aspects of diplomacy-- contradicting the opposing POV that Muhammads actions were, say, military conquests or religious conversions. Merging into the other pages will allow us to present all POVs without asserting one over the other. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 21:40, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>merge</b> any useful content per Alecmconroy. Description of the events discussed in this article as diplomacy is problematic for POV reasons and in most cases constitutes original research. For instance, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Medina_75b9.html" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a> found a place in the article on the basis that one source says Muhammad showed great "diplomatic skill" in that instance.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The subject is too important not to have its own article. The name of the article only indicates the subject, not the conclusion that must be drawn about whatever diplomacy Muhammad may or may not have engaged in. POV problems alone aren't enough reason for deletion, and there's a different solution for that and for lack of sourcing. (Even if the article only had the Koran as a source, it would still be useful and it could always be improved.) We're going to have disputes over Islam no matter how we organize the articles about Muhammad. In a religion with <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a>, the topic of Muhammad and diplomacy has got to deserve it's own article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:25, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's a misrepresentation of my views.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Sheriff Stadium article says it is the only modern stadium in town. But the Malaya Sportivnaya article give a capacity of 14,200 while the Sheriff article gives a capacity of 14,300. How about redirecting to the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriff_Stadium_a62c.html" title="Sheriff Stadium">Sheriff Stadium</a> article, which seems more credible, since it has references. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 20:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For some reason they gave it a name which could mislead. (There is in the U.S. "Indiana University of Pennsylvania" which is unrelated to the state of Indiana, but is in the town of Indiana, Pennsylvania.) Maybe someone could add to the article why something in Eastern Europe is called Malaya.<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 18:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not misleading in the slavic languages. 'Malaya' here is small - as opposed to 'Bolshaya' which is 'large'. In fact there does appear to be a <a href="http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_pictures/europe/moldova/tiraspol_bolshaya.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_pictures/europe/moldova/tiraspol_bolshaya.shtml" rel="nofollow">Bolshaya Sportivnaya Arena</a> in Tiraspol - which from the link may be the one described here.

<p>Reason Commilito 12:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC) The article <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_media_players.html" title="Comparison of media players">Comparison_of_media_players</a> has all the players in this list included (at least all the "blue" ones ) and many more. Also the comparison gives you much more information and a better overview. So I don't think we need two articles for a summary of media player, especially not an incomplete one like that.</p>

But might I suggest nominating <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liblogs.html" title="Liblogs">Liblogs</a>, which is worse than both of these?

I should also note that those Alexa rankings are suspect, because the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> entry is not about www.progressivebloggers.ca, it's about <i>all 230 sites</i> that comprise the group. If we wanted to accurately reflect this entry's Alexa ranking, we'd have to combine the ratings of all the member blogs.<br />

<p>Yeah, apparently someone changed the link and made it look like spam. Leuko 23:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC) Yes, please keep. It's a major organisation well known in the UK. --Auximines 23:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC) But actually, after looking at the correct website, it is a fee-for-service provider of counseling.

<li><b>Comment</b> - while it's only a one line stub, I'm not sure a charity can spam. Anyway, despite this being a nothing stub, Relate is definitely notable, it's the largest relationship counselling and sex therapy group in the UK, with about 600 offices around the country, and saw 150,000 people last year alone - it was formed in 1938 as the Marriage Guidance Council, changing its name to Relate in the early 1990s. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Diana_4f2c.html" title="Princess Diana">Princess Diana</a> was a patron. I can't believe this article is so bad, when you consider offshoots of Relate (such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Association_for_Counselling_72c4.html" title="British Association for Counselling">British Association for Counselling</a> and equivalent charities in other countries (such as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relationships_Australia_3ed4.html" title="Relationships Australia">Relationships Australia</a>) have decent articles. The stub just fails to assert any notability, at all. Should be easy enough to flesh out before the close of this AFD, I'll take a look tomorrow.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't agree that this is a "how-to" article. It's explaining how to apply statistical testing procedures to answer a question. But that doesn't make it a "how-to" article. On the basis of the reasoning that underlies this nomination, every single Wikipedia article on mathematical and statistical subjects ought to be deleted, since math is always about "how to" use logic in some context or another. Oh -- does anybody read the History pages in these debates?

<li>Uhhhh, not... really... This is an application of a set of well-known statistical concepts to a "real world" problem.

<li><b>Keep</b> But, please, can someone add one of the zillion available references to this, even some college probabilities textbook handily on your shelf? People who have not studied probabilities don't realize the obsession with this fair coin, fair die, fair bet that statisticians and mathematicians have, and how prevalent the literature is on the topic. References would forestall a lot of these discussions.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've rewritten the "preamble" section (I probably ought to retitle it, also, but didn't think of anything appropriate while I was at it). I've also added one reference, and I'll tie that in to the rest of it with &lt;ref&gt; tags in the next day or so. Someone else should have a look at the section I've rewritten to be sure I didn't make any misstatements. This article <i>is</i> very poorly written. The examples are reasonable, and the math is OK, but the prose is truly horrid. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 19:14, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is silly to construe the title literally and call this a how-to article. Anyone familiar with statistics knows that when one talks about "coin-tossing" one is usually talking about something more general. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But right now the article isn't being described in generality; it's a specific application. Specific applications and examples are fine in textbooks or even our sister project, Wikibooks, but it doesn't seem appropriate for an encyclopedia. Examples should be given only when they are absolutely required to clarify the meaning of an article. -<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratesJedi_4545.html" title="User:SocratesJedi">SocratesJedi</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESocratesJedi_9c57.html" title="User talk:SocratesJedi">Talk</a> 22:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Think of it as an article on the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posterior_probability_density_function.html" title="Posterior probability density function">posterior probability density function</a>, but with a a more prosaic name, just as "coin-tossing" is prosaic for <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernoulli_process.html" title="Bernoulli process">Bernoulli process</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 01:33, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, but why not then just title it posterior prob density function and then write it in generality rather than on this particular example. It's not the idea that I'm objecting to; it's the style in which it's written that makes me believe it ought to be on wikibooks unless it undergoes a substantial rewrite. -<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratesJedi_4545.html" title="User:SocratesJedi">SocratesJedi</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESocratesJedi_9c57.html" title="User talk:SocratesJedi">Talk</a> 22:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

If this does not get deleted, I'd probably consider creating a "Ashkenazi Incestousness" wiki, and we will see if the same people use the same arguments for keeping it. We will use all sorts of fun stuff, like propensity for genetic defects, inbreeding customs, and niffty anecdotal things like Einstein marrying his cousin.

<dd>Whether it has diffs supporting it really isn't the point though. Things can be 100% true and that still doesn't necessitate a stand-alone lenghty article. Would you support the creation of a Sub-Saharan African Intelligence page with the many IQ studies proving that Sub-Saharan Africans have IQs in the low 70s just because it is well-documented and there are many examples supporting this claim (violence, backwardness)?

<li><b>Keep</b>. However the page is very POV, and needs to be improved. I am the one that started this page. I actually started it in order to move this material off the Ashkenazi Jews page, and to drive away all the crackpots that beat the drum for this material. In other words, I actually started this page not because I believe in this dreck, but because I didn't like the way the Cochranites had taken over the Ashekenazi Jews page with their somewhat fringy ideas. The Ashkenazi Jews article is already too long. This is material that has been in the news a lot. I would call the Cochrane stuff just slightly better than fringe theory. It has actually been published in a so-called peer-reviewed academic journal, although that doesn't mean much, and the journal is only borderline in respectability. It is a coherent idea, but it just happens to be wrong. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 05:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think Metzenberg's motivation (see above) was reasonable in creating the article. But in my opinion, "Ashkenazi intelligence" is an inappropriate (and POV if not racism-begging) premise for an article, and perhaps as a result, the article is beyond repair. I think that the facts of this article should be applied in a different context (for instance, in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Cochran_683c.html" title="Gregory Cochran">Gregory Cochran</a> entry and others). But the fact that Ashkenazim have a high average IQ score and do disproportionately well in academia -- while interesting -- is not worthy of its own encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrgan123_6dff.html" title="User:Organ123">Organ123</a> 06:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This is appropriate as perhaps a minor side note on a Ashkenazic Jewish page, but by itself it is basically an article for a study and since there is no precedent for this type of thing, I'm gonna say delete. There are many studies in all reaches of race and intelligence but they don't have their separate article. Equivalently an article called The European and American domination of Arts and Sciences probably wouldn't pass very well although it could be VERY VERY WELL sourced and just as User:Izak up there gave us great examples of famous Jewish personalities who exhibited high intelligence we could fill up that article with many similar examples. If there was a famous study conducted proving that the Jewish people have a genetic tendency to be <a href="../../../f/r/u/Frugal.html" title="Frugal">frugal</a> and it was equally well-sourced, I have a feeling there wouldn't be as many keeps; it would just be called "anti-semitic." <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 08:39, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The main argument in favor of deletion seems to be a presumption that the topic in question has an overwhelmingly obvious correct answer and additionally that discussing the topic is politically unpalatable, hence, the article and discussion should be quashed as the article has no substantial merits and significant de-merits. What's wrong with this argument? (1) This is a common point of view, that Ashkenazi Jews on average are more intelligent than other groups, and it is legitimate to discuss this body of thought and opinion regardless of whether one agrees with it, (2) In fact, those who argue for deletion would do better to expand the body of knowledge available on this page regarding the topic in question by posting information regarding how this commonly held body of opinion regarding Ashkenazi Jews is flawed, rather than attempting to quash discussion about it. (3) My personal opinion - it is glaringly obvious that Ashkenazi Jews are on average more intelligent in certain ways than other groups. Those with a political axe to grind are actually those who don't like the conclusion and want to enforce mandatory adherence to the dogma that intelligence is not heritable. Sharpening and using such political axes is not the point of Wikipedia. There is a body of research, thought, and opinion regarding the question of Jewish intelligence; the fact that the evidence overwhelmingly points to conclusions that some find politically offensive does not mean that information regarding this widespread body of thought and opinion should be blocked from Wikipedia. -Me 02:16 am 16 February 2007 (UTC). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.10.64.46_7d52.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.10.64.46">58.10.64.46</a> (talk) 02:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>So African American genetic predisposition to crime would be a fine article to keep if it existed because there's boatloads of research proving it? I'm finding it hard to believe if this article had a negative connotation you would still wish to keep it with the same reasonings.

<ul>
<li>I can only address the article that has been proposed here for deletion. This article discusses a theory that increased intelligence conferred adaptive advantages to Ashkenazi Jews, so that this trait was enhanced and selected for through evolutionary and cultural changes. The claim that the "article is about a study that isn't even that famous" is utterly irrelevant to notability. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 18:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not true. The fact that there are many other studies on intelligence more famous than this one that DON'T have separate articles highlighting them makes it seem as if wikipedia gives more worth to this one over others. On the other hand, if this was just a segment of the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazic_Jew_438c.html" title="Ashkenazic Jew">Ashkenazic Jew</a> article, it wouldn't seem as if the encyclopedia is trying to hold it above all others. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 15:47, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well if as you say there are more famous cases, that's not the fault of this article, and I believe not relevant to this AfD. If I understand you correctly you are not arguing against this article in most of your commentaries, but the fact there are not similar articles for different ethnicities. Well the simple suggestion would be to create them, as you say there are more famous cases than this one, so with 53,000 Ghit this one has already demonstrated basic notability let alone it's verifibility etc. So if they are more famous it will not be difficult for you to start these articles, or I you don't have the time, you may go to <a href="../../../a/f/c/WP%7EAFC_0d2b.html" title="WP:AFC">WP:AFC</a> with the basic premise and I'm sure they wil be started for you. To quote you <i>...makes it seem as if wikipedia gives more worth...</i> it <b>might</b> make is semm but it could be just an editor who loves all things Jewish has created this article, but no-one has bothered to do the others. But the lack of other articles is not a problem of this article, and I will say again is a strawman argument. Oh and just for the record I think the theory is bunkum, but although the subject matter is controversial I'm voting on the article, it's notability, verifibility, and not whether I believe it or not. <sup><a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#6633CC">Khu</font></b></a><a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#CC66FF">kri</font></b></a></sup> 08:37, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I think the word "intelligence" is throwing you off. It is merely a measure, not a value judgement. So if the sources were available, an article entitled African Americans and crime would be appropriate because it recognizes that there is a notable issue, but does not make a judgement on it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshdboz_c913.html" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> 11:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What difference does it make if the article title makes a judgement or the article itself does? This article is making a judgement immediately at the header. The judgement is backed up by a thorough study but so are many other judgements and we don't have separate articles for each one of them. Why is it so necessary to report this one so directly? Nobody seems to find the dozens of studies on the average IQ of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese.html" title="Japanese">Japanese</a> being significantly higher on visuospatial tests so important as to make an article about it. The importance of that study is well rooted and has many of the same explanations as this (cultural and historical changes). I think the fact that so many people actually vote keep on this article shows the inherent bias of wikipedia. Most wikipedia editors are white males, and I'm sure almost everyone on this AFD is one too. (Please don't chime in and say you're not...there's a reason I put "almost.") So naturally, we're going to feel more strongly about keeping an article on Ashkenazic Intelligence than one on Japanese Intelligence or Aborigine Intelligence. But this is problematic, because the fact that we HAVE an article on Ashkenazic Intelligence and not on the main other well-studied researches equivalent to it shows that we are lending more worth to that study than others. I'm not against reporting these studies, I'm against highlighting them as is being done now. Why not just add this to the Ashkenazic Jewish article in a couple of sentences? It can be done and has before. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 15:47, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

Germans and the Dutch have scored higher average IQ in two different inquries. STOP this "look how much more intelligent and better we are than other"-thing.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. At the very least, it should get a better title, because intelligence itself is such a tricky concept. Doubtless there is potential for a valid article on the topic (which should also include the early 20th-century U.S. studies claiming to show that Ashkenazi Jews were of <i>below</i> average intelligence, part of the whole weird history of measuring intelligence). Seems to me that the topic is going to come up one way or another, so it might be best to take it on frontally.

<dd>What makes an article notable is explained in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> may come in handy as well). A blog (like Fleen) does not count, a new webzine like Spacesuits and Sixguns does in my opinion not count in most cases either. The WCCA awards have recently been deleted from Wikipedia as being non notable on their own (but this may well be overturned at deletion review), but a nomination is not enough to make a comic notable anyway. The Top Webcomics list is a popularity contest, not a notability contest. Many popular websites, online games, ... have been deleted because they lacked the necessary reliable sources. Basically, while it is clear that the webcomic exists, has a following, has admirers, ..., it isn't notable yet (in the Wikipedia sense). It may become notable, but it can only have an article <i>after</i> that happens. For an idea of what would indicate notability, take a look at this New York Times article, the main reason the WCCA article may be kept after all<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/17comi.html?ex=1281931200&amp;en=08e3777cc4943486&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=geartest&amp;emc=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/17comi.html?ex=1281931200&amp;en=08e3777cc4943486&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=geartest&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>. A comic that gets a paragraph in such an article (be it favourable or not), like <i><a href="../../../n/a/r/Narbonic.html" title="Narbonic">Narbonic</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Perry_Bible_Fellowship_b6bd.html" title="The Perry Bible Fellowship">The Perry Bible Fellowship</a></i>, has a clear indication of notability. This is the kind of thing we are looking for, not blogs, fansites, fora, ... Of course, the problem lies with the borderline cases, sources which may be reliable and independent enough for one person, but too much like a fanzine for someone else. I haven't seen any sources yet which are good enough for <i>my</i> interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, but other editors and the closing admin may of course disagree. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:17, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Borderline delete</b> based on current available evidence. Note for the record that this comic may easily meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> in the fairly near future, and that as current WCCA nominee, it may in fact meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s awards clause in a couple days, so this AFD should not be taken as a bar to re-creating the article, and also should be kept open until after the WCCA results come in (and extended by several days if necessary should this comic win) to avoid an immediate DRV. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 09:23, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but am I supposed to leave the article be whilst this debate is going on? Because I realise it is mostly fancruft, and I plan to change it should it survive.

<dd>It might. You might stick a copy on your userpage, too, so you can save your work for later and just re-post it once the comic has become notable (as seems likely to happen in the not-too-distant future). Fram, I haven't changed my mind as to whether or not speculation about the future is relevant to notability. IMO, it isn't notable <i>now</i>, but the timing of the AFD is such that without an extension, there's something like a 1 in 4 shot of an immediate DRV based on it having suddenly become notable per [[WP:WEB]. I suppose that's not too bad of a hassle. If we are all in agreement here that this comic is (a) not notable now and (b) becomes notable if it wins the WCCA, we can express that. Can I have a straw poll on that if..then statement to see if it's agreeable? Just say <i>aye</i> or <i>nay.</i> I say <b>aye.</b> <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 06:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, <i>all</i> of the names were in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_American_Jews_8286.html" title="List of Latin American Jews">List of Latin American Jews</a> in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Latin_American_Jews&amp;oldid=90446377" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Latin_American_Jews&amp;oldid=90446377" rel="nofollow">previous version</a> dated <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. The "Lists of Peruvian Jews" initially existed as a section of "List of Latin American Jews". It was easier to copy the 8 blue-links back in than selectively rever to and cleanup the old versions. However, that said, I don't necessarily oppose leaving them as redirects (I really have no opinion on that).

<li>Just to clarify: <i>all</i> of the names in the individual "occupation" lists were replicated in the main <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Peruvian_Jews_e73a.html" title="List of Peruvian Jews">List of Peruvian Jews</a>.

<li>The point isn't that there are many article divisions its that the list itself is full of non-notables. There is nothing to merge. The smaller lists are just divions of the big list, which is filled with names that don't show up on more than one page of google. Keeping the list really makes no sense.

I created this page out of interest in expanding the knowledge of the programming on IUSTV that reaches over 100,000 people daily. Currently, more than one episode of the show in the article in question airs on a rotational basis, and this article would provide necessary background information on the show's creation, production, and eventually an episode list (which I've not yet had the time to create). The intention of this article is the same has having an article that is a brief blurb about a song that is part of a greater project (an album). Likewise, the intentions of myself and the creators of the show is to allow the public to read the necessary information about this part of IUSTV's lineup. In addition, this production is intended to be continued in the creators' post-graduate careers in the form of a web-based cartoon, for which there are many, many articles currently found on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERhardiii_10a3.html" title="User:Rhardiii">Rhardiii</a> 23:14, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it's really hard to find published album sales figures in the Philippines, especially if you're not one of those major bands/artists that sell that much. The band, Dicta License, is a non-mainstream act, but they are under a major record label (Warner Music Philippines), which I think suffices for their notability. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jenvidanes (<a href="../../../j/e/n/User_talk%7EJenvidanes_c7ae.html" title="User talk:Jenvidanes">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jenvidanes_90d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jenvidanes">contribs</a>) 18:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

They accordingly do not get the publicity or scrutiny of a Senate confirmation hearing like every full-fledged federal judge does. Also, their opinions do not establish precedents and aren't typically studied or even cited to—their orders are usually in the form of recommendations to the district court judge, unless the parties had expressly consented to have the USMJ issue a binding order. They just don't typically get any attention as individuals beyond those who have to deal with them in the court, and so I do not believe that the position necessarily confers notability. Because this article has no other claims for its subject other than her position as a USMJ, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 22:17, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't agree that the List of Playboy people articles <i>do</i> offer "useful and encyclopedic information." The simple fact that someone was interviewed for a publication is not in and of itself notable or encyclopedic. I also think it sets a bad precedent for the establishment of other equally poor lists of people who are connected only by the happenstance of being booked on the same talk show, regardless of how many months or years apart those appearances were. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nothing gives more information about the content of a broadcast or publication than an objective listing of its contents (as opposed to a plot summary, which is an inherently subjective listing). The encyclopedic point of looking at such lists isn't to suggest a connection between the people involved; it's to give information about the contents of the broadcast or publication. It may say nothing about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pervez_Musharraf_6841.html" title="Pervez Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> that they both appeared on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a>, but it most definitely says something about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a> itself. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 05:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It does to the extent that I know of <b>no</b> AFD nominations for them which implies greater community support for the existence of such articles.

If the community did not have an implicit consensus (read: no nominations for literally thousands of articles) that they have encyclopedic value then they would have been deleted long ago.

It would be absurd for a nominator to just list an article without a reason. To get philosophical, if the burden is not on the nominator then every article should be up for AFD the second it's created and, ultimately, every article should have an AFD. And to that extent there is no box for a user to justify why the article was created. And, you know, if the burden really was on the creator then creation of an AFD <b>SHOULD</b> require the creator be both notified and given first chance to respond to the AFD.

<dd>First, I admit there is some level of being a TV guide. "Oh, Jimmy Carter will be on next week...I <i>can't</i> miss that one." Second, there's the opposite issue: "Last month or two there was some woman on about stem cells. Who was that? And what book? Oh, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eve_Herold_d864.html" title="Eve Herold">Eve Herold</a> and Stem Cell Wars." Third, by topic: "What was that one joke about <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> resigning? Hmm, it was announced on 11/8/06 so...yup, it was probably on 11/9/06." Fourth: "When the heck was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> on the show? 8/24/04."

<dd>Hi, Noroton. Another reason I can contribute: it might be interesting to people who want to study the political use of the media (e.g., who has appeared on the show, who hasn't, the timing of appearances--before/after elections, and so on).

<dd>A thousand pardons, Noroton. In fact it was your claim of open-mindedness that suggested to me that you would read beyond the first sentence of the link I provided.

<dd>You owe me another thousand apologies, Antepenultimate. I never said the nature of the subject was unencyclopedic, I asked how it would be used or enjoyed by readers. Different question. And it was a question. (I usually favor inclusion and I usually argue against people who say something is "unencyclopedic"). And as for "in the absence of clear policies or guidelines against articles on such subjects" what part of "Wikipedia is not a directory" don't you understand? I don't like simply standing on Wikipedia bureaucratic rules, but I also know they exist and I don't see how this article avoids violating it. <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> isn't official.

<dd>I would likely be much more inclined to directly answer that question if you could provide a guideline stating that Wikipedia articles must be "useful" or "enjoyable."

<dl>
<dd>You mean you actually have an answer and you're just not gonna give it out unless you trade for my answer? The point to my question was practicality, not that there's a guideline saying anything in Wikipedia has to actually have some human purpose to it. I believe actual human readers should be served by Wikipedia because the purpose of a reference work is to serve readers, and all rules of Wikipedia should directly flow from that. Where the rules get in the way of serving readers, the rules should be changed or ignored and the service kept, not the other way around. That's why I usually advocate keeping articles rather than deleting them. But if I can see no use for an article, and if the article also violates a Wikipedia rule, then I favor deletion, and even "strong delete". And when I do that, because I just hate doing that, I look for ways my objections might be met and I try to state them in my comment. And sometimes they are met and I change my vote. What you're demonstrating here is that not only does this list violate the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">not a directory</a> rule, but that there's no practical reason for violating that rule because in the real world there's no real use for this list.

<p>I am nominating this page for deletion as people's opinion varies from one to another, even from car magazines can vary that term as for example, how can car magazines consider the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_GT_7100.html" title="Ford GT">Ford GT</a> as a supercar when it is the same size as the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrari_F430_e8f9.html" title="Ferrari F430">Ferrari F430</a> (the latter but precessor model has been banished into the disputed supercar column) and this has been a subject to argument for a good perio so I think it would be a great to take this page out of its misery.

<li><b>Delete</b> Though I don't agree with the reasoning of the nom, this list is very subjective and hard to reference (I added most of the refs) because some sources call a car a "supercar", while others may not. It is up to each editor to decide which <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source is reliable</a>. Also the list can be and is argued over, so there are inherent POV issues whether it gets fully referenced or not. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086"><font face="comic sans ms" color="#454545">James086</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="darkgreen">Talk</font></a></sup> 23:10, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the article's introduction says it all: "The category is a subjective one, however, and the inclusion of some of the automobiles listed may be somewhat controversial —depending upon the opinion of the reader."

<dd><b>Comment</b> I really want to come to this articles defense. As it has been stated above the criteria by which a supercar is defined is vague, however some cars are nearly universally accepted as supercars and sources can easily be found to back it. The article does require some changes; the intro paragraph needs reworking to encourage only referenced supercars to be added and the list needs some pruning to remove unreferenced vehicles. If the subjectivity is really such an issue I would support a name change to "list of vehicles refered to as supercars" but I don't think it is truly necessary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd>I disagree. When I found the page I tried to find some sources for it. However there is absolutely nothing on the internet about this guy. Chances are it's a hoax. I have not found him listed in any Namibian team lists, any Leinster team lists. As well, he was never the International Rugby Board under 19 player of the year (I checked their website, where past winners are listed). So after spending a lot of time trying to verify this info I can really think of no reason to keep it. - <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShudda.nz_8088.html" title="User:Shudda.nz"><font color="blue"><b>Shudda</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/u/User_talk%7EShudda.nz_dbfc.html" title="User talk:Shudda.nz"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 20:58, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article appears to have some merit. It could also benefit from improvements.

Of course, if anything articles of greater duration, with multiple editors deserve greater process.

(As a side note, those last two links are full of crap, but anyway...)<br />
I should also note that those Alexa rankings are suspect, because the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a> entry is not about www.bloggingtories.ca, it's about <i>all 300 sites</i> that comprise the group.

<dd>That's exactly what I'm saying. The sources are an article on WorldNet Daily which is largely based on an article from a Tacoma paper and two websites. On Wikipedia we base decisions on notability on the presence of secondary sources. In this case there are almost none. Check the "offbeat news" section of your local newspaper's website. I can assure you that anything there will have 10 times more sources than this article. For example, the first "offbeat news" story in my local paper is (coincidentally) about Middlebury College telling students not to cite Wikipedia. A google news search for "Middlebury College" and Wikipedia gets 118 results. Admittedly, most are probably from the AP wire, but I also see separate articles from the Chronicle of Higher Education, the Guardian and a couple of college papers. And that's without going to the second page of the results. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Middlebury+College+Wikipedia&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Middlebury+College+Wikipedia&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> This isn't any more notable than the millions of other ideas people come up with every day. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 18:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> if the hoax is notable, then the proposal is notable, and a separate article IS necessary to emphasize the blatant differences. It is encyclopedic. Most people only know about the hoax version, so to inform them of the legitimate version, seems to me, to be a compelling reason to keep the article as is. I spoke to Dr. Barnard personally before he died and he explained to me that the only reason the proposal never got serious attention was because the hoax version is so prevalent. He was still working hard to distance the proposal from the hoax until the day he died. Of course, I should mention I found out about NESARA through that article on WND, so if I could find it through third party sources, so can others; and thus it's notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/i/User_talk%7EInigmatus_0324.html" title="User talk:Inigmatus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Inigmatus_7d72.html" title="Special:Contributions/Inigmatus">contribs</a>) 22:29, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I <i>did</i> AGF, as evidenced above. I responded to this as a legit but misguided AfD, addressing only policy points about the article and the AfD. I then did research, after <s>admin</s> smart person Malevious noted the weirdness of the user's history (immediately after the nom statement, up top), and that research conclusively demonstrates that this is a sockpuppet acting in bad faith; there simply is no room to assume good faith any longer. Please read the evidence. I'm not even the first to figure out that this is a sockpuppet, as documented in the sources already cited immediately above. I do not randomly go after users in AfD or anywhere else. If I come to a conclusion of puppetry or any other bad faith claim, I assure you it's after due dilligence and great effort to not have to go there. I spent over an hour researching this one, hoping it wasn't true. <i>Cf.</i> the trying-to-be-helpful comments I initially left for the pseudo-user on its talk page: "If you simply feel (and I would agree) that the article is too skeletal and needs expanding, all you need to do is flag it with {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">Expand</a>}} at the top (I've already done that in this case), and someone will get around to working on it. Thank you." I will happily hand-hold new editors. This isn't one. Its a repeat vandal and policy violator, who deletes SD tags, spams, and modifies other people's AfD votes, all documented above. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 22:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
