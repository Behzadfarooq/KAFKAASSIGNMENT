<li>No idea about East Saarling, but Charter Rock is complete bollocks. 30 people? Pitcairn's population is 47, of whom all but 10 live in Adamstown. So the idea of 30 of them living on a rock elsewhere in Pitcairn that was only discovered in 1922 is complete drivel. As for "a ferry every two hours", since boat landings are only possible on Pitcairn twice a day, this is just the icing on the cake. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<small><font color="#008822"><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a></i></font></small> 01:18, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I, the nominator, am nominating this page for <b>DELETION</b> for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does the information for the "Country Tracks" chart come from? <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_magazine.html" title="Billboard magazine">Billboard magazine</a></i>? <i><a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_%26_Records_b4a5.html" title="Radio &amp; Records">Radio &amp; Records magazine</a></i>? A syndicated radio program that gets its information from an unidentified source? The author?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There already is an article for <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Country_Singles_%26_Tracks_209e.html" title="Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks">Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks</a>, which is based on the <i>Billboard magazine</i> chart.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is absolutely no need to provide an exhaustive list of which artists have appeared on the this Country Tracks chart. If they've had a hit in the past, say, five years (which appears to be as far back as the author went), they've been on the chart. A link to <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_music.html" title="Country music">country music</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_music_performers.html" title="List of country music performers">list of country music performers</a> would suffice; but better yet, no link to tell the reader whom appeared on the chart is really needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMO, this article has no value and should be deleted in short order. [[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriguy52748_613a.html" title="User:Briguy52748">Briguy52748</a> 20:04, 15 November 2005 (UTC)]]</p>

<p>'Crase' is a misspelling. It is the Portuguese word for 'Crasis'. Whoever wrote this entry must not have been aware of that. I have created a new stub for 'Crasis', which I have also defined more accurately and generally. I have also edited the old link to 'Crase' in the entry on the 'Grave Accent', which now directs to 'Crasis'. 193.136.232.3 12:37, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not think it is a common misspelling for English-speaking people. Only a Portuguese-speaking person would write 'crase' instead of 'crasis'. The word 'crase' does exist in English, but it has a completely different meaning. Regards.</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b>, and move to correct spelling.

<li>Delete: When we're at the level of mistitled articles, moving them to the proper spelling <i>as well as</i> waiting for a proper bit of content is the functional equivalent of deletion anyway.

<li><b>Keep</b>; it is a very short stub, but not exactly a dictionary definition. However, it should be moved to Positive Political Theory, which seems the most used term of the two.

<div>I realized that I did not make my point well. That the subject of the article is notable seems agreed by most of the editors above (and a web search on Positive Political Theory shows that there are books and seminars on the topic). An article on this topic would be made of a definition and a (short or long) descripion of the subject. In this case, we only have a definition, which makes the article a stub. What I do not agree is that this is a <i>dictionary</i> definition. If this were true, we would be able to transwiki to wikctionary. Obviously, we can't: this is the definition of a subject (in this case, a theory), not the definition of a term (a <i>dictionary</i> definition). My reading (and intepretation) of the policies is that little content is not a ground of deletion, as long as a full article on the topic would be kept.</div>

<li>Comment - what Google hits I have found are references to books which discuss the theory, and to university curricula which cover it. There seem to be no free-standing articles on the net - this looks like a trip to the library. There is no doubt in my mind of the currency of the term, but it is far beyond my knowledge of political science to discuss intelligently.

<p>This article is describing an event that could be easily described in the article it is linked from. The Hell's flash attack was apparently only used once. The specifics of this event don't seem deserving of an article. Also, there is only one article linking to this page.

<p>Even if the copyvio issue is fixed, I don't think that this book merits it's own entry. As far as I can tell, the author has one book published, and the first person tone of the entry suggests that either the entry was written by the author himself or was cut-and-pasted from elsewhere.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. This is an A1 and A3 (linkspam) speedy, and so the deleters have things heavily on their side. I am firmly discounting Hipocrite's comment: it is not an appropriate way to participate in AfD. I find Gateman1997 and Yuckfoo to have extremely weak positions having cited no reason <i>at all</i> for their recommendation. If either of them had put their article edits where their comments are, then things would clearly be different. Jtmichcock on the other hand at least has something to say. If Hipocrite wants a Deletion Review, s/he is free to request one himself. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 04:16, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

There are decent, if minimal, arguments made for retaining the content so there's no consensus to delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> In the case of Ashley Burns, her death was commented in many sources and challenged the development of cheerleading, or at the very least highlighted its evolution into an athletic and dangerous sport. While similarly the link has been drawn to the risk of school trips, I think this is just journalist filler when reporting a tragedy. I recall a report in Australia earlier this year of a girl being killed by a falling tree while on a school camp. Life is risky, some people die prematurely, including on school trips and it is very sad.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 19:59, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Is it possible to rewrite this entry in a tone that is less memorial and more in line with the tone of the Ashley Burns article?

Hopefully the article will someday be a true biograpical article but I don't see how. So, does a moderator close the debate and remove the AfD notice after verifying the vote and eligibilities to vote or does it fall to the nominator (me)? It was my first nomination and I'm still not sure about the procedure in full.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 16:05, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, There is nothing objectionable about it. Even though she is a minor, her name has already made it into the news. This article has not exposed anything new that would cause further harm, but has instead stuck to a news-based perspective.

<li>The AfD isn't about objectionability so much as relevance.

<li>Indeed, there is. If you prevent deliberation of an article along the lines of the deletion guideline, you are preventing the functioning of the AfD process, which makes your actions disruptive. If you are considering the article and believe that it should be kept, that's fine.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a>, your logic escapes me. In <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_songs_that_have_been_considered_among_the_worst_ever_5f90.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs that have been considered among the worst ever">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs that have been considered among the worst ever</a>, you argue strongly for linking the vote to such articles as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the worst ever">List of films that have been considered the worst ever</a>. You state&#160;: <i>Effectively, this vote is a vote on whether or not to delete the entire series of "X that have been considered the worst ever", since there's absolutely no significant difference I can see</i>. I felt the statement was sophistic because VfD is not the supreme court and its results do not create legally binding precedent. Nevertheless, there you felt that a delete vote would set a dangerous precedent for articles you clearly considered valid. Here you vote keep, even though you are opposed to the Gay criminal list. If we can’t remove the rubbish from our house all at once, must it all remain? I say delete the entire series of X criminals, gay, straight, Jewish or otherwise. I invite you to join me in setting a precedent. Let’s start getting the trash to the curb. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:11, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I did not vote "keep," I voted "<b>conditional keep if the 'LGBT criminals' category is deleted, conditional delete if the 'LGBT criminals' category is deleted</b>". I would have put all that in bold, but I didn't want to annoy anyone with overusing the bolding, and since the <i>current</i> consensus when I voted in LGBT was for "keep", "conditional keep" was my effective vote at the time; if the consensus for the LGBT criminals category changes to "delete", my effective vote here will then be "conditional delete". I voted "strong delete" on that list, incidentally, rather than "conditional delete", because unlike this vote, that one is just getting started, and there is plenty of time to debate and for people to change their minds and for a consensus to arise for either side. For this list, however, the consensus is very firmly already established as "delete", and there's limited time left for this category to exist; thus voting "conditional delete" would be meaningless, since there's almost no chance that the "condition" I require wouldn't be satisfied. My vote is conditional here because the "LGBT criminals" vote is much less decided (though leaning "keep").</li>
<li>I never implied that there was anything "legally binding" requiring us to vote remotely consistently (or, indeed, not to just flip a coin to decide how we vote); legality implies "must", whereas my arguments deal with "should", with the most rational course of action, the one that will benefit the most people and thus benefit Wikipedia most. Wikipedia not being the supreme court is irrelevant; "precedent" (like "delete this for the same reason that X was deleted") is still a very valid concept that is commonly used to justify VfDs and votes throughout Wikipedia. If one article is deleted for a certain reason, and the exact same reason applies equally well to another article, then either the other article should be deleted as well, or the first article's deletion should be overturned. If "list/category of Jewish criminals" is a bad list solely because it implies a connection between two types of people where no connection can be shown to exist, then a "list/category of LGBT criminals" should also be deleted unless either list/category, or both lists/categories, can be shown to <i>have</i> a valid connection between the two groups worthy of a list/category. Unless there's something especially offensive about <i>Jewish</i> criminals that makes it bad to have a list for them and OK to have a list for other minority ethnic or sexual groups, this list should be handled just like all other lists of the exact same nature, regardless of the specific groups being discussed. Likewise, if "list of songs that have been considered the worst ever" is bad because it is POVed, or because it is unmaintainable, or because it's standards aren't strict or organized enough, or for any number of other reasons, and those exact same reasons apply to "list of movies that have been considered the worst ever", then unless someone can somehow show that it's OK to have such a list for movies but not for songs (which no one has even attempted to do thus far, probably because such an argument would be ridiculous), either both lists should be deleted, or neither. And then we get a chain reaction: if "list of movies that have been considered the worst ever" should be deleted, so should "list of movies that have been considered the greatest ever" unless it can somehow be shown that having a "worst movies" page is completely unacceptable, while having a "best movies" page is just fine; and if "list of movies that have been considered the greatest ever" is unacceptable, then surely the same applies to "list of computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever" unless some difference can be shown that would make "best movies" not OK and "best games" OK. Again, noone's succeeded in establishing a single significant (in terms of deletion/not deletion) difference between any of these four articles, thus a VfD for one of them is highly significant to all four pages. Arbitrarily deleting random articles does a disservice to Wikipedia, to its editors, and to its readers, by causing confusion and waste of resources and time through unnecessary inconsistency not merely in article style or format (which I tend to be OK with), but in our actual <i>inclusion standards</i>. Feel free to vote "delete" for Jewish criminals and "keep" for LGBT criminals (or vice versa) if you want to, but it would be highly advisable to eat least provide a possible <i>reason</i> to do so, as no one has done so yet, just as no one has yet provided a reason to delete "list of songs that have been called the worst by noteworthy souces" and not "list of movies that have been called the worst by noteworthy sources". Come on, give me some specific <i>counter-arguments</i> if you disagree with me! Don't just fight for inconsistency and arbitrary, chaotic, random voting for the hell of it. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:25, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that you are willing to delete the list of criminals shows a bias for only keeping lists that show people in a good light, no?

<li>Because I was unaware of them, of course. It's a big wiki.

<li>I removed a set of not-puns, going for a nice scattershot effect across the political spectrum. But this is riddled with them, and some are actually pretty interesting - there's some historically notable nicknames there - in the UK, Howard's "Dracula", Chamberlain's "Great Appeaser", or the wonderful "Chat-show Charlie"; in the US, "Tailgunner Joe" which it would be nice to have collected. A lot of the puns that aren't just examples of "made up 'cause I think it sounds funny" (cf/ Ulysses S. Graft) are/were actually in use as nicknames - "Dumbya" or "Bliar" are pretty common, I remember "Clintonista" cropping up a good bit (though not as a personal nickname), and a collation of these is encyclopedic - especially when we start going back to the c19th, politics used to run on this stuff. So, I've rolled back, and suggest...</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> to List of perjorative political nicknames, keep all the stuff that's actually a) verifiable and b) ever got used in any significant amount, and see what it looks like then.

<li><b>Delete</b>: "Good topic/bad content" is, for me, a clear delete, but I think it's a bad topic, too. While we wait for the ideal authors to emerge and correct the mess, we have persistent "crap," and there's simply no need for that. The ideal author will create a new page as certainly as remedy this morass. However, a "pun" is in the ear of the beholder, and "pejorative" is in the ear of the beholder, and the list of such doubly subjective things would serve no actual purpose in that it would not be exportable, nor would it illuminate any other subject.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though major refactoring is in order (it can be dealt with once the AFD is dispensed with). Agree with others that all entries must be sourced; and that POV material should be removed. (Note--explainations of an insult are OK as long as they are couched with appropriate disclaimer--Wikipedia must not take the position that a given politician, right or left, is bad). Note: Were a suitable refactoring to be proposed which included deletion of this page, I might vote to delete--but absent a concrete proposal for a better home for the content here, my vote is to keep. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 19:03, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Noone could possibly be benefited by including "famous" or "noteworthy" in the title of any of those articles. It would just make the articles harder to find and give them extraneously long titles, plus "fame" and so on are POV terms. Having it be assumed that we wouldn't include non-noteworthy information into <i>any</i> Wikipedia list or article is a much more sensible attitude. As a general rule of thumb, if someone's noteworthy enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, they're probably noteworthy enough to include in the categories and lists they would fit into.

<li>Of course they don't.

Personally, I don't see why this couldn't be a perfectly useful list to numerous people, and the existence of the category makes it much <i>easier</i> to maintain, but whether you think this should be deleted or not, the debate should be clarified such that it doesn't look like we're attacking a single religion's list.

Are you aware of the major advantages a list has over a category? If not, I'll gladly enlighten you about the problems with maintaining something like a category that's so much less centralized than a list, that lacks the coherent history file a list does which makes keeping it high-quality so easy. Obviously, categories have their advantages to (like being linked to on every page a member of the category is a part of), but you'd have a hard time arguing that lists don't have some major advantages over categories. Contrary to popular opinion, including both in some cases can actually give the best of both worlds; just something to consider, don't vote blindly because there's also a category of a similar nature. And even if one does, that person should make quite certain to do the same for the countless other articles of the same nature. There's no point having votes like this just to breed inconsistency; let's be straightforward about what is and isn't being voted on, <b>from the onset</b>! -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:13, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1) Not one of them says how they were made, what sources were used, or what objective criteria were used for inclusion. If they said "List of composers whose Wikipedia articles identify them as Roman Catholics" that would be OK, but they don't. It would just as much work to check them one name at at time as it is to rebuild the list from scratch.</dd>
<dd>2) This article purports to be a "list of Roman Catholics." But it is comprised of lists that say simply that they are lists of "Catholics." Are these lists restricted to <i>Roman</i> Catholics or not? There is no way to tell—other than to check every entry individually.</dd>
<dd>3) What are we to make of the section of List of Catholic composers that says simply "The great majority of composers listed on the following pages: The great majority of composers listed on the following pages: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_renaissance_composers.html" title="List of renaissance composers">Renaissance composers</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Category%7EItalian_composers_91a0.html" title="Category:Italian composers">Italian composers</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Category%7EFrench_composers_ccbe.html" title="Category:French composers">French composers</a>&#160;?"

Whoever wrote that couldn't possibly know it is true <i>unless he counted them,</i> which would require knowing <i>which</i> were Catholic (or Roman Catholic), in which case they could and should have been <i>listed</i>. Conversely, knowing that "the great majority" of Italian composers about as useful as knowing that a stopped clock is right twice a day.

<dd>P. P. S. The very entry for Agnieszka Holland in "List of Catholic directors and producers" says she is "now roughly an agnostic." How does "roughly an agnostic" = "Roman Catholic?" The article on <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnieszka_Holland_2ceb.html" title="Agnieszka Holland">Agnieszka Holland</a> says she "was born to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, and was raised a Catholic." So, are these supposed to be "lists of people who were raised as Catholics, regardless of their parents' religious affiliation or those of their parents?" No, because the same list includes "<a href="../../../l/a/r/Lars_von_Trier_d20e.html" title="Lars von Trier">Lars von Trier</a>, convert."

<dd>I might've inspired that, sorry. I do think it seems like Catholic and Jewish lists were targeted disproportionately. That did strike me as slightly strange. There may have been too many of both kinds of lists, but I think it would've "set off flags" less if it had been more limited or gone solely after the marginal cases like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Catholic_American_Actors_4010.html" title="List of Catholic American Actors">List of Catholic American Actors</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_superheroes_cbec.html" title="List of Jewish superheroes">List of Jewish superheroes</a>.

<li>You were doing great until you got to "I would also like to comment". It's true that people voting on VfDs don't <i>have</i> to explain their votes, but they certainly <i>should</i> explain their votes on such, if doing so isn't too terrible of an inconvenience. And <i>asking</i> people to explain votes is <i>absolutely</i> acceptable conduct. Pointing out that someone voting without explaining his reasoning is as much a personal attack as taping a frog to a doughnut is. That is, not at all. "Personal attack" would be saying "This person voted without explaining his vote. <i>What a fucking idiot!</i>" Remove the italicized bit and you're in the green, baby. Though even if it was, somehow, a personal attack, I don't see how disobeying a Wikipedia policy could, on its own, be considered "unethical"...

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, 15 minutes is a bit arbitrary, but it's a quarter of an hour, if that has any meaning. It could be 10 or 30 minutes, but it's 15. Why not? Why are there 60 mintues in an hour - that's kind of arbitrary too. The criteria are a bit specific, but you can basically state them as such: no classical pieces, and the song must be a continuous song (i.e. extension by silence between a hidden track doesn't count). I kind of like the list, but I suppose it doesn't fit in too well.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>move</b> to List of unusually lengthy songs, and subdivide that page by certain ranges of length. i.e., the top section might be "5 to 10 minutes long" (though most songs would have to be near 10 minutes at least to be considered "unusually long", depending on the specific song), then "10 to 15 minutes long", then "15 to 20", then "20 to 30", then "30 to 1 hour", then "over 1 hour long"—<i>something</i> like that, anyway. Putting them in order of length just seems to make more sense to me than putting them in alphabetical order by artist, though I can see strong arguments for either, since the current page looks quite nice... But the reason I suggest this is, many songs are known for being "long" that only 10 or 12 or 8 minutes long, like "Hey Jude"; although it might open a can of worms and require us to start finding sources and citing them to show that the songs have been considered "unusually long" by various people, it would also remedy the arbitrary "15-minute cutoff" and protect the page from being spammed by dozens of non-noteworthy songs that just happen to be over 15 minutes long. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough. But I like my idea more. Make it more vague and require sourcing for notability; there <i>are</i> plenty of unusually long songs out there that have nonetheless (or as a result?) achieved a fair amount of popularity, or sometimes infamy. It's not a completely valueless topic; we just need to assert notability with more vigor, and change the arbitrary "15 minute" limit to a vaguer, but ultimately more complete, listing of especially noteworthy "long" songs in general. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>To clarify: a "list of unusually long songs could include every song that has been remarkably successful despite its great length, or otherwise very noteworthy songs that are unusually long for their genre.

"15 minutes" is too arbitrary a threshhold, and gives a false impression to some contributors that <i>any</i> song over 15 minutes merits inclusion, even if it's not noteworthy.

<li>The article tells us that this person is a published author of both books and magazine articles, and provides a bibliography of some of the books and articles. The article also links to press coverage where this person's research has sparked newsworthy discussions, both recently, as reported on Wikinews, and in 1996, as reported by Schulman.

<li>I hope you <b>don't delete</b> it. I found it on a google search and it was very helpful in defining the term and showing it's difference from the term supernatural. (Above vote is by User:70.22.237.252)</li>

<li>I don't understand how it rates a disambiguation page... you aren't disambiguating a term, you are saying it's supernatural or ghosts or etc. which are all just supernatural. At best this is a redirect to supernatural with a mention on that page about the alleged difference between the two. Disambiguation pages are for topics with more than one meaning, not one vague meaning better covered by preexisting articles. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:17, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>P.S. The non-blank talk page consists of three comments spaced out over almost as many years mainly discussing if it really rates a real article, with one using the term to mean something clearly different from the defintion the main article took from a fictional movie.

<li>The fact that the page has beein sitting there in its original form for about three years would seem to argue the other way: this page has been around unchallenged for a long time. A short article directing people to the sorts of things that have been called "preternatural" would appear to be appropriate. FWIW, the articles <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomalous_phenomenon.html" title="Anomalous phenomenon">paranormal</a> seem to distinguish themselves one from another; if <i>preternatural</i> covers both, it is a candidate for a disambiguation page in your sense as well. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:58, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The fact that it has been sitting there in its original form for three years show that the article was so unimportant that nobody saw it or cared about it. Arguments that "that's the way it's always been" hold no water. Try arguing for it based upon its actual content... which in this case is simply dicdef with neologistic alternate meaning different from standard usage. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 18:10, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>perhaps my edit will improve the much-needed disambig process. merge? redirect? i don't know: apologies for unfamiliarity with wikipedia protocols. jaqi, 19 nov 2005</p>
<p><br />
Requesting to improve this seems ok to me, but trying to just outright delete it is nonsense. It's a word not used *that* often and in lieu of an improved explanation of the context this word might be used instead of 'supernatural' etc., this definition serves its purpose. If you go deleting entire pages just because you didn't like how complete it was, how complete is that (much less). <i>(unsigned comment by anon User:65.219.108.116)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia deletes dicdefs all the time. That's not "nonsense" that's policy. If anyone wants a definition or a link to a definition in the article they can go to Wiktionary, which is what it is for, and which already defines the word. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 17:33, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Certainly would agree that not sufficiently notable at this point of time in the notable architects list and hence has been voluntarily deleted from the notable architect's list.

The demographics of this fast growing region indicate this apparently cohesive running club will likely grow rapidly also. The fact that only a handful of running clubs have articles in the Wiki indicates that this niche has been badly neglected.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Samizdata is an extremely well known politics blog. However, I would be surprised if there is a literature <i>about</i> the blog that would satisfy the requirements of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Certainly I don't think anything more than a couple of sentences could be written about it in encyclopedic fashion. Wikipedia does not exist to serve as a directory of everything in existence. It is an <i>encyclopedia</i>: it covers subjects which have already been studied and/or reported on, and <i>about which</i> there is at least some literature that will satisfy the citation and verificatory requirements of an tertiary reference. I am therefore inclined to ask for a <s><b>delete</b></s>. I can be persuaded to ask for a redirect, either to an article on the Russian theme behind the name or to a general article on politics blogs. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">encephalon</span></a> <i>03:05, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</i> <u>Update</u>: A <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samizdat.html" title="Samizdat">Samizdat</a> is sensible. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">encephalon</span></a> <i>10:26, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm aware that this is probably useless, based upon the string of pure "votes" above, but oh well... <i><b>This is not a vote.</b></i> Unless you have some evidence of something's notability, please don't simply say "keep, notable". Provide some links, citations in major media, references in popular culture, arguments as to why you think it's notable, anything. Even if it is just "like foo said above". Otherwise what your simply saying is "keep because I've heard of it." A closer with a tiny bit of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chutzpa.html" title="Chutzpa">chutzpa</a> would have a good argument for discounting any such opinion. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 02:44, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It shouldn't be removed. It meets the criteria for a notable website. It has a pretty good Alexa rank of 17,488, a forums with 10,000 members, and its diagrams have been used in many newspapers, and books, as well as online. The website is also significant because of its unique "diagrams". I have updated the article to reflect SkyscraperPage's significance, though I still need to edit it for easy reading.</li>

<li>There are approximately 6 billion human beings on earth. Conservatively, estimate that 1 billion of those are of primary or secondary school age. Again conservatively, estimate that only half of those actually attend school. If every school has 1000 students, then that presents 500,000 separate article candidates for the schools category alone. This number is equal to 60% of the total current English language articles and nearly seven times the entire Spanish language Wikipedia.

<li>That's just one of the problems with school rankings. SAT score, graduation rate, retention, college placement, performance on state-wide exit exams, number of "well qualified teachers" (per No Child), teacher/student ratio, etc. are all ways to be "best" or "worst," which is one of many reasons that these claims really shouldn't figure in the debate over the worth of an article on a public high school.

<ul>
<li>It's completely coherent. I can understand perfectly what's being said, which is that a chimp, which he had, turned into balls. He had bought the chimp at jakes pizza. The fact that the content isn't paticularly intelligent doesn't make it patent nonsense, as we define it. On WP, patent nonsense is either utterly impossible to understand content (such as random keys being pressed, such as k,asdhjvbsdhb aldshbld lHDb lahdcblbi&amp;&amp;****) or "content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make sense of it." I can easily make sense out of this article. It is not confused or incoherent, but it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and is possibly vandalism.

<li>Hi, Elaich. I apologize for the tone of the nominator; perhaps he's working a little too hard and has forgotten to <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assume good faith</a>. The issue he raises is that the article doesn't establish <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> of the Knights of Disorder, and he implies that it's a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">vanity</a> article. The article asserts that they are legendary, but we'd need proof of that. Which brings me to the more important criterion: that the material be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>. For anything you add in Wikipedia, somebody else should be able to go to the library to confirm it. To aid them in that, you should include <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">citations</a>. I hope that helps!

<li><b>Comment</b> The text smells like a copyvio to me - at the very least, it's probably been cut and pasted from somewhere else, with or without permission. Whether this belongs in an encyclopedia or not is not really covered by this article at all. How much notoriety did the case get? Did it have any wider effects? For example, did any laws change? Did police procedure change? Did any charities or movements get inspired by this murder? Was it used as the basis for a work of fiction? All of this would help. A murder on its own is not enough to get in the encyclopedia, but if it was a notable case, then it might. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown</a> 02:34, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sounds better than it is - "president" in Scientology is in fact a public speaker, not an executive.

<p>I do not understand what this article is about, why it belongs to the section "Endurance sports" or "Literary stubs" as I find nothing literary about it. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManikraina_d995.html" title="User:Manikraina">Manik Raina</a> 14:05, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> This article covers three separate things, so should be three articles and a disambig page. The stock character part is worth keeping (and expanding), the endurance event and internet slang sections refer to separate things, and should not be on this page - neither is important enough for a separate article, IMHO. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> 16:35, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>While I fail to see the sense of the "Literary" stub (but somebody may- let him speak up now), I see no reason to dump any of the content, not even the literary slang I never heard about- one should never move to eliminate something because it fails to appeal to <i>you</i>, nor even if ou think must readers wouldn't care or it- an encyclopaedia is not meant to be readable 'from cover to cover' but as its etymology suggests to cover as much ground as reasonably possible (and our medium has the crucial advantage that it is not limited by the size and costs of every hard copy, unlike printed lexica). In the case of the competition, the very facts that an event <i>sui generis</i> persists for years and is made to subject of a lenghty foreign TV program indicate there clearly are people that can be interested in it. As I agree neither section is large enough to need a separate page (nor the whole page too long to read trough quickly), I wouldn't argue (yet?) for disambiguation either <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 10:50, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As nobody seems to find any sense in the 'literary' stub, and lack of animo for significant elaboration requires no sturring, I simply removed the mystery stub. However I read absolutely nothing that compells removing either of these items- if people delete anything they can't be bothered with, me demote Wikipedia from an alternative alongside professional encyclopaedias, abdicating the extras without a hope ever to approach the qualitative quasi-guarantee of a scientificaly edited one. Our time is far better spend contributing content, not bitching about every little bit that wouldn't make Britannica, which happily already exists (how absurd most articles from its free 1911 edition are still not being used, that alone would be superior occupational therapy for years!) <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcarius_bda5.html" title="User:Arcarius">Arcarius</a> 18:06, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. While I do believe it should be deleted, I believe we must go about this a bit more respectfully, as the author e-mailed me, and explained how he was willing to reconsider, but here are his thoughts, taken verbatim from his e-mail to me, on the matter:</li>
</ul>
In response to your message to me upon the nomination of Ytmnd soundtrack for deletion, I had originally posted it as it's own article because it was not a part of YTMND or a YTMND fad, per-se. I do see your point in deleting it though, as it is a borderline vanity article (i helped distribute it, therefore i do have a bit of a vested interest in it). Would you say this information does not belong on wikipedia at all, or should i move it to the ytmnd fads article that you had highlited for me?
