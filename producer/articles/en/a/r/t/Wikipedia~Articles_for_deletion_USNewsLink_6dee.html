<p>Old, but non-notable website. Original version had about <b>6</b> external links to the site. Main claim of notability seems to be that it is in the Library of Congress's Sept 11th Internet archive; this is not significant, as that archive contains a large proportion of all sites on the net as of that time; it's no claim of notability, afaik. Also the site has a prominent banner saying that it is being sold; this looks like an attempt to use Wikipedia as a promotional tool. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 09:24, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP.</b><a href="http://www.usnewslink.com" class="external text" title="http://www.usnewslink.com" rel="nofollow">USNewsLink's</a> main claim to fame? There is no main claim to fame. This website is constantly updated and provides information about a variety of subjects and issues. Jesse's criticism is unwarranted and his summary of the site's importance is petty at worst and inaccurate at best. Jesse does not have a clue about the history of USNewsLink or its "external links.” USNewsLink's <a href="http://www.usnewslink.com/uscasualties.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usnewslink.com/uscasualties.htm" rel="nofollow">US Casualties</a> pages are constantly read. The <a href="http://www.usnewslink.com/archive.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usnewslink.com/archive.htm" rel="nofollow">Archive</a> is constantly read, and re-read. And I doubt that anyone at the Library of Congress would agree with Jesse as to the importance of the Sept. 11 Archive. While there may be many entries in the Archive, they were hand selected by an editorial committee. Every article was read by one or more people before it was nominated for inclusion. The efforts of Jesse to minimize the importance of the selection of USNewsLink's articles and commentary for the Sept. 11 Archive is certainly no reason to delete USNewsLink from Wikipedia. The fact that USNewsLink is for sale in no way implies that it will not continue in its present format because it is funded by my foundation. I will remain a Director and my stock ownership will revert to the foundation for USNewsLink's future overhead. And for the record, Jesse made no effort to notify me of his deletion nomination. I have revised the content to bare bones information and hope that Jesse will remove his objection and allow the content to stay in the directory. Usnewslink 09:44, 4 March 2006 (UTC).</li>

<p>Thanks for your comment on this. I didn't leave you a message before nominating the page because I noted that you were currently active on the article, and I assumed(correctly) that you would see the message, and would comment if you wished to. Regarding your description of Wikipedia as a "directory", please review the page <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. Also <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> would be useful, as it lays out some good guidelines regarding the inclusion of articles on websites in Wikipedia. Reviewing the LoC site, I see that you are right - although the total collection is over 30,000 sites ("selected", but mere mebership in such a large list would not be grounds for inclusion in Wikipedia), there is a smaller collection of approx. 2,300 sites which were further indexed, and USNewsLink <a href="http://lcweb4.loc.gov/911/catalog/2394.html" class="external text" title="http://lcweb4.loc.gov/911/catalog/2394.html" rel="nofollow">is one of them</a>, which I agree is some claim to notability. I still wish to leave this up for nomination for some more time, as I'm not yet convinced, but I do appreciate the comment. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 10:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The inclusion of USNewsLink's articles and commentary in the Sept. 11 Archive ensures that historians throughout the ages will have access to what Americans - in particular this American - thought and felt during the aftermath of Sept. 11. But from your view, people who read Wikipedia would have no interest in such. You think USNewsLink is not relevant or important enough to be included in Wikipedia and want it deleted. But thankfully, the Libary of Congress doesn't share your view. Usnewslink 11:19, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
