<dd>I'm not laughing. Being a full professor is hardly a reason for having a wikipedia article. None of my professors - many of whom have several books published - have wikipedia articles. Why should this one?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I mean, serriously, the most notable thing about this person is that he's the brother of someone whose notable. Being the sibling of a notable person hardly merits a wikipedia article, and neither does this person.</dd>

<dd>As for why I didn't give a reason... I thought the non-notability of this article was self-evident. I guess I was wrong.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 02:50, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: First, I think you should write articles on your professors, because we need more articles on academics. Second, I don't know anything about Professor Lutz's brother, but I do know that Lutz's books are sold through Amazon and B&amp;N <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=Ws5uCAmCOg&amp;isbn=0415143136&amp;itm=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=Ws5uCAmCOg&amp;isbn=0415143136&amp;itm=4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I suppose every author who has a book for sale at both Amazon and B&amp;N should have a wikipedia entry, too? Even if no articles currently link to them, as is the case with this article? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 10:14, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That there are links to an article may speak in its favour, although not without exception, but the lack of such links may just mean that the area has so far been overlooked. I am sure there ar more links to any random pokemon figure than to Lutz, but that is just a result of some people's <s>obsession with</s> dedication and hard work on such matters, not an indication that the pokemon character in question is more important to the world at large. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:29, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>One of the explanations I've seen thrown around for the John Seigenthaler debacle <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/01/0030200&amp;from=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/01/0030200&amp;from=rss" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> is that factually inaccurate information tends to go undetected in low traffic articles, and this article, in case you haven't noticed, is a low traffic article. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 10:51, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is an obvious problem, which at some point (soon I hope) will be remedied by moving new articles, as well as hopefully old articles displaying certain characteristics, into a holding area for fact-checking and cleanup, but it is not really an argument for deletion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._a659.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr.">Seigenthaler</a> may not be as significant as the whole scandal has made him look, but the reason the article was little edited and the murder allegations went undetected for so long was not his lack of notability. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 11:39, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Although I suppose it doesn't really, now, I believe the above does constitute cause for deletion because I believe that having no article is better than having a factually inaccurate article, and as I've already attempted to show, an article with as little traffic as this one is ammong the most likely of articles to have factually inaccurate information. It doesn't enrich the experience of most wikipedians (ie. it doesn't add anything), either, due to the low traffic this article garners. So, basically, I don't believe it really adds anything and I believe it actually has the potential to do harm, since it is, as I said, among the most likely of articles to have factually inaccurate information added to it (and since factually inaccurate information can, I believe, be harmful). <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 23:47, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Then you should change your reason for nomination from "not notable" to "not enough people edit this article". --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> 01:10, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Aren't "not notable" and "not enough people edit this article" pretty much the same thing? Imho, if and only if an article is notable will it be a hub of activity. This article is not a hub of activity, and thus, pursuant to the previous statement, it isn't notable. Of course, since this guy passes per the "Professor test", I suppose further discussion ought not necessarily take place here, but rather, in the talk page for the "Professor test"... <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 07:49, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, "not enough people edit this article" is very often just a result of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. I also think your argument confuses notability with current fame or celebrity status. A few weeks ago I created a stubby article on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_Montaigu_11a6.html" title="Collège de Montaigu">Collège de Montaigu</a> in Paris, a college where <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus.html" title="Erasmus">Erasmus of Rotterdam</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Calvin_f3ea.html" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a>, and <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Loyola_8402.html" title="Ignatius of Loyola">Ignatius of Loyola</a> were students. Nobody had created that article in the previous five years of Wikipedia's existence, and nobody has edited it after me. Would you say that an educational institution which (at least partly) educated three of the most important individuals of Early Modern European history is <i>non-notable</i>? In a hundred years, Erasmus, Calvin, and Ignatius of Loyola will <i>still</i> be considered among the most important people of European history, while many of the favourite hockey players of today and everything having to do with <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">pokemon</a> is likely to be long forgotten. I'm not saying Mark Lutz is another Erasmus, and I <i>may</i> be wrong about the pokemon, but I think you get my point. While we have a systemic bias favouring Western over non-Western topics, there is also a systemic bias disfavouring many Western classical and academic fields, except in some small areas where we have a few dedicated users. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:57, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>TerraFrost, since you (perhaps still) think the two are the same, but at least some of us don't, I still recommend you change the nomination to avoid the appearance of trying to mislead. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <span class="user-sig-date"><small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">12-31</a>&#160;00:28<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></span></i></span></dd>

Lutz is also the author or editor of several books and numerous articles in academic journals.
