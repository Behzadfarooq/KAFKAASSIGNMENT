That is disingenuous. Tsarevich Alexei was a certain heir to the throne of a nation of 150 million people. Barry Gurary was a not-so-certain heir to the religious leadership over a Hasidic movement of 50,000(?). There is no comparison whatsoever. Barry Gurary is profoundly NN.

<p>Note: Because it was I who objected to the tactics of <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a> in the first place, and now pushed to have this article <i>un</i>deleted, only to have it pounced upon by User:CrazyRussian again, the following refutation of his above points is required here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Barry Gurary was the <i>only</i> remaing male relative of the Schneersohn-Gurary-Shneerson family in his generation (note, that the 6th rebbe's name was spelled with an "h" in it, and the 7th rebbe was his cousin and that is why his name was spelled differently, without the "h"). This is very significant. Wikipedia has an article about <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alois_Hitler%2C_Jr._9fc9.html" title="Alois Hitler, Jr.">Alois Hitler, Jr.</a>, the half-brother of Hitler. Why? The <i>only</i> reason which indeed makes it notable is that he was Hitler's half-brother. Period. There are many other cases like this, such as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Harry_of_Wales_f9b1.html" title="Prince Harry of Wales">Prince Harry of Wales</a> (what has he done that makes him notable? and it's unlikely that he will ever be king of anything!), whereby family relationships alone warrant an article.</li>
<li>Barry Gurary didn't just "steal some books from his uncle" -- because who was to say that his uncle had a right to them in the first place. In any case the court ruled that the books belonged to the Chabad movement and not "to the uncle."</li>
<li>It is NOT "disengenious" to compare Barry Gurary to the <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsarevich_Alexei_Nikolaevich_of_Russia_513a.html" title="Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia">Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia</a> because, as I stated, the Tsrevitch was a young kid who never got to be Czar (and what did the Tsarevich ever do in his short life that made him "notable"?) Indeed there is an entire category called <a href="../../../h/e/i/Category%7EHeirs_apparent_who_never_acceded_883f.html" title="Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded">Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded</a> and Barry Gurary could fit into such a category perfectly if there were a Hasidic equivalent! When Barry was 14 (the age at which the Tsarevitch was executed by the Bolsheviks) he was indeed viewed as the ONLY heir to the Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty by his grandfather, the 6th rebbe.</li>
<li>When CrazyRussian compares Jewish statistics with Russian or world statistics he crosses all lines of logic because we are talking about Jews and Judaism and since there are only about 13 million Jews in the world, they will <i>always</i> be outnumbered compared to numbers in the world's general population (currently at over 6 BILLION).</li>
<li>To claim that there are not enough works about Barry Gurary in the world is also a poor argument (how many books are there about Alois Hitler Jr?) because there are many articles relating to Judaism, and to <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic Judaism</a> in particular about which there are few if any sources because the topics, while they may be of importance, remain signficant within the history of a group or as part of a sub-culture which may seem esoteric to outsiders.</li>
<li>At the very least, the article is far better than most of the hundreds of stubs relating to Jews and Judaism.</li>
<li>Finally, as CrazyRussian admits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shemaryahu_Gurary&amp;diff=75088509&amp;oldid=75088422" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shemaryahu_Gurary&amp;diff=75088509&amp;oldid=75088422" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, he hadn't even heard of Barry Gurary before he came across the article, and he was also the one who submitted it for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shemaryahu_Gurary&amp;diff=75088422&amp;oldid=75075893" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shemaryahu_Gurary&amp;diff=75088422&amp;oldid=75075893" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> so the question is: How can <i>anyone</i> judge, let alone submit for "deletion," an article they they openly admit they know nothing about? Therefore what is the rush to have it deleted again so quickly unless there may be other POV objectives that I cannot fathom at this time. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 03:03, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I won't be responding to this diatribe, other than to state that I am not a member of Chabad, do not care about Chabad, and don't have any tactics. As you, IZAK, well know, I do a lot of work with rabbinical bios. Whenever I see one not worth keeping IMO, I propose it for deletion.

<ul>
<li>Crazy: Why call what is a clear logical categorical rebuttal a "diatribe"&#160;? In any case, the issue of Barry Gurary goes way beyond the parameters of a "rabbi's bio", it touches upon a far deeper matter pertaining to how and why and at what point potential heirs to <i>any</i> dynasty or powerful group are marginalized and deligitimatized and sent into obscurity, if not literally executed at the end of it all. You know, as an example, if one were to adopt a Stalinist frame of mind, then Trotsky's bio is "not worth keeping" beyond tarring him as a cheap "villain," and yes I know, Barry Gurary was no Trotsky, but think of it in terms of the Hasidim who swear by family successions <i>only</i> when it comes to their rebbes' iron-clad rulership over them, Barry Gurary presents as big a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conundrum" class="extiw" title="wikt:conundrum">conundrum</a> to Lubavitch as much as the issue of Trotsky's mere existence represented to Stalinists.

<li>Crazy: Perhaps you are not that well-acquainted with Wikipedia yet where articles may start as stubs and then progress over time, sometimes years, into longer articles. This article is well beyond stub status, it has a number of links that verify a lot of its content. To ask for Harvard research-level quality as an article progresses is not always realistic because as you may be aware, articles need time, sometimes years, to evolve and mutate into better articles. Featured articles are not born overnight. And when an article touches upon potentially critical subject-matter, as this one does, you need to respect those editors who feel it has enough intrinsic value to be saved. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 04:22, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Khabad tries to let the people forget about leadership struggle for Khabad movement in 1950, and to represent R.Menakhem Mendel Schneerson as the sole candidate to the post, while there was a struggke underground which not ended up even 30 years later. As It is said, the winner side writes history. I never heard about Barry before inquirung in Rebbes genealogical table about succession line after R.Joseph Isaac death, it is clear that people outside Khabad wouldn't know the story. According to my opinion people should see different perspectives on Rebbe's messianism and immortality. Of course I recognize Rebbe's unique personality and contribution to modern Judaism.<a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarshavs_8b9b.html" title="User:Narshavs">Narshavs</a> 21:41, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Compared with the garage bands, webcomics, dorm rooms, and other stuff that regularly comes up for deletion, notability here is no problem. No-one's aerioualy challenging the existence of enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> etc. I disagree with claims that notability has to be based on what people do. As no less an authority on notability than Sherlock Holmes pointed out, what the dog didn't do in the night is just as notable as what it did do. The consequences of bowing out can be just as historically important, and notable, as bow-wowing in. As with dogs, so with would-be heirs to the Lubavitcher dynasty.

<li><b>Delete</b> Not only is he barely notable (I can't find almost any of the details by google searching even on the more scandal mongering anti-chabad sites) but the complete lack of sources runs afoul of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.

<li>Joshua: <i>If</i> Barry Gurary is "not notable" then why does the entire Lubavitch movement have a huge day of celebration ("<i>Didan Notzach</i>") trumpeting a secular court's ruling in their favor against Barry Gurary? As a number of people here have already pointed out, this alone deserves time for expansion and is certainly very notable in the context of the history of latter-day Chabad. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 14:11, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Joshua: The Lubavitchers are experts at hiding their own true beliefs!

Lot's of Lubavitch gloating and exuberance about this day - and without Barry Gurary's role as "the designated fall guy" none of it would make any sense. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 03:26, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
