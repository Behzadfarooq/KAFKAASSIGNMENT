<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-18_0115.html" title="Edit section: [CwO]climax">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[CwO]climax</span></h2>
<p><b>[CwO]climax</b></p>
<p>[CwO]climax or “climax” is one of the greatest players of the multiplayer game Team Fortress Classic (TFC). climax’s TFC career is incredible with many landmarks and records unmatchable by any other player.</p>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>climax first started playing TFC in the year 1999, when the game was much different than it is today. In 1999, climax went by the alias of Manulis and established a reputation of being a clan leader and an exceptional medic. The alias Manulis was used for two years in which Manulis was a member of over 100 clans. The majority of those two years was spent managing his own clan No Limit, a Stronger Than All (STA) League Gold clan. In 2000, Manulis took a year off and disappeared. He returned in 2001 under a new name and told no one of his identity. This new alias was climax. After intense training and studying of TFC techniques climax joined the clan Apprime, the resurrection of the famous clan (!)mnipotence lead by DrLove. Suspicion arose after climax joined Apprime, a STA Gold clan, after supposedly only playing TFC for two weeks. Many players believed climax could be an ex-hacker such as MassacrE making a comeback. More suspicion arose after climax’s incredible performances in matches and gathers. climax’s participation in Apprime was short lived due to the clan breaking up after only three matches, but by then climax’s talent was already known to others. An opponent and spectator of climax realized climax’s potential and immediately asked climax to audition for the clan Clock Work Orange [CwO]. After several tryouts as a medic climax was admitted to the clan.</p>
<p>Members of [CwO] soon realized that climax was more than a great medic, but he was also a great soldier, demoman, scout, and engineer. He was soon being used as more than just an offensive medic. Once [CwO] acquired climax the clan took off to be on the best in the game. They went on one sixteen match win streak starting off with a win against clan |404| in overtime in which climax captured the winning flag. Soon, [CwO] beat clan –Vindicate- for the STA Titanium Championship. [CwO] remained as a dominant force until the clan broke up. After nearly two years with [CwO], climax was forced to go elsewhere with the breakup. climax then joined a few other top clans but then named his retirement…</p>
<p>The retirement was short lived, as climax returned less than a month later under the alias derived. In order to maintain secrecy and to change things up a bit; derived presented himself as a soldier, and a very good one. He joined a mediocre clan in order to be able to play with two of his hometown friends, slickz and Omen. derived played with clan {GTO} for a few months and finally called it quits for good.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>climax is also known for having performed the only conced double super shotgun kill recorded in TFC history. Footage can be found on the POTW 13 file at <a href="http://www.thecatacombs.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.thecatacombs.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecatacombs.net/</a>. Go to Plays of the Week, Week 13.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Technique and Special Skills</b></p>
<p>The alias climax is used the most because under that alias, that was when he was at his prime in skill and popularity. Under Manulis he was just known as a clan leader and under derived he was known as a good soldier.</p>
<p>The skill that most signifies climax’s image, is bunnyhopping. climax could most possibly be the fastest and best bunnyhopper in TFC of all time. He utilized bunnyhopping not just with speed, but with accuracy, and multitask skill. climax once did a race against BlueGuy and Rent-A-Knight testing bunnyhopping, movement, and concussions; on the maps well and openfire. climax won the races on both maps by significant margins.</p>
<p>Also, climax had excellent precision with the shotgun and small weapons. From compiled statistics from previous Phat Farm servers, climax accuracy with the super shotgun was 89.4%. That is 15% higher than any other player logged in server’s statistical database. climax also had excellent precision with the rocket launcher and the pipe launcher in which, according to previous Phat Farms statistics, climax’s RPG accuracy (including splash damage) was 78%, which is a very good number considering rockets are sometimes shot in random or to frag one’s self. His detonation frag accuracy was seven frags per ten detonations, which is a very good ratio.</p>
<p>Probably climax’s best skill, is his technique and awareness. climax decisions during a match almost always produced good results. He is a master of communication, timing, and routing. Combining all of these skills together makes out a very formidable TFC player.</p>

<p>The John C Proctor Recreation Center has served the citizenry of Peoria since 1913, when the facility was opened by the Proctor Endowment, a Peoria charity established by local businessman, John C Proctor, a prominent lumber dealer and one of the organizers of the First National Bank of Peoria, now Commerce Bank. (In addition to the Proctor Recreation Center, which opened after Proctor's death, Proctor also donated a new facility for Cottage Hospital, subsequently renamed for the donor, and established and became a resident at the Proctor Endowment Home, sometimes called the "Proctor Home for Old People", both of which are still in operation today, although both have relocated to more suburban locations.</p>
<p>The recreation center and public baths were unique in that it was privately built and operated by the Proctor Endowment to serve a burgeoning population of workers and their families in Peoria's growing manufacturing industries.</p>
<p>The center was built to withstand the test of years with brick exterior, complimented by the heavy use of marbel in interior waiscoating to withstand the wear of the years. The building has a tile roof. skylit gyms, and brass doors.</p>
<p>While the public bathing facilities was a major component of the center's early purpose, the center offered a diverse variety of facilities which would be comparable to contemporary facilities, including a swimming pool, 2 gymnasiums, auditorium, library, arts and crafts rooms, etc. Today, the center, which covers a large city block, also has a number of outdoor sports courts.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the center was closed by the Endowment due to decreased returns on its investments, but was subsequently given to the City of Peoria Parks Department after a special election by Peoria's citizens.</p>
<p>As the center's 100th anniversary approaches, the center continues to serve the community and provides extensive recreational programming to serve the needs of the surrounding area, including specific anti-gang / anti-drug programs for young people. The Center, today is also home of Peoria's African-American Hall of Fame.</p>

Sharon Geller-Metal is an American industrial designer known for creating traditional Jewish ritual objects that uses a modern design vocabulary. Common features of her design include simplicity of line, a respect for materials and a rejection of the extraneous. Her judaica line, Gotham Judaica was launched in 2003.</p>
<p>Metal's design career began in 1972 at the Jewish Museum in New York City, where she studied at the museum's Tobe Pascher Workshop under renowned master silversmith Moshe Zabari. After earning a Masters of Industrial Design degree from Pratt Institute in New York City, Ms. Metal became a founding member of the Association of Women Industrial Designers, promoting the work of some of the most creative and innovative industrial designers working today. A multi-talented designer, Ms. Metal worked extensively in book jacket design and the fabrication of theater props for Broadway shows, including "Les Miserables" and "Phantom of the Opera."</p>
<p>Sharon Geller-Metal's work displays a practical knowledge of Jewish ritual and strives to conform to standards of Jewish law. Her Hebrew calligraphy is a signature design element in many of her pieces.</p>
