<p><b>Delete</b> - This article is on a <i>nn</i> organization with under 1500 google hits. The article itself is simply a bunch of different lists, with the highlight being the "history" section (it was created in 2003). NN. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 23:50, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Forensics is a notable activity, but I don't think each of its state chapters deserves an article. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 23:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There probably is more history that can be added than is in the article right now. I'm not sure what it adds to the article, though. The major content of the article is the list of winners, and that, alas, isn't very encyclopaedic. Also, as goes this article, probably should go other state league articles (e.g. California's). —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 02:12, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There <i>is</i> more history to the league, along with additional information regarding the officers and competitors that can be put here. Give others the time to contribute to the page.--<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckaroo54_51ae.html" title="User:Buckaroo54">Buckaroo54</a> 12:30, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What more history can there be for an organization that's been in existance for 3 years? Also, most of this information is unencyclopedic. A list of officers, a list of award winners...those belong on a state website, not a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 12:36, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The organization has been in existence <i>in its current legal form</i> for only three years; it goes back further under prior name/structure. History is a worthy addition to the page. I don't think officer and competitor information is useful for an encyclopaedic article, though. On that I agree with Metros232: lists of winners belong on the FFL web page and not here. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 21:05, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well one thing the article would need to assert then (if kept) is the history of it. I didn't understand that part really and assumed it meant that people were working to organize it for a bit and finally achieved active status in 2003. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 21:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My main objection to the article is the fact that it is nothing more than a collection of unencyclopedic lists.

<li><b>Delete</b>; Wikipedia is not a backup service for floridaforensics.org or any other website. Find some nontrivial third-party reviews for references, or I see no reason to keep. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:12, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> State forensic leagues are not mere chapters. They have hundreds of events each year, thousands of participants and are the main way in which NFL members gain experience. It is like saying we should not have a New York Mets page, since we have one for Major League Baseball. In addition, state leagues sponsor different events than the NFL does. These would be lost if there were not state level pages. In addition, there is more to this page already than there is for most of the High School pages in Wikipedia. Sure, the page needs work, but a lot of our pages do. See also the discussions at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENational_Forensic_League_642e.html" title="Talk:National Forensic League">Talk:National Forensic League</a>, where active encouragement has been given to developing State league pages. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 13:15, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know if one or two people (Wikistar) saying there should be state league articles counts as there being "active encouragement" for these pages. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 13:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The encouragement is recent, therefore, active. Since there are not exactly a high number of editors working on article or the broader movemnet, I believe it is significant. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 13:24, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The information on this page is the same type of information that is found on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Catholic_Forensic_League_b242.html" title="National Catholic Forensic League">NCFL</a> page. Both articles have an extremely brief history, a description of events offered, and information about the tournaments offered. This article, however, goes so far as to describe the league officers, the individual districts in the league, the qualification criteria, and the champions in each event, all of which are not included on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Catholic_Forensic_League_b242.html" title="National Catholic Forensic League">NCFL</a> page. This seems to indicate that this article is, in fact, <i>more</i> comprehensive than national forensics articles. --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckaroo54_51ae.html" title="User:Buckaroo54">Buckaroo54</a> 17:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Several remarks have been made regarding the lists of winners found on this page. If that is the main problem with the article, then can we not <i>move</i> that content to a page similar to NCFL Grand National 2006 (or delete it, if it is necessary) instead of deleting this entire page?--<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckaroo54_51ae.html" title="User:Buckaroo54">Buckaroo54</a> 17:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> While the list of winners is a major problem with this page, its removal would not, IMO, make the article any more encyclopedic. - <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 22:02, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
