<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. When the debate is primarily ten people, each accusing everyone of bad faith except themselves, it's hard to pick out cogent points. The consensus is a little weak, but does favour delete (particularly as there is some very fishy (sockpuppetty) 'keep' votes). And, as the discussion has become less about the merits (or lack) of this article than into an incoherent shouting match, the main reason for my going with deletion is the fact that the article is a collection of external links, thus failing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, anyway. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 15:22, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. You completely bypassed the AFD, which is a key concept of Wikipedia, and decided to rename it yourself without taking into account the views of other editors. If you want the article to be renamed, cross out your "delete" vote and change it to "rename to ...".

<li><b>Comment</b>. I haven't changed it again (well, I did, but just to correct a mistake in someone else's move). As for your concern about my hypocrisy, it's a false argument. First off, nobody has said this will not be dealt with elsewhere. I just don't have the time to deal with everything right now. We can take this one day at a time, kay? But even if I didn't want to correct the problems elsewhere, that wouldn't be any evidence that I'm <i>wrong</i> here. If I beat my wife it wouldn't make it any less true that you shouldn't beat your wife if it came out of my mouth. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 20:15, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

What ever the excuses you have given here, does not justify your present attitude,which is very much biased.If you,as i said, are genuinely interested at removing the phrase "terrorist attacks" ,you should do it equally in every article.By picking up this article alone,and neglecting the others just shows your duplicity.--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 20:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b> I wanted to mention this is littered with allegations that are misrepresented as facts. Many of the incidents show no proof LTTE had any part in it, but its completely misrepresented in the article. In addition many incidents rely on a Sri Lankan government letter sent to the UN citing incidents. Its hardly a credible source of information and could just be propaganda material. Title is hardly NPOV. There is hardly verifiable evidence to indicate and prove its "Terrorist attacks carried by the LTTE". <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElalan_06ee.html" title="User:Elalan">Elalan</a> 23:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The current title "Terrorist Attacks carried out by the LTTE" is certainly POV. LTTE has not accepted responsibility for all of these attacks. Most of the accusations have been made by the Sri Lankan Government, and it is very likely that their version is full of exaggerations. Merging the article content under the title "Attacks <i>attributed</i> to the LTTE" is a better solution. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I totally disagree.The article is not only <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> it is also one of the best referenced article i've ever seen in wikipedia.Your case against this is very weak, i would rather say.Most of the accussations comes from every corner of the world,And most importantly from the people who suffered from their brutality.<b>And to claim,since LTTE dont admit this must be false,is infact your POV.</b>.And the fact that, <b>LTTE never denied most of this accusations should be noticed here</b>.please tell me ,why would they never denied these allegations when they were first made&#160;?? Since most of these terrorist attacks were carried out in mercenary type or in suicide mission, unless dead people come from their graves,one must say we never know the absolute truth of this.But what we know is, LTTE have every reason to terrorise sinhalese and even muslim people.They want sinhalese/muslims out of their mythical homeland by any means..<b>And even this,article actually do not carry every single terrorist act of them.The list is,sadly huge!!</b>.And none of the attacks were exaggerations by GOSL,and i would really appreciate if you can come up with any. finally i would like to state, that this article has not violated any of the wiki policies.And arguments against are "amazingly weak",and simply can be put into various "logical fallacies". --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 14:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> again engage in a logical fallacy of "Since GOSL are invlove in this crisis what they say cant be true"..If we apply this logic, then we must dismiss every source which comes from tamil sides,LTTE or NOT, because they too are a party of this crisis.Also, we should ruled out any comments made by the norwegians too.As peace keepers they too,are involve in this.So,we can simply reject their claims using the above logic.Finally, we may end up with nothing,since the above logic simply ruled out "a good portion of the sources". And speaking of civility, its amazing that those comments comes from someone"who deleted his own talk page just to cover himself up".someone who uses words such as "goons", "stupid" ,"kid" ,"immature" to describe fellow wikipedians and yet hasn't done a single apology at all!!</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sri Lankan govt letter to the UN is not a WP:RS. That is the biggest problem with this article. Where is there reliable. neutral, authoritative source to indicate this is a "terrorist attack." Hence 115 events have to removed to start with In this it claims "LTTE" did it. It has no substantiation to make this claim. A Sri Lankan govt. letter to UN is hardly of any substance and doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Are we starting to publish everyone's letters on wikipedia&#160;? The way it is worded, there is apparently proof the LTTE did, but this is complete misrepresentation coming from clearly a propaganda letter. The article is the boldest example of WP:POV, it relies on what is a propaganda source to advertise that these events were true. Where it relies on other sources of evidence, its got show that its "a terrorist attack". If that wording is not in the source then its <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> (original research). <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElalan_06ee.html" title="User:Elalan">Elalan</a> 21:55, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is obvious that from all the sources given here(which you seem to have missed) these brutal acts of terrorism were done by the LTTE.And even LTTE, has not denied of these cases, esp none of the masacres carried out by them..And in case you havent noticed, there is a clear verdict against prabhakaran on his involvement of central bank bombing <a href="http://www.spur.asn.au/News_2002_Nov_03_to_04.htm#" class="external text" title="http://www.spur.asn.au/News_2002_Nov_03_to_04.htm#" rel="nofollow">jail sentence</a>.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> (<a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Iwazaki_1638.html" title="Special:Contributions/Iwazaki">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Plus, there is the notice: "Please note that since some of the incidents were contained in a letter authored by a Sri Lankan government official, it's contents may or may not be neutral.". By mentioning these incidents, we are not saying that LTTE committed these acts. We are just saying that they were attributed to LTTE by some organizations/governments/news channels, and we are providing sources. The reader may check these sources and exercise his/her own judgment. Moreover, the article can be expanded to include LTTE's denial of these attacks or information about possible involvement of non-LTTE parties in these attacks. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> LTTE did carry out every single attack stated in the article and a lot more not in this article.And these are acts of terrorism.And even in the wikipedia they have an separate template titled infobox terrorist attacks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_terrorist_attack" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_terrorist_attack" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.Which is work of an administrator named Tariqabjotu.So the word "terrorist attacks" is not POV at all according to wikipedia.You may have a case against calling them terrorist,but not against the use of "terrorist attacks"..And if you have any questions regarding cited incidents, i would like to take every single incident and discuss with you.And,finally, i would like to tell you that the ,LTTE have not categorically denied most of the massacres stated in this article. --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 19:15, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Reply to <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">User:Utcursch</a>, Terrorist attacks attributed versus Notable attack as a tile. If the former, then each and every attack has to fit the definition of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> page, attacks aginst military instalations cannot be included. If the title is latter then the attacks have to be notable ingoring the troubles associated with terrorist attack definition, hence my preferance to <b>Notable attacks by the LTTE</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The reason they're unreliable is that for a great many of them, their source is solely the Government of Sri Lanka. The GoSL has certainly been known for lying about these incidents (indeed, it has even been accused--in some cases likely justifiably--of blaming its own soldiers' crazed attacks on the LTTE). Therefore, reports of LTTE attacks whose only source is the GoSL are <i>inherently unreliable.</i> Third party reports from reliable neutral parties is an <i>absolute must</i> for such an article. This cannot be remedied with this silly "some of the incidents were contained in a letter authored by a Sri Lankan government official, [so] it's contents may or may not be neutral" note. <b>If they're not known to be reliable, they <i>cannot</i> be included</b>. To work the way that is being suggested with such a note is like writing an article of fiction and having it pass muster because you note at the top "this article may be lies". Sorry, but we <i>obviously</i> cannot work that way. In addition, the entire article is POV. The reason we have <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notable_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_65d5.html" title="Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE">Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE</a> is twofold. First, is so that only attacks that are notable enough for an encyclopedia are included. Are these attacks notable? If they are, they can go into that article.

<li>Iwazaki, whether the claims in the letter are correct or not, the source of the letter is biased. I will <i>not</i> provided evidence for what cases are not true. That's not the point at all. If the source is unreliable (and it is, since it is clearly biased to the pro-GoSL point of view), it cannot be used. If what's contained in the letter is correct, you should have <i>no trouble</i> finding it printed in an <i>independent reliable source</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Okay, this is the last time I'm going to bother responding to you, since you seem to be intentionally ignoring my actual point. There is no "evidence" that <i>this time</i> the GoSL is lying. However, it has to be accepted that the GoSL is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> on the LTTE because it is <i>so involved</i> in the conflict with that group. That's the whole definition of <i>reliable source</i> - a source that is neutral to the issue. It is <i>not</i> "our" turn to find reliable sources to question the validity of the GoSL letter. It is <i>your</i> responsibility to show what is an <i>inherently unreliable source</i> (a source so close to one side in an <i>incredibly heated</i> conflict) is actually the truth. Basically, both the LTTE and the GoSL have to be excluded from your fact-finding mission (except where they are reporting on their own actions, and even then they have to be examined carefully). Both sources are <i>obviously</i> suspect to a great degree, to the point where we cannot accept them. If what GoSL is claiming in the letter is truthful, then there will be <i>no problem</i> finding reports from neutral parties on the same incidents. So go searching for the obvious truth. This is an encyclopedia--don't expect your articles to be handed to you fully-formed by Sri Lankan officials. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 20:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

When its people are dying from the acts of terrorism,and there are over 200 such acts carried out during 1980-2000,GOSL had every right to made complains to the relevant international bodies.Every incident stated in the article is carried out by LTTE for obvious reasons,ethnic cleansing..And for my knowledge they have even not denied most of them&#160;!!</dd>

<p>if you are claiming GOSL sources are biased, you should prove it..And provide counter arguments for it..Just because GOSL is engaged in a war against LTTE, we cant dismiss every single claim made by the GOSL.We should take, every case carefully and analyse it thoroughly before making any conclusions.And in this case,you havent done any of it.Also the article has given non government sources too,but you still want to delete it,and merge into a different article,which says nothing about terrorist attacks&#160;!! so i have the feeling that this isnt about evidences after all. Finally, except for giving classical examples of logical fallacies,such as Appeal to Ignorance,you have done absolutely nothing to justify your position here. --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 21:05, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>strong keep</b>. As a fellow editor had already stated,this is one of the best referenced article in wikipedia. All the incidents are definitely carried out by the LTTE and so far i have failed to see any proper argument against this.And for the merging, i <b>strongly</b> oppose the proposed idea by fellow editors.As for reasons i have given under comments..Also, bear in mind there is clear ethnic cleansing going in north and east against sinhalese/muslims and LTTE historically have shown that they are willing to do anything to expel those communities from their mythical land of eelam.finally i would like to add the following link ,where you can see one of the survivors of the most brutal terrorist attack ever carried out against the Buddhist monks in the history of the world.<a href="http://www.helabima.org/Aranthalawa.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.helabima.org/Aranthalawa.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I had the opportunity to met ven monk, and even to say this was not carried out by LTTE, is an insult to all the 32 monks who perished in that incident.Please try to stop your tears, when you look at this <a href="http://www.nmatnet.com/picturegallary/details.php?image_id=10&amp;sessionid=5dd743d716c62e42a8563df36f663b2c" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nmatnet.com/picturegallary/details.php?image_id=10&amp;sessionid=5dd743d716c62e42a8563df36f663b2c" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>,i say this because i couldn't. --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 19:32, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The nomination is flawed in the 1st place as POV is not a reason for deletion. As per <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a></li>

<blockquote>
<p>The deletion processes all focus on whether an article meets the criteria for existence on Wikipedia; that is, they are to determine whether it is not original research, its central information is verifiable, and it is capable of achieving a neutral point of view with good editorship. <b>XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked, whose perspective is against ones beliefs, or which is not yet presented neutrally</b>. Using XfD as a "protest strategy" in an editorial or NPOV debate is generally an abuse of process and the article will usually be speedy kept.</p>

<dl>
<dd>This article has a wealth of information that is not contained anywhere else in Wikipedia. As pointed out, what is wrong with using statistics of a national government about dead citizens? What is the nutrality dispute there? When someone is killed, it is the duty of a government to go through the incindet and file a report about it.</dd>
<dd>The word "terrorist attacks" is not POV and is widely used in Wikipedia. As <a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> pointed out, there is already a template called <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_terrorist_attack_3b60.html" title="Template:Infobox terrorist attack">Template:Infobox terrorist attack</a> and a number of other articles including

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Also, a look at the articles that link to the terrorist attack template shows how many notable attacks have been labled as terrorist attacks. For example, the <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_City_bombing_680f.html" title="Oklahoma City bombing">Oklahoma City bombing</a> article starts off</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oklahoma City bombing was a terrorist attack on April 19, 1995, in which the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, a U.S. government office complex in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was destroyed, killing 168 people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The September 11, 2001 attacks (often referred to as 9/11—pronounced "nine eleven") consisted of a series of coordinated terrorist[1] suicide attacks by Islamic extremists on the United States on September 11, 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>And the article <b>should not be merged</b> with the notable attacks article as that primarily focuses upon the military attacks by the LTTE and the terrorist attacks article focuses on the Terrorist, ie attacks against civilians.

<li><b>Comment</b>. You're claiming that because there are other articles which go against Wikipedia guidelines that that's evidence that this article should also? Isn't that some sort of fallacy? As for the wealth of information the article contains--is that wealth of information encyclopedic? Does Wikipedia have a List of murders in Los Angeles article? As for POV not being a reason for deletion, if the article cannot be anything <i>other</i> than POV, that is, if the entire issue is POV from the start, (the way this article is named is undoubtedly POV that cannot be allowed to stay), then, yes, POV <i>is</i> a reason for deletion. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 17:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The other articles prove that there is a wide consensus within the Wikipedia community that the word "terrorist" is acceptable. Just because you don't like it that does not mean that it shouldn't be used. Again, if you dispute that, you do not have to go through the articles, simply nominate them for deletion as they contain the word terrorist in the title. Your need to delete this article <b>ONLY</b> and your unwillingness to take engage in any other article with the title terrorism or the "terrorist Attack" template clearly displays your bias and duplicity in this matter. And we aren't talking about 1 or 2 murders here. If we listed all the murders carried out by the LTTE we'll get a really, really long list. Only the <b>notable</b> incidents where at least about 4 or 5 people were killed are listed. Comparably, there is an article subsection list of serial killers in the US <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_serial_killers_by_country.html#USA" title="List of serial killers by country">List_of_serial_killers_by_country#USA</a>. -<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><b>talk</b></a></font> / <font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><b>@</b></a></font> )</sup> 19:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Oh, goodness gracious. First off, those articles don't prove anything--you'd have to also know how many articles that <i>could</i> use the word "terrorist" but don't in order to get any idea whatsoever of how widespread and accepted its use is (plus, Wikipedia isn't a democracy, it's an encyclopedia out to publish facts in a neutral way, and if something's wrong with 95% support, <i>it's still wrong</i>). Secondly, I explained quite well on your talk page why I am currently dealing with this article. And I did not say I would never go deal with the other articles, which, BTW, might not require deletion--if they're only POV in their naming, then they just need renaming. This article, however, is POV in its entirety, using GoSL propaganda as its main source, which is clearly against <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As for your argument that this article only includes <i>notable</i> incidents, do you mean it only includes incidents that the people maintaining <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notable_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_65d5.html" title="Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE">Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE</a> don't think are notable? There's already an article on <i>notable</i> incidents, so why you'd be arguing that this article is about notable incidents, I do not know. Clearly, it's a POV fork from <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notable_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_65d5.html" title="Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE">Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE</a>, an attempt to include as many "incidents" as possible, including all sorts of incidents that are reported by the GoSL and the GoSL alone, because those level-headed individuals maintaining the other article didn't want it turned into the huge POV mess this one is. This article certainly doesn't make any mention of notability, and, in fact, someone from this AfD has been adding it to article "See also" lists as <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_7d95.html" title="Terrorist attacks attributed to the LTTE"><i>Comprehensive</i> list of terrorist attacks carried out by LTTE</a>. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 20:01, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Iwazaki, you can't vote a million times, vote once and respond to other statements as comments. This is truly uncivil to drag in the names of Wiki editors in every comment you make like the one above the previous fake vote of yours. I am not looking at deleting a template as you have mentioned above, but it is more likely that you are getting very frustrated and losing temper because the pages you cried out against including the State terrorism template are all being confirmed to be perfectly <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a> So respond to points in a fair and civil way than just cry out and hit out at everybody against you.</li>

<p>Inspite of repeated requests and warnings you still haven't changed, not just with me, but with anyone who has a stance against that of yours. Instead of trying to understand that they are talking about a context, you think they are out to get you and prove you wrong. I am posting this very specifically because you have been too much for quite some time, meddling with my talk page, posting uncivil comments and the list is endless and all the warnings and messages in your talk page testify it.</p>
<p>I'm specifically making this point here because you have dragged in my name for no reason here as italicized: <i>And its good to know, like Sudharsansn ,you also want to delete a certain template</i> and this is totally uncivil.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: The LTTE is recognised as one of the most ruthless terrorist groups in the world, classified as a terrorist organisation by 29 countries including the US, and the LTTE has has been responsible for the most heinious and brutal murders of women and children in Sri Lanka. The relevant article has extensively referenced sources for every quote. There is a group of people with vested interest like the LTTE sympathisers who want to expunge this information in order to whitewash the LTTE hence their objection to this article in the wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government of Sri Lanka is a reliable source <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, for the main reason that <b>as a government the statements that it(Goverment of sri lanka) makes carry a inherent sense of responsibility</b>. A goverment's comminiques are carefully considered statements which are reliable sources which do not contravene any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guidlines.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the main people unhappy with sourcing from the Government of Sri Lanka are LTTE sympathisers or antigovernment forces who are quite happy to use pro eelam websites such as tamilcanadian.com, tamilnation.org, Tamiltigers.net as sources for there potentially libelous orchestrated attack on the Sri lankan goverment via the wikipedia artcle <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Terrorism_in_Sri_Lanka_8f88.html" title="State Terrorism in Sri Lanka">State Terrorism in Sri Lanka</a> yet cry foul when a Goverment source is used to substantiate a LTTE attack.</p>
<p>I wish to make a strong point, if the government of sri lanka cannot be used as a reliable source, then coversely none of the pro eelam sites or LTTE sympathisers and LTTE fronts like tamilnation.org can be used either, and thus would justify a swift call for a strong deletion of articles like <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Terrorism_in_Sri_Lanka_8f88.html" title="State Terrorism in Sri Lanka">State Terrorism in Sri Lanka</a>, which use multiple pro eelam sites (ex&#160;: "Sri Lankan State terrorism by Tamiltigers.net") to substantiate their allegations.</p>
<p>This article uses multiple cited reliable sources like the goverment of sri lankas official communiques, amnesty international's reports. US state department's reports etc to highlight the ghastly murders including the killing of Buddhist monks done by one of the most murderous and ruthless terrorist groups to appear on the face of this earth which pioneered the concept of suicide bombing. It is NPOV and should be allowed to stay as a article in accordance with the wikipedia policies. There should be no whitewashing allowed for a classified terrorist group like the LTTE.</p>
<p>I also urge the people who question the statements made in this article to <b>highlight the relevant sections that in there opinion are disputed</b> so we can discuss and find other sources to substantiate the claims if needed.</p>
<p>I urge the ruling admin to strongly consider the importance of this article, and the neutrality and the mutiple reliable source used to substantiate the claims and continue to let this article exist.</p>
<p>It would be interesting that a similar debate regarding the infinitely more libelous and defamatory template against the Sri Lankan government called Template:State terrorism in Sri Lanka ended up in a "no consensus" ruling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_15" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_15" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerr_avon_f75a.html" title="User:Kerr avon">Kerr avon</a> 09:35, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, Kerr avon, those articles/templates should also be deleted as being based on unreliable sources. This AfD is going to end up as no consensus as well, since the majority of the votes, on both sides, are based on emotion and not appeal to Wikipedia policy, and there are sockpuppets (both confirmed and not) on both sides.</dd>

<dd>Now, as for your statement that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> says that since it is from government it is reliable, that is a misrepresentation. It says that "Government publications are often reliable, but governments vary widely in their level of reliability, and often have their own interests which will explicitly allow for withholding of information, or even outright deception of the public." This is clearly a case where the government is far too involved as a partisan in the conflict to be considered reliable. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 14:24, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
