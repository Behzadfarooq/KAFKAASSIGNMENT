<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:08, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>While it's good to know that the subject's webmaster approves his bio to appear here, it woudl be <i>better</i> if there were some evidence of actual notability per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. As it stands what we have here is: he's an evangelist. He evangelises. Here are some of the places he's evangelised. Did we mention he's an evangelist?

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> as vanity spam. I am seriously getting annoyed with Jason Gastrich's attempts to flood Wikipedia with articles of Christianity. I have nothing against Christianity, but he clearly knows that <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> takes priority. Yet, Jason relentlessly creates non-notable articles for his organization <a href="http://wiki4christ.com/" class="external text" title="http://wiki4christ.com/" rel="nofollow">Wiki 4 Christ</a> and refers others to influence the AfD votes, others who don't understand the entire situation.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with the statement that the article needs editing, to better reflect NPOV, but he should be represented in a comprehensive encyclopedia -- the TV show "Day of Discovery" is shown every week on our CBS affiliate station, with him as a major contributor.<a href="http://www.keyc.tv/nw/article/view/23574" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.keyc.tv/nw/article/view/23574" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="../../../1/d/i/User%7E1diot.html" title="User:1diot">1diot</a> 18:05, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Once again, folks, the stuff in the article is almost entirely unverifiable. The claims there are extremely non-specific, and the little bit about WNYM I haven't been able to verify. (The station has had several incarnations.)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article needs a clean up, but I think we can do it without deleting it... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:07, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<li><i>'I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same', 'Two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the user that put this bio up in the first place. Dr. DeYoung is a notable speaker. He is the <a href="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" class="external text" title="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" rel="nofollow">cohost</a> on <a href="http://www.rbc.org/dod/home.php" class="external text" title="http://www.rbc.org/dod/home.php" rel="nofollow">Day of Discovery</a>, which is a nation-wide show. He is heard on over 1000 radio stations in North America. He is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970824602/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970824602/" rel="nofollow">published author</a>, a <a href="http://www.prophecytoday.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.prophecytoday.com/" rel="nofollow">radio talk-show host</a>, a <a href="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" class="external text" title="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" rel="nofollow">television cohost</a> , and, yes, an evangelist. I am not a sock-puppet of anyone. My name is Chad Smith - I haven't added a lot of stuff, that's true, but I'm a real person. If you check the links in the article, you'll see that the info is on the up and up. If you think the links have been put up to support a fake article, check the web archive for them. Dr. DeYoung has a large number of listeners, his web site gets tens of thousands of visitors per month. Just because you haven't heard of him, doesn't mean he's not notable. There are plenty of notable people in fields that are outside my interests that deserve to be on Wikipedia. The same is true for each of us. Dr. DeYoung is in the <a href="http://www.pre-trib.org/about-members.php" class="external text" title="http://www.pre-trib.org/about-members.php" rel="nofollow">Pre-Trib Study Group</a> that Tim LaHaye started, as in the coauthor of the Left Behind series. Is <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_LaHaye_a4ed.html" title="Tim LaHaye">Tim LaHaye</a> in the Wikipedia? Yes. Granted, Tim LaHaye has more mainstream success, but Tim LaHaye thinks enough of Dr. DeYoung to include his notes in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0899579248/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0899579248/" rel="nofollow">Tim LaHaye Prophecy Study Bible</a>, in which Dr. DeYoung's is cited as a contributor, and has an entire article included. His article is on page 973 and is entitled "Israel Today" if you'd like to go to a bookstore and check it out, and the list of contributors in the front shows that this is the same Dr. Jimmy DeYoung of Shofar Communications that I am referring to in this article. It may be true that this article should be cleaned up. It was my first addition of an article, and only the 3rd or 4th one I've worked on. But please don't remove it. I don't even know who this Jason person is. I've gone through it a little bit and tired to clean it up, and make it more acceptable for Wikipedia. I'm sure more work can be done, but I wanted to at least include some of the verification sources to help keep it on the Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChad78_10c6.html" title="User:Chad78">Chad78</a>.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Vanity, non-NPOV, non notability. This reads like a press release, not an encyclopedia entry. 12.210.85.52 02:27, 23 January 2006 (UTC) (sorry, hadn't logged in yet.) <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen611_d377.html" title="User:Zen611">Zen611</a> 02:28, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
