<li>You are making a fundamentally wrong assumption: this does <i>not</i> have to be an article about a film: it can be an article documented the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> evidence that the film was talked about, even if this film does not exist, and even if it never exists. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> states that "if such an unreleased film can meet the criteria in our basic guidelines, then a case can be made for its notability." <i>Jurassic Park IV</i> meets criterion 1, "The film has been the subject of multiple, significant published works, whose source is independent of the film and its creators/producers." The fact that the article <i>as currently stands</i> is about the film, rather than the about the verifiable evidence is a reason for cleanup, not for deletion. Finally, I note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> is a <i>proposed</i> guideline and certainly does not override the core policy of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: First of all, <i>Jurassic Park IV</i> has been in development as early as 2001, with no production ever going beyond that stage. The Google hits are because of the various happenstances in the development stage since that year, and I must remind you, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a>, "Films merely 'in development' are subject to many rumors and unsubstantiated speculation, and such films often <b>never reach actual production</b>, let alone theatrical release." (Emphasis is mine.) As you can see, the article contains rumors and unsubstantiated speculation. In addition, this is an article about a <i>film</i>. Production of this film is not guaranteed to take place -- being in development since 2001 should reflect how iffy the film's chances are. I would not oppose the recreation of the article when production is set for a time and location with casting completed. However, some people who voted to "keep" are relying on the notion of "enough" Google hits -- take a look at a search for <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22jurassic+park+iv%22+OR+%22jurassic+park+4%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22jurassic+park+iv%22+OR+%22jurassic+park+4%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" rel="nofollow">JPIV or JP4 in the Google News Archive</a>, which generates more notable results than the large majority of a typical Google search. And the number is 216. Combined with the fact that there's been rumblings since 2001, that number is rather small and a weak indication of actual production. Seeing that films in development are not guaranteed to be made, this in turn does not meet WP:CRYSTAL standards because the subject of the article, the film itself, may never take place, and the existing documentation is not strong enough to indicate that production will actually take place. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 15:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Even though production isnt really moving fast, it is being made. Spielberg himself has said it numerous times. Suposedly, filming is due sometime in 2007 once Indiana Jones IV is completed. So I say keep it. darkyoda141 Febuary 20 2007</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Spielberg has also said that it's last on his list, and that he's focusing on Indy 4 right now. Are we going to start getting into the habit of creating articles for films that will not be in production for half a decade? "Pre-production" does not mean it will be made. Scouting locations is just a way to get prepared for when the time comes that you get the go ahead for "production".

<li><b>Comment:</b> Under crystal ball - "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place." We don't know it is "certain to take place". Pre-production doesn't mean they will make the film. I just don't think there is enough reliably sourced information to warrant a page at this moment. It seems better suited for a film series, or on the page for the 3rd film. <i>Saw IV</i> was greenlit and is going to be made, according to the studio, it's pretty definite, but there isn't enough information to support an entire article. We're talking about an article for a film that has years before it get's put into production, because Spielberg has yet to start Indy 4. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 23:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>God complex has multiple sources (although I agree it's not adequate). Note also the difference between <i>verified</i> and <i>verifiable</i>. The <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_complex.html" title="God complex">god complex</a> article is certainly the latter (and partly the former as well). Also, redirects do not necessarily support concept formation. They are intended to make searching easier.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think "Christ complex" is the Christian religion-oriented version of the Messianic complex, which as DGG has noted, is different from a God complex. The term "messianic complex" exists and has use in professional circles (see <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0037-7732(194005)18%3A4%3C521%3APATMC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0037-7732(194005)18%3A4%3C521%3APATMC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://www.thehope.org/mescompl.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thehope.org/mescompl.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). I do not think we should merge "messianic complex" into "God complex" as the former may manifest itself as a martyr complex rather than a superiority complex (this is all based on my quite fuzzy understanding of the precise meanings of the terms). I suggest we entertain two proposals (please add others or revise these if you like):</li>

<li>Yes, television shows are legitimate sources. However, the <i>article</i> has no sources. Sources definitely exist, but they need to be cited in the article (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.) Unfortunately an article requires multiple, non-trivial, reliable third-party sources to achieve notability. Star Trek episodes, books, and officially licensed products fail the "third-party" requirement. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 20:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I disagree with your statement, notability is often very subjective (mostly because the criteria is so often variable, almost any elected politician will get an article, but are they truly notable? I doubt it). Butyour claim is meaningless anyway, as it's pretty clear Star Trek is notable. Nobody is going to argue that. This is an aspect of Star Trek. As such, some coverage of it is appropriate, even if it's just to say "The Agonizer is a pain-causing punishment device found in the following episodes/Novels/whatever of Star Trek". Not covering it would be silly. Wikipedia is not paper, this article is not silly, it's sourceable, and it doesn't violate NPOV. So while i can accept merging it, deleting it is just the wrong idea. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:14, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">notability is <i>not</i> subjective.</a> This is <b>consensus</b> on Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>I am aware there are people on Wikipedia with that opinion. I believe they are mistaken, because nobody has an objective criteria for notability, believe it or not, it is ultimately based on subjective observation that "enough" other sources have covered the subject. And just throwing links to various pages around doesn't make your argument for you, not when those pages themselves lack substantive and convincing arguments to justify their position. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is just a guideline, nothing more. If you wish to persuade me, try offering arguments related to the subject at hand, not throwing page links around. This is supposed to be about the <b>Agonizer</b> isn't it? As something in Star Trek, which regardless of your opinion as to whether notability is subjective or not, is notable, it therefore becomes a question of how best to cover the subject. It's a discrete and independent device, and appears in more than one episode...but those episodes cover the same subject, which has its own article, so why not merge it there? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not trying to persuade you of anything. I'm trying to help you out, because (and I apologize if I'm wrong!) it doesn't seem like you have a clear understanding of what <a href="../../../p/g/_/WP%7EPG_70f0.html" title="WP:PG">guidelines on Wikipedia are</a>, nor do you seem to have an understanding of what <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">the idea of consensus on Wikipedia</a> is.

I'm "throwing page links around" because I'm trying to refer you back to where I derive the reasoning for my arguments, and to illustrate that I derive them from guidelines and policies agreed on by Wikipedia consensus.

<li>And you seem to have no idea what I'm saying, or how you're coming across. I'm trying not to be offensive here, but you have not been persuasive, your methods are ineffective, and it's not going to change my mind or help me in any way. Sorry, but the net benefit to me is nil or less. Honestly, I'd rather you stuck to discussing the subject at hand, rather than addressing this other problem. And to try to get back to that, look at it this way, is there any question that it's appropriate to have an article on the episodes of the Trek series this device appears in? Describing those episodes without mentioning this device would be silly, don't you think? It's one thing to not mention every person in a group scene, but this device provided significant importance. Not mentioning it would leave a major hole in explaining how the Mirror universe was different from the "real" universe. Now does this mean an article on it? Maybe not, but a redirect is cheap. However, we have the problem that it's in more than one episode...of different series in the same universe. So that may lead to a different decision. It's not quite right for an article on Devices in Star Trek, but luckily in this case, with several episodes of Trek series (and a few books), there's enough content that the whole Alternate universe warrants an article. Thus <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agonizer.html" title="Agonizer">Agonizer</a> can be properly described and redirected there. If that's not satisfactory to you, please offer an explanation as to why. And no, an argument about how not every item on Taco Bell's menu should have an article will not serve. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think you are misrepresenting the policies here. To begin with, not all dictionaries specialize in giving meanings or definitions. For instance, there are dictionaries for pronunications, for frequency, grammatical usage, etc. You take a look at almost any good Chinese dictionary and you find that they indicate this or that character is also a surname. The best one also have a list of Chinese surnames in the back. As it looks now, the article is nothing but a list of surnames and their pronunications according to their frequency in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, you are also misreading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, which covers a much wider range of articles that should not be in Wikipedia.</li>

<dd>As I said earlier, I cannot see what the frequency in PRC has to do with Chinese surnames in general, something that this article purports to discuss. In the explantion of the statistics for 2006, it states that it is based on information from 1100 counties and cities in the whole of China. Last time I checked, China had more than 2000 counties and usually statistics from China include the PRC only. If you claim that Taiwan is included, the burden of proof is on you not me.</dd>

<dd>I had read your response prior to my comment. From the thread I see that you brought no counterarguments against HongQiGong's argument that the excerpt on genealogical entries is inapplicable. And also, there are no separate dictionaries for definitions, pronunciation, and grammar--all of these things are included in a dictionary. "Dictionaries" for frequency of use and other information have a more appropriate name--encyclopedias. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:18, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It does, however, seem that I am not alone and I will leave it to other editors to weigh in on the matter.

I fail to see why ranking them makes it encyclopedic, and it is ranked just as well at Wiktionary.

The rule of thumb is that if an article is about the word or words themselves (etymology, meaning, pronunciation, etc.) rather than the concept the word refers to (its history, influence, context, etc.) than it is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 03:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

Also the objection about the lack of sources for pronunciation information for Korean, Cantonese, Mandarin, etc. is rather amusing given that these readings are common knowledge to tens or hundreds of millions of people and are listed in virtually any dictionary you can find, but I put in cites to a web-accessible source for the Korean pronunciation for the top 25, for example. Finally I fail to see how it is unencyclopedic to put the Vietnamese and Korean pronunciations in the table, given that it is nowhere stated that people with that surname are related (you don't see a disclaimer on every article about someone named Smith that they're unrelated to all the other Smiths), and further there are significant populations of both groups living in the PRC as well as populations of Chinese living in said countries who actually use those pronunciations either in everyday life or as their legal name. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 06:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The argument that the article should be kept "as per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>" is assuming what it should prove, i.e. the utility of an article on every single Chinese surname. I read <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> and it is clearly designed to help people create lists of biographies, countries, species and the like. I just had a look at a couple of the articles on Chinese surnames and all they do is to list the pronunciation and the list number of people called <a href="../../../x/u/_/Xu.html" title="Xu">Xu</a>, for instance. They almost looks like disambiguation pages and some of the pages actually are disambiguation pages, like <a href="../../../w/e/i/Wei.html" title="Wei">Wei</a>. If this discussion leads to the deletion of a couple of empty article on surnames, all the better.</dd>

<dd>None of them really address the fact that this list has comparative commonality rankings from both 2006 and 1990. What I mean is, a reader can look at the list and see, for example, that X is ranked 10th, as compared to Y, which is 11th, and a reader can look at the list and see, also, that X is ranked 10th in 2006, but was ranked 15th in 1990, whereas Y was ranked 14th in 1990.

<dd>Summarizing the delete votes up to this point (above): Nominator's "not a genealogical database"; <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>; "per above"; an opinion on the encylcopedic nature of the ranked list; and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> again. The <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> argument is becoming overused in AFD discussions for any list, without understanding the principle behind the rule, and I decided to call out anyone who wants to claim <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> to back it up. This is not genealogical (as the nominator proposed) as no biographic info is on this page. It is not a directory of businesses (obviously). That leaves us with "loosely associated topics", which is in WINAD as a deterrent to the "me too" lists of every time that a left-handed actor sneezed in a film. A researched list of surnames from a country's census or what not is not loosely associated information. So far, the only reasonable argument for deletion is Dmcdevit's "unencyclopedic". To argue whether it is encylcopedic or not is valid; to try to fit this square peg article into the round <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> hole is not. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:11, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Heck, if someone in real life researched and published a book on the most common English surnames with their ranking of commonality, and an editor wrote an article based on that, I would think the same, that such an article deserves to exist in WP.

<li>No one has said that this article consists of "loosely associated topics", neither is anyone denying that it is based on a credible source. But that does not make this article encyclopedic; the fact that it is <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">useful</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/t/WP%7EINTERESTING_6e23.html" title="WP:INTERESTING">interesting</a> does not make it encyclopedic. A telephone directory is sourced, contains interesting data on the frequency of surnames and is very useful. But it is not encyclopedic. A dictionary can list the pronunciation of several Chinese characters, but that does not make it into an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>As to whether Chinese surnames are more important than "Western surnames" (whatever that is) has no bearing whatsoever on the question whether there should be a separate article listing the hundred most common surnames by frequency. This is a policy question and not a question of different cultures. I'm looking at you, HongQiGong.</li>

Neither has anyone denied that certain Chinese surnames may be the topic of separate articles. But no one has so far put forward any convincing argument why we should have a special list with Chinese surnames, many of the articles that the present page link to are not even articles. Many of them look more like disambiguation pages, and some of them actually <i>are</i> disambiguation pages: <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mai.html" title="Mai">Mai</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/i/Wei.html" title="Wei">Wei</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi.html" title="Shi">Shi</a>. There is even a special project devoted to the creation <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Chinese_surnames_9af2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Chinese surnames">Wikipedia:WikiProject Chinese surnames</a>, where the to-do-list runs as follows: "1. It must be an interwiki link to an article which satisfies WP:NOT. No redlinks. 2. Individual must have that surname. (Not as a given name.) 3. The individual's article must show the full Chinese name to support inclusion in the list." Can anyone tell me what is going on here? A Wikiproject for the creation of dictionary entries and disambiguation pages? I'm not saying that their work is worthless, but it is misplaced. We have Wiktionary and that's where their work belongs. There is an excellent summary of the differences between Wiktionary and Wikipedia articles <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html#The_differences_between_encyclopaedia_and_dictionary_articles" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">here</a> and how that applies to articles on family names.</li>
<li>Some of you have asked why some of the oppose votes only quote the <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> without further comment. My explanation is that the reason for deletion is obvious, and that most people who are in favor in keeping this article either do not understand Wikipedia policy or the difference between Wikipedia and Wiktionary.

<dd>You said above that we stand "far apart in our interpretations" of the two policies, but whereas I have suggested my reasoning behind my interpretation, you have only noted the policy (your comment to HongQiGong on this matter was "you are also misreading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, which covers a much wider range of articles that should not be in Wikipedia" and nothing else). Whether this article is kept or deleted is a matter of consensus. You may take it to DRV (although you wrote arbitration, I assume that's what you meant), but the <i>only</i> purpose of DRV is to determine whether an AfD discussion was appropriately closed. For the most part, it should not include arguments about the merits and/or failures of an article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:57, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You're "looking at me"? LOL. I'm only responding to your thinking that some special exception or rule is made for the Chinese, and that's why this article exists or that people are voting to keep this article. If that is really your motivation for nominating this article in the first place, it smacks of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>.

<li>Nope. I'm referring to when you said, "We do not create separate policies for matters Chinese or questions pertaining to other cultures".

<li>Actually I'm not talking about you specifically. I can tell from your contrib history that you have a working understanding of Chinese culture.

I agree that it's irrelevant to the deletion itself, and at the same time I don't think this article ought to have been nominated because an editor feels that it was created out of some "seperate" rule for something that is Chinese. Like I said, if a similar list is researched and published in real life for English surnames, and there was an article about it, I would support keeping such an article, too. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 04:11, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>To HongQiGong and Black Falcon: I appreciate your clarifying remarks and I'm happy to learn that I have a working knowledge of Chinese culture. I would oppose a page on English surnames if it looked that this page does now, especially if it claimed to rank English surnames overall based on the frequency in the US.

<li><a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a>. No, it's not about you. It's not about any of us. But stating that you will take this to DRV or arbitration if the consensus is not in your favor does seem like a form of "disruption". Wikipedia operates based on consensus. Sometimes it's on our side, other times it's not. I realize that this article is in many respects similar to what might be found in a dictionary (Wiktionary). However, let's also please realize that this article also contains addiitonal information that would not be found in most dictionaries. Yes, Wikipedia is not the white pages. Nor is this! This is not a list of individuals--which is what the white pages is. Finally, I have no idea what reading "like a list of disambiguation pages" has <i>anything</i> to do with genealogical or phonebook entries. To sum up, I hope you do not take my (or others') comments personally. They are not directed against you. They are directed against the arguments and the statements you have written.

<li>This is kind of interesting, if no consensus emerges, then the result is "keep", I gather. So policies do not really matter after all. After an article has been created, no matter how unencyclopedic, the burden of proof is on those who want it to be deleted.

<li>I am a tad puzzled by the above comment, for my interpretation of the same policy has been that the burden of evidence will always stay with the contributor, and should any material be up for deletion, it is the contributor who has to show proof.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Dmcdevit and some other points I want to raise. First, this is a list of names. Therefore, per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> (an official policy) it's dictionary material. The 1990 rankings and the 2006 rankings and the translations into other languages are all great stuff which make this a comprehensive <i>dictionary</i> article, not an encyclopedia article. Second, as has been noted, the cultural significance of Chinese surnames can be covered in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_surnames.html" title="Chinese surnames">Chinese surnames</a>; there is no potential for it to be covered in a <i>list</i> of names. Third, <s>some of the arguments to keep are a tad overwrought, given</s> note that this has already been transwikied to Wiktionary and no material is being lost. Finally, to address the argument that this list is useful for navigational purposes: Let's see. When I look at the first few linked articles, I see two types of content: (1) dictionary material, e.g. in <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_%28%E6%9D%8E%29.html" title="Li (李)">Li (李)</a>: "Lǐ (Chinese: 李; pinyin: Lǐ) is a surname of Chinese origin. It is the most widespread surname in China..." or (2) disambiguation, e.g. lists of people named Lǐ. The #1-type material should be tranwikied to Wiktionary and deleted from Wikipedia, like this list. The #2 type material should stay on Wikipedia and pages like <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_%28%E6%9D%8E%29.html" title="Li (李)">Li (李)</a> should be converted into pure disambiguation pages with links to the corresponding Wiktionary articles (using {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiktionarypar_6f6e.html" title="Template:Wiktionarypar">Wiktionarypar</a>}}; see e.g. what was done <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry&amp;diff=107970116&amp;oldid=107970007" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry&amp;diff=107970116&amp;oldid=107970007" rel="nofollow">here</a> with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry.html" title="Harry">Harry</a>). Once this is done, this list would be a list of links to disambiguation pages.

<li>Individual Chinese surnames have its individual extensive origins, and there is no way that it can all be covered in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_surnames.html" title="Chinese surnames">one article</a> alone. See an expanded Chinese surname article example here: <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a>. Now, if this Chinese surname list is properly expanded, it would include the outline of the history origin of each listed surname, and links to its expanded article entry. Anyways, just look at the article <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a>, and think about it again. <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;">AQu01rius</font> <small>(<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAQu01rius_9358.html" title="User:AQu01rius">User</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../a/q/u/User_talk%7EAQu01rius_1acc.html" title="User talk:AQu01rius">Talk</a>)</small> 18:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I am not confusing articles with subjects; the onus of expanding a lousy article lies on the person who created it or wants to keep it. What gets my goat about this whole <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Chinese_surnames_9af2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Chinese surnames">surname project</a> is that it is (1) entirely focused on increasing the quantity of surname related articles and (2) based on a number of questionable assumptions about Chinese history.</dd>

<dd>First, if the proponents of these articles focused on creating a small number of solid articles on a selected group of Chinese surnames, it would be easier to argue for an expansion of the project. I started to notice this when a number of biographies on I created got tagged with stuff like "This article is about person with the Chinese surname Chen." At first, I thought this was part of a project that was designed to improve Chinese biographies, but after a while I noticed that all the surname project managed to do was to create empty articles and lists, with no encyclopedic value whatsoever. This was several months ago, and I think it is time to ask where this project is taking Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Second, many of these articles confuse myths with history. I perfectly aware of the fact many people in China place great importance on surnames and that certain surnames carry special meaning for people. But the fact that a certain name can be traced back two or three thousand years back in history does not necessarily mean that all people bearing this same surname today have anything more in common than their surname. Anyone who is familiar with Chinese history or anthropology knows that claims of common ancestry should be taken with great deal of caution.</dd>

<li>(reply to AQu01rius's first reply to me) I looked at <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a>.

The rest of <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a> is about notable Yuan <i>clans</i> and should stay on Wikipedia. Now, if the article under consideration at this AfD were a list of notable Chinese clans, then I suppose I could accept the argument that the list is useful for navigational purposes. But this is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames_de0f.html" title="List of common Chinese surnames">List of common Chinese surnames</a> which presents information about names, not clans, and all of the ~10 bluelinks I checked at random are not links to articles about clans, they're disambig pages or articles about names that should be transwikied and converted into disambig pages like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry.html" title="Harry">Harry</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> The previous two writers raise valid points, which will probably win the discussion, but I'll speak for the opposing side. I was a child once, and I <i>know</i> that some of these songs, most especially <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Song_That_Never_Ends_8aaa.html" title="The Song That Never Ends">The Song That Never Ends</a>, are infinite loops or unbounded. The fact that there are many of these shows it's a common cultural trend, so a list (or category?) may be appropriate. I'm not sure how to counter the OR problem: how do I find a source for the fact that I used to sing those songs in fourth grade riding with my friends on the bus? <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 01:51, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Published books of children's songs would probably be a good place to start. You need some way to verify notability, however, I'd argue that the same song appearing in several (5+?) books by different authors and publishers would probably be a fair indicator of notability. Nonetheless, such research should be added to the main articles themselves: if the underlying concept of a list is not notable, the list should not be kept. (In other words, "List of cities with green fire hydrants" is not notable if green fire hydrants are not themselves notable.) - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 02:01, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If kept, the article would benefit from a tighter definition of "unboundedly long." There is a definite difference between neverending songs like...well, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Song_That_Never_Ends_8aaa.html" title="The Song That Never Ends">The Song That Never Ends</a> which really doesn't end, and a rock song with an improvised jam at the end that fades away into silence. Including the second group invites abuse. I'm also thinking there might be a less awkward title. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyous%21_8a6f.html" title="User:Joyous!">Joyous!</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoyous%21_ed0e.html" title="User talk:Joyous!">Talk</a> 03:00, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This list lumps a bunch of different concepts under the "unbounded" label: songs like "The Song That Never Ends" that "never end" until the singers get bored; songs like "Row Row Row Your Boat" which are just really short and are usually repeated over and over when sung; songs like "Down By The Bay" which usually go on for a while with different ad hoc variations for each verse; and songs like "BINGO" which <i>do</i> have a definite end but are just repetitive childrens songs. It doesn't form a coherent concept at all. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 03:24, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this seems like a perfectly valid list. However, "unboundedly long" should be defined such that it doesn't include songs which are sung repeatedly in succession and songs which are just long, but still having a bound.

<li><b>Delete</b> How is this significant? I disagree that not having a discernable end somehow makes this an exceptional length. I think you'd all find that there are very few songs with track times of 10:24. Shall I start that list? And could not any song conceivably go on this list? For example: "Row Row Row Your Boat" is actually a very short song. It is sometimes arranged as a round or a medley and could conceivably be arranged to go on infinitely, but, so could <i>any</i> song if you actually wanted it to do so. For a random example: "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_Ready_to_Make_Nice_dafa.html" title="Not Ready to Make Nice">Not Ready to Make Nice</a>" begins and ends with the same lines. One could easily make the end the beginning and sing the song on loop. Would such a mix merit inclusion on this list? GassyGuy 04:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Update</b>. I've read the discussion, and I've decided to do the following.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I will move the article (pending admin approval) to "List of repetitive songs". People <i>do</i> use "repetitive songs" (I can cite references on that), so it solves the problem with the title.</li>
<li>I will rewrite the introduction, again from references, as best I can.</li>
<li>I will delete items on the list that are not blue-linked to relevant articles. What does that accomplish? Very simple. It defers the problem of original research from the list article to the linked article. If you don't believe that "the song that never ends" is repetitive, go check its article.

<p>I don't see any purpose to this article. The concept of templating is not unique to blogs. This doesn't seem to be about anything in particular.

<p>I was searching on Wiki about blog templates and could not find any information about them, so i decided to add some info. I should have added references which i have done now. If you still feel this article is not so important you can delete it.--Inhook 02:30, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Topic is notable. Just about everyone has seen parts of the magic bullet infomercial.

<li>Update: Still Keep. I've cleaned it up and included more references. It's a notable topic, no point in deleting it when it's only going to reappear in an even more primitive form.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and lordy, someone take some time to clean this thing up - it really doesn't need a full description of the infomercial, complete with cast of characters and trivia (!). Weak because of the sources hateless provided above, I'm only comfortable with one - the Stuff magazine review. The others read like promo pieces. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 20:45, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> (by nom) C'mon, <u>are you guys kidding me???</u> The Stuff source??? See that <u>|--BUY IT--|</u> button under the picture? It is an advertisement. Catalog descriptions and statements by companies trying the sell the thing do not count as sources, guys! Otherwise we would be reproducing every catalog out there. PUH-LEEEZE! <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 23:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Stuff magazine isn't a catalog. It's an independent source. Just because they have a "buy it" button doesn't make it any less of one, it just means they have a cross-marketing deal with Amazon (and the button doesn't even work). I've give you the other two sources as not RS, the second one isn't written by anyone reputable, and the third is just...blugh. There's more sources out there, though, for one thing, I saw a write-up of this product in <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reader%27s_Digest_8956.html" title="Reader's Digest">Reader's Digest</a>. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 02:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>as for the second <i>source</i>, it's self-description is "Associated Content, an online community of highly-engaged, quality content producers, provides an ideal environment for advertisers who are ready to tap into the benefits user-generated content advertising." This is not a reliable source, either. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 00:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>and the third one, LASplash, is a e-zine that only has reviews of new products. All reviews read like copies of the product website for the manufacturer. Unlike consumer reports, none of the product reviews do critical comparisons, and none appear to be NPOV. The site does not have any statement of objectivity or any claim that their content is not influenced by paid advertising. I do not regard this as a reliable source. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 00:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you still want more sources, then here you go, including some news articles that are clearly not advertising: <a href="http://www.dmnews.com/cms/dm-news/direct-response-tv/38105.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dmnews.com/cms/dm-news/direct-response-tv/38105.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bogus+blenders:+direct+marketer+spends+$2+million+to+rein+in...-a0150091011" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bogus+blenders:+direct+marketer+spends+$2+million+to+rein+in...-a0150091011" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://www.ivillage.com/pbp/0,,b10zng1h,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ivillage.com/pbp/0,,b10zng1h,00.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Also, I want to note that just because there's a Buy Now link at the bottom of a review it doesn't mean it's not an independent review--a separation between advertising and editorial is the typical norm within publications and both have jurisdiction over the same page. Look up your typical negative review on <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Sennheiser_OMX_52_Street/4505-6468_7-31945182.html?tag=pdtl-list" class="external text" title="http://reviews.cnet.com/Sennheiser_OMX_52_Street/4505-6468_7-31945182.html?tag=pdtl-list" rel="nofollow">CNET</a> and see if you can find shills on the page. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 06:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let us not confuse being mentioned in an article with being the subject of the article. There is a big difference. In the first of 3 new sourced you provide, DMNEWS, the article is about Unfair Trade Practices. The person interviewed happens to be the maker of the product, and it is mentioned. This is a TRIVIAL reference. It does not provide encyclopedic content that can be added to an article about the product. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 04:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is about cheap knockoffs as directly related to the appliance. It is thus non-trivial. Is an article about Tony Blair's role in the Iraq War a trivial reference to Tony Blair? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second article source you provided above is seemingly a reprint of the first. The article provided content that could very easily and appropriately be used in an article about unfair trade parctices and product counterfeiting. It does not provide a source of notability for this particular product. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 04:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is about cheap knockoffs as directly related to the appliance. Also, it is not a reprint of the first. The subject is the same, but the content and text are different. It is thus non-trivial. There are many articles about the 2008 US presidential election and many include much of the same information--this does not mean they're reprints to be discarded. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The first article plainly states, <i>in the first paragraph</i>, that the product sold (1) 7 million units (in 3 years), (2) generated $300 million in sales (in three years), (3) was entirely marketed via infomercial marketing, and (4) stated who the marketers were. That is not trivial information, this is essential information. Your standards are quite impossible if this constitutes trivia. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 18:18, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When I see a magazine review (or "rave" as your third source above calls it) that appears to use the same language as company-produced advertising, then what I look for to determine if they are a valid source is a statement on the website about neutrality or responsibility for content. If the company states that they are not responsible for the content of the reviews as the content is provided by paying contributors, then it is clearly POV. In the case of the third source above, these areas of the website seem to require a subscription. I can not access any of the website pages which have "premium" in the first part of the URL. My guess, based on the tone of the ad-like "rave", is that it is a paid product placement, and so I would not consider ti a valid source. So we are still at NO SOURCES status for this article, as far as I can tell. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 04:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>FTD meets both criteria. Notible in the sence that the band is well known by a large number of people and those people wish to find out more about the band. And Verifiable becuase when I've had some sleep i'll state sorces, reasons, examples etc etc tommorow. I'm not sure anybody but the people of my town or county assosiated have the right to destroy knowledge of the band. may I suggest the persuit of a girlfriend is a far more admerable persuit than systematic search and destroy efforts of the wikiempire. Furthur more I doubt many peoeple would consider you <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, that wasnt a cheap dig or pathetic attempt at an internet insult just a fact, in a world of opinions no-one can truly say they are right.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Benmilnes (<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenmilnes_f803.html" title="User talk:Benmilnes">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Benmilnes_b451.html" title="Special:Contributions/Benmilnes">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> There are very few Wikipedia editors who would assert their own notability. You are right that I am not notable or verifiable, and this is why I have no Wikipedia article devoted to me. As for "destroying knowledge," no one is destroying any knowledge. You wrote the article, and the knowledge in it came from you. You still have it. No one is going to take it away from you. You are free to make the babbling gossip of the air cry out "Fast Track Down!" if you want; you are free to license the text of the article under the GFDL if you want; you are free to create a website entirely devoted to promoting this band if you want. Wikipedia, however, has no obligation to host these efforts. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 04:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep Open</b> I think the page should remain open because many other X Factor contenders have their own pages people who also have little fame after X Factor and they include Maria Lawson, Brenda Edwards and Chico Slimani. The article also goes into much more detail than the original page does and provides people who are interested with what she is doing after X Factor, her time on X Factor and has many outside wiki features as well for Dionne fans to access. By FEEFOO (I apologise- I don't know how to attach a hyperlink to my username.)</li>

<li>Maria Lawson released an album and has had a UK top 20 single, Brenda Edwards has been starring in the West End version of Chicago for some time, and Chico has had a UK #1 single and is nationally famous, so they've all enjoyed considerable success. According to this article the only thing Dionne Mitchell has done since appearing on X Factor is "talking with a management company about future projects", which isn't enough to warrant a seperate article.

<dd>Wikramadithya, please understand I have nothing against you personally. My problem with this article, and, to be honest with you're edits as a whole, is that they appear to be you personal opinion and not the general consensus. Considering that you fail to provide any sources for what you have written here, and for things like you're blatant attacks / defamation against D.S. Senanayake, and the fact that no one else seems to agree with what you're writing, I'm pretty sure they are all you're personal opinions.</dd>
<dd>Please understand that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a place to publish you're personal opinions. Everything we write here has to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and accurate, so I don't think this article should remain on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Also, if you suspect sock puppetry, please feel free to report me (or anyone else for that matter) at <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> or <a href="../../../r/c/u/WP%7ERCU_f1af.html" title="WP:RCU">WP:RCU</a> to confirm it.</dd>

<dd>The page under discussion is <b>not ‘original research’</b>. The page is based primarily on the submissions to the Supreme Court and the Human Rights Commission respectively in the case and application cited on the page.

One of them is even voting for the deletion of the page based not on what the page says but on what I have said here! However, although this is a Sri Lankan topic, it is not another numbers game where a majority can bulldoze minorities. Therefore diplomatic protocol aside, it would be public money well spent if this interest group could clearly note their contrary viewpoints on the page rather than coming down with a barrage of attacks on the Editor.</dd>

<p>DISCUSSION: FROM ROADKILLHEADS.</p>
<p>The above user "Rklawton; Rklawton" who complains about our article seems to be completely oblivious to American "underground" music and writing, followers of whom are well aware of who Roadkill Bill Jabanoski is. WE, a group of fans, not the artist himself, posted this article in an attempt to add an entry into Wikipedia about an artist who has had a major influence on hundreds of thousands of people and to provide helpful links and information about him. As we work and do not have 24/7 to spend in front of our computers, as evidently "Rklawton" does, this article is still a work in progress, more details of which will be added as we are able to find the time. If Wikipedia requires that we document every sentence, provide more independent reviews, etc., we will do so as we proceed. If, however, Wikipedia only chooses to post articles on Britney Spears and the like, your "Encyclopedia" is going to become nothing more than a week's worth of "Access Hollywood" shows. However, if you wish to include reliable information about artists that, while not mainstream, have huge cult followings, then you will keep the article, allow us to complete it, and not threaten to erase it every time someone who happens not to have heard of the subject of the article decides to tell you to delete it, then you will be a real, "complete" encyclopedia. If you don't choose to be this, then stop advertising yourself as such all over the internet.</p>
<p><b>BAIT AND SWITCH</b></p>
<p><b>WIKIPEDIA IS A CON ARTIST WEBSITE</b></p>
<p>NEW ENTRY FROM JAMES L. GORDON</p>
<p>BAIT AND SWITCH! My name is James L. Gordon. I signed up for an account on Wikipedia, copied down my password, and answered your "check E-mail address" E-mail. I also sent you a $50 donation in the mail because I loved the fact that you had articles on my favorite artists like Chuck E. Weiss and even more so, Roadkill Bill Jabanoski. Now I return to the page for Roadkill Bill (<a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a>: 28 g-hits) and find that you've destroyed the artwork (there was a really great concert poster heading the article beforehand) and are happily in the process of deleting the whole article. I suppose the Chuck E. Weiss (<a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a>: 46,000 g-hits&lt;) and Paul Westerberg (<a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a>: 500,000+ g-hits) ones will be next. What's more, when I tried to "Log On" to your website, double checking my password numerous times, I find that I no longer seem to even have an account with you! As a lawyer by trade, I know that this is what con artists call the "Bait and Switch." You solicit contributions by temporarily posting articles, then remove them, and then don't even claim that your contributors have an account. "There's a sucker born every minute," so the quotation goes, and I certainly was one. I would stop payment on my check, but I like to think of myself as more honorable certainly than your firm. I will NEVER use Wikipedia again, I will tell my employees, business associates, and friends not to do so either. Playing con games with people is both dispicable and just plain wrong. --<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User%7E75.74.180.49.html" title="User:75.74.180.49">75.74.180.49</a> 06:38, 19 February 2007 (UTC)James L.

If Bill Jabanoski is really tring to get himself into the music biz, I can't imagine why he'd want his name attached to this pathetic attempt to squeeze $50 out of a registered charity organisation, and I can only guess what music execs, producers, and potential CD buyers will think of it when they come a-Googlin'... oh well... <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>KEEP</b></p>
<p>IN RESPONSE TO PREVIOUS POST BY STARBLIND, Andrew Lenahan</p>
<p>The entry from "ROADKILLHEADS" above makes it clear that they, a group of fans, posted this article thinking they were providing what they believed to be useful information about a somewhat well-known underground artist and that this article was a work in progress. So it is you, Starblind, who are making false accusations when you state that:</p>
<p>1. The artist himself had anything to do with submitting this article.</p>
<p>2. The "ROADKILLHEADS" ever suggested that they paid any contribution to Wikipedia to publish this article. Rather, it was another writer on this discussion page, signing himself James L. Gordon who, I agree very hot-headedly and wrongly, suggested that he had been cheated out of his donation because he assumed Wikipedia was providing information on his favorite artists.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should take some time to actually read the previous posts rather than only skimming them before also making wrong allegations, Mr. Lenahan (Starblind).</p>
<p>3, As for Mr. Jabanoski trying to use this article to "break into the music business," I highly doubt that the artist even knows that this article exists. You are also almost thirty years too late in your advice to Mr. Jabanoski. His first record was released in 1979, and he has developed a substantial following both as a musician and a writer, particularly over the past two decades.</p>
<p>I personally find what there is of the article to be informative and to provide good links, and I believe it should be retained and that Wikipedia should allow "ROADKILLHEADS" to complete it as they requested in their post. If there are documentation problems (which I really don't see. Most of the article provides simply common knowledge information to anyone who has researched the artist, and it does not quote without documentation), then I believe that Wikipedia should work with "ROADKILLHEADS" in solving these. This is just my opinion as a frequent user of Wikipedia and someone who enjoys Jabanoski's work. --<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User%7E75.74.180.49.html" title="User:75.74.180.49">75.74.180.49</a> 20:45, 19 February 2007 (UTC)Tom Carter.

<p>A case has not been made for deletion. User 'YechieMan' makes no specific assertions or claims, so ther is no fact or matter at issue to which anyone can reply.</p>
<p>The assertions made above by user 'WeniWidiWiki' fail on several points of fact:</p>
<p>1) The entry was not penned by me (though I did supply a photo) 2) "inundated with vanity links". Not so. There were 2 Myspace links, 1 remains for reasons outlined below. If 1 link is "inundation", then most Wikipedia articles are similarly inundated.</p>
<p>The 2 users cited above may be familiar with SPACE SHOTS, and possibly FRONTIERS, but I don't know. If so, thanks for watching -- glad to count you among the audience -- sorry if you didn't like what you saw, but that should not be grounds for removal. If they have not ever seen SPACE SHOTS, and have not been to Austin, TX, then the assertions are rooted in complete ignorance, lack of knowledge, and that explains the lack of facts in their claims(either directly known or for which they can provide evidence).</p>
<p>RE: "... Does not seem to meet notability criteria ..." SPACE SHOTS has been influential and the methods used to procduce it have reduced TV/video production costs significantly. The video shoot, edit, and post-production tactics &amp; strategies have altered the character, content, look, and feel of nearly everything coming out of Austin, TX. The reduced cost and production-cycle times in the SPAXE SHOTS business models are part of what is making Austin, TX a growing center for music (and other) video production, despite its location and other srategic business drawbacks.</p>
<p>I think that the preponderance of evidence would establish that SPACE SHOTS does meet the notability criteria.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how many hits this entry receives, but "Space Shots" (the TV show) is the #7 yahoo.com search entry, and the #11 Google.com search entry, for the term "Space Shots". "Space Shots TV" is atthe top of both company's search-results. Ask Google and Yahoo for details on how their search algorithms work.</p>

<p>The timing and other facts about this particular delete-request are intersting, and raise questions about conflicts of interest by the delete-requestors.</p>
<p>1) There are more people and there is more commentary pertaining to this delete request than to any (maybe all) other current, pending delete-requests. Despite the claim that SPACE SHOTS lacks sufficient notability, the attention here and now strongly indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>2) For about 2 years, I have been asking the <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/divisions/music/directory/igtm/igtm_s2.htm|Texas" class="external text" title="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/divisions/music/directory/igtm/igtm_s2.htm|Texas" rel="nofollow">Governor's Music Office</a> to update the obsolete web address for Space Shots. In early February, I went public and noted the "sloppiness and apparent staff intattention" in this matter, and stated that "it begs the question: ...what other information issued by the Texas Governor's Office is wrong, obsolete or inaccurate?"</p>
<p>Question: Are any of those requesting a deletion affiliated or connected, either personally, professionally, or otherwise, with thee Texas Governor's Office or the Texas Governor's Music Office?</p>
<p>3) Time Warner Cable has a TV station called M-E TV which they operate as a music channel in Austin, Texas. For over two years, they have been unable to get "good", "exciting", or "cool" bands to appear on their live music forums, because they are considered "dorky", "gay", "dull", etc. by music fans and bands. A few bands that received a lot of promotion on M-E TV and Time Warner's news affiliate "News-8 Austin" bombed completely at local clubs (no one went to the shows except station staff, who were given free tickets).</p>
<p>SPACE SHOTS is a non-commercial project, and licensing agreements for use of live performance videos of major rock bands (e.g. Black Sabbath, Guns 'N Roses, Motley Crue) have not been licensed to Time Warner for commercial Cable TV use. In a recent solicitation (local posters and several myspace posts -- <a href="http://forum.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=messageboard.viewThread&amp;entryID=31034135&amp;categoryID=0&amp;IsSticky=0&amp;groupID=100012772&amp;Mytoken=D7E8AE53-4CB6-446B-B6824BA1EFA60DE870153318|here'a" class="external text" title="http://forum.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=messageboard.viewThread&amp;entryID=31034135&amp;categoryID=0&amp;IsSticky=0&amp;groupID=100012772&amp;Mytoken=D7E8AE53-4CB6-446B-B6824BA1EFA60DE870153318|here'a" rel="nofollow">a link to one such post</a> -- in early February generated <i>over 40 band applications</i> for a video taping event during SXSW 2007. These will use the Austin Public Access TV facilities (under an agreement similar to those recently concluded for the TX State Lottery Commisison, and Friday Night Lights).</p>
<p>Time Warner attempted a similar campaign for M-E TV, but received no takers. They will do something else during SXSW 2007.</p>
<p>So, are any of the delete-requestors here professionally or otherwise affiliated with Time Warner, Warner Music Group, or affiliate labels that have a material interest in commercial ventures during SXSW 2007? -BL The Eagle 14:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the request for deletion here probably has nothing to do with SPACE SHOTS at all. 1) the delete requestor does not seem to have ever watched the show; 2) the requestor seems to be making his request for non-content related reasons; 3) There is no specific fact asserted about SPACE SHOTS cited by the delete requestor that indicates a violation of Wikipedia policies.</p>
<p>This article was not penned by the program's producer.</p>
<p>Just a guess here: This request may have been made as some retailiation for controversial analyses and news reported on FRONTIERS, concerning the Iraq war, U.S. relations with Israel, and a long-running thread that suports the war as an economic venture, but is heavily critical of the U.S. military strategy (or more specifically, the lack of a coherent military strategy) to date.</p>
<p>Recent commentary has drawn a criticism and opposition from both Zionist and anti-Zionist groups. Since the FRONTIERS information is from trusted and verifiable sources, no retractions or apologies have been made.</p>
<p>FRONTIERS has been a controversial TV program series since its inception in March, 1988. But has been retained and built itself an audience.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've honestly never heard of the "FRONTIERS" thing. My only concern is with notability, as I stated above. I cited the guidelines with which I was concerned - if it can be demonstrated and sourced that Space Shots is notable per that criteria, I have no objection to keeping it. Otherwise, it should probably be deleted.

<p>The only assertion made by the delete-requestor here that seems to warrant a response (since it may be relevant to Wikipedia inclusion policies) is the link to a myspace.com page. This was done for a few reasons:</p>
<p>1) Myspace is a generally neutral forum; 2) Myspace is not a site which I have to maintain or on which I need to provide anti-hacker security; 3) Myspace seemed to fit more closely with the SPACE SHOTS theme so I recommended linking to it instead of other sites); 4)I never spend money on what is offered for free (a convenient web page in this case).</p>
<p>If a myspace link is problem, then go ahead and delete it. People who need to get in touch with me can do so via several other platforms &amp; channels. If you do that, then it seems reasonable to expect that all other links to a myspace.com page will also be deleted at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm not inclined to go through all of the wikipedia entries for various music, movie, television, and other entertainment entities, projects, or individuals. However, after a cursory read-through of those for some local (Austin, TX) talent, it's clear that most of it is essentially promotional and reads like something a publicist would write. Maybe most of it should be deleted ... though personally, I have no problem with any of it.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the entry that is not factual.Direct 'Black Eagle' to remove what you regard as too pomotional to meet Wikipedia guidelines.</p>
<p>Feel free to raise any additional matters of concern. At this time I can not determine that there are any good, valid reasons for deleting the SPACE SHOTS entry.</p>

<p>This article is basically a shorter, less precise and less informative version of the newer <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliptical_construction.html" title="Elliptical construction">Elliptical construction</a> article. Also, I believe the title of the article is misleading, since ellipsis as described in the article is not, to my understanding, a 'figure of speech', but a grammatical construction (hence the article <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliptical_construction.html" title="Elliptical construction">Elliptical construction</a> which treats it as such). In addition, the article is being transwikied to wiktionary as a dic-def. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorgo_c293.html" title="User:Torgo">Torgo</a> 07:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliptical_construction.html" title="Elliptical construction">elliptical construction</a> and redirect.

<li>It seems to me that the only thing in this article that is not in <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliptical_construction.html" title="Elliptical construction">Elliptical construction</a> (besides the examples, but the latter article has its own examples for the same things), is the mention of ellipsis in film. However, if anything, I think this short sentence should be added to the <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellipsis.html" title="Ellipsis">Ellipsis</a> article, just to mention it as a different use of the same word. Anyway, it certainly isn't a "figure of speech" (or a grammatical construction) when used in this sense. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorgo_c293.html" title="User:Torgo">Torgo</a> 21:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> TIME article says that "China UFO Research Center" broke up into "competing factions three years ago". It is not clear if the subject of article (Research Organization) is that described in TIME. I do not believe that any of the organizations are "run" by PRC government- tolerated perhaps and maybe including some former government officials/scientist in administrative roles. The yahoo email address and blank page for forum also makes me suspicious to the claims.

This discussion had grown quite substantially over the past few days (evidence suggests that this is thanks to Nima's actions, but I guess if the article'd be placed on some List of UFO-related deletions then the situation'd be similar), and maybe there is something to it. My suggestion is to keep the article for now, however on conditions that Nima provides sources, be they Chinese or English, and expands the article so that it is something more than just a list of names and links. Lists to prose. Let's wait it out, give it a few months, and watch. If the article does not grow, let's come back to it in a few months and discuss it again. --<a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOuro_8ad2.html" title="User:Ouro">Ouro</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/u/r/User_talk%7EOuro_6623.html" title="User talk:Ouro">blah blah</a>)</small> 08:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Im in the minority with that choice, but why cant this article just be expanded. If its that well known and documented whats stopping someone writing more info about it. I have to say in the way it stands, its just a list of various pieces of data, but if someone could put some more meat on the bones it could be a worthy article. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 13:10, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I made a snap decision and upon further review, I think it fails wikipedias notability guidelines. I looked at the sources in english and the references I found do not reinforce notability for me. <a href="http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0718/vo2-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0718/vo2-2.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> is about somebody who works there, but the article is not about the organization. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,488900,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,488900,00.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> is the same story, the article is not about the organization in reference. This leads me to believe that most of the articles are probably mostly related to the UFO Phenomenon with a brief mention of this organization. I dont think that this meets notability standars because it is not the subject of the third party trivial sources.<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 14:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Tough call here. This man has produced a forest of literature, but doesn't seem to have the peer recognition that is typical of notable figures. He has maybe 1000 ghits that actually refer to him.

<li><b>Keep</b> The inexperienced author of the article did not bring out the fact that in addition to having a chair named after him, he was visiting Professor at several universities, a member of the editorial board of at least one major journal, has published 147 articles in peer-reviewed journals, is on the editorial Board of <a href="../../../b/m/j/BMJ_b90d.html" title="BMJ">BMJ</a> and had a truly distinguished career in research administration. However, he never held a full professorship at a major university, which is what complicates the evaluation of his work, for we do not really have good standards for evaluating administrators.

<dd>As for the subject of the article before it got vandalized, Associate Professors are not always notable.

<dd>As Penik committed suicide in 1982, web sources are a bit thin on the information, mostly making a reference to the event. However, that his death still gets mentioned in recent articles (see the citation I gave of Oran article dated 2006) shows the notability. The article is a stub and will need to be fleshed out by using print sources. However, the question at hand is notability. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a> 12:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Turkish local media, meaning newspapers. Any google search will show you that. But seeing that there was a call for English citations, I took the trouble of doing a 3 minute web search and added 3 English citations. Since the event occurred in 1982, before the advent of the web, web references are a bit thin on information, mostly just making a reference to his suicide. This article needs to be fleshed out by using print sources. But there is no question in my mind that there is no "notability" issue. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a> 12:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took the above "lifted" comment at face value to be honest, I haven't looked through in detail, will do so now. (tempus fugit) &gt;&gt; doesn't seem to be an exact matchup, my apologies for not investigating before my earlier comment. Changed my opinion to a weak keep above, but the article needs work, most notably to assert notability. Editor below makes a specious argument regarding notability to those who wish to know more about the game world, which to me is only true if there were not several other websites that provide similar information. My Keep was based on notability of the subject matter as source material for numerous fictional offshoots, and would suggest the article be tightened up and better cited. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 23:23, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, while there are fan pages around, wikipedia should host information, since the information is consense of at least all those authors that added to the page. Disagreements are discussed on the discussion page. Fanpages often host wrong or non-objectiv information. As for lifted information: The tribes represent archtypes therefore all serious pages about the tribes will tell the same. But that's the same with articles about movies or TV shows, their information is also always found on other pages, too. As for notability, tribes are a huge aspect in the complex game world. To properly describe the game a desccription of the tribes is vital. Adding the info into the main article would decrease readability. That's why the article should be kept.<a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeinrich_k_a9bc.html" title="User:Heinrich k">Heinrich k</a> 20:21, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The World of Darkness RPG settings are reasonably notable on their own, describing the basics of what is a fairly major component in making a character of the RPG and a definitive factor in the world is highly reasonable. I'm not saying this article is well done, or that there isn't some better way to do it, but pending some good argument to merge, it's a keep. Individual articles on the tribes are another matter. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:38, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Do not delete</b> - The notablility of the article could be argued about, but there are different point of view to the topic. While the information in the article might not be of notable intrest to most humans on earth, there are individuals that are intrested in learning the basics about the game and they should be able to find reliable information at wikipedia. Just as there are articles about characters of TV series and movies and Star Trek technology or other fictional subjects. The article's information is vital for those who want to increase their understanding of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Werewolf%7E_The_Apocalypse_9557.html" title="Werewolf: The Apocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a> game. Sources (at least on inconclusive information) arn't currently added in the main article but can be found in the discussion page. In addition the information in the article is a combined from various out-of-print books, so the informations availability is limited, and therefore should be available in wikipedia. In addition the article's introduction and title clearly marks the article's information as part of a fictional game scenario, so there is no need to find fault with the article's tone. The arcticle is in fact a very neutral text about a fictional topic, marked as clearly fictional. If necessary source information will be added over time. While it might be right, that article is currently lacking of real world relations, the article is part the necessary information about the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Werewolf%7E_The_Apocalypse_9557.html" title="Werewolf: The Apocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a> game, and moving all information back into the main article would greatly disimprove readability. In addition all information was moved together into this article from seperate articles for better maintenance, so the article is vital target of many redirects. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeinrich_k_a9bc.html" title="User:Heinrich k">Heinrich k</a> 20:04, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> I reference my comment above as to why this article should remain since it is a product of the ijji gaming portal website. Additionally, the game has been out for several days now and, with the number of users fluctuating between 2500 and 3000, there has been ample opportunity to test the game out and render all crystal ball concerns obsolete. Furthermore, the fact that there have been no further recommendations for deletion since the release of the game should provide more evidence to keep this article. It is important to preserve the "history" of this game as it is occurring and fresh in its players' minds rather than trying to write about it after the fact. Finally, how someone can recommend the deletion of an article pertaining to a topic within 24 hours of its release is beyond me.--<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinoyGenius_7d46.html" title="User:PinoyGenius">PinoyGenius</a> 19:44, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Metacomment</b>: The game was apparently released (as open beta) after the nomination, so many of the "delete" comments saying "crystal ball" or "unreleased" seem to be outdated already.

<li><b>Delete</b> As I commented above. Hasn't established notability. It is common for fans, or those in favor of promoting a new product in beta, to insist that an article should stand without establishing notability, or providing independent third party references. You may like the game, but anyone can announce a beta test and get some folks to download something for free.

<li>Comparing Silberstein to Jim Morrison is silly and not really doing his case any good. (Was that even a serious comment?) I guess one could compare Jim Morrison to a cellist superstar like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacqueline_du_Pr%C3%A9_ff3e.html" title="Jacqueline du Pré">Jacqueline du Pré</a>. But there seems to be a point in Wikipedia having a bias for contemporary popular music (in the sense of pop, rock and related genres) as opposed to classical music. A more relevant comparison would perhaps be to the huge number of obscure groups or people included in categories like <i>Category:Black metal musical groups</i> or <i>Category:Heavy metal drummers</i>. Heavy metal is certainly significant as a genre, as are its superstars (its Morrisons or du Prés, if you will), like Metallica or Motorhead or the members of those groups, but with all the subgenres (black/death/thrash/doom etc. etc.) and all regionally popular groups, I wonder if most of the metal bands and musicians on Wikipedia really compare that favourably to a musician who has played first cello for three decades in the (presumably often recorded) orchestra of one of the most famous opera houses in the world. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 07:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> The article on the Opera, like that for most musical organizations, lists the conductors and some of the principal singers. We don't seem to have standards for orchestral musicians, but i think any of the regular members of any of the major professional orchestras is about comparable to a regular long term member of a professional football team. The leader of a section is the senior player of the group, and generally also a well known soloist on his instrument, as is Silberstein. The opera orchestra gives concerts of its own &amp; tours on its own account apart from the opera company. It's hard to give numbers, but I think it would be safe to say that the leader of a section in a major orchestra must be among the 20 best players of the instrument. Do the 20 best bass players in popular musics have articles? Sure they do. But not a single one is known to me, by name or by music. Notability in the field is notability, or else we will all be deleting each other's genres. Pharamond sees it right.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As another comparison, think of it as members of the section being like full professors, and the principals being chairmen. Orchestral musicians are appointed in similar ways, by judgement of their peers--in classical music, usually by the even more demanding judgment by blind audition. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to admit, I am a newbie with Wikipedia. I was going to move the page into the band format (when I figured out how to do that). In terms of Notability, Blonde Vinyl Records is considered by some to be a pre-cursor to the much more-successful Tooth And Nail Records because it released avant-garde CCM, which was quite unusual at the time, and pushed the envelope of what Christian Rock could be. Later, another Avant Garde label, Flying Tart, which also released a track from Sixpence None The Richer on a Christmas Compilation before they were a cross-over success, released records by the band Fluffy. Fluffy's records were released through national distriubtion channels (for the CCM market) and the recorded works span a period of six years. The source for a majority of the information on the article comes from CD's that I own, and I guess I just don't know how to source that. I exchanged two brief correspondances with Chris Colbert many years ago and that is my only affiliation with the band <a href="../../../o/c/t/User%7EOctillion_69e1.html" title="User:Octillion">Octillion</a> 03:35, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> lol I think this article should be given a chance. When I saw this up for AfD I had a feeling I knew what "Academy Scream" was referring to, sure enough it *is* referring to that soundbite&#160;:P. I would've added that the soundbite is also featured in every Nutri-Grain cereal ad featured here in Australia plus it's also featured in one of the Star Wars films - although some supporting evidence should be supplied to back up the claims I suppose. --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 06:23, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I mean, people looking for it on a few internet forums doesn't mean that the topic is notable. As <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> says, "The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works." So far, I do not see the kind of discussion in secondary sources necessary for the article to remain in WP. The <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_scream.html" title="Wilhelm scream">Wilhelm scream</a> is notable because it has been discussed in such sources. My concern is that this article is an attempt to draw attention to what the article's author considers an interesting topic, which is not the same as notability <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 17:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ryan Pequin here. I didn't create the original article about me but I thought I'd try to argue my case for just a second. First off, as opposed to the claim above, I was not only listed as a contributor for True Porn 2 but was reviewed, albeit briefly, for my piece here: <a href="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_12.29.05/theend/lovebites.php" class="external free" title="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_12.29.05/theend/lovebites.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_12.29.05/theend/lovebites.php</a></p>
<p>Additionally, I've just recently been nominated for a Shuster Award for Canadian Webcomics, which can be seen here: <a href="http://joeshusterawards.com/story.asp?storyID=78" class="external free" title="http://joeshusterawards.com/story.asp?storyID=78" rel="nofollow">http://joeshusterawards.com/story.asp?storyID=78</a></p>
<p>I also have done illustration work for Somethingawful.com as seen here: <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/electric-heart-true.php" class="external free" title="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/electric-heart-true.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/electric-heart-true.php</a></p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that the main reason I assume I was wiki'd in the first place was not for my short True Porn 2 piece but for my autobio comic at <a href="http://www.ryanpeq.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ryanpeq.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ryanpeq.com</a> which I've been updating for close to three years. Lastly, I do play an at least slightly significant role in the autobio webcomics community with my hosting of the Journal Comic Jam.</p>

<p>Appears to be a non-notable fencing organization. About 1000 ghits. Some bad signs: there are no significant incoming or outgoing links, and there's no interwiki with Espanol. If it's not deleted, consider moving to "Mexican Fencing Federation," the English name. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 17:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Creating outgoing links just requires a bit of formatting, sources would be nice but I think the subject is probably important enough for an article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, it merits an article as a national sports federation.

Lack of incoming links can be corrected by editing "Sports in Mexico" or <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fencing.html" title="Fencing">Fencing</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:54, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Mexican Fencing Federation" does not appear to be a common way to refer to this association. "Fencing in Mexico" would be a good idea if the rescoping can occur, but if the article remains about the association, this name appears to be the more common one.

<li>You are right (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22mexican+fencing+federation%22+-wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22mexican+fencing+federation%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>). However, "Mexican Fencing Federation" is just the direct translation of the organisation's name. "Fencing in Mexico" would be nice, but it would require refocusing, as you have noted. I think it might be alright to leave the page at this title, but the English translation should be noted in the article (I will add it momentarily). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but of the two "votes" since it was relisted I know that I at least am not a single purpose account (and have the 1000 entries in my edit history to demonstrate that). User:mm17nov@hotmail.com had already "voted" before the relisting and now again since, but not like s/he was hiding that fact. The other people who have commented (<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a>) all have long edit summaries.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Well, I did in fact fail to notice User:Fvarisco (apologies) but for the others, I should mention that IP addresses are <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">not Single Purpose Accounts</a>, only user accounts can be (by definition). Noting the date tags of the edits by those addresses, I notice they are not concurrent, so my best guess is an editor whose system pulls different addresses from a server (extremely common).

<li><b>Keep</b> This wrestler was part of the orginal ECW; which hardcore fans (no pun) remember and Vince McMahon makes a mockery of on Scifi. He's related to known guys that worked in the WWE. Plus, Kris Classic has a right to his own opinion, but this is not a poorly written article. It's a simple one, not overglorifying Brawler's career. It's paying respect to one part of the orginal ECW. Plus, wikipedia has articles on other indy wrestlers (like Vladimere Koloff), you can call NN too.User:Goofy14
<ul>
<li>No doubt this will be deleted, because wikipedia isn't a democracy. Other indie wrestlers you can call NN, because they didn't make a big name across the country. Still, these workers pay dues, but never get recognized. Jerry Lawler mentions this in his biography (p.244). It's just a shame some wikipedians have a pompus viewpoint, but that wikipedia's right to make that rule (no democracy). In the long-term, the more these viewpoints grow, the quicker wikipedia will implode. It happened in WCW and other businesses. If wikipedia bans me, I don't care. The world and life goes on and wikipedia isn't the only website for looking and contributing information. To quote Steve Austin, "THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE!!!" If you don't like it, can lump it. Goofy14.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable. Being part of the original ECW doesn't matter (people employed by WWE don't automatically deserve articles either), and it's been established that just being related to someone notable doesn't make you notable. Also, WP has made it clear that "this article should exist because this other article does" isn't valid. <a href="../../../l/r/r/User%7ELrrr_IV_0800.html" title="User:Lrrr IV">Lrrr IV</a> 03:28, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Doesn't appear to be notable. It's not a matter of indie wrestlers "never getting recognised". Paying respect to ECW is not what Wikipedia is for. Being related to a WWE employee is not a good reason for existence. If the article was expanded hugely and referenced then my viewpoint might be swayed. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 12:15, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I would certainly be interested in an article regarding significant cable television serials in the past 30 years and how they may have influenced and affected the television industry. This is not that article. Actually this is not ANY article as is, and paradoxically the shows listed aren't even cable shows, they're network. Agree with nom on use of the phrase "strange and unnecessary article". -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:52, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Actually, to respond to the above, many of the shows listed would be considered "cable" shows in Canada, because up here cable TV includes the importing of the American commercial networks. However under that criteria this list could well include every American series broadcast. Way too broad and undefined. I could see a list of local cable access shows possibly being made (though there would be notability issues). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A brief look around the web indicates she is very well-known as a Tolkien artist. She apparently is also in rising demand as a concept artist/designer for movies. The claims cited from the home page can be verified. (Example:<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>). The page needs some attention from Wikipedians fluent in Polish, Russian and Italian. (I myself have only the most rudimentary understanding of Russian and can reasonably follow Italian, but am far from fluent.) However, simply because the sources are foreign language, does not mean she is not notable or that the article should be deleted. It just means the article needs some attention from those with the skills to verify the references. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 19:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am against of deletion. True, article was started by author himself, but that doesn't mean that the article should be deleted. I am keeping my eye on this article and have deleted some promotional stuff that was there. If you feel that article is still too self-promotional and non-encyclopediac - then, please, fix it. Or leave it for other people to fix. But the article won't be fixed if it will be deleted. And finally about non-noteability. Come on, guy has 9 (nine!) World Records! And it would be interesting to read how the guy decided to make all these records and how he trained. Look at the articles about other athletes - a lot of them have even less information than this article has! <a href="../../../m/i/x/User%7EMixer_b654.html" title="User:Mixer">mixer</a> 08:18, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>keep</b>. Note that the arguments to keep in this discussion, and the article itself, are distinctly different from an indiscriminate list of surnames. Therefore, this is not a valid precendent in the AfD for an article that is simply a list of names or surnames from some culture. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 02:31, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> I originally tagged the article for prod based on non-notability but that was contested with an attempt made to address the issue. I still think the group is non-notable with only a dozen local schools. Please see the articles talk page.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 07:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> 12 schools is not in the grand scheme of things a large number of locations. My argument, rather, and to be more clear, is that this school is notable based upon its stature as a large <i>Canadian</i> institution. Shugyo 09:05, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>clarification</b> Association de Karate Japonais du Quebec is in <i>Central</i> Canada and offers <i>Shotokan</i> karate. Shintokukai (Matsukaze-ryu) is in <i>Western</i> Canada and offers its own unique style. The geographic distances between these two schools relative to the size of Canada is vast (analogy: New York and Seattle). Shugyo 21:23, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Here are several changes I've made in the article:
<ul>
<li>Sixteen Candles was filmed there partly and I've added back that information.</li>
<li>For the fifth year in a row, the student newspaper, The North Star, won the "International First Place award from Quill and Scroll" (for the 2005-2006 school year).</li>
<li>The school chess club is ranked third in the state.</li>
<li>Niles North High School was named "National History Day Illinois School of the Year" at the annual Illinois History Expo held May 3, 2006, in Springfield.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you thought this high school was not notable before, there is no reason to think so now. The journalism award is particularly impressive. The Quill awards are THE most prestigious journalism awards for high school journalism. I have no idea why they won or what they've been doing to win (perhaps someone from the school can fill that in later, but only if there's an article to contribute to). It may have something to do with the fact that about 30 percent of the student body is "Asian or Pacific islander" but that's just speculation. I'd be in favor of keeping the school even if not notable by the standards of other groups. I think high schools are inherently notable because so much of a community's wealth, interest and hopes are invested in them. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. The only sourced statement which claims more than the terms existence is <i>"Originally, the term was used to describe the in influx of Irish, Jews and other ethnic groups once considered non-white in the United States"</i>. This is "sourced" in the loosest sense of the word to a racist text, specifically the sentence "whereas the dominating numbers of the cavaliers of our own South were able to escape the racial deluge of Negroes". If what isn't even pretending to be verified is removed, we have "racial deluge is two words that one or two racists have used in sequence". Nothing below demonstrates that any of this material would meet policy at this pagename or any other. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 03:03, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although the term is a "scare phrase", it is one that is in use, at least among white supremacists. The term is POV, but the article is not. Also, it is rather well-sourced (the last sentence on Hispanics should be deleted unless sourced). Oh, and from a historical perspective, a "massive wave of demographic change in a particular area over a short period of time" is what happened when the whites came to North America. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I can verify that all the information here is correct as the artist is my deceased father. Please be more specific as to why you believe this article "does not belong" (?) Thank you,<b>Imyra</b></p>

For example, <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Man_%28film%29_6149.html" title="Iron Man (film)">Iron Man (film)</a>, and the new <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%282007_film%29.html" title="Halloween (2007 film)">Halloween (2007 film)</a> film have their own MySpace page. For instances like this, I wouldn't simply dismiss MySpace as a reliable source, even though generally it is considered unreliable. Context needs to be addressed, and outside opinions need to be requested. BUT, in regards to what this page is, it seems to lack <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, doesn't conform to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. MySpace in this regard isn't about reliability, the fact that they exist is irrelevant, but having a MySpace page does not make them notable. I have a MySpace page and that doesn't mean I'm going to get my own Wiki article. The page seems like it's about advertising, which is not what Wiki is for. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 19:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. The article clearly admits production being at a standstill, and there is no guarantee that this film would ever be made. Mention of Smith's involvement is already included on the main <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Green_Hornet_2222.html" title="The Green Hornet">The Green Hornet</a> article, so no need to merge any information. Would not oppose re-creation if production ever gets underway, which doesn't seem to be anytime soon. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 13:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - per nom. Didn't Smith at one point say that he was going to make the Green Hornet because he didn't think he could make a good comic book movie? The main article even provides the link to where Smith says he is not making the Green Hornet any longer, so even that information is inaccurate on the film page. I think it's more appropriately covered on the main article for The Green Hornet. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 17:43, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Like I mentioned, the information is already mentioned on the appropriate article, so there's nothing further to merge. In addition, no point in keeping the redirect if the film is not guaranteed to be made. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 23:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll accept nothing to merge, but I stand by the redirect, so that if someone searches for information about the film they heard was coming, they can find where its status is discussed. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:38, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> One Fine Day has little notability at the present moment, but it is a legitimate film and a wikipedia page would help in the publicity the film needs in order to gain some notability. I think that this page should stand. -Sarah <small>— 24.61.108.178 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.61.108.178_1159.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.61.108.178">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is my first post on wikipedia. I've been following these guys's film online for a few weeks and I really think they've got something.

<li><b>Delete</b> Films should have an article once they're notable - not in advance --J2thawiki 20:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> At first I didn't post because I was afraid that I would be discredited or banned for this being my first post and therefore right now this might be considered a "single purpose account." But Anyways, I say keep the article. It's not doing any harm really, and the film is already growing in appreciation just from the trailers. It's not like this is a page for something that's completely made up or something that won't get any hits or something like that. And also, when does something become non-trivial? Because with a film like this, it's gonna be tough to get some sort of big label on it. At least give the article and film some time to prove itself before fighting to delete it. (Loki8907 20:53, 22 February 2007 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for reason stated by J2thawiki. <b>Comment:</b> Many of the keep votes seem to be based on the idea that Wikipedia can be used to increase popularity for the subject, but <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">policy</a> strictly states that self-promotion and advertising is something to be avoided at all costs. --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 22:40, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I'm iffy on whether this article should stay or be deleted, but for now I'd say it's at least mildly non-trivial and appears to have a somewhat established actor in the cast. If the IMDB page wasn't provided I would probably say delete it, but I'm going to give it a weak keep. (Third3rdIII 23:16, 22 February 2007 (UTC))</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>; recent community consensus against "in popular culture" articles applies much the same to this article, where "can be verified/cleaned up" protestations are outweighed by the extent to which this article is unverified and messy, and clearly isn't going to be made into a real article anytime soon. This article suffers more than others that have been deleted, if anything, due to the confusion between the Western political emblem and the Eastern religious symbol. The argument that this should be kept around because some of this mess needs to be merged into the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">featured article</a> is equally unconvincing. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 03:15, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not every entry is OR. It's easy to speak in general terms, but when you examine the entries one by one, each one is different. Why not just add fact tags for the problematic ones, and if they are not cited within a few weeks, delete them - then if the article is whittled down to nothing it can easily be merged or deleted. Seems like this AfD is jumping the gun to try and solve a problem that will just be re-created.

<li>No, the best solution is to delete articles that consist of nothing but indiscriminate context-free items. As I've already said, even if every item were cited, that would still leave this as an indiscriminate list, devoid of any context either within the fictional item from which the sighting was made or in the real world. I am willing to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and accept right now on face value that every item on the list is a real factual thing. Which leaves the question of "so what"? What does it tell us about the XFL that their logo bore some passing resemblance to a swastika? What does knowing that a character in <i>The Sum of All Fears</i> has a swastika engraved on the back of his watch tell us about either The Sum of All Fears or the real world? Nothing. And I'm sorry, but your desire to keep these sorts of articles because it keeps the information from being in the main article is a poor excuse. If the information is crap in the main article and it's crap here then the information should be removed. And if that means that you or some other editor who's interested has to monitor the article, so be it. I have articles on my watchlist and when people add crap information to them I take it out. That's part of what being an editor here is about. If you're not willing to do it, that's fine, you certainly aren't required to. But please, don't shift the responsibility onto someone else by dumping garbage into a trivia article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'd argue that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is the incorrect category in which to determine notability for this entry, as CASA is neither a musician, musical ensemble, composer, or lyricist, but rather a community organization, similar to the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbershop_Harmony_Society_73de.html" title="Barbershop Harmony Society">Barbershop Harmony Society</a>. CASA and CASA's programs have been instrumental in the advancement and growth of the genre. The CARA awards are the primary arbiter of success in recorded a cappella (witness the number of groups, student publications, etc. proudly displaying their nominations and/or awards in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cara+a+cappella" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cara+a+cappella" rel="nofollow">this search</a>); the CASA website publishes articles, commentaries, and blogs from notable figures in the field; the CASA songbooks are invaluable in assisting new groups in getting off the ground. Contemporary a cappella is clearly a niche genre at this time, but CASA is the central organization contributing to its growth and advancement. <a href="../../../j/a/v/User%7EJavaTenor_52f8.html" title="User:JavaTenor">JavaTenor</a> 04:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a Non-Commercial organization, the Wikipedia Guide to Deletion states that Non-Commercial Organizations are "usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by sources that are reliable and independent of the organization. In other words, they satisfy the primary criterion above." CASA is legally filed as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, has over 2700 verifiable members around the world, has a team of Ambassadors around the world, holds a national convention annually, etc, etc. These are all international in scale. vocomotion 04:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a well-respected organization with national stature and participation, particularly among students; holds frequent and verifiable events; and its publically available IRS records on the web date back to at least 1998. I'm not affiliated with the organization but as an a cappella performer I recognize how CASA's activities regularly and significantly affect me, my peers and the stature of a cappella music.

<dd>Whichever administrator looks over this should note that Seinfreak37 is both the nominator and the editor voting just above. Seinfreak37, you could just label your comment <b>Comment</b> and make it less confusing for the administrator. In response to your comment just above (as I mention in my linked-to argument), high schools are very different from the other entities you list. Because of what high schools are, nearly every single one of them has a large impact on the lives of students and very often on whole communities. That can be said for hospitals and maybe a few other classes of entities, but not for all persons or companies or products. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arruzzo 16:28, 19 February 2007 (UTC)Hello Natalie and other Wikipedians, I'm new here. I added the Keep Bluechattin' software to wiki and I have my reasons for this. Yes, the first corrector was right it was not at that time in Google (s/w was not listed by G), but check it now, or better tomorrow. As many other software provided by AXYZ Mobile (yes, I do work there) it's very valuable and high volume product. And guess what, it's free, as wiki. So, 19 February is it's launching date, it's very fresh and one of it's kind. Isn't it great that wiki is so much up-to-date that on it's release date, it's already on wiki?</p>
<p>Cheers, azzurro</p>

This is just ridiculous. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 17:47, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I guess i have no personal preference. I just wanted it to be know that the article had been deleted via <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. There was no consensus to merge or move the content elsewhere.

<li>It does if the article was deleted for being unverifiable, which was the argument made by several editors in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nerd_Boy_%282nd_nomination%29_8ee8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nerd Boy (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nerd Boy (2nd nomination)</a> and not refuted with a citation of a single source, either then or in this re-addition of the same content.

<li><b>Keep</b> there seems to be a continued crusade to delete ASCII-art related content recently. It is just convenient to have this article on its own page, because it is related both to <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_art_8901.html" title="ASCII art">ASCII art</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomics.html" title="Webcomics">webcomics</a>. It could be easily expanded with sections on various notable ASCII comics, such as "Red Baron", the first ever ASCII comic, legendary "<a href="http://www.asciiartfarts.com" class="external text" title="http://www.asciiartfarts.com" rel="nofollow">ASCII Art Farts</a>" and so on. Just because nobody bothered to do that up till now doesn't mean that it will stay stubby for eternity. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 17:43, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You'd fare far better by showing that the assertions that the article is unverifiable are false. You've nowhere addressed verifiability in your entire argument. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:00, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Even if they are verifiable, verifiability is not the same as notability. I can't see a reason why this can't be a <b>Merge and redirect</b> into <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_art_8901.html" title="ASCII art">ASCII art</a>, either <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 19:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If it's unverifiable, which has been the challenge levelled at this content without answer since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">01-03</a>, it cannot be. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I suggest that you read what I wrote again, and start to address verifiability. Looking at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nerd_Boy_%282nd_nomination%29_8ee8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nerd Boy (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nerd Boy (2nd nomination)</a> it appears that people have been pointing out to you the lack of sources for this content (which is little different to what was written in the now deleted Nerd Boy) for at least a month and a half, now. You could save yourself a lot of trouble by citing sources to show that they actually exist. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>All of the content that is currently in the article is verifiable through the primary source (official website). You could save me a lot of time by pointing to which exact statements need sourcing. This stuff is pretty old, and a lot of web links are already dead. It's pretty hard to search for sources in this area. For example about 4 years ago I was doing ego-searching and found an article in Polish magazine with very thorough coverage of ASCII art (written by Blazej Kozlowski, no less, one of the greatest artists of the scene). It mentioned Nerd Boy and other popular ASCII comics. I can't find the link now. The printed version is probably stored somewhere, but the web version is dead. A lot of ASCII art references are in printed form and their Internet versions have phased out. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 21:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Interesting debate, but ultimately very little of it pertains to the bio in question. This decision to delete the bio on Denny Klein is based on a lack of independent assertion of notability and is without prejudice to creating articles on the technology—whether the technology is valid or not (and my take on this is that it is not—reminds me of Fleischmann and Pons <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a> claims in its combination of science, scientists and lack of verifiable and independently reproduced results). I will make the deleted material available if someone wants to pursue a neutral article on any of the rest of this. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 21:03, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article should be deleted because Wikipedia clearly has no person qualified nor knowlegable enough on the topic to make it compliant with Wikipedia standards.

<dd>Do you not understand how to read chromatography graphs? If you have any questions about the graphs write me a private message and I will explain them to you. This technology is clearly not Oxy-Hydrogen therefore it is not a hoax, understand the chromatography graphs and you will begin to understand why fuel enhancement is a viable technology. While HHO is manipulative, because it is Brown's Gas, Brown's Gas itself has been around for decades and is the allotropes and isomers present in the chromatography graphs. Do what you want with the article, but the chromatography graphs are the end all be all means of proving, showing, and rationalizing why HHO, Brown's Gas, Rhodes Gas, Green Gas, and Hydroxy (which are all the same gas) are not hoaxes and are simply the result of a common ducted electrolyzer design. 24.193.218.207 17:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Journal of Hydrogen Energy Technology, published by controversial physicist Dr. Santilli. Although the manuscript is a complete crock in its assertion that HHO is somehow not Brown's Gas, the data is some of the first scientific material ever published in a peer review jounral about common ducted hydrogen and oxygen gases.24.193.218.207 19:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The exact chromatography graphs have been extracted from the article and published on the website listed in the references section of the "Denny Klein" Wikipedia article. Check out those graphs, they clearly show that the result of common ducting is not just H2 and O2. Oxy-Hydrogen is only pure H2 and O2, therefore because of the different molecular configurations (proven by chromatography and published in peer review), common ducted hydrogen and oxygen cannot be Oxy-Hydrogen. If you want to get into schematics, technically common ducted hydrogen and oxygen contains Oxy-Hydrogen, because common ducted hydrogen and oxygen does indeed contain predominantly H2 and O2, but because of the existence of H5,O5,H1O2,H1O4,H2O4,H2O2, and a variety of other molecules it simply cannot be stated factually that common ducted hydrogen and oxygen is Oxy-Hydrogen.24.193.218.207 19:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The exact name of the Scientific Peer Review Journal, and the published volume, issue, and date are: The International Journal of Hydrogen Energy Volume 31, Issue 9 , August 2006, Pages 1113-1128 24.193.218.207 19:29, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In fact on the website where the chromatography is published the graphs are actually on a page titled "What is Brown's Gas?". 24.193.218.207 19:38, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know how respectable it is, but that looks superficially to be a real peer-reviewed journal. That paper actually discusses the actual "HHO gas" created by this company, compares it to Yull Brown's gas (which is said to be distinctly different), and includes links to Denny's company website. Regardless of whether it's a truly reliable source, this is another major notability point. Here's a proper reference:

<dd>What can I say, you are probably the first Wikipedia editor to actually pursue this technology scientifically. Your current edit to the article is professional, not biased, and scientifically accurate. You have clearly expressed what is stated in the academic article, and have taken into consideration information that is obtainable from other notable sources; simply well done. I am happily in a stupor. On a side note, since you have absorbed this HHO crock, you will be happy to know that the only reason HHO is claimed to be different than Brown's Gas is to avoid the stereotypes associated with Brown's Gas. Although there is no peer review article that directly states the clear and obvious link between HHO and Brown's Gas, it will emerge publicly over time. As the HHO article published chromatography a simply chromatography test of Brown's Gas will reveal consistent quantities of particular molecular masses establishing an emperical link between so called HHO and traditional Brown's Gas. HHO is simply the most current effort to take Brown's Gas technology to the next level, as it has been around for decades in a stalemate with the status quo. Please uderstand Omegatron, this technology is simple, Oxy-Hydrogen (H2 O2) is produced in an independently ducted electrolyzer, Brown's Gas (allotropes, ect...) is produced in a common ducted electrolyzer; it is this simple design criteria that dictated how the molecules in the product hydrogen and oxygen form. 24.193.218.207 05:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Some of this is the wrong damn argument. This is not the place to debate to what degree Denny Klein's claims are truthful or fraudulent. Is his story noteworthy and verifiable? For AfD, we don't care if his claims are verifiable. We care if it's verifiable that he made those claims at all and to what extent they influenced others. Whether he pulled a hoax or not, the fact that he made said claims is not a hoax.

<dd><b>Comment</b> you misundertand wikipedia. I am not denying X said Y. The point is X can make the claim he wants to yet there is no independent scientific article supporting that claim.

<dd>You seem to have taken offence. Please don't. And please don't assume that I haven't looked for sources establishing notability. I'll admit, I didn't stretch to searching <i>FOX News</i>. The newspaper articles you've linked to all seem to be the same story retold, and I believe (with as much authority as my own journalistic hunches may carry with the closing admin) that they are essentially obliging pieces in response to self-publicity on Klein's part.</dd>
<dd>I think you've hit the nail on the head, when you say that "<i>Even if he himself is not notable, his company and the "HHO gas" certainly is, so that article should be re-created if this one is deleted</i>". My secondary concern is that this article is about Klein's company and his fuel source, thinly masquerading as a biography. Look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Template%7EBiography_b518.html" title="Template:Biography">Template:Biography</a> for the sort of thing that a biography should include; then compare with <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denny_Klein_7a9c.html" title="Denny Klein">Denny Klein</a>. There's almost no biographical material there at all (the unavailability of which tends to confirm my assessment of his notability). I infer from the nominator's comments above that this article is being used to shelter material which has been deleted by community consensus - that's poor form, but I'm still not basing my opinion on that. I remain of the opinion that this person is non-notable.</dd>
<dd>If you would like to see one of those other articles undeleted, then move for a deletion review. It's not relevant to my assessment of Denny Klein's notability. Best wishes — <a href="../../../m/h/o/User%7EMholland_48ad.html" title="User:Mholland">mholland</a> 18:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Anyone who says that this technology is a Hoax has clearly not pursued due dilligence. Frankly its disturbing how the general public subscribes to the prevailing stereotype without conducting an investigation prior to making conclusions. This is the very reason why the status quo in America is practically impossible to change. Omegatron has conducted due diligence and has uncovered one of the more recent peer review publications on the topic, albeit there are not many, and most only indirectly reference Brown's Gas and HHO, but the simple fact that the editors of the peer review journal chose to accept the material for publication deems the technology to have a certain degree of merit. <b>Frankly the chromatography is the smoking gun for the credibility of the technology</b>. Obviously the information currently contained within the article clearly does not belong in a Bio, but the information is indeed credible, verifiable, and peer reviewed. I personally have voted delete because there is simply no one editing this article other than myself and Omegatron. I strongly urge anyone that does not understand this technology to at least review the chromatography posted on the Sanilli article exerpt @ waterfuelconverters.com . Also anyone who believes this technology is a hoax do review waterfuelconverters.com thoroughly and you will clearly see that the technology is currently being installed for fuel enhancement applications across the USA in very public applications including commercial diesel trucking enhancement, personal vehicle enhancement, and power production facility enhancement. 24.193.218.207 20:13, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The very reason that <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> has labeled this technology a hoax, is why this technology has not progressed publicly for the past 40 years. This technology has been around since the 60's, and electrolysis has been around since the early 1800's and is barely used in viable applications other than Oxy-Hydrogen torches and chemical production systems. I would like to clarify something. Electrolysis is less, way less, than 100% efficienct therefore the hydrogen and oxygen output has less energy than the input. If you put in 100 watt-hours, and the electrolytic cell is 80% efficient, you get 80 watt-hours of energy output in the hydrogen and oxygen. Who in their right mind would rather use the hydrogen and oxygen rather than the electricity directly, as it is more efficiency to use the electricity directly rather than convert it into hydrogen and oxygen. The status quo is that making hydrogen and oxygen is futile because it will have less energy than what is input (this is 100% correct, the dam status quo is correct). But because the general public cannot think past what is put right in front of their close minded shallow faces this is where they stop. Hello everyone, welcome to the idea of on-demand (no storage, produce it then use it) fuel enhancement. Produce hydrogen and oxygen, but not use it by itself because of energy lost due to efficiency, and use of the hydrogen and oxygen as a carbon fuel enhancer. This is viable, as because Brown's Gas and HHO has fancy molecules other than just H2 and O2, when used as a fuel enhancer there is a direct BTU contribution and a catalytic effect. Because of this dual effect the concept of fuel enhancement is indeed viable, marketable, and emerging extremely quickly in light of carbon fuel prices and the consequences of pollution emissions. <b>Why use only carbon fuel when you can mix in a quantity of hydrogen and oxygen to make the same quantity of carbon fuel release more energy, burn more completely, and produce less emissions</b>. I feel like I have to spoon feed the concept of fuel enhancement to the general public. I sooooo deeply appreciate the due diligence of Omegatron, and its time for some other Wikipedia editors to put in the time and effort that is required to understand the technology. There is no excuse for <b>perpetuating stereotypes</b>. Grow up people, don't subscribe the the status quo, investigate, research, and make your own decisions. 24.193.218.207 20:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> actually said "this is most likely a hoax". Most likely? What does that mean, is that your opinion or are you repeating what you have seen. Have you investigated the tech? Have you read the Santilli article? Have you seen waterfuelconverters.com? Such an ambiguous statement implies that you have done nothing except make an "unsubstantial" statement. What proof do you have that "it is most likely a hoax"? The word of other people? What other people? What was their claim? What was their proof? Where was the claim posted, on a forum? 24.193.218.207 21:04, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b> Just before I make my comment Im a cricket fan also. I see this as a pointless article. What use does it actually serve? All it is is a list of info - granted all linked up but I dont know why anyone would come searching for this data on wikipedia, and by the time the cricket world cup is over the article would be of no use anyway. If someone was looking for info on an umpire, they would search for the umpire directly, not come via this list --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 13:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>(Unsigned!) <b>Comment</b> This profile (Douglas Bell) has now been updated. Everything has been entered carefully to be statements of fact. Achievements of particular note (to date) include being a publisher of books and magazines from the age of 23. His day-job includes editing of one of Europe's largest youth culture magazines. Douglas has won an international photographic award - although this has not recently been acted upon publication/exhibition wise. He has two books in production (under his own authorship) which will be out this year - one is highly political and will circulate internationally. He has a degree from one of the most respected academic departments in the world. He is also also politically active - despite his age (now 25). Are there any other young people in the world with such a CV?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fat Controller Magazine is re-launching in April '07 with a projected readership of 500,000/month (abc audited) - having proven itself as an enormous success already. What is so remarkable is that it is entirely independent of IPC/EMAP (who have something of a duopoly in the UK publishing market). The company is embracing new technology in a way which was simply not possible even a year ago, and has hundreds of young contributors involved from all over the world including Thailand, Egypt, Canada, China, Russia, Peru, Ecuador, India, Japan, South Africa, The USA... the website www.fat-controller.com does not (at this stage) fully reflect this, as a re-launch is imminent and updates are tied to this schedule. Like Wikipedia, Fat Controller Magazine affords the public an oportunity to be involved in media production (on a huge scale). It is possibly the first user-generated (print) magazine of is kind and/or scale in the world. The company (Fat Controller Media Ltd) &amp; Arthur Bell CBE still need profiles uploaded.</p>
<p>The magazine's Wikipedia profile needs updating but it is factually correct (in all that it states). Look-up Fat Controller in media directories such as BRAD/Mediadisk if you have access to them - they are expensive/exclusive but extremely valuable. Perhaps a PR drive is required by the publishers, but with a larger circulation and an April re-launch, it is fair and right to wait for further press coverage before any hasty (and undue) wikichat ends up deleting these valid and relevant entries, just because the complainants haven't ever picked up a copy themselves.

<ul>
<li>Marianos - the "ultimate" reality-television couple. The fact that they have compete (and so successfully) on so many CBD shows and were invited to appear on the All-Star versions of both Survivor and the Amazing Race brings them, for me, above the general lack of notability of Reality TV contestants.</li>
<li>Alison Irwin - as with the Marianos she has been involved in a number of different reality television show and gained notoriety as such.</li>
<li>Kandice - keep because her competing in the Amazing Race is peripheral to her notability as Miss America state titleholders and Miss America national competitors .</li>
<li>Tyler MacNiven - notabile for a number of other different things - see article.</li>
<li>As for the rest - well I've tried to get rid of them myself (See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_James_Branaman_b0f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Branaman">here</a>, but I'm not going into that now). -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 20:02, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Relist as individuals</b> or <b>Keep</b>. Some of these may indeed be cruft, but some of these are not. I haven't looked at each article, but some of these people are notable for more than just being on one TV show. Some of these people have appeared in multiples of Survivor/Big Brother/Amazing Race, plus all-star editions. Kandice Pelletier has also appeared at Miss America after winning her state competition. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 20:23, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep all</b> as too mixed of a bag of nominations to reasonably consider as a unit. Some of these are TAR winners, which IMHO confers notability in itself. Some are notable for achievements outside of TAR and need to be considered in light of those achievements. And frankly, anyone who thinks that Rob and Amber are not notable has no conception of the reality television genre. Finally, if no better reason for deletion than "reality tv cruft" can be offered then there is no justification for the nomination. Delete&#160;!votes are coming off very much as <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy close all</b> This is absurd. The Marianos each have appeared in five editions of three different series, one of which was completely about them. Tyler MacNiven is arguably notable completely outside of his participation, which, it should be noted, was a victory, in The Amazing Race. To compare these individuals to the average reality TV participant is absurd. Even Ron and Sarah, partners on the show they participated in, deserve separate AfDs because of Ron's possible notability from his time in Iraq. I'll say it again: This is absurd. --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 20:42, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Relist as individuals</b>, other <b>keep all</b>. While some are strong keeps (for instance, Rob and Amber Mariano), others might well qualify as deletable. Unfortunately, as Maxamegalon2000 and others, voting for this many in this fashion will only cause confusion. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 23:57, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was unaware of the previous AFD but in reviewing it, it appears that most of the keeps were based on the form of the nomination, not the substance. However, I disagree that a mass nomination of people notable for the same thing (winning a million dollars on the same game show) is automatically invalid. And "keep"s based on the existence of the previous AFD need to take into account that <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus can change</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>keep</b>. I completely agree with the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> argument, and was ready to go with the delete arguments on that basis. Normally, arguments based on <i>"keep because we have article X"</i> are not relevant. However, in this case, I find those arguments do hold sway. If we're going to have lists of <i>many</i> other country's postal codes, then there is no basis in the arguments to delete the postal codes from Nepal. Seems to me they should all go, but no basis for singling out only a single country. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 05:41, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The information might be "useful" to some minuscule subset of those who search wikipedia for encyclopedia information, but that is not a reason to keep it (see <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html#It.27s_useful" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> - an essay, not a policy, but reasonable in its content) and so I don't think that warrants retaining it... and of course, similar articles are neither a reason to delete <i>or</i> to keep per "<a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html#What_about_article_x.3F" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">What about article x?</a>".

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Quite the contrary: my grandmother is old, but she is not notable because she is not adequately documented by independent sources. Here on Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wp:notability">notability is not subjective</a>. This is a well-established principle. Simply because something is old, or big, or small, or young, or <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wp:notability">you happen to like it</a> does not make it notable. It bears repeating in virtually every debate on schools articles: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html#The_common_notability_criterion" title="Wp:notability">a topic is notable if it has sufficient, independent works that are reliable</a> to support an article about it. Every other article in Wikipedia has to stick to these principles, but in every school debate we get variants of the line "all schools are notable", or "I think this is notable", or "I like it". This is fine, and if anyone wants to set up a directory of all schools on the planet they're very welcome to do so, but the criteria we have here are different: we have a technical definition of notability that is independent of your preferences, or mine, or any other editor's. But there is a small, vocal, number of editors who think that their preferences should over-ride this fundamental principle, simply because "they like it". One of the great tragedies of Wikipedia is that the "pro school" people think that there's a bunch of people out there who are "anti school": I'm certainly not, as my record shows, and I'm highly confident that neither are most people. All I want, and I suspect all that most people want, is for the same rules on notability to be applied to the subjects of all articles. We can indulge in technical quibbles about whether school sports results in local newspapers count as adequate references if you like, but the bottom line is that what I want is fairness, and not to have the particular preferences of one group imposed on the project as a whole. You say that I am missing the point, but it is you who is missing the point: Wikipedia is a shared, collective endeavour in which we all agree to be bound by common standards. When you try to impose your views by claiming that all X are per se notable it is you, not I, who is breaking the social contract that unites Wikipedia editors, because you are not accepting the general principle of notability that guides and binds us, but imposing your own. To say "I like this, so it must be so" is not the mark of someone who wants to be part of a larger commonweal, but the mark of the unco-operative, the petulant or the dictatorial. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not denying that this article needs sources, but I still say that a School with a history of over 350 years is asserting notability. That history needs verifying. The guideline you quote "is notable if it has sufficient, independent works that are reliable" is all very well, but in my opinion it is confusing notability with verifiability. Something can have lots of sources which are reliable, in the sense of reporting something correctly, but they can be sources about something that is trivial. I am not saying "I like this". I know nothing about the School. Nor am I saying "All Schools are notable". I am saying that very old Schools are at least asserting notability. People should be adding reliable sources and developing this article. A very old School will have had many notable alumni and will have played a significant role in its community. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A very old school need not have had any notbale alumni. If there are notbale alumni, then this is very probably a notable school. But this doesn't follow on from the fact that it's old. Something can very easily be old and not notable. Basically, a mention of notable alumni would be an assertion of notability. It doesn't mention any. Simply being old is not enough. There are no other assertions of notability.

<dd>I note that this one didn't get speedied. Note that the search term you are advocating is already pretty long, and if someone types it they don't want to wade through a long list to find what they are looking for.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see why high schools are "inherently notable". Notability for our purposes has a clear definition, and right now this article doesn't demonstrate this. I'm entirely resigned to the fact that when this debate is closed the closing administrator is simply going to count up opinions and go with the flow, because the truth is that closing administrators are never actually "bold", and the number of schools AfD debates that are closed by "keeping" articles that don't in any way meet our criteria for notability is legion, but now and then I do just want to ask: why should the rules on notability for schools be any different for our rules on other subjects? Notability is not, in Wikipedia, a matter of opinion. But, heck, little by little we're destroying the value of a Wikipedia entry, and that gets on my nerves. Just for once I'd like to see an adminstrator close a debate by actually sticking to our rules, not by counting opinions. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 11:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. The delete arguments were stronger than the keep arguments, and this certainly has the look of a vanity article. The references, as noted, are very week. The failed political career is not notable. But still, it was a close call...almost a no consensus, but in the end, there just wasn't enough of a case made for notability for the article to stay. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 05:17, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The Kirby franchise is one of the biggest in gaming.

<li>Also, categories are of no help for the majority of the articles; for instance, the category doesn't give a description of Marx.

<li>Yes, but the goal is to guide and help mature. What are they doing here under deletion? Improvement is mentioned before deletion and even then under deletion it says "Be hesitant to list articles on Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion if there's a chance they could be improved and made into a meaningful article. Tag them for cleanup instead. Try not to step on people's toes.

<li><b>DELETE</b> Who keeps remaking this page? It took me WEEKS to get it deleted last time! There is already a category listing all the Kirby chars. We don't need a huge, ugly, bloated page of information that is already listed several times in other places. We have <a href="../../../k/i/r/Template%7EKirby_characters_e4a7.html" title="Template:Kirby characters">Template:Kirby_characters</a> and Category:Kirby_characters There are simply too many characters too list them all on one page. That's why you divide it up.<br /></li>
<li>There is NO need for this page, it's nothing but redundant. It's too much of a hassle to keep the information consistent between pages. We have a page for enemies, a page for bosses, and certain characters already have their own pages. Every character already has it's own listing.

<li>Frankly I'd rather wipe some of the more catalog-esque lists above and redirect them here. Take a page from <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monsters_of_Final_Fantasy_99a9.html" title="Monsters of Final Fantasy">Monsters of Final Fantasy</a>, which used to look like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monsters_of_Final_Fantasy&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=20321349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monsters_of_Final_Fantasy&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=20321349" rel="nofollow">this</a> until it was spread across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monsters_of_Final_Fantasy&amp;oldid=30933492" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monsters_of_Final_Fantasy&amp;oldid=30933492" rel="nofollow">three pages</a>, and ultimately cut down to something like a quarter of what it used to list. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 05:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> What's the point of this list if most (all of them, actually) of these characters are already on other lists?

<li><b>Delete</b> This treats several main characters(like Dedede, Tiff, etc.) like minor characters. I think they're good with just their main articles. I think another list should be made with the REAL minor characters. BamYap 04:58, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And what are you talking about? This list is particularly SHORT in comparison with many other video game character lists. How in the world is this even remotely long? We don't have lists of bosses for other games, and we definitely don't have one for mini-bosses. We don't need one for animal friends, since only six characters apply to that label. The only two lists that are of any worth are the list of enemies and the list of characters. And considering that you are fighting me tooth and nail over me shortening a list of enemies (which has to be twice the size of this article), I'm shocked you're saying "Delete this article because it's too long". How can you call this listzilla and oppose its existence when you are all for a list of enemies which you refuse to allow the removal of less-notable enemies to shorten it? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And not to be rude, but are you quite sane? This is done in ALL character lists. Legend of Zelda character list has Link on it, Mario list has Mario on it, Chrono Trigger list has Crono on it, Final Fantasy VI list has Terra on it. There is NOTHING wrong whatsoever with listing major articles on a list of characters just because of importance. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems to me that most, if not all of the data listed here is already available in other locations. You may argue that a list would condense unneeded categories into a single area. This is absurd, nay, preposterous! There are far too many characters, enemies, and bosses to be placed in a single list. You may claim that all of the information is not needed on this website, but you would still be incorrect. Is Wikipedia not an attempt to place as much information as possible in one website. Man cannot be the judge of what wisdom is declined and what is accepted. This video game franchise has as much of a right as anything else to exist. - Izzyisme 08:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Unencyclopedic; Wikipedia is not a repository of probability tables. Very long; content doesn't stand on its own as an article, is too long to be accommodated in another one. Is named as a subpage, which articles should not be. Should be deleted, transwikied or moved out of article space. – <a href="../../../q/x/z/User%7EQxz_3066.html" title="User:Qxz">Qxz</a> 23:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker_probability_%28Omaha%29_b06d.html" title="Poker probability (Omaha)">parent article</a> seems to have a bunch of these tables too.

<ul>
<li>I hadn't thought of it that way. As I understand the rules, though, it would be a copyvio only if the tables existed somewhere else first, since I don't <i>think</i> anyone can claim copyright on something which turns up here first. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I left a note on the parent article's talk page, and on a user page of someone involved in splitting the article in the first place, who may have made the tables. It's not exactly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> because it's not really <i>research</i>; I wouldn't demand a ref for 2+2=4.

<ul>
<li>I can't claim to understand the mechanics of card games, but I think it's still close to OR if not in fact over that line. Essentially, the article's talking about a series of outcomes and the probabilities that these outcomes will occur. That's something which requires a higher level of mathematical work than 2+2=4, so it's either been done by someone somewhere else (in which case it needs to be appropriately sourced before we talk about anything else) or done by the author/s of this article (in which case it's naughty). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(edit conflict) I do understand the mechanics of card games; I think the calculations fall under the realm of <i>common knowledge</i> among "professional" Omaha players, in much the same way basic math is common knowledge among grade-schoolers. I can tell you <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackjack.html#Basic_strategy" title="Blackjack">what these blackjack charts say</a> from memory, for example. <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omaha_hold_%27em.html" title="Omaha hold 'em">Omaha</a> is simply one of the most complex games, where the amount of esoteric knowledge is high. A lot of the card game articles are fairly ad hoc in respect to citations, but I imagine they attract a fair amount of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Wikipedia%7EExpert_editors_976b.html" title="Wikipedia:Expert editors">expert attention</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 23:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Since I created the article in question I'll abstain from voicing an opinion. But I thought I'd copy here my response to the question <i>"Did you make the tables in the article up for deletion?"</i> from <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a> on my talk page:

<dd><i>What do you mean by make? Yes, I made the tables. No, it's not my original research. However, I don't know of any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that contains all of the information, probably because it's voluminous. The sourcing is from papers and discussions in probability forums, but those wouldn't be considered reliable sources and most of it has not been "published" in the proper sense. All of the information in the tables is easily verified because after all, it's just math. The "verification" is that the probabilities add up to 1.0. I included</i> <b><a href="../../../p/o/k/Talk%7EPoker_probability_%28Omaha%29_Derivations_for_making_low_hands_f449.html#Explanation_for_length_of_the_page" title="Talk:Poker probability (Omaha)/Derivations for making low hands">a note on the talk page</a></b> <i>regarding the reasoning behind including the tables, which in part is specifically to provide verification for the tables in the main article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Completely objective and verifiable (use <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combinatorics.html" title="Combinatorics">combinatorics</a> and a calculator). This is not original research; from <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>: "Editors may make straightforward mathematical calculations or logical deductions based on fully attributed data that neither change the significance of the data nor require additional assumptions beyond what is in the source."
