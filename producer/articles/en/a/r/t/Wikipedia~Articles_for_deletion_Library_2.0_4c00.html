<p>Yet Another Web Neologism. From the article: <i>The term "Library 2.0" was coined by Michael Casey on his blog</i>. Says it all, really. A neologism coined by a blogger and used by bloggers, not notable <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 16:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm unfamilar with this topic, but looking at the extensive references the term "Library 2.0" appears in the title of articles in both Library Journal and School Library Journal (among the other web or blog references) and appears to be a known academic concept, not a neoligism. I'd say this should be kept unless proof of a lack of notability could be shown, or other proof that this is some sort of odd fringe concept. Notability isn't based on where a term originates, but where it ends up. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>From what I can see, the term is used only in Library-related publications, and on the web. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 18:44, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You mean only the experts on libraries use the term? Then it must be useless, of course. â€“ FYI, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_science.html" title="Library science">library science</a> is an established field of research. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 18:50, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have to say, "the term is used only in Library-related publications, and on the web" as an argument for deleting, er, an article on the use of online systems by libraries... is, um, conceptually flawed. I can't stand all these Foobar 2.0 names, but the concept is out there and we're saddled with the phrase. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 00:47, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I never liked "Web 2.0" and "Library 2.0" is even worse. However, the term has quite a bit of traction in publications already, and I won't support the deletion of an article just because I find its name silly, the concept fuzzy, or its origin too bloggy. We should have a decent article about this. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 18:50, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This entry should be kept as it has garnered so much attention, not only in the library community. Students are writing papers on it, library schools are dedicating full semester classes to it, entire conferences are built around it, and the theories are well grounded. It's very real, the subject of much discussion, and should stay in Wikipedia. Steven M. Cohen - 16:30, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This entry should be kept! The term has been used for over a year in the library community. It has been morphing into a description of new ways to think in the library community - different ways of putting the customer first, new ways of serving a library's community, and new ways to even think about librarians and training. Also - if this term is removed, I'd say that Office 2.0, another wikipedia entry, should be removed too - since they're both offshoots of the term web 2.0. David Lee King(UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While "Library 2.0" began as a bloggy term, its recent popularity in the field of Library Science has helped clarify its meaning and now has an academic "life of its own." This is an incredibly useful concept for those trying to communicate the changes in library technology. Is the name silly? Sure, but so is the Klingon language. Is the concept fuzzy? A little, but Wittgenstein made part of his career clarifying concepts such as "family resemblance" and this is no different. It's origin may be bloggy, but how is this different from the origin of many words from other technologies? It's not just a bloggy term anymore. I don't think the "origin police" should go after concepts solely because of a less-than-high-falutin origin.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - After a year of discourse via the Biblioblogosphere, the term has found its way into library-related professisonal journals <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6365200.html" class="external free" title="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6365200.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6365200.html</a>, into library school courses and workshops/symposia/conferences. Also, Casey &amp; Savistinuk's book "Library 2.0" will be published in early 2007 by Information Today, thus making the wikipedia entry a useful resource for readers looking to find out more and trace the term's history.*</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I find it bizarre that "Library 2.0" is up for deletion, the wikipedia's criteria of 'reliable sources' seems to be established. Surely discussions on the merit of the concept should be within the article not cause the deletion of the article!(Surely there is no need to address Lurker's comments on "only in Library-related publications" ...)*</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - If professional librarians are discussing and addressing this in their professional literature (and they definitely are!) then why would wikipedia feel it needs to be deleted. Are not librarians the best ones to decide what is worth discussing wrt library terms?24.36.176.71 02:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Why would "Library 2.0" be deleted if "Office 2.0" or even "Web 2.0" aren't? Isn't "Web 2.0" just as much of a neologism as "Library 2.0"? And why would a neologism be deleted anyway, especially if it's being used professionally with quite a bit of frequency? Joshua M. Neff</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I hate the term. But the very fact that there is a debate around the issue means that that debate should be vocalized. The article should spell out completely the criticisms of the term and let the reader decide <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchabot_6d70.html" title="User:Schabot">Schabot</a> 16:04, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I wrote probably the most widely-read discussion of the term (and the thing), cited in the links, and I may be identified (wrongly) as a leading opponent. While I may not be enthusiastic about the term as it's sometimes used, it's absolutely prominent, not only on blogs but within librarianship/library science in general. If this isn't noteworthy enough for Wikipedia, there must be at least a quarter-million better candidates for deletion. (Walt Crawford)Waltc 20:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable. While it could be seen as 'original research', it should be seen as an attempt to evolve existing libraries. Thus, it is NOT new but a use of new technology in the same context. Given that context, the Wikipedia falls into the same category - an 'unproven' technology which is based on the evolution of pre-existing technologies. By this logic, those who are calling for this article to be deleted might just want to save us all a lot of trouble and flag the Wikipedia itself for deletion. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 17:19, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I support the other arguments that have been made to keep this entry. Information professionals are currently discussing how Web 2.0 will apply specifically to libraries, for example: how to add tagging to catalogues. We use the term Library 2.0 to apply to Web 2.0 concepts that apply specifically to library issues. Many of our colleagues who are thus far unfamiliar with the term may be referring to Wikipedia to find out what it means. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnie_Crosby_cbcc.html" title="User:Connie Crosby">Connie Crosby</a> 17:43, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -The topic, although named poorly, is an important current trend among libraries around the world. -Annonymous</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This topic is in big discussions, in blogs, journals and in libraries themselves, even here in Australia. It is important to libraries and library staff that information like that provided by Wikipedia, continues to be freely and easily available.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -814,000 hits from a search of Google, including many of the significant print and online publications in the information sciences? Not everyone agrees with it, for sure, but the term is acting as a valuable focus in thinking about the ways in which library services evolve. -Paul Miller 24 November 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Although the term Library 2.0 may not be ideal, what is behind it is an important movement. Sarah Houghton has defined L2 as "â€¦making your libraryâ€™s space (virtual and physical) more interactive, collaborative, and driven by community needsâ€¦The basic drive is to get people back into the library by making the library relevant to what they want and need in their daily livesâ€¦to make the library a destination and not an afterthought." Because of its importance to the library community, I believe that this entry on Library 2.0 (L2) should remain in Wikipedia. - Jill Hurst-Wahl, Nov. 24, 2006.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Here are 7 published articles, 4 of them in peer-reviewed Library Studies journals, that have the term in their titles:

<li><b>Keep</b> - I would most certainly say keep this.

<li><b>Keep</b> - All terms are neologisms when they're established; this term has grown beyond its youth. For the reasons above, I recommend this be a "keep." I've presented internationally on Library 2.0 (to special librarians in South Africa) and they invited me specifically to explain and elaborate concepts that had already well permeated our culture. Kgschneider 15:49, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It seems pretty irrelevant to me whether people like the use of the "2.0" suffix or whether its use is just a fad. The fact is that the term is clearly in use right now, its use is causing debate, and that debate will leave a legacy irrespective of whether the term remains in current usage or not. It therefore deserves an entry. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndypowe11_c8b1.html" title="User:Andypowe11">Andypowe11</a> 07:54, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> â€“ Although the suitability of the "2.0" suffix for Library is just as debatable as the plethora of other 2.0s out there, its impact on the world wide community that are the custodians of the worlds information has moved well beyond its use as a label. Library 2.0 has become the central theme around which a debate/learning exercise, about the way Librarians and Librarianship need to evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities provided by the evolution of web/Internet technologies over recent years, has formed. There are many Librarians whishing to understand more about Library 2.0 â€“ this page is an ideal starting point and should be retained. Richard.wallis 09:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Neologism or not, the mere fact that this term is used in library literature, as well as lectures, talks, and at conferences means that it has entered the vocabulary of the field. For that reason alone, it needs to be documented to explain to future generations what the term means. <a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosboot_ad7c.html" title="User:Kosboot">kosboot</a> 14:43, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I think that once there are conferences out there that are built around the term (<a href="http://olcit.blogspot.com/2005/12/its-time-for-library-20-conference_15.html|" class="external text" title="http://olcit.blogspot.com/2005/12/its-time-for-library-20-conference_15.html|" rel="nofollow">It's time for a Library 2.0 conference</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/curtisrogers/sets/72157594224240348/|PLCMC" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/curtisrogers/sets/72157594224240348/|PLCMC" rel="nofollow">Library 2.0 flickr group</a>) a Wikipedia article to explain the term is beyond useful!

<li><b>Keep</b> - Please keep this term. It doesn't matter if it originated as a neologism or not. It is extremely useful.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDrew_a5a1.html" title="User:BillDrew">Bill Drew</a> 18:41, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Important term that is generating a lot of discussion. dosogwanian 11:03, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Keep with reservations. The <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia policy on neologisms</a> reads
<blockquote>
<p>Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from reliable sources. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term â€” not books and papers that use the term.</p>
</blockquote>
Since the 2.0s were all born as manifestos, people write <em>about</em> the term before they ever <i>use</i> the term. Still, it's everywhere in the literature... --Otterfan 19:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Non-issue, really. It's pretty clear that some people grate at the 2.0 thing. Seem to feel it's vacuous bandwagon jargon. Some justification for this, I suppose. As others point out there is a settling in period for new words/terminology. However, any amount of reading in the area of Library Information Science/Technology will confirm this to be a useful term.--Charles Bolding 19:36, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This debate has been referred to in at least a couple of library blogs see <a href="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/librarianinblack/2006/11/library_20_wiki.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/librarianinblack/2006/11/library_20_wiki.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> so I have added the not a vote template. I think that we should welcome professional librarians and people with a library science background. Otterfan's point about the need for reliable sources is a pertinent one and I note that there are references cited at the bottom. A Google Scholar comes up with citations as well as false positives see <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Library+2.0%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Library+2.0%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 22:42, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>'<b>Keep'</b> - It even has a well populated category <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Library_2.0" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Library_2.0" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Library_2.0</a> - <a href="../../../b/e/v/User%7EBevo_cf25.html" title="User:Bevo">Bevo</a> 00:55, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>'<b>Keep'</b> - Agreeing here with many of the above arguments to keep; although the term causes my teeth to grind, it is all over the relevant literature and a recurring topic at conferences and mini-conferences alike. This article provides valuable access points for those (such as MLS students or trustees) wishing to understand current library technical jargon. Granted it is a neologism, but it is also a key term for understanding the current debate about technological integration and innovations in the field of library and information sciences and, indeed, within libraries themselves. Many of the articles cited above by the contributors to this discussion will confirm. Disturbingly, I heard someone throw out the term "Library 3.0" the other day, so I'm sure we will eventually argue about deleting that future article as well!&#160;:P trireme 04:36, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
