<p>Contested Prod. Yet another joke religion. Per the article and Talk page discussion, the entire history of the religion was 3 hours at the Burning Man festival. No sources outside Burning Man. No indication of any activity since, but author argues that it might happen again next year. I don't see how a one-time joke is remotely notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Three hours is much longer than the average Sunday mass lasts. Babarism is not a well-enough established or widely-enough spread religion to hold a weekly service due to how spread out its worshippers are. Furthermore, as many people only attend church on special occasions such as christmas or easter, an annual meeting isn't that infrequent. To call it simply is demeaning to the deep morals that can be learned within Babarism's approach to the Babarism bible. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 21:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would prefer specifics. First off, this article is about a religion, that it mentions an organization (the Church of Babar) is only a side-note. The Church of Babar is not the whole of Babarism, as in many faiths such as <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicca.html" title="Wicca">Wicca</a>, there are more individual practitioners, the CoB is simply the only organized practise to espouse doctrine for the faith.</dd>
<dd>Still, even ignoring that this is an article about a religion (and one that has had a gathering, unlike <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisbeetarianism.html" title="Frisbeetarianism">Frisbeetarianism</a>), even approaching it from the role as an organization, it is still qualified. The scope of it's activities in an international festival such as <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> make it Criteria #1 for Organizations. The <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> Festival is a justified third party which published an announcement of the event. It was not published by the Church of Babar itself, so it is not an internal document. This has gone far beyond the level of a simply <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up ideas</a> due to the organization and collectiveness witnessed. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 21:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Your comparison is without merit, do note that while this article has links from the beginning, Flying Spaghetti Monster did NOT have them when it was first created: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;oldid=20304108" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;oldid=20304108" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;oldid=20304108</a> .

<li><b>Keep Babarism.</b> There are at least 17 parody religions in Wikipedia. These religions are based on widely known elements of popular culture around the world, including international soccer star Diego Maradona: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Maradona" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Maradona" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Maradona</a>, the Frisbee: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbeetarianism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbeetarianism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbeetarianism</a>, and more. Due to the religion's loose affiliation, ceremonies are not widely known about and do not garner much attention. This does not detract from their value and importance to the religions followers. At the time of this post, there were at least 40 mentions--<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethnickerson_fe5e.html" title="User:Sethnickerson">Sethnickerson</a> 05:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC) of the religion on the web. That tells me that Babarism is gaining acceptance and spreading by word of mouth, similar to how many religions spread before the advent of the World-Wide-Web. This religion deserves its place along side all of the other religions on Wikipedia, real or imagined. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethnickerson_fe5e.html" title="User:Sethnickerson">Sethnickerson</a> 01:34, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: your vote might matter if this were a vote, but it's not! It's a discussion to try to establish a concensus. And pointing at other articles is not going to advance your case. The question isn't "are parody religions allowed on Wikipedia", so pointing at other parody religions adds nothing to the debate. The question raised is about notability and verifiability, and you haven't offered evidence of either one. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 06:16, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Babarism. I've actually met more than one Babarist and in non-burning man environments. I can assure you they each seemed totally sincere. I agree that it's not a religion, and the Babarists I met never claimed it was, but there are people out there who follow their philosophies. The groups I met were in Phoenix and Chicago and seemed to be unrelated to each other (aside from the whole Babar thing). The only way I met the group in Chicago was because I recognized their "WWBD?" wristbands. (dwishman (at) hotmail.com)</li>

<dd>Yeah, I've been thinking about this because this is one of those unclear areas. I think the problem is that only the existence of the event at Burning Man is verified by the mention in the Burning Man newsletter. I'm going to make some assumptions here so, of course, correct me if I make an erroneous assumption. I'm guessing that the Burning Man newsletter provides just the name, time and location of the event and not a long description of the event and certainly not a description of the Babarism religion itself. Thus, if the event were mentioned in the Burning Man article, one could not challenge the assertion that the event had been held on the grounds of it being non-verifiable. The Burning Man newsletter provides the verifiability of the event BUT not of the details of the religion as presented in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, you cannot justify the whole article on Babarism based solely on the mention of the event in the Burning Man newsletter. What you would need to look for is a journalist or scholar who went to the event and reported on it in some newspaper, magazine, journal article or book. If there was an official Babarist newsletter, that might be argued as being a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Failing any of the above, the article fails for being non-verifiable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note that this argument falls apart if the Burning Man newsletter provided an after-the-fact account of the event with a full description of the details of the Babarism religion as presented in the article AND copies of the Burning Man newsletter are available either online or in libraries/archives accessible to the public.</dd>

It certainly counts as at least one interpretation of a religion, that being the Church of Babar's. The reason I give it precidence in the article's creation is that it is linked to on the Burning Man official theme camp announcement list as being the homepage of the creator of the encampment. So due to that, it's not as if someone just wrote a page on it. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 16:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep Babar</b> While I am not a member of the Babarist religion myself, my husband (much to my chagrin), was converted at the 2005 Burning Man. This is actually the 2nd year that the Babarists have held their Babarist Bash in Black Rock City.<br />
And to the poster above who argues that blogs are not considered "reliable sources," I'd like to remind him of the recent release of "Snakes On A Plane;" and the blog for said movie that just became the viral marketer's wet dream. Not only were new scenes filmed for the movie because of the blog, but more hype was created due to this movie's blog than previously thought possible. The creator of the blog was even invited to the movie premiere. While it's true that many, if not most, blogs cannot be considered "reliable sources," you can no longer automatically discredit sources just because they're not mainstream.149.169.67.118 17:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)Shawnna</li>

<dd>In that case, there was widespread reporting <i>about the blogging</i>, and the reaction to it, in numerous reliable news sources. The blogging was the <i>subject</i> of news stories, not the source. There's no indication of that occurring here. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 17:48, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Shawnna, I understand your point about blogs but I'm not convinced that it applies here. Moreover, I think it's a bad idea to get into an extended discussion of the merits of a Wikipedia policy in an AFD discussion. Let us please keep the discussion closely tied to the decision whether to delete this article.

<dd>Shawnna, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware at all that a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> event was held for this in 2005. If it was, I'd think it here be <a href="http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/2005/05_camp_vill_1.html#B" class="external text" title="http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/2005/05_camp_vill_1.html#B" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Perhaps in 2005 it was an unofficial gathering that mitigated the creation of the official 2006 theme camp. The owner of the main site can perhaps verify this once he gets into contact with me, which I've been waiting for, for a couple days. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 16:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

I gave the link to the 2005 events because someone was claiming it was held in 2005, but since I showed it wasn't listed, it wasn't notable if there were in fact a gathering in 2005 because it wasn't notable. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 19:21, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Clarification</b> - When I said there are a number of outside sources referencing the existence of Babarism, I was referring to the number of mentions elsewhere on the Web. Here is a list of the links to Babarist.org -- these are NOT typos: <a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.babarist.org&amp;bwm=i&amp;bwms=p&amp;bwmf=u&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;fr2=seo-rd-se" class="external free" title="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.babarist.org&amp;bwm=i&amp;bwms=p&amp;bwmf=u&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;fr2=seo-rd-se" rel="nofollow">http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.babarist.org&amp;bwm=i&amp;bwms=p&amp;bwmf=u&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;fr2=seo-rd-se</a>. The modern definition of news is what people find important to them, whether it be a major media outlet, the newsletter of a festival, or a blog. When an organization such as the Church of Babarism is referenced in multiple sources by a number of unaffiliated individuals, this warrants merit and establishes authenticity.

<li>Is everyone just searching American sites? The Babar books are French.

<li><b>Comment</b>. While the Babar books are French, this supposed religion had one gathering at Burning Man, an American festival. There's no assertion that this religion has any French component, which is probably why people aren't searching French-language sites.
