<ul>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> I don't see how being an artist automatically makes a person notable. Neither do I understand why created by an administrator is relevant. jmd 01:15, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being an artist is not itself notability, but it is a <i>claim</i> to notability, which is all that is required to prevent being a speedy delete. And the fact that it was created by an administrator is relevant because we can assume that user has a grasp of the policies which apply here, although that doesn't trump a consensus we find here. (<a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a>)<sup>(<a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a>)</sup> 02:47, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I refute your statement that being an artist equates to a "claim to notibility" --- at least notable enough for a wp article. There's an artist in all of us --- it's just that some are more artistic than others. Or perhaps you mean that it must be a <em>paid</em> artist, in which case a) you're discriminating against some very talented (and notable) unpaid amatuer artists; and b) why can't this apply to other jobs (doctors, laywers, butchers, dustmen ....)&#160;? If the article said that "YY is a <i>notable</i> sculptor", then that would be different, but the article doesn't say this. jmd
<ul>
<li>I think you're misunderstanding me. I'm not saying that Yamaguchi is necessarily notable. However, speedy criterion A7 requires that there be no claim to notability at all. (<a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a>)<sup>(<a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a>)</sup> 07:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly. As deletion is supposed to be a serious matter, I'm pretty strict with the application of the speedy criteria. A7 is supposed to be limited to those with no claim of notability whatsoever, "Joe Schmoe lives in New York City and drinks lots of beer," for example. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 16:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now that this article has been expanded, I'm withdrawing my deletion vote. But I'd like to point out that when I listed this article, there was indeed no claim of notability whatsoever. The article listed the person's name, occupation and education --- nothing else. What if your hypothetical article said "Joe Schmoe attended New York University, works for as a town planner for the City Council and likes to drink beer," would that have made it notable? jmd</li>

<ul>
<li>Why do you say notability is "clear"? What makes it clear to you? jmd
<ul>
<li>Based on a Google search and looking through a selection of the hits, showing her being exhibited at major museums. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 08:06, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>But the article doesn't assert that. Therefore it's a valid speedy candidate. If this person is indeed notable, then the article should be expanded, giving reasons for notability. Otherwise it should be deleted. jmd</li>

<dl>
<dd>Changing vote to <b>Keep</b> - this is hardly an artist of much note, and the padded CV posted by Pburka contains a lot of shows of largely indecipherable notbaility, but her inclusion in a few galleries of note means she meets the threshold for inclusion. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 18:05, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>After looking through about 10 pages of Google hits I have decided that her notability is not quite high enough to warrant inclusion, so I have changed my vote. However, I do think that to say immdeiately "nn" is to ignore the full story. Also note that if this Yuriko Yamaguchi is not notable enough for inclusion, the <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuriko_Yamaguchi_%28voice_actor%29_8281.html" title="Yuriko Yamaguchi (voice actor)">other one</a> probably is not either. <a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 02:52, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please note that I didn't say "this person is not notable". I said this "is an article about a real person or persons that does not assert the importance or significance of the subject". There is a difference. jmd</li>

<li>Are you basing this impression on quality or quantity? I'm not an artist of any sort, so I can't comment on the prestige of these various awards, or the reputability of the awarding institutions. But my own CV is equally as long, so does that qualify me for a wp bio? jmd

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is not the run-of-the-mill teenage vanity article, a few seconds of googling indicates some notability, and it is an article created in good faith by an established user. As I have repeatedly pointed out in the discussions on academics, I also think we need to ask: <b>is this person really <i>less</i> notable than the least notable professional baseball or hockey player who would be included according to our current notability criteria?</b> Is an artist who is represented in several public museum collections, has had numerous exhibitions at both museums and private galleries (who presumably expect either some income from sales or to enhance their own prestige by exhibiting a certain artist), and has had a large number of articles or reviews written about her or her work in major newspapers and art publications really <i>less</i> notable than some 22-year old who has just played hockey in the NHL for a year? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 08:51, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is indeed an interesting topic for discussion. The crux is, that <i>notable</i> is not the same as <i>noteworthy</i>. For example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bryant_da7e.html" title="Martin Bryant">Martin Bryant</a> is certainly more notable than (say) <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frits_Zernike_4349.html" title="Frits Zernike">Frits Zernike</a>, but IMHO less noteworthy. I would certainly agree that the huge majority of sports personalities are totally unworthy of any special notice (what's so clever about kicking a ball around?) but that's just my POV. That fact remains that the world has and does take notice of many of these persons who have not managed to outgrow their teenage infatuations (or have found a way to make money from them), and are therefore by definition <i>notable</i>. I'm not saying that this isn't a very sad inditement on society, but that's just my POV. jmd</li>
