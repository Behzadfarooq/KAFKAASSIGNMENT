<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to see a source state that this is name is used in other places of note. Meaniing, usage in terms of this title.

<li>Here's one, from the Kansas University article linked above: "As a consequence, science fiction can incorporate other genres; we can have a science-fiction detective story, a science-fiction western, a science-fiction gothic, a science-fiction love story, or, most likely of all, a science-fiction adventure story." The term was also widely used to describe <i>Firefly</i> and <i>Serenity</i> (for example, in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4318938.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4318938.stm" rel="nofollow">this BBC News story</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/B0000AQS0F/ref=dp_nav_0/002-4419481-3941634?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=130&amp;s=dvd" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/B0000AQS0F/ref=dp_nav_0/002-4419481-3941634?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=130&amp;s=dvd" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com's editorial review of <i>Firefly</i></a>).

Of the two links you give, the first says that <i>"science fiction can incorporate other genres; we can have a science-fiction detective story, a science-fiction western"</i>, but that doesn't mean it's a whole new genre.

<li>To clarify: the article doesn't hold that the science fiction Western is a whole new genre, but a notable blend of two genres. In addition to dozens of <i>Firefly</i>/<i>Serenity</i> mentions (including one at <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/diary/2002/10/03/firefly/" class="external text" title="http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/diary/2002/10/03/firefly/" rel="nofollow">Salon</a> that goes into the term at some length), I've found references to <a href="http://www.joblo.com/soldier.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.joblo.com/soldier.htm" rel="nofollow">Paul Anderson's film <i>Soldier</i></a>, <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/07b/www61.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sfsite.com/07b/www61.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Wild Wild West</i></a> (at least <a href="http://www.well.com/user/bubbles/SS0055.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.well.com/user/bubbles/SS0055.txt" rel="nofollow">twice</a>) and the <a href="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/10893810671886.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/10893810671886.htm" rel="nofollow">comic book <i>Lone</i></a>, all described as "science fiction Westerns" or variants thereof.

<li>American westerns <i><b>did not</b></i> have an influence on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> in general. Rather, a few authors wanted to repackage the stories of the old west for marketing to a new generation. Most modern writers of science fiction realize that our technology has already surpassed the point of the old west re-emmerging in space (see <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_teleportation.html" title="Quantum teleportation">Quantum teleportation</a> and the writings of <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Kurzweil_cb80.html" title="Raymond Kurzweil">Raymond Kurzweil</a> for instance). The shows listed in the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_Western_a9c7.html" title="Science fiction Western">Science fiction Western</a> article all have frontier themes exactly the same as any other Western, except with a science fiction <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/backdrop" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:backdrop">backdrop</a> in place of desert mesas and tumbleweeds. Wearing cowboy hats and roping steers don't make a Western. Westerns are marked by a particular genre of themes that encompass taming the frontier and expanding civilization. Whether that is done on a horse in old Colorado or on a space ship in future Orion's Belt, it is the same genre: a Western. --<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeace_Inside_5515.html" title="User:Peace Inside">Peace Inside</a> 06:06, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, but "science fiction Western" is still not the msot ideal title for an article. Maybe Science fiction with themes from Westerns? (Although, that nomenclature has the potential to open the door to a <i>lot</i> of cruft: "Science fiction with themes from Wagnerian opera? (As if we need another <i>Star Wars</i> article!)

<dd>If the term weren't already in use, we might be able to rename it. Personally, I would like to see it called <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html#Category:Western_science_fiction_to_Category:Science_fiction_Westerns" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Western (Science Fiction)</a></i> because these "sci-fi" shows are first and foremost American Westerns. A true science fiction story builds the <i>fiction</i> from the <i>science,</i> while the shows listed in the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_Western_a9c7.html" title="Science fiction Western">Science fiction Western</a> article use science only as a backdrop for a frontier story. As per the many examples that Josiah Rowe gave above, however, the term <i><b>Science Fiction Western</b></i> is already in place (and so much a cliche' of our society that people <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html#Category:Western_science_fiction_to_Category:Science_fiction_Westerns" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">like Radiant</a> apparently associate the genre with Science Fiction in general). Although I expressed my personal preference that <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html#Category:Western_science_fiction_to_Category:Science_fiction_Westerns" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">the category</a> be changed to <i>Western (Science Fiction)</i>, I consent to the name of the article and category being per current usage. *<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeace_Inside_5515.html" title="User:Peace Inside">Peace Inside</a> 16:41, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: One advantage of the current title is that it does not make an assertion about primacy (whether science fiction Westerns are "really" Westerns or "really" science fiction) — critical opinions may vary. "Space Western" can be slightly pejorative in use, and excludes examples like <i><a href="../../../w/e/s/Westworld.html" title="Westworld">Westworld</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_Part_III_290a.html" title="Back to the Future Part III">Back to the Future Part III</a></i> which combine Western elements with science fiction tropes outside of space travel. However, I think "Space Western" is preferable to Daniel Case's suggestions, which seem awkward to me (and, as he notes, may open the door for more original research). I honestly don't see why "Science fiction Western" is more problematic than <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy-drama.html" title="Comedy-drama">Comedy-drama</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fantasy.html" title="Science fantasy">Science fantasy</a> or any of the other genre mixtures listed at <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-genre.html" title="Cross-genre">Cross-genre</a>. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 18:34, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Since this AfD has obviously failed and we are now talking about renaming the article, I move to continue this discussion on the talk page of the article. --<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeace_Inside_5515.html" title="User:Peace Inside">Peace Inside</a> 16:58, 15 January 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/c/i/Talk%7EScience_fiction_Western_e331.html#Rename_to_Space_Western.3F" title="Talk:Science fiction Western">Talk:Science fiction Western:Rename?</a></p>

<dd>It may be best to leave the judgement of whether an AfD has reached consensus or not to the closing admin, per <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">suggested process</a>. That doesn't preclude people talking about renaming as you suggest, and the place you suggest doing so seems valid to me. But if consensus is reached there to rename, please make sure you do it via move rather than copy, so that links from here to the article remain valid. It should then be noted that the move happened here, via a comment, and please realise that a move doesn't invalidate the AfD nomination, although it may influence the closing admin's view of what consensus was.

<dd>Your comments help to clarify <i>your</i> view on when <i>you</i> think an AfD should end. <i>My view</i> is that when sixteen people have expressed their views and not a single one of them, even the creator of the AfD, has voted for a <b>Delete</b>, a reasonable person can safely conclude that the entire AfD was a waste of time. I also feel confident that Administrators are not the only reasonable people at Wikipedia. *<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeace_Inside_5515.html" title="User:Peace Inside">Peace Inside</a> 18:16, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My comments clarify my view on what <b>suggested process</b> is and what it says about timelines, not on when <i>I</i> think a particular AfD should end. If you haven't followed the link I gave before you may want to consider doing so, here it is again for your convenience: <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion</a>... it's quite good reading and one of the things it talks about is the timeline for these things. This AfD is likely to fail, in my view, so why not just wait it out? The article is neither a speedy keep nor a speedy delete, IMHO, so the timeline ought to be adhered to. To the reasonable person comment: I would think of myself as a reasonable person (and not an administrator). I am not afraid to call *fD's wasted time (and have done so in the past) but I don't see this particular one as a waste, if it leads to improvements in the article that otherwise would not have come about, that's goodness, and worth the effort. As the article stands it's Original Research, as near as we can tell, so it needs cites at the least. I'd also note that several users have given you advice about how best to comport oneself in one of these discussions which I'm not sure you've heeded yet. I think it's useful advice that you may want to consider. Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:26, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think our communication isn't connecting because we are standing on different platforms. While I'm sure we are both focused on consensus in creating a better encyclopedia, it appears to me that we have a difference of opinion over how that consensus should be reached. I don't believe that consensus should be adopted from authority figures or majority rule. I think that individual expression is vital to a healthy consensus, but that <i><b>acceptability</b></i> is different than <i><b>preference</b></i>. When I said above that "I move to continue this discussion on the talk page of the article," I was expressing my <i>preference</i>. I was <i>not</i> expressing what I would find acceptable, which is a much <i>larger</i> set of possible actions that I tolerate in order to move forward as a community. Expression of my preference will never be dictated or repressed by <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion</a>. If applying the guideline to this particular instance doesn't make sense, I will speak my mind about that. Yet, because my tolerance level on this subject is without bounds, I will go with whatever the group (not you or a guideline) decides. *<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeace_Inside_5515.html" title="User:Peace Inside">Peace Inside</a> 18:57, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that Lar was objecting to your suggestion that the discussion of the page's name should continue on the article's talk page, but to your assertion that the AfD had "obviously failed" (and the subheader "AfD Failed"). Although it's a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the voting to date, it's still <i>possible</i> that an influx of new editors will come in with compelling arguments as to why the article should be deleted. Therefore stating "AfD Failed" before the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Closure" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">closure process</a> has finished gives the appearance of presumption, not to mention incivility. You are, of course, free to discuss your views or preferences about the discussion or about process; however, it might be more productive to express those views at a page <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">dedicated</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_process_30f5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion process">that subject</a>, rather than suggesting that the process be ignored or contravened on a page that is operating within it. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:57, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Precisely. Calling this AfD "over" is premature, per the process. (although I suspect it will come out the way it's trending, and I <i>hope</i> it does, it is not over <i>yet</i>) Thank you Josiah Rowe! The other bit of my comment is to say that if consensus of the article participants is that it be moved to a different name, the fact that it is under AfD does not prevent movement, but it's considered polite (and part of the process) to make sure that the move leaves a redirect in place from the old name so that people can find the renamed article. A minor point but one I felt worth repeating because doing so when you move is politeness to AfD participants. Hope that helps. (also, for what it's worth, I'd rather see the article remain unrenamed, this is how I know the concept best, and further when I called for cites, I'm not calling the term into question... I think there are cites out there that just haven't been found or put in yet) And finally, I agree, process should guide us, not rule us but with hundreds of these discussions a week, using process really helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 22:26, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that we should make a decision about renaming the article here. Editors should be given a chance to participate in that discussion <i><b>before</b></i> it is enacted. Anyone could figure out that an AfD for this article would fail, which is why there were so few people giving their opinion, but a rename has some chance of succeeding. The dozens of people involved with this article should have a chance to let their voices be heard on the discussion page of the article, where they would expect a discussion about renaming to take place. *<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeace_Inside_5515.html" title="User:Peace Inside">Peace Inside</a> 23:09, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Josiah, given that the person who created this AfD didn't even vote for the article's deletion, I think it's fair to tell people that they don't have to waste any more time on it. I live by the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_rule.html" title="Golden rule">golden rule</a> and I would appreciate someone else doing the same for me. If you can tell me that you honestly believe that this discussion has any chance whatsoever of turning around, I will change the title of this section to encompass your views. When <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon">User:Encephalon</a> wrote the rules of closure, he did so for groups that couldn't figure out for themselves how to proceed.

<dd>Peace, I'm sure that your intentions in saying the AfD had failed were good. And no, it doesn't seem at all probable to me (although it is technically possible) that the conversation will turn around. That said, I tend to think that bypassing established processes that run reasonably well tends to cause more unnecessary <i>agita</i> than letting them run. But that's just a question of style, I suppose. And I do agree that the naming issue is better discussed at <a href="../../../s/c/i/Talk%7EScience_fiction_Western_e331.html" title="Talk:Science fiction Western">Talk:Science fiction Western</a> than here (with Lar's caveat that the article should be locatable by AfD participants). I think we're just talking about style at this point. It's not a big deal. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 00:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is common for articles to be improved while on AFD. Adding sources and/or cleaning up and/or renaming can help to both "save" the article and improve Wikipedia. The end result of AFD is generally either no article, or a better article. The latter sounds certainly appropriate here. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:16, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm in agreement on this. There's a point made on the article's talk page that Space Western isn't as inclusive as Science Fiction Western (it would shut out <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westworld.html" title="Westworld">Westworld</a> for example) and I think that's spot on as well. My hope is that adding sources for the term will satisfy those that have issues and that the current AfD thinking will be the consensus. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:30, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The point is not about including as many shows as possible! The point is using a term that actually exists, pretty much everyone has heard of this thing called a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Western_445b.html" title="Space Western">Space Western</a> where as <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_western.html" title="Science fiction western">Science fiction western</a> seems enough like a made up term for a bunch of stuff that it ended up on AfD. Sure there are lots of movies books and shows that you could get away with calling a sci-fi western but if you take out the space westerns do you really have enough left to call it a genera? Is it a term that anyone actually uses in the industry? If not no matter how descriptive the term is wikipedia is not in the business of popularizing new terms, I think this impression is why the original suggestion if Influence of Western on science fiction was made. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 10:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Linguistic <i><b>description</b></i> is how a term is used, including common "incorrect" usage. <i><b>Prescription</b></i> is the "correct" meaning of a term, even if nobody uses it that way. People with a limited knowledge of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativism.html" title="Relativism">relativism</a> claim that "correct" and "incorrect" notions of a definition cannot exist because absolute truth does not exist, but these people do not understand the practical implementation of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativism.html" title="Relativism">relativism</a>. When it comes to language, "correct" and "incorrect" refer to how useful the terms are for the purpose of conveying information. Obviously a common definition of the term must be adopted within a group to enable efficient exchange, but the term must also convey a unique and concise bit of information. An optimum language must have a distinct term for every concept and a distinct concept for every term.
