<p>No online source for copyvio, but I highly suspect it. Otherwise Original Research and not encyclopedic (nor potential to be so), perhaps Homoeroticism in Ancient Greek culture may be an article one day as an appropriate title for sniggering about <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules.html" title="Hercules">Hercules</a> and his friendly man-cousin Ioalus.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 08:24, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>. This isn't even an article about gay Greek myths; it's an article (or rather, a book report) about a book about gay Greek myths. But by all means someone should start an article on Homoeroticism in Ancient Greek culture or the like. For the time being, anything useful here should be merged into <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_homosexuality.html#Ancient_Greece" title="History of homosexuality">History of homosexuality#Ancient Greece</a> --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 11:01, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> (and cleanup) this article on a book. 3,070 google hits for the title, seems to be a reasonably notable.

<li>I hope this isn't sounding prejudiced. But a book about homoeroticism (even in a historical context) is going to have a significant boost to its Google hits for no other reason than its got gay stuff in it. Gay people will push it, Homophobes will denounce it. I say 3,000 is really not enough to count as notability. Has it won prizes? That would up its notability. Otherwise is just promotion of a book.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 13:47, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is an article about a book. So the question is whether the book is notable. It does not seem to have been on any major bestseller lists when it was published a bit more than two years ago. Its current Sales Rank on Amazon is 45,000 or so. This means not very high sales, although they might have been higher in the past. The publisher is Haiduk press, which has published just two items. (The other one is "Lover's Legends Unbound", a CD collection of stories about male love, edited by Calimach and others.) We have an article about the author, although Wikipedia being what it is, this doesn't mean he is notable. The article doesn't mention that he has written anything else, other than the CD collection, which is based on this book. It says that he is an "independent scholar", meaning he does not have an academic appointment. The book was nominated for the Lambda Prize, which is awarded for gay and lesbian literature, indicating that the book might be notable within the gay and lesbian community, even though it doesn't seem to have achieved any kind of general notability. I don't know; it looks like we have three articles: one about the author of some underground chapbooks and basically one book (which might be self-published), an article about the book, and an article about a CD collection of readings based on the book. Sure doesn't have "notability" written all over it. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:40, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>For me, a commercial and/or critically successful work is actually <i>more</i> notable if it's self-published. For me the book seems adequately notable within its field (and yes I have a low threshold), the CD collection maybe not. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:43, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, you are right that self-published works (if that is what it was; I am only speculating) are not very often critical successes. But how do you know this book was a commercial and critical success? The Amazon sales rank doesn't suggest it was; but perhaps it sold a lot of copies at gay and lesbian book stores. As for critical success, are you going by the Lambda Prize? That seems to be the only indicator of critical success, and to be honest, I have no idea how prestigious that is. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:49, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I was mostly judging critical success from the reviews listed at Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0971468605/ref=dp_proddesc_0/103-2089188-1630202?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0971468605/ref=dp_proddesc_0/103-2089188-1630202?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I might be wrong, I suppose, but considering the massive number of books in print, I think a sales rank of 45,000 at Amazon is actually pretty darned significant for a self-published work of gay scholarship which hasn't exactly received <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah%27s_Book_Club_2e97.html" title="Oprah's Book Club">Oprah's Book Club</a> levels of publicity. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
