<p>Well, Profound Intent has worked with Scottie Beats and his Night Flight Recording Studio in Forestville, Washington. The group released the single through CdBaby.net and his currently an independent recording group. A performance of their single Time 2 shine did indeed spark rumors of them bashing singer Beyonce Knowles and the death of their producer rather their engineer did spark more rumors. Locally this group was the center of attention. Within the RIAA this group was the center of attention and they also had to answer to the RIAA regarding their single and its release to the public. The group was asked to stop performing the single as well and that's what they've done in compliance with the RIAA.</p>
<p>I think that this article should not be deleted and time should be spared for more persons to add to the article what they know its true in concern of the group. This is rather a impressive article which shows no signs of spamming at all. This is a true article and I as a internet user and a wikipedia user oppose of its deletion.

<li><b>Delete or Speedy Delete:</b> Non-notable nonsense. All the sources are blogs, except the last one (WP) which makes no mention of the band at all, and the article is propping up a dead man to advance their claims. Thus there is zero, zip, zilch independent confirmation of any notability or any association with anyone notable. <strike>It may be some kind of hoax or possibly a paid public relations campaign spamming the web. Google News has zero articles on the band. Google search on "Profound Intent" (in quotes) has pages from PRWEB.COM at positions 2, 5, 6 and 7 (The band's site is at 1, and Wikipedia is at 3. 4 is a bloggish "community" site (think like myspace)).</strike> Delete ASAP. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 15:11, 4 December 2006 (UTC) (strikethrough <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 22:29, 4 December 2006 (UTC) )</li>

<p>What your saying makes no sense, of course a website with the words Profoudn Intent in the form of a phrase will show first because its a domain registered as profoudintent. I think you all are races and shall be sued. But I guess the group will do that on their own. They have been notified of you publically saying that they are FAKE! and have issued a statement at www.profoundintent.com <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.200.246.251 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.200.246.251_c5ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.200.246.251">contribs</a>) 16:04, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Comment: We believe you are real. That is not the issue. We expect an entity's web site to come up number one in searches and that is not the issue either. The issue is that we believe you are <b>not notable</b> enough to warrant an encyclopedia entry. There is also the appearance that Wikipedia is being used for a promotional scheme. It is really sad that when you encounter a little opposition you charge racism. You have no idea of the racial or ethnic backgrounds of people who use IDs or anon IP addresses here. 151.200.246.251 is the first to inject race into this debate which says more about 151.200.246.251 than anybody else. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 17:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>PROFOUND INTENT OWNER STATEMENT:</p>
<p>As the proud owner and founder of Profound Intent all is herby forgiven. I personally do not hold WIKIPEDIA.ORG responsible for the allegations posted in concern of Profound Intent's legitimacy and credibility made by members of a free service in which any John Doe can join and edit the sites contents. However; I must defend my establishment against claims that WIKIPEDIA has made saying that the Profound Intent articles was a promotional scheme. In defense I say that my establishment did not create, request or warrant such articles, and we surely do not intend (at any time) to use such a site for promotional purposes. I ask that you refrain from further stating such false and damaging remarks in regards to my establishment. Thank you for your time and attention for it is greatly appreciated. - 151.200.246.251 (LaPret) 21:09 UTC December 04, 2006</p>
<p>THAT "Positive Hip Hop Single Slams Beyonce &amp; 50 Cent" Press Release was not released by Profound Intent it was released by Rapnews.net you @SSholes! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.75.117.188 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.75.117.188_6bf0.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.75.117.188">contribs</a>) 07:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>It still looks and reads like a blog ("posted by Dave", with at least 7 spelling and grammar errors). I think all the Profound Intent supporters need to calm down and realize this is a debate about an article and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">not a forum for personal attacks</a>. Personally, I strongly endorse the positive intentions of the members of the group who would like to see music sold on its musicianship and not sensationalism of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thug.html" title="Thug">thuggery</a> and gangsterism and <a href="../../../p/i/m/Pimp.html" title="Pimp">pimping</a> (which is beating women into prostitution). I think the group has talent and fully expect that with focus and perfection of craft that this band will soon achieve some success and be fully deserving of an article. However, they are not there now. I do wish them success. Work hard at the musicianship and the group will triumph over the naysayers and be back with a dynamite article in jig time. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 08:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>PROFOUND INTENT STATEMENT:</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, for recognizing our purpose and our intentions as musicians and a group We don't dispute that we are 'not there' yet. In fact, we agree; we have a long way to go, and for someone like yourself 'Hu' to be one of the first to perfectly put into words and to recognize what our intentions are, gives us a great deal of encouragement. The "Time 2 Shine" single is about not letting anyone make you feel guilty for being yourself. As a positive group when we reference other artist we have no intentions to destroy or to 'put them on blast'. Our 'profound intent' is to reach that artist and say hey as 'youth' we feel that at some times our fellow youngsters can misinterpret what your saying; and going back on what you've said and what you say in reference to 'youth', we just want to remind that Artist; Hey we (as youth) are listening to every word you say, we hear you when you don't hear yourself sometimes. Today's youth take everything an Artist/Entertainer says for Granted and that's only a problem when what the Artist/Entertainer is saying only benefits the Artist/Entertainer rather then the 'youth'. - (the group) December 05, 2006</p>
<p>-- P.I. recently lost MISTY who left becuz she felt LaPret the founding-member was working soley in his niece Mizz Redz best interest and not the group. But Lil'Ace didn't agree. But anyway the group does have strength with all this debate about an article on WIKIPEDIA and at the same time working on replacing an orginal member. I say delete the article and just wait for the day when they get one based on FACTS known by the entire US and other national markets around the world. Most importantly when they have a WAY BIGGER fan BASE!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I know this isn't much a topic anymore but there's a REAL picture on P.I.'s Official myspace which links from their official website showing LaPret, Mizz Redz, and Misty as Young Crowd three days before they became Profound Intent and Mizz Redz broke her leg and arm and a car accident. It's the three of four members with Kelly Price at the 16th Annual Stone Soul Picnic in Washington, D.C. after they opened up for her!</li>
