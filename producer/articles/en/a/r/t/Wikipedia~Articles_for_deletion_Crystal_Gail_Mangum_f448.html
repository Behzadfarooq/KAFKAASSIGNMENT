<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> The relevant <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standard is "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events." My test for this is that if she has received renown/notoriety (as <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monica_Lewinsky_f914.html" title="Monica Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a> did) then news/blog mentions of her would not need to specify her role in the event. I checked the hits for her name at Google News, and all made it very clear that they still feel the need to say who she is. Thus, I conclude that she has not yet achieved the appropriate level of "renown or notoriety". The article has found a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for her name. I expected otherwise because most news organizations that have the requisite staff and policies to be reliable sources also have policies against revealing the names of reported victims of rape. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:15, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nonsense. The cause (victim vs perpetrator) of their notoriety is irrelevant. Cited above are nine stand-alone articles of semi-famous people known for one--and only one--event. Wikipedia evidence doesnât support your assailant-only argument: within minutes we could find yet more stand-alone articles of accusers, victims, alleged victims and the like, including two cited above: <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katelyn_Faber_2bac.html" title="Katelyn Faber">Katelyn Faber</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Hatfill_90c5.html" title="Steven Hatfill">Steven Hatfill</a>, plus four additional single-event, non-assailants <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Zapruder_51e4.html" title="Abraham Zapruder">Abraham Zapruder</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Walker_d37c.html" title="Edwin Walker">Edwin Walker</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_McCoy_8b87.html" title="Houston McCoy">Houston McCoy</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Delehanty_c254.html" title="Thomas Delehanty">Thomas Delehanty</a>. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertkeller_b7bd.html" title="User:Robertkeller">Robertkeller</a> 17:30, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with ANON above. I have a hard time believing Brian when he says that she's non-notable given the fact that he's put in over 40 comments on her discussion page. Non-notable to who Brian? Certainly not to you. In fact, I'd say you're rather fixated. Furthermore, I feel that your assertion that "victims are not notable" is rather cold-hearted.</dd>

<p>I'd also like to point out that wikipedia is not a crystal ball, therefore...none of the arguments saying "after the case is over, nobody will remember her" isn't a valid argument. She is notable at present as shown through consistent news agency reporting, numerous google hits, publicity, etc. She IS notable at present. Wikipedia is ever changing. Divine Brown was only notable for sucking off one actor, but she's still got a page. This person is notable for her allegations and pending a trial, perhaps for orchestrating a large fabrication, or being the victim of a horrible incident. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 19:20, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
