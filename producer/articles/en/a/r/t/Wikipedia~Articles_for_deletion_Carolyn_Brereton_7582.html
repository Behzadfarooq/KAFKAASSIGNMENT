<li>Editor of some papers that don't seem to have articles on WP... 36 google hits (which is odd, I know a local newspaper reporter who gets zillions of google hits because her name gets repeated so much in by-lines).

<li>I know this person very well. She might not have enough google hits... but her name is not common. for example, John Smith could be the editor, and no duh it would have a lot of google hits. Are you aware she really was an editor. She represented New Edinburgh. Check the Wikipedia article on that. If you read the article on her, she did more than be an editor. She also got nomminated for ottawa's women award. Isn't that a big achievement? So keep the article, so more people can learn about someone local to Ottawa.
<ul>
<li>I hate to say this anon user, but there are tons of article on folks from <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> who deserve them. Your person isn't encyclopedic.

<li>The only thing in the article that could meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is her editorships (being nominated for, but not winning, an award is below the radar, particularly for local awards). Anyone know the circulation figures for the <i>New Edinburgh News</i> and <i>Manor Park Chronicle</i>? They're both community papers. I happen to have the <i>Kitchissippi Times</i> (Hintonburg/Westboro) here, with a circulation of 16,700, so assuming that that's not exceptional for an Ottawa community paper I have to say <b>keep</b>. — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 20:11, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, that was kind of ugly, wasn't it? I mean: Ok, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the only possibility is her editorships. Assuming her neighbourhood papers have circulation like the neighbourhood paper of my neighbourhood, then she meets that, so keep. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> sets a low bar, but it sets a bar. — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 04:53, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The circulation for the "New Edinburgh News" is really high. The newspaper goes to some local embassies and goes to the Governor General and Prime Minister. Any other community papers that go to high power figures? Will in world
<ul>
<li>It doesn't mean they read it.

<li><b>Delete</b>; the paper might deserve an article with a circulation figure like that, but that doesn't extend to its editor unless she's done more than just edit a community newspaper...like, has she been a columnist in the <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Post_afd6.html" title="National Post">National Post</a></i> or the <i><a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Citizen_8564.html" title="Ottawa Citizen">Ottawa Citizen</a></i>?

<li>Maybe in 100 years, there will be many editors of this paper and they need to be remembered. There are so many people that are only known to about 1,000 people and get the smae credit as someone who is known by 1 billion. She also started the newspaper layout electronically. She was a diplomat, mother, newspaper editor, activist. Does she need more than that? Will in world</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A majority of Ottawans do <b>not</b> know about her.

<li><b>Keep</b> and condense considerably (1 paragraph max.). Editor of two neighborhood newspapers, wife of Canadian Consul-General in Buffalo, met in Havana.

<li>Tremont30 is not a sock puppit of me. Just to clarify that. Keep this article for one of the other reasons why... She was the first editor of those papers to start the layout electronically. She also interviews Adrienne Clarkson, a huge achievement for a local community editor. Can you name anyone else? Carolyn is knwo across New Edinburgh that a majority a residents in New Edinburgh were saddended tha she was leaving. If you keep this article, more people can learn about her. A lot of musicians weren't known until they died. Just keep that into consideration. Will in world</li>

<li><i>She was the first editor of those papers to start the layout electronically.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable. If she'd been the first newspaper editor in the <i>world</i> to <i>ever</i> use electronic layout, you'd have a point, but being the first one at a specific local community paper simply isn't encyclopedia-worthy.</li>
<li><i>She also interviews Adrienne Clarkson, a huge achievement for a local community editor.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable. Lots of people have interviewed Adrienne Clarkson over the years; it's not a feat that automatically makes someone deserving of their own article.</li>
<li><i>Carolyn is knwo across New Edinburgh that a majority a residents in New Edinburgh were saddended tha she was leaving.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable to anyone <i>outside</i> of New Edinburgh. This is a worldwide encyclopedia, not the encyclopedia of New Edinburgh.</li>

<li>Maybe she was the first on to start the layout electronically. Do you know anyother papers that started their layout before 2003, most likely but you don't know.A lot of people who interview Adrienne Clarkson are mainly people who work for big papers, but is it really often for a person working for a community paper? Can you answer me that? Maybe she is not known, but maybe in the future she will be known. Her husband works for the Canadian Foreign Service, maybe their will be an article on him, and might need one on his wife. So instead of looking at the present, think about the future. There are a lot of articles on wives of famous people. Also, (i know i told you this), but read the article. She is a diplomat, mother, activist, defender and newspaper editor. Does she more than that to get on to Wikipedia? Tell me. I really want to know.</li>

<li><i>Do you know anyother papers that started their layout before 2003, most likely but you don't know.</i> Um, I <i>personally</i> worked at a newspaper that was using electronic layout in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. And, ironically enough, it was in Ottawa, which means Carolyn's paper wasn't even the <i>local</i> leader in that regard, let alone a worldwide one. It wasn't even a particularly radical new approach when <i>we</i> did it.</li>
<li><i>Does she more than that to get on to Wikipedia?</i> Yes, she does have to do more than that; she has to <b>be notable</b>, for one. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:26, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
