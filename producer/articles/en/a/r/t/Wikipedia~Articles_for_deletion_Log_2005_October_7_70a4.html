<p>Take a close look at this article. It contains almost no information at all about Anti-Shaker; most of it is about Shakers. The info it does contain about Ant-Shaker seems quite nn, vague and dubious; if anything, this should probably be merged into Shaker. I would appreciate your views on this.

<li><b>Keep</b>: it looks like there were Anti-Shakers. However, the information in this article seems wrong. It should be cleaned up or merged with Shaker if there's not enough information for an article. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:41, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakers.html" title="Shakers">Shakers</a>. 90% of this article is about them anyway, and I suspect the info over there is more accurate. I'll vote to <b>delete</b> over keep, if no one else supports a merge. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 11:05, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and nuke the current article. The currently iteration is unsourced and IMO has absolutely zero value. That being said, there was an Anti-Shaker movement and I have no objection to a separate article on Anti-shakers, but I would strongly recommend deleting all unsource claims, even if it takes this article back to a stub, until someone wants to take the time to research and write a decent, factual, article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:44, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> or at least <b>rewrite</b>. A quick Google seems to show that they were merely an unrelated array of pastors etc. who criticised the Shakers in books and in front of their congregations, whereas the article does not define what they are and therefore makes it sound to the reader like they were a single united and named denomination opposed to the Shakers, which they are obviously not. And since we're now in the realm of fiction-writing, what shall we invent for our new group to stand for? Shakers are people who (at times) are so filled with the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> that they visibly tremble, so what are Anti-Shakers, people in comas?&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 16:07, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> While "anti-Shakerism" existed, it was never formalized as a movement, and belongs under the Shaker article; or, if that is too long, under the title "Criticism of the Shakers." <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:52, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Merge</b> I guess. I'm not sure I can vote on an article I created, but originally I meant to title this "Anti-Shakerism." I'm not sure why I titled it "Anti-Shaker" instead. Still much of their culture and history does mention imprisonment or persecution they faced. The only problem with a merger is I'm not sure this works with the Shaker article. Possibly it could just be deleted and whatever's useful in it be placed elsewhere.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 08:40, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On consideration could this simply be moved to an article called say "Opposition to Shakerism." Shakers is a featured article and I'd hate to muck it up with something not quite straightened out.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li><b>Weak Merge</b> There does not seem to be enough significant and accurate information on this to make it its own article. It would be better placed as a subheader under the main Shaker article, but it is critical that it be rewritten. I would vote <b>delete</b> over keep, but it would be better rewritten, and possibly merged with the main Shaker article. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 20:25, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It doesn't say anything about racism. The ruling states that despite mr. Mathew's violent behaviour -he broke the prison governor's face and threatened prison staff with a self made weapon, according to the Eduardo Mathews article you have written- it was not legal to treat him more harshly than other inmates. It is nowhere stated he was treated that way because of the color of his skin or any other reason. You basically have one man and his family calling for a boycott because he feels he was mistreated because of his race and his remarkable intelligence. This might be true or not, but is it a movement? Is it encyclopedic? The inclusion of this article is in itself POV because it seems to be created with the intention of being linked to from the Natelee Holloway article and support the POV that there is something wrong with the justice system on Aruba. Your article on mister Mathews is fine, but there is no connection with the Holloway case, imo. --<a href="../../../m/z/z/User%7EMzzl_7b96.html" title="User:Mzzl">Mzzl</a> 10:52, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue is not whether racism exists in the Aruban government. The issue is whether "Boycott Aruba" refers to anything, and whether that thing is notable or encyclopedic.

<p>This doesn't <i>feel</i> right as an article. Not sure I can verbalize it more than that, but it's.... it's not the content, it's the idea of facet of the subject having an article. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 20:16, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Feelings are usually not enough to work with, unless of course one is in love. The article on the History of Cuba does not cover this important point, and it should not be missed.</p>
<p><br />
Web sites from inside Cuba, tell of small towns in Eastern Cuba which have lost a good number of their men to these Castro promoted adventures. It is common knowledge that Castro started doing these kind of things before he was a rebel working some say for the communists, and others from the CIA to distabilize democratic elections in Colombia in 1948. About that time he also was part of the far more worthy cause the Cayo Confites effort of the "Caribbean Legion" to over throw the Dictator of the Dominican Republic Rafael Trujillo.</p>
<p><br />
Soon after victory in Cuba Castro disposed of the remnants of Camilo Cienfuegos forces by sending them on a doomed mission to the Dominican Republic (as he would do later with the "Che" in Bolivia). Castro trained, armed and sent expeditions to almost every country in Latin America, with possible but not certain exception of Mexico.</p>
<p><br />
Castro supported and still supports the Basque Separatists of ETA, the Polisario front in North Africa, he even sent tanks to Golan Heights (whether these tanks saw action is a matter of some Israel 's discuss). He provided refuge to certain IRA members, some who turned up later showing the Colombian FARC rebels how to make better bombs. He supported supplied and armed rebels in most of Central America.</p>
<p>I have heard Castro supplied so many arms to the Salvadoran Faribundo Marti group that they would leave untrained but magnificently armed rebels, on the side of volcanoes to be slaughtered by helicopters of Salvadoran Army. He sent at least one expedition to Venezuela, which caused much bloodshed. and the list goes on.</p>
<p><br />
Of course all know of Castro's support of the North Vietnamese, and the Cuban "interrogators" of US POW. My favorite account of those times is a standard press report of a Cuban vessel supplying weapons to the Sri Lankan Tamil rebels. Castro was most busy. Much of this info comes from the KGB files which are now to some extent in the public domain.</p>
<p><br />
Thus if somebody has a feeling that this is not so, then that person has much to learn. If a Castro simpathizer objects ask him about the "internationalistas," they are their heroes why be ashamed of them. Let him/her tell his/her side of the story......</p>
<p><br />
I have no objection to any label you may wish to place on the site, but one would think that placing such a label indicates a lack of ability to rebut argument. (El Jigüe, 10/7/2005)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Someone tried to do a sort of okay thing here, listing these "operations" separately rather than trying to jam them all into the paragraph towards the end of <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html#Brief_History" title="Cuba">Cuba#Brief History</a>, where this page is referenced. But the effort to properly "jam them in there" (more cleanly, of course, and with some verification) needs to be taken, or perhaps to add them to <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> (where the Angola operation, at least, is already mentioned), because these operations certainly aren't worth their own separate article yet. I suggest copying the text here onto <a href="../../../c/u/b/Talk%7ECuba_88d0.html" title="Talk:Cuba">Talk:Cuba</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/d/Talk%7EFidel_Castro_0391.html" title="Talk:Fidel Castro">Talk:Fidel Castro</a>, and letting it filter onto those pages as editors see fit. <a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 21:38, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the moment the article is a list of assertions, and is woefully under-referenced. There is one web link (that I can't get to work at the moment). The article needs tens of references. For example the sentence "<i>In Vietnam Cuban engineers help build the Ho Chi Min trail, and Cuban intelligence harshly interrogated US prisoners</i>" requires at least 2 references, one for the Ho Chi Minh trail section, one for the interrogation claim; I'd prefer more.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Nowhere in the article is the covert or overt nature of each operation identified. I can imagine that the overt operations could be verified. The covert operations would inevitably present verifiability problems that are orders of magnitude greater. In the absence of verification (i.e. at least one reference for each claim) <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 22:00, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Humbug! All you guys want is to find and excuse to delete because this reality offends you. Apparently you only read the news you like. I will put in the references, even though I am sure you will say that they are insufficient, wrong, or in the wrong format. However, when you do that remember this identifies your call name as that of a marxist radical. And provides more evidence that Wikipedia is merely a source that rewrites history to its own far leftwing agenda. (El Jigüe, 10/7/2005)</p>
<ul>
<li>Um, <i>¡viva la revolución!</i> or something.

<p>G. that article does not mention the Polisario front, Ethiopia, the Congo, Bolivia, the Chile intervention when he had a Cuban bodyguard Patricio de la Guardia kill Allende to make him a martyr, the old and new Venezuelan adventures, the support for the Macheteros in Puerto Rico,for the Montoneros, the disastrous landing in the Dominican Republic, the material and manpower support to North Vietnam, and who knows what else. Appears that the above acts are not consistent, with the conclusions reached in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Cuba_3d0d.html" title="Foreign relations of Cuba">Foreign relations of Cuba</a>&#160;; and thus one is tempted to consider that the proposed deletion of this section is merely to facilitate a single view of Castro's action that differs from objective reality. Therefore the proposed deletion is quite clearly a violation of Wikipedia guidelines (El Jigüe, 10/7/2005 ).</p>
<p><br />
I have added a historical introduction to the article, including Spy vs Spy. (El Jigüe, 10/7/2005 ).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Overly verbose, and somewhat disjointed, but those aren't reasons for deleting an article, but for cleaning it up. Also I agree that the atricle title isn't ideal. I suggest <s><b>merging</b></s> the overt activities to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Cuba_3d0d.html" title="Foreign relations of Cuba">Foreign relations of Cuba</a> and <b>moving</b> the covert activities to History of Cuban espionage which would be in keeping with the naming pattern of some of the articles in <a href="../../../e/s/p/Category%7EEspionage_fe01.html" title="Category:Espionage">Category:Espionage</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 04:37, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Cleaned up a bit and added more detail, there is an amazing amount of the stuff (El Jigüe, 10/9/2005)</p>
<ul>
<li>Since you also decided to triplicate the article by adding identical versions under History of Cuban espionage and Brief history of Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity, I'll change my vote to a simple <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 22:28, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>We have about 250 members world wide, including many artcart artists, environmentalists and art critics. We are a humorous environmental group. We were a major player in the web goes black, back in 1996 and were one of the first groups to call attention to the whole in the ozone in the 2 year period back in 73, when no one seemed to care. We were the ones with the holes in our heads then. I have looked at all the pages of those of you that want to delete the cosmic rays from this site and am surprised that none of you see the tongue in cheek humor/putdown of the psuedo-sciences. While at the same time producing some rather interesting recycled art. Here's a list of awards, articles, links and more. I am correcting the original page to fix the links... One last question, why does my name come up empty? Do I need a page on myself (the ultimate vanity) where everyone else can come in and edit?</p>

<dd><b>Reply to Alsoaswell:</b>Wikipedia is not meant to be cryptic or sarcastic, it's just an encyclopaedia, and so, in my opinion, these articles should not present this information as if this is a serious weirdo-collective. There are plenty of articles around about internet jokes etc, but they are explicit and clear in the explanation of the joke. <i>I stand by my original vote to keep</i> (and the other related articles should merge), and I strongly suggest that the author, also aswell, should change the style of writing and the content to explain what this organisation is about etc. But, so as not to mess with Wikipedia policy, this should be done after this nomination has been decided upon. With regard to the page on yourself, yes, create it, just click on your name in the upper right corner of the page (next to "My talk, Preferences..."). The structure of Wikipedia is such that these pages are created in a different directory and indexed differently to the articles etc (and attacking Wikipedia directly is not going to help you plead your case, honestly). Please read the <a href="../../../h/e/l/WP%7EHELP_d2d5.html" title="WP:HELP">help pages</a> for more info. -- <i>(the preceding two paragraphs both written by me)</i> <a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a> 11:00, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply to Quirex</b> I followed the directions at the helpless newbie page and dropped by The Welcoming Committee and picked a member who I think will help me bring the cosmic ray page into compliance along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Genius" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Genius" rel="nofollow">Sub Genius</a>. I live in New Orleans and have a lot of other things going on in my life right now so I don't have a lot of time to devote to this, but I am starting to see that I need a serious re-edit of the article. If anyone here cares to help out, please feel free to join in. I feel that I have shown enough links to show that the organization is real and respected in humor, physics, outsider artists, free speech and just plain wierdo circles.

<li><b>Abstain</b> as nominator. The accomplishments described <i>might</i> be notable enough for inclusion, and he does get some Google hits, but my suspicions were raised by the fact that the page appears to be edited several times by Geltrudi himself (or by someone who's such a fan as to take his name as a handle; also suspicious). I think there's no hard rule against a notable person writing about himself from reliable references, but it does raise doubts. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 15:38, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but clean up. I did a first pass, wikifing and doing basic formatting. But sources need to be cited and more work done. This person seems notable enough to me, but all the google hist i found were non-english pages. The automatic translations are good enough to make the page look plausible, but i dodn't trust them enough to use them as the basis for adding or revising content. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:49, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as nn commercial architect. Unverified info in article indicates Geltrudi has entered contests and exhibited his designs (not generally notable), but only actual buildings mentioned are minor commercial works. Besides, if he's not verifiable in English-language sites, does he belong in the English 'pedia? Obviously he could go in the Italian, but .. well, I don't know enough about how the diff. language versions are coordinated, if they are at all.

<li><b>Comment</b> I strongly disgree with that statement. Given that the subject is Italian, while it is <i>necessary</i> that he be notable enough for inclusion on the <i>it</i> Wiki, it is not <i>sufficient</i> as I would expect topics that would be of marginal and localized notability to be notable enough only for inclusion in certain Wikipedias.

<li><i>Disclaimer</i> -- I am not a close friend of Dr. Thinker, but I have "met" him (real-time Internet conversation) on several occasions and have helped <a href="../../../m/i/s/MiSTing_5cba.html" title="MiSTing">MiST</a> some of his works. I can attest that within the sphere of online MST3K fandom, Dr. Thinker is really pretty notable -- if I remember correctly, Web Site Number Nine (the largest archive of MiSTings on the Internet) had a classification tag for MiSTings of Dr. Thinker's work, and he was one of only about 3-5 authors to have their own classification tags. However, I am aware that every fandom is huge to itself, and I sadly doubt that his notability within that sphere really translates to notability outside it. I have to vote <b>Weak Delete</b> -- weak because I could, of course, be underestimating how notable Thinkerfics and MiSTings thereof became outside the fandom proper. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:53, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect. The article on Hubble expansion should define what the Hubble flow is, and clearly explain what the difference is. (I personally have no clue as to what the difference is, and having two articles that seem to be talking about the same thing doesn't help me or most enyone else.) If there comes a day when the article one Hubble expansion has an incredibly long section on Hubble flow, then it will merit a split into two distinct articles. Splitting prematurely, however, only leads to chaos, as multiple editors make almost the same, but conflicting/confusing edits in related artciles, resulting in a nasty mess. I've seen this far too often in the math articles; it can and should be avoided in this case. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 21:59, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b>. AFAICT, 'Hubble flow' refers to the same thing as 'Hubble expansion'. The latter term has been around for decades and is clearly standard, but the former is very new and <i>definitely not standard</i>. The two terms refer to one and the same thing (the expansion of the universe); if you're digging for a difference <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a>, I'm afraid you won't really find one. ---<a href="../../../m/p/a/User%7EMpatel_da58.html" title="User:Mpatel">Mpatel</a> <a href="../../../m/p/a/User_talk%7EMpatel_28b1.html" title="User talk:Mpatel">(talk)</a> 11:41, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hubble flow is the more commonly used term in the astronomical literature. Hubble Expansion and Hubble Flow are of course different terms for the same thing - what I said was that Hubble expansion currently redirects to Hubble's Law, and the law and the flow are not the same thing. We don't have an article at Hubble expansion, we have a redirect, so it is not correct for Hillman to say <i>there is already a fine article called <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubble_expansion.html" title="Hubble expansion">Hubble expansion</a></i>. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 12:07, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am a an academic geneticist, and I haven't heard of this guy. Every department chair at any large school will have ten titles like that (they come with big chunks of research money from the school). He published an interestingly-titled article, but that isn't significant. He is not up for a Lasker or a Nobel, and almost certainly never will be. A quick check shows that many Nobel-level geneticists are not in WP, and they should be in here before this guy is: Randy Sheckman (chair of genetics at Berkeley, cloned all the secretion genes 20 years before anyone else), Richard Palmiter (invented transgenic mice), David Anderson (caltech, isolated neural stem cells) &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. This is a vanity page.

<li>If you may apply abit of common sense here, the two page moves were of little historical value to wikipedia, and mind telling us what is the use of having List of Singapore Television Channels. staying when List of Singapore Television Channels does not? Are we expecting lots of people to type "List of Singapore Television Channels." (with the dot) when searching for this article? The only so called "links" to this article is from another re-direct page, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_television_channels.html" title="Singapore television channels">Singapore television channels</a>, the later of which is only linked to talk pages, templates, and so forth.

<p><b>Comment</b> I have no idea if this is true or not, but I can not find anything that verifies that such a thing exists as in the article.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, pending factuality. "Love Rug" "Hung Dynasty" gives no Googles, while shoving beaver into the mix gets synonyms for <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">vagina</a>. Fascinating stuff.

<p><br />
I'm the original author of <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low-power.html" title="Low-power">low-power</a>, so I'm not exactly unbiased, so I don't expect you to count my vote to <b>keep</b>. I personally think it is a very interesting and counter-intuitive idea that "whispering" may be better at communicating than "shouting". (I wish I could remember that nice "whispering vs. shouting" article I read about it, comparing low-power spread spectrum meshes over high-power tall broadcast towers ... Ah, I think it's the one mentioned by <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/22/2346239&amp;tid=193&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=103&amp;tid=17" class="external autonumber" title="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/22/2346239&amp;tid=193&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=103&amp;tid=17" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Similar ideas are expressed elsewhere <a href="http://www.decodesystems.com/mt/97feb/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.decodesystems.com/mt/97feb/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1496446,00.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1496446,00.asp" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://www.cioinsight.com/print_article/0,3668,a=38467,00.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cioinsight.com/print_article/0,3668,a=38467,00.asp" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="http://logicerror.com/openSpectrum" class="external autonumber" title="http://logicerror.com/openSpectrum" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> <a href="http://www.lightreading.com/boards/message.asp?msg_id=110196" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lightreading.com/boards/message.asp?msg_id=110196" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> ). I hoped that people would expand the low-power article to talk more about that idea. (The name "<a href="../../../l/o/w/Low-power_communication_device.html" title="Low-power communication device">Low-power communication device</a>" *sounds* like it might be more appropriate for that sort of talk, but the content seems to be about a legal term that only applies to one specific frequency band, not about low-power communication in general). You may be right -- it might work better as a disambiguation page between the two very different meanings of that phrase. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCary_1a42.html" title="User:DavidCary">DavidCary</a> 19:48, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Previously this article was also nominated for removal, which was saved by the MuggleNet fans themselves by voting in favour of keeping the article. Apparantly MuggleNet had posted this link to vote in their favour on CoS forum [MuggleNet's official Forum]. This was a serious bias decision as majority of voters were MuggleNet fans redirected from the Forums and they had no idea what they were voting for or What Wiki is really about. The previous Nomination for Deletion page can be found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_MuggleNet_8d58.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MuggleNet">here</a>.</p>
<p>An Excerpt from previous nomination which proves MN's intentions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As harry potter fandom is one of the biggest in the world and mugglenet is the most popular fansite within it, Mugglenet should be kept but definitely expanded. It has a rich history in the fandom and <b>it's inclusion in this article would greatly expand it</b> &lt;--- See! They want MuggleNet to expand by including it on Wiki. Now tell me, is it ok for sites to make pages of their own to gain hits for their sites? Isn't this Vandalism?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's not. To be <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>, it has to make a "deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia". If it's simply promotional, it's wrong. But not vandalism.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 14:14, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also MuggleNet is really cautious of not letting this article to be deleted. If MuggleNet is notable enough and worthy enough to be included in Wiki, why is MuggleNet trying so hard to save this article from deletion? Why are majority of voters from MuggleNet who vote in favour of keeping MuggleNet on Wiki? It is time that this has to stop! And the time is now. Lets make Wiki the best encyclopedia in the world, not a advertising campaign/dictionary.</p>
<p>And now, speaking of whats left of that big article now is this: Emerson made this site [it was a different layout not the current one] when he was 12. So what? There are loads of people who make sites at the age of 12. How will this information justify its existence in an Encyclopedia? Ask majority of the people in the world, take a survey. Do they know MuggleNet? I agreee they know JK Rowling and Harry Potter, but MuggleNet? What is MuggleNet?</p>
<p>2nd point: He met JK Rowling once. So? Many fans met JK Rowling. Its not like they are having telephone conversations everyday. And even if he knows JK Rowling like a friend, so what? If you say include this article because he know JK Rowling then I suggest you also put up articles on JK Rowlings husband, her family, her friends, her children. Is this justified. Surely not. --<a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajdumbledore_a3e2.html" title="User:Rajdumbledore">Raj Dumbledore</a> 05:10, 05 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It was AfD before and survived.

It's hard to understand how a AfD notice, his last edit, can be minor. Also I notice that on <a href="../../../r/a/j/User_talk%7ERajdumbledore_d209.html" title="User talk:Rajdumbledore">User talk:Rajdumbledore</a> he has created his own Harry Potter sites and that makes it appear as if he has some other motive than a legitimate AfD.

<ul>
<li><s><b>Abstain</b></s>, but consider this. Deletions must be based on the here-and-now, not the past. What is MuggleNet's status <b>right at this moment</b>, never mind the past AFDs? Is it, in fact, an inherently notable site on its own merits (number of users, importance to the fandom, etc). I'd go as far as to suggest that those who voted for and against in the previous AFD abstain from vothing this time, since this sort of thing is biased.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>: this is really unclear, and the lengthy spiel above is badly formatted and almost illegible, but it would appear that this is a bad faith nomination by the creator of one or more rival Harry Potter fan-sites: the fact that the nominator has made so many confusing edits to the article, all marked as "minor" but removing apparently-siginificant information, does not help matters. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_MuggleNet_8d58.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MuggleNet">previous nomination</a> resulted in a resounding <b>keep</b> despite being formatted almost to death.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a remarkably notable site. I've never read any of the books, but even I have heard of it. I heard an interview with Rowling once where she said that she used Mugglenet regularly to check her own continuity. If that isn't notibility, I'm not sure what is. Also, in response to this: "<i>Ask majority of the people in the world, take a survey. Do they know MuggleNet?</i>", if that was the standard for deletion, Wikipedia would be very small, not to mention useless. -- <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlutor_2e6a.html" title="User:Plutor">Plutor</a> 17:22, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, I am fed up of these constant votes for deletion, and this is actually the 3rd not the 2nd. Please can the people take a hint that it should NOT be dleeted? It is worthy of the Wiki article because it is an essential part of Harry Potter fandom.

<li><b>Delete</b> An essential part of Harry Potter fandom? As decided by who and what? The guidelines for Wikipedia, which tend towards the non-notiable classification, or the people who frequent Mugglenet...who have already established a bias towards keeping it even if nobody but their rather small community considers it worthwhile. Wikipedia is not supposed to be about personal biases, that's why their are guidelines and classifications for what does and does not go here. Now, I'm not saying that my recommendation of <b>Delete</b> is automatically correct, or that all others MUST vote for <b>Delete</b> as well. All I ask is that people look through the guidelines for content and make their own decisions rather than be swayed by situations like the LAST time, where Mugglenet forum members swarmed over here to vote for <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 20:32, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While this forum may not be "essential" to anything, it has enough of a fanbase and outreach to make it noteworthy. If this is up for deletion than we should put <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.html" title="Fark">Fark</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> up with it. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragoonmac_a999.html" title="User:Dragoonmac">Makenji-san</a> 22:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (If Speedy Keep fails.) Esp. if they get the 6 million hits a month they claim. Even if not, it's clearly legit, I checked Rowling's official site, and mugglenet is the 2nd of 4 or 5 fansites listed, and she has this to say: "It's high time I paid homage to the mighty MuggleNet. Where to start? I love the design, (I currently favour the 'Dementor' layout), the polls (I actually voted in the 'Who's the Half-Blood Prince?' one) the pretty-much-exhaustive information on all books and films, the wonderful editorials (more insight there than in several companion volumes I shall not name), 101 Ways to Annoy Lord Voldemort (made me laugh aloud) &lt;snip&gt;". Not that Rowling's praise makes it notable, but it does prove its a well-recognized fansite of an <i>enormously</i> popular series. And no, I'm not a sockpuppet, I've not read a word of those books. &lt;smile&gt; <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 14:14, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I know enough people from a diverse social situations who know about Mugglenet. Just the other night Mugglenet came up in a non-Harry Potter related meeting I was at. Oh - and the majority of people in the world don't know about the vast majority of things on Wikipedia. And if you look at the people voting keep on this page, you'll see we aren't just "fans of the site".

<dd>One thought: isn't it the purpose of an encyclopedia to inform you of things that you <i>don't</i> know about? If all the information on Wikipedia was stuff we knew about, then what would be the point? I run across obscure words, references and URLs all the time.

<dd>But I didn't know about Mugglenet until I saw the AfD. An encyclopedia can't guess what everybody knows. It has to include as much as it can. Insofar as it's of some importance.

<li>I respectfully disagree with <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a>. John Hughes surely knew this school when he was growing up and has used a number of schools in the area as locations for his films. The fact that he chose Niles North as a filming location shows that its atmosphere fits into a certain idealized type of midwestern "upper middle class" high school. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 05:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You see - it was in the movie precisely because it was not notable - because it was just like every other midwestern "upper middle class" school out there.

<ul>
<li>No, I don't see, and I still think you are wrong. Information that a film was made at a location also belongs in the article for that location can make that location notable. The school was in the movie due to having a certain look -- being a quinessential example of such a school-- and being in a certain location. I doubt that Hughes sent out a team to look for this location, given where the school is he almost certainly was familiar with it from his personal life. Furthermore, assuming the information were added to the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixteen_Candles_5b12.html" title="Sixteen Candles">Sixteen Candles</a> page, wouldn't it be more elegant to mention the school and then link to an article with more information about it (location, info on architecture, etc.) than it would to put all of that in the Sixteen Candles article? That <i>is</i> what hyperlinks are for, after all. Especially since the article currently has no information about where any of the scenes were filmed. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 12:27, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The demands for "notablity" of schools (not a valid criteria for deletion of schools in the first place) by deletionists are getting increasingly baffling and incomprehensible. This school was used in a major motion picture, front page of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> and already has some listed notable alumni. The fact that this school has these clearly <b>notable</b> events in it's history just goes to demonstrate how pointless it is to argue "notability" with deletionists in the first place. This institution is inherently notable anyway - waiting for deletionists to subjectively call out the particular instances of notable events and then argue about them is just a waste of time; after all, we have so much to do voting to <b>keep</b> on other school articles!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May I perhaps add my two cents about this matter? Although it is certainly trivial knowledge, adding that information just to the sixteen candles articles is a disservice. Consider the following situation. I'm researching, say, facts about schools in this school system. I may not have the wherewithal to search and look at all the hits, I may just look for articles on each of the schools. In this case, having the article serves a purpose. Sure, its not much of a purpose, but in the case of things like schools (who are not here trying to get hits or sales), as far as I'm concerned, any reason is a reason to keep. What's the harm?

<li>This is not consensus - in fact its obvious there is no consensus. Until both sides agree to do something with these terrible "articles" this debate will continue every day here. I already suggested making school district articles and moving it there instead, but the <i>keep all schools</i> side does not agree, so instead we have this - every day. At least on the keep side things have degenerated to cut n' pasted arguments - give me something about the particular article that makes it noteworthy, not a <i>keep all schools</i> argument please. Oh, and comments like "Nominating schools is a waste of everyone's time" is just going to make things worse.

<li>What is obvious is that 85%-90% of school articles nominated to VfD/AfD this year are not deleted. 85% not deleted over the course of a year sure sounds like a concensus to me. It may not be a concensus to keep or a concensus to delete, but it is a concensus about something.

<li>We are voting here based on the encyclopedic nature of this article and its non-notability. As for the album, supposively its by a band thats notable. However, the argument is simply not valid because nothing is inheritly notable - that's why we're here. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 09:02, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's relevent because the band (community) is notable enough to warrant an article. Those with a deep interest in the band (community) wish to delve into the subject by reading about individual albums (schools). They feel that the album (school) is an inherent component of the band (community). Information on every album (school) would clogg up the larger article about the band (community). Plus not all those reading about the band (community) care about every album (school). But the dozens (hundreds or thousands) of people who bought the album (graduated the school) would have great interest in the album (school). Therefore the notability of the band (community) means that every album (school) should also be kept. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:39, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's kind of a fractured analogy. If every album ever published got an article, it might be apt, but they don't. The inclusionists want every school to have an article though, no matter how insignificant and ordinary. As it stands now, some album articles get kept, others get deleted.

<li>See #Keep, but briefly, as I understand the arguments, schools are <i>public institutions</i> essential to <i>communities</i> and masses of individuals in their formative years. They are generally <i>fixed in location</i>, and often have <i>long histories</i>. They are likely each to attract substantial <i>communities of interest</i> to WP. I don't firmly agree with these points, but I see some value. My high school, for example, was founded in 1970, with an average class size of 1,000 people. It serves a city of 70,000, each citizen likely to know it. It is known across the entire US state, and well-known by adjacent towns, such that I estimate at least 350,000 people know of it and have reason to search for it. In my state, my school <i>is</i> (or was) average (ie. I looked up class size and campus size when enrolled there, and it was in the middle.) 350,000 potential searchers is good enough, arguably. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:27, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do <b>firmly believe</b>, however, that these arguments absolutely distinguish schools from boxes, gyms, bars, factories, and all the other general categories to which the are compared by some here. Generally, most students have at least some interest in their school (if only because they are stuck there in young life when they would rather be outside), and I <i>know</i> most parents have an interest in their children's school. The aggregate community attachment to these places, in my experience, far exceeds community concern for other "buildings," as schools are called here in dimunition by some. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:34, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It was sarcastic a bit but it was certainly not an insult (far from it). The whole point of it is a criticism of your and other arguments that are arguments about the type of article it is rather then the article itself. I apoligize if you were offended though&#160;:).

<dd>It's true that this is an argument by type. However, for school-supporters, schools are like real towns (which have become notable ipso facto based on an argument by type.) I know that this is controversial, and I don't even know whether or not I agree with it. However, it is, in my view, a <i>reasonable argument to make</i>, and I am slightly frustrated with school-opponents, who I do feel sometimes unduly belittle these arguments from others.</dd>
<dd>The reason I will always vote keep for any real high school is that I recognize at least ~30% of our committed editors enjoy these articles, and embrace a reasonable position to explain their notability. In such a circumstance, with WP operating as a consensus forum, I believe any attempt to delete real high schools is less than useful. It doesn't mean anyone is wrong to so nominate; it doesn't mean their arguments are wrong either. But, in a consensus forum, when a static position of "Let's-agree-to-disagree" is reached, the default is (and should be) to keep. I believe we have reached such a stasis, and I will continue to vote, by type, a default keep on real high schools as a method of conveying my belief in this stasis and the relatively low utility of further dispute. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 13:56, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that those arguments could be applied to any local fast-food place for example - and those kind of articles get purged here easily. Having seperate school articles is a lot like having a seperate article for each mcdonalds outlet - sure a lot of people have worked there - maybe even shaped their lives, so to speak - they have served thousands of people, I'm sure. It sure isn't encyclopedic though, much like most of these school articles. As I've said before there are hundreds of these substubs - all the same, just citing the year and principal of the school - nothing worthwhile about most of them. No parent is going to go here for school information because it will at the very least always be outdated and inaccurate, especially now due to the proliferation of these substubs. More morbidly, if you were to make an article about a teacher at one of these schools it would get speedied quite quickly. Deleting a school is good because it encourages someone to write a better article - as if someone was really to rewrite this they would not use any of the current content most likely. Finally, I can almost garuntee you no one "enjoys" articles like this because there is no real information here - plus its just a line... a line&#160;:). Giving an opinion of a carte blanche keep based on type of these kind of articles is doing much more harm than good because its discouraging useful debate (heated as it may be), giving people the OK sign to write substubs of just about anything with no real information, and in general encourages article creation without any real encyclopedic content. Of course, I could be wrong on all this&#160;:). <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 14:47, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If one could get ~30%+ of committed WPians (after extended debate like we've had on schools for a long time) to agree in general that every McD's is notable, or that Xoloz' nosehair is notable, it would be worthy of inclusion here under my argument (notwithstanding even my own assessment of my nosehair as useless). WPians decide what belongs in WP, and the system exists with a (admirable, IMO) bias that anything with substantial support stays. That is a consequence of the non-majoritarian nature of the process. It is also a geneal guideline not to delete, <i>but to expand</i> when an article on a noteworthy topic is poorly written. I see no reason this guideline is inapplicable to schools, although they be numerous. And lastly, it is, in my view, unknown whether a poor stub or a blank page is more like to motivate a visitor to write a quality article. Some less experienced WPians simply have a "page-creation phobia," but are not afraid to <b>cleanup and expand</b>; I know I was once one of these newbies.&#160;:) <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:08, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Frankly, I don't see why not, if a neutral, factual and verifiable article can be written. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 00:10, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And there in a nutshell is the problem. While these articles may be neutral, and they may contain verifiable information, they are pretty much lacking in facts. Sadly, most of these articles will probably never contain more than a probably fairly soon out-of-date principal's name, and the school colors. Anyone coming to the article for some actual information about the school is likely to go away sorely dissatisfied. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:16, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hoax or fiction. This was tagged for speedy delte, but IMO does not qualify. (Hoaxes are not a speedy criterion). There does seem to be a Paul Pattywho is a political figure in austrialia, If I have read a quick google scan correctly. But this isn't that person, although it may be satire. There are no google hits on "United Immigrants of Australia", and the only ones which are on "Paul Patty" + "United Immigrants" seem to be the sites liste at the end of this articel, all on fre host providers, and all looking very much like hoaxes or jokes. <b>Delete</b> unless reliable adn verifiabel sources are cited that this is a real person. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:25, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As a member of the wikipedia community I find the above statement unnacceptable as it does not pertain to wikipedia's high standard of spelling and grammar.

<p>The above is a most accurate account of the wonderful, exciting, and highly relelvant life of Dr. Patty. Dr. Patty is known as an inspiration to young teens throughout Australia, his deeds and great accomplishments are the reason for this. To even think that this wonderful account of Dr. Patty's life was to be deleted is proposturous. I for one, believe that this recount should not only be kept, but be immortalised for ever.</p>
<p>Habib the Pizzaman's thoughts</p>
<p>As a young boy growing up in Syria, life was very hard for me. From the age of 3 I regularly worked 17 hour days in my father's sweatshop, and I was one of the luckier ones. In 1947, my father sold his sweatshop to pay for an economy air ticket to Australia, which he gave to me on my birthday. Soon after, I left Syria, and I have never seen my parents since (by the way mum and dad if you are reading this, i say "Hello"). I wandered the streets of Melbourne for a year, although I never did come within 13km of the CBD - you must remember that I had no way of travelling from the airport except on foot.</p>
<p>It was with a flame in my heart that I heard of Paul Patty, the man who would later become the great political figure Dr Patty, and his role in the Brisbane Massacre. I began to believe (as did many others in the ethnic community) that I was actually worth something, and that there was someone who was prepared to stand up and fight for our common cause. So it was with cries of "Wogs, Lebs, Chongs, I-ties, Frogs, and anyone else of ethnic origin, let us unite!" that we marched upon Melbourne's CBD, inspired by the great Paul Patty and the Brisbane Massacre. However, from there nothing further happened for many years.</p>
<p>When the great Patty visited Melbourne with his cousins of the same name, he began to sow the seed amongst the marginalised and oppressed. Whilst not an active member of the United Immigrants party, I supported their views, and had decided to vote for them if a member stood for election in my electorate. I had also agreed to make pizzas for them at any party functions if they so desired.</p>
<p>I served as an NCO in Vietnam under Patty, and this further strengthened my conviction that he would one day be the voice of the oppressed ethnic community. After returning from Vietnam, I lost contact with Patty for some years, during which I established my now flourishing Pizza shop (which in fact gave the creators of SBS's 'Pizza' their idea).</p>
<p>In 1976, after the re-establishment of United Immigrants, I became the fourth most senior member of the Victorian branch of the party (after the three Asians Patty's cousin had met in a cab). Now I am an active member of the ethnic community, with such incentive schemes at my pizza shop as "Habib's Pizza - Ethnic Tuesday, all ethnics can buy one get one free" or "Present your ethnic passport for free garlic bread". That somebody accuses Patty of being a hoax is deeply insulting, because he rescued me from a life wandering the streets of Melbourne. It is a slur - a reflection of the cynicism of society today - that my friend and saviour, The Right Honourable Lord and Despot Hellenic Patriot 'Bane of the Communist Party' 'Scourge of the Working Class' Dr. Prof. Paul 'The Jackal' Patty PhD, AATP, NRMA, HIH, RER, RATP, TAB, SNCF, AC/DC, KFC, ADHD, ADD, RSPCA, USSR, ASIC, CCCP, ACCC, ATSIC, ACGS, PM, MP, ALP, ONP, AMP, JC, JP, DFAT, MoD, UK, OHP, PC, ICUP, QTC, QUT, NKVD, AIS, NYPD, LAPD, PCYC, YMCA, QPAC, QTIX, UQ, QUT, ACU, ADP, GDP, ADF, QLD - Leader and Founder of the United Immigrants, could be questioned as to the validity of his life story, because for the most of it, I was there with him.</p>
<p>Habib</p>
<p>By the way don't forget that Tuesdays are Ethnic Tuesdays, and, if you can prove you have read this document, you may have a free pizza to go with a 2L coke.</p>
<p><br />
I think ignorance is the cause of this movement to delete the honourable Paul Patty's page. I am an Australian and know very well the accomplishments, or lack there of, of Paul Patty, co-founder of the United Immigrants Party. This is an outrage, conjured by unintelligent people who obviously have no knowledge of syntax or correct spelling amongst other things, namely Australian history. Paul Patty is an Australian icon, the Che Guevara of Australian time. [Australian Citizen - K. Henderson]</p>

<li>World War II actually happened...does that make it acceptable to joke about it? If you read the definition closely, it talked about the term being used in "underground circies."

<li>Raspustin, to be perfectly honest, im offended by your statement. JFK was a good man and you feel the need to mock the highest elected official in the land?

<p>This is quite a useful article to have, but has been created as an excuse to mock bands that one Wiki user doesn't like. The list of bands at the end is a joke and contains mostly bands that the term doesn’t apply to.</p>
<p>For a start ‘Pop Core’ isn’t a genre as such, it’s an adjective used to tag bands in a similar way to the modern usage of emo. It refers to rock bands that have either been ‘created’ by larger record companies to fill gaps in their portfolios (esp. in the early 00’s such as Lost Prophets) or to bands that had image makeovers to make them look more rock. I’ve heard it used to describe acts that contain former members of pop acts too (such as Charlie from Busted’s new rock band Fightstar).</p>
<p>I’d keep it but overhaul it – I might have a go later on. Nli10 09:54, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the list of bands at the end needs to be culled. It's quite obvious it was made just to spite bands this article's creator didn't like (I'm not a fan of As I Lay Dying, but they're certainly nothing near "popcore," and they sound nothing like other bands on the list, such as Chevelle, which also shouldn't qualify as popcore). -- <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirveaux_8682.html" title="User:Sirveaux">User:Sirveaux</a> 11:53, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>What do you mean record companies "created" Lostprophets?! There was a rumour about them being a manufactured band when they first started making it big, but as someone who lives pretty close to where all the band members grew up, I can vouch that those rumours where complete b.s. Look at the article on the band for more info on all that stuff.
<p>And I vote <b>Delete</b>. The title's subjective, and this information is covered much more extensively and neutrally in the article on <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_Century_Emo_6db8.html" title="21st Century Emo">21st Century Emo</a>. --<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.4.224.6.html" title="User:80.4.224.6">80.4.224.6</a> 15:44, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>I think the title is better than <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_century_emo.html" title="21st century emo">21st century emo</a>, simply because the latter implies that this music is emo, and it isn't. However, the bands listed in pop-hardcore need to be changed.
<dl>
<dd>Ie: Alkaline Trio is punk (earlier stuff), pop-punk (later stuff)</dd>
<dd>Sugarcult, Yellowcard, Simpleplan, AAR, My Chemical Romance, are ALL pop-punk</dd>
<dd>Thrice, Thursday are post-hardcore</dd>
<dd>Coheed And Cambria are prog rock.</dd>
<dd>The bands i agree as being popcore: Hawthrone Heights, Sutterfly --Web250 16:55, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>ok, so maybe the band list at the bottom isn't the most accurate, and many of these bands fall under other genre names. i would still like to keep this page, and just edit it down heavily to include bands that are directly pop-core.. ie The Movielife, Saves The Day and so on. --68.171.62.215 01:33, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It doesn't make a damn bit of difference what a small handful of people feel "emo" is. If the world considers a band to be "emo", then they're "emo", right or wrong. It's not up to us to make the decision, and it's not up to us to create some genre to throw the bands we don't think are "emo". Popular culture decides, and they have. Our job on Wiki is to portray reality, not dictate it. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisB_74d2.html" title="User talk:ChrisB">ChrisB</a> 07:35, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Web comics are judged much too leniently on AFD, and web comic authors should meet a higher standard for inclusion than the strips. When an article on a webcomic guest-author has absolutely nothing encyclopedic to say about the subject other than "he guest-authored 9 webcomic strips" then that is not sufficient to support an individual bio page. Mention him on the page for the webcomic, and wait until there is something more to say about the author to give him his own bio. It's really pretty stunning--nearly the entire article is about the strip. The only thing it says about Petrone is that he's from Philly. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 04:14, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Content is not notable enough to have its own article; very few actually refer to a "tenth" crusade. The metaphor of crusades has been used by bin Laden and other extreme Islamists to describe US presence in the Middle East for a long time; it is not a rhetorical device invented by Bush as the article claims. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 18:13, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tag for cleanup and <b>Keep</b> - 1,250 google hits suggests notability. Plus, as C. Sloat says above, many Muslims do think that Bush is engaged in a crusade. To delete the page because 'we know that he isn't' is reverse political correctness. And with respect, the article does not say that Bush invented the device, only that he used it. If bin Laden was using the term first, the fact should be added to the article but it doesn't present an argument for deleting the page, quite the contrary. I agree that 10<sup>th</sup> is arbitrary, but the reason for the name is less important than the fact that the name is widely used. Perhaps the concept is misnamed, but it doesn't mean that the page is not correctly named or shouldn't exist.

<dd>Correction - many of those references are to Wikipedia; many others are to other uses of the phrase (e.g. the 1983 novel -- some 400+ hits on your results alone -- or the 2001 article about English in Tunisia). A lexis/nexis search of major papers finds three uses of the phrase, listed below, none of which are in the usage here:

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A search of magazines and journals nets nothing on lexis/nexis. You're looking at a few hundred google hits at best, most of them referring to or just copying the Cockburn and O'Brien articles; those are the only two real voices using this particular phrase in this manner; I would not call it notable, especially given its nonexistence in lexis/nexis, a better gauge of material that is actually published. If the article is kept, it should be radically revamped and its name changed to talk about the "crusades" metaphor as used in general rather than the specious "tenth" crusade, which, as others noted, this is not really the tenth anyway.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 03:34, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For the hell of it, I searched the New York Times back to 1857 for this term and found three uses of it; twice in 1904 and once in 1917 referring to the actual Crusades, specifically the battle in Jerusalem. The 1904 references refer to a novel of the era by Frederic Harrison called <i>Theophano</i>.-<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 03:39, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"tenth crusade" bush is 404 hits. -cockburn is still 231 hits, not that I see why cockburn should be excluded. As above, I'm not attached to the title so much as the concept. "bush crusade" gets 37,400 hits. "bush crusade" iraq gets 31,300 hits. There's a real concept here, perhaps the current page is misnamed and a mess, but I think there's something worth keeping?

<dd>I agree that the concept is notable but the title is a misleading neologism. There already was a tenth crusade, and it wasn't this one.

<dd>Well, I like it better than Bush Crusade, though that's not saying much. I'd prefer to somehow have "The crusade" rather than "The Crusades" because I think the whole War on Whatever is a single thing, even if the connections between the parts are pretty tenuous sometimes. We did for a while have a page called <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade_%28modern%29.html" title="Crusade (modern)">Crusade (modern)</a> which is now a redirect to <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenth_Crusade_8207.html" title="Tenth Crusade">Tenth Crusade</a>. If we wanted to go that way, I'd prefer Modern crusade. Other options which I also don't like but am going to suggest in case it gives anybody a better idea are Crusade against terror, Crusade against terrorism or War on terrorism as crusade?

<li><b>Delete</b> The article lists him as an extra in one film. The IMDB entry for that film doesn't list him, so this is unverifiable. If this is removed, there is no content at all.

<li>Due to the poor grammar, that quote you present <i>out of context</i> does indeed seem to make no sense, however you should read the sentence immediately preceding it: <i>The holiday</i> [Valloween] <i>makes for great costuming ideas which are explored at parties held twice a year!</i> The following sentence, then, is clearly just a list of some costumes that people might wear, as this is a combination of Halloween and Valentines.

<p>Let us consider the notoriety of this topic.

<li><b>Keep</b> Or <b>Do Not Merge</b> If this article wasn't related to the encyclopedic <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> article then I would agree with you, but since it is I'm voting keep. The forum's influence on YTMND cannot be denied and the forum's history is too detailed to be included in the main article. Further, Wikipedia admins and mods basically said that YTMND forum history and information has no place in the main YTMND article. NOTE #1: I am not a YTMND forums user. NOTE #2: I created the YTMND forums article by culling the admin/mod deleted forum history material from the YTMND article and pasting it there. I don't know enough about the forums to do anything else really besides fight vandalism on that article. I'm just a lone YTMND editor who strongly believes that the YTMND forum users need their own article. Not only does it keep the YTMND article clean, but it also documents an important part of an important pop culture artifact.<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelerityfm_dc3c.html" title="User:Celerityfm">Celerityfm</a> 19:15, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
