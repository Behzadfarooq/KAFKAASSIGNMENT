<li><b>Keep</b> per media coverage and being somewhat widely known among critical sites. Also, the article, the AfDs, and the countless public debates have, over time, given me a profound zen revelation: We're All (speaking now of both us and them) Wasting Time. It's <i>got</i> to count. Perhaps by keeping this article Wikipedia can contribute to our implied mission of enrichening human minds and knowledge. Because life is too short for people to truly know anything. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 20:28, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia as realized, as opposed to idealized, is an essentially farcical undertaking.

<li>Hmm. Wouldn't go as far as saying farcical.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The "speedy" that erased this page declared it failed "WP:WEB." However, "WP:WEB" is not a criteria for speedy deletion. The majority of negative commentators on it's overturning simply said they didn't like the site because it was negative, or because it was (they asserted) created by a banned user. However, like them or hate them, whether they were started by a banned user or by Jesus Christ, the fact remains that killing the messenger doesn't change the message. The bottom line is that Wikitruth meets all criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia. One of Wikitrith's largest criticisms of Wikipedia is that pages can (and very often are) deleted without warning and leaving no trace, despite the GFDL. Speedy-deleting the Wikitruth entry on Wikipedia does not delete their criticism, it <b>validates</b> it. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Websites that fail to assert notability per WP:WEB <i>are</i> subject to CSD A7 these days. However, this was introduced very recently and applying it to <i>old</i> articles with considerable history and would likely to cause debate if unilaterally removed is iffy at best, dubious at worst. CSD is primarily intended to remove <i>new</i> articles in case where it's <i>entirely</i> uncontroversial (as in "every user should know that it doesn't help to <i>create</i> articles that fail CSD, because those get deleted"). If there's even tad bit of possibility the site is at all notable, it's an AfD case. I wouldn't go enforcing the "new" A7 on old articles unless it's extremely clear-cut and there's not been significant improvement since creation. This article <i>clearly</i> isn't an open-and-shut case and it should be AfD'd. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 22:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ted Wilkes claimed to have much legal knowledge and used this knowledge in his mud-throwing campaign against arbcom member Fred Bauder. Wilkes, who plumed himself on being one of the best and most active contributors to Wikipedia, was blocked by arbcom ruling on 19 March 2006 for one year. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ted_Wilkes#Blocked_per_arbcom_ruling" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ted_Wilkes#Blocked_per_arbcom_ruling" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Is it just mere coincidence that Wikitruth was started shortly after that date, on 20 March 2006? His alias NightCrawler had much trouble with administrator <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a>, ironically wishing Angie "WikiLove," etc. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Angela/Archive1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1751029" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Angela/Archive1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1751029" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/NightCrawler" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/NightCrawler" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Significantly, Angela Beesley is attacked on the Wikitruth pages. Furthermore, administrator FCYTravis is one of Wikitruth's whipping boys, perhaps because Ted Wilkes had some trouble with this administrator on the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENick_Adams_3fe6.html" title="Talk:Nick Adams">Talk:Nick Adams</a> page. See, for instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nick_Adams#Rumors.2C_gossip_or_speculation_contravene_official_Wikipedia_policy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nick_Adams#Rumors.2C_gossip_or_speculation_contravene_official_Wikipedia_policy" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Wikitruth also frequently claims that too many vandals and trolls "game the system" on Wikipedia. Is it just by chance that Wilkes and his supporter <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">User:Wyss</a> frequently accused user Onefortyone of gaming the system, being a troll, the "most dangerous vandal", etc., falsely claiming that this user's edits were fabricated, unfounded, or unwarranted and therefore must be removed.

<dd>As usual, this depends on how we read multiple and non-trivial. Orlowski's piece is merely repeating the arguments he made on the Reg for the benefit of the sandal-wearing lentil-eating Grauniad readers. Wikitruth is merely a hook on which to hang this (and if you get paid by the word, it's a pretty good idea to recycle earlier work). Ebiz just regurgitates Orlowski, so that can't qualify towards multiple. The Village Voice piece is independent, and presumably non-trivial, and an unbalanced rant into the bargain. No doubt you see this as meeting WP:WEB's requirements, but I don't. So we disagree, no surprise there. However, the impossibility of this ever being NPOV means that we'll be back here again, after a decent interval, repeating exactly the same arguments. "Avoid writing or editing articles about [Wikipedia], since we all find objectivity especially difficult when we ourselves are concerned."

<dd>Tawker, I think that speedy deleting it, speedy deleting the redirects, salting the article, and especially speedy deleting the talk page and then remaining silent about it on wiki until it was restored really hurt this AFD. Before you did that, not that many people were paying attention to the artcle and then suddenly the news of what you did spread everywhere and lots of people came to vote to keep it. So the actions hurt your cause and you would have done better by AFDing it through process.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 11:31, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Besides, the history and discussion pages are quite active and this article is listed in the category "Wikipedia critics". But maybe this category has to go too.
