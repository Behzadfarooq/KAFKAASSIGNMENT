<li>Your last sentence is mildly derogatory, and is not necessary. In response, I will reiterate that you are proving my point that you are focusing only on the external link / spam issue, which is obviously an issue near and dear to you, but only peripheral to the current article, to which you've nonetheless recommended a complete deletion rather than suggestions for changing its content. It also seems you've brought along other like-minded editors (I might be wrong, but you posted the afd <i>twelve hours</i> after article creation, then the next two delete votes by familiar editors follwed, the first (pjacobi) within 3 minutes, and the next (ptkfgs) within 21 minutes) from the previous debates. Also continued to be ignored by the current discussion are the contents of the article's talk page which were available before you made the afd. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 11:25, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Despite the comments of the above, this article is trying to avoid that counterproductive almost-flamewar to which the above two editors are frequent contributors. As a case in point, see their delimitation of the discussion to the presence of external links, which is not the primary motivation for this article. In contrast, justification for the current article was in article talk (and ignored in the above comments), as both <a href="../../../s/t/a/Portal%7EStar_Trek_960a.html" title="Portal:Star Trek">Portal:Star Trek</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_further_reading_319e.html" title="Star Trek further reading">Star Trek further reading</a> exist (i.e. analogous articles for a fictional universe with an extended storyline and fanbase across various media), along the same parameters as this article. Any justification for deletion should take these articles, as well as others in to account. Thank you. As a further note, there is the WP-wide issue of statute vs. precedence, and the above editors seem biased toward statute.--<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 09:16, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>If the concern is duplicate links, these could be offloaded from an borderline-long parent article. Note that many of the categories are not redundant between the two articles. Further the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Experience_b649.html" title="Lost Experience">Lost Experience</a> links are not duplicated in the main article. Also the presence of the navigation is analogous with the use of one in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> main article. I am trying to follow precedence of similar extant articles, and any constructive suggestions along those lines would be welcomed, and immediately implemented. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 09:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Due to the existing pool of already-opinionated editors from both sides, I'd informally like to solicit commentary from long-time WP editors who frequent AFD pages, but are not previously invested in issues closely related to this article (Lost). Or, if someone could take the initiative as the vote goes on to identify which voting editors have already been involved in the issues related to Lost articles, and those who have not.--<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 09:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I always begin assuming good faith. This assumption can change based on evidence, for example through comments I have seen of some editors in articles talks, such as yourself: 1) focusing on external links almost exclusively in this afd with "strong delete" with no reference to the article as a whole until this strange emphasis was explicitly questioned; 2) other misinformation as well as comments that have been construed by <i>other</i> editors as a vendetta in other talks such as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lostpedia_%28second_nomination%29_de88.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lostpedia (second nomination)">the Lostpedia afd</a> (see also the deletion review/DRV linked at the top of that page), are the reasons I have overturned my opening assumption of good faith. In other words, your own past comments subjectively suggest to me that the issue of Lostpedia has strongly affected the severity of your comments on this article. Also, based on your past comments, I further suggest that your posting of the obvious ( <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> ) was possibly intended as derogatory toward me as well. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 01:36, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to ask that you please <i>drop</i> the talk of "vendetta", which borders on a personal attack. Again, equating disagreement with "vendetta" is misguided and dismissive of everyone's right to a respectful dialog here. You take the interesting logical leap of saying that because I've commented in the past about how I feel that a link to Lostpedia (a site I happen to enjoy quite a bit) is wrong for Wikipedia, I'm somehow part of a vendetta, and that my comments must be derogatory and/or in bad faith. Disagreement does not equate to derogatory either. So please dial it back. Thanks, <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 04:49, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
