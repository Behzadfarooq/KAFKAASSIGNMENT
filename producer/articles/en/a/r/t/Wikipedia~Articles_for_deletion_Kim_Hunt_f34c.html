<p>I am nominating a series of biographical articles. The articles are <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire_%28US_game_show%29_de5d.html#Million_winners" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)">Million Dollar Winners</a> in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. While their achievements are notable in the scope of the show, in scope of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> they are not. Since this is an important topic for the show, I have created a List of top winners in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and copied the information in each article I've listed for deletion. If this nomination fails, then I request the removal of List of top winners in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire as it will be redundant. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 07:06, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The other articles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carpenter_%28game_show_contestant%29_6560.html" title="John Carpenter (game show contestant)">John Carpenter</a> (2nd Nom)</li>

<li>Kevin Smith</li>
<li>Nancy Christy</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Delete</b>, per nom, unless one does something exceptional in the next few days. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 08:05, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep/Comment</b>. I don't think a mass nomination is appropriate because not all of these persons are on the same footing. In particular, it seems to me that Carpenter achieved bona fide renown and in addition was involved in more than one event likely covered by the press. My keep applies to Carpenter's article. In addition, I'd like to comment that I'm not sure I see how a list of non-notable people would be worthy of an article. If these articles are deleted, the newly created list article should also be deleted. Finally, I think the tactic being employed here is ill-advised and against the spirit of AfD. It creates a de facto referendum on whether content should be presented in one form or another instead of focusing debate on the suitability of content for this encyclopedia. AfD should be about content, not form. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 08:12, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (nominate only the non-notables of the list). A spot check also produces <i>Nancy Christy was the <b>first woman</b> (May 8, 2003) to win the top ($1,000,000) prize on the United States game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.</i> You can say what you want, but to be the first woman to do something, is notable (even if it's a bloody game show) I don't think a mass nomination is in order here either. There's at least two people in this list who deserve an article in my view and if someone doesn't deserve their own article, it doesn't neccesarily mean a list of WWTBAM winners is not notable. This needs a different approach. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:49, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><s><b>Keep all</b>. While Wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate source of information, neither is it a paper encyclopedia. Major winners of gameshows should be notable enough for inclusion. <b><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_f939.html" title="User:Brisvegas">Brisv</a><i><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_Esperanza_b205.html" title="User:Brisvegas/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a></i><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrisvegas_c8ec.html" title="User talk:Brisvegas"><font color="red">gas</font></a></b> 09:39, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</s> After mulling over some more, I figure that since the entries would still be listed, it makes no major diifference. Changed vote to <b>neutral</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> the Carpenter page at least, <b>Listify</b> the others. Carpenter's WWTBAM victory was very notable in it's own right, (citing press coverage.) The other winners may be notable enough to list, but not on their own page in my opinion. AfD Precedent says spelling bee winners et. al. are considered notable. It should be noted that Carpenter's first AfD nomination resulted in a No Consensus. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> 12:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Each article should have their notability judged individually. For example, Bob House is not notable for anything except winning on the show, while <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Olmstead_f48c.html" title="Kevin Olmstead">Kevin Olmstead</a> is notable not only for winning the show, but for the fact for a long period he held the record for the highest winnings on a game show, and is also a founder of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academic_Quiz_Tournaments_ff4a.html" title="National Academic Quiz Tournaments">National Academic Quiz Tournaments</a>.--<a href="../../../n/o/n/User%7ENonpareility_99db.html" title="User:Nonpareility">Nonpareility</a> 14:21, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I vote keep for all (as independant articles) with varying levels of conviction. <b>Strong keep</b> for Carpenter, as he was a genuine celebrity for a few months; <b>keep</b> Olmstead, for reasons listed above; <b>keep</b> Cullen due to his success on multiple game shows (he was also part of Jeopardy's Ultimate Tournament of Champions); <b>weak keep</b> for all the rest. Who Wants to be a Millionaire was <i>really</i> popular in its prime, and it has always had a good sense of its own history (compared to shows like Wheel of Fortune, which never talk about their past contestants). I think we can spare some space for every million-dollar winner. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 14:58, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete]</b>Their 15 minutes of fame are over unless the TV exposure led to some notable carrer in movies, TV, or whatever which itself makes them notable. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:18, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I have to agree that a mass nomination is not appropriate here. There is no question to me that Carpenter (since he was the first winner) and Olmstead (since he held a game show record for a few years) should have their own pages. While I'm not sure that each and every winner should have their own page, I do think every page should be decided individually.--Jatterb 17:42, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I also agree mass nomination is inappropriate, and Carpenter and Olmstead should definitely be kept, with the others weakly kept. (Many of the articles include substantial information on the million-dollar question, which, in my view, is borderline encyclopedic.) I did suggest redirection for non-notable people (or, I should have implied, for biographies that don't state much more than what they are notable for) in the talk page for Kim Hunt. Hunt could have been redirected to <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire_%28US_game_show%29_de5d.html" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)</a> if article content was an issue. I recently redirected <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Korotkin_353d.html" title="David Korotkin">David Korotkin</a>, the first contestant of the US Millionaire (which I now brought up in <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a>), and I also redirected <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Brydges_a920.html" title="Robert Brydges">Robert Brydges</a> to the <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire__%28UK_game_show%29_1b94.html" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)">UK version of Millioniare</a>. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 08:18, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to List of top winners in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, if not already complete there. --<a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyingPenguins_a1ed.html" title="User:FlyingPenguins">FlyingPenguins</a> 02:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>. <i>Millionaire</i> isn't like the other game shows, and as long as we don't start expanding to "500k winners," I think this will be fine. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:15, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
