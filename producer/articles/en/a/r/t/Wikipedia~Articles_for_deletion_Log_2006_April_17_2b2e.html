<p>Gaius is a friend of mine, so this AFD is nothing personal. However, I don't believe he meets Wikipedia's notability guidelines for living people. The only article that links to this is <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carper_Award_b795.html" title="Carper Award">Carper Award</a>, and whether the Carper Award is notable or not, I don't think its notability implies that everyone who has received the award is notable. The article doesn't mention that he co-founded the predecessor organization to the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_Competition_Federation_13ce.html" title="Academic Competition Federation">Academic Competition Federation</a>; however, I don't think that affiliation automatically makes him notable either. Perhaps someone will edit the article so as to better assert the notability of the subject, but I don't think it's possible. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 00:53, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do we really want to list every new product that comes out? That's over 100,000 new products per year. I think we should wait until a product gains some notability (other than self-promotion) before we consider it encyclopedic. As a minimum, this one fails the notability test. In my view, it fails the SPAM test as well. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 02:24, 17 April 2006 (UTC) (I think we're about to see viral marketing at work...) <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 03:27, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Product with humorous nationally-televised commercials in my face all hours of the day.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I've seen the product mentioned and advertised over the last year in various major magazines.

<li><b>Speedy Delete and protect</b> as a recreation of previously deleted content. Releasing one album via a myspace album does not satisfy the requirement that the band have "released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)." --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 04:04, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't like the band but they've worked up a sizable buzz. I think those aforementioned four-million hits would consider Hollywood Undead a notable band. As <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> said, they released an album on a label which is a joint venture with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interscope.html" title="Interscope">Interscope</a> - a rather major label which has been around for a number of years.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This might seem like the pedant's march, but the Myspace records album is a compilation. WP:MUSIC reminds us that compilations or soundtracks are NOT enough by themselves to warrant an article, excepting those which only consist of one artist (I can think of <i>Highlander</i> and <i>Mortal Kombat</i> right now). Also, even if that album counts, it takes two such albums to qualify under WP:MUSIC. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#0033CC">Corbin</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPM_9a68.html" title="WP:WPM"><font color="red">∫</font></a> <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W"><font color="orange">1</font></a> <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEA_d033.html" title="WP:MEA"><font color="gold">ɱ</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="lime">p</font></a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPATRA_5b5c.html" title="WP:SPATRA"><font color="blue">s</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CorbinSimpson_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/CorbinSimpson"><font color="indigo">ɔ</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPMU_ef61.html" title="WP:WPMU"><font color="violet">♫</font></a></strong> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson">Rock on, dude!</a></sup> 05:59, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

More importantly, the music made by Hollywood Undead is not licensed to nor intended primarily for use <i>by</i> MySpace, but is only hosted on MySpace's servers. Also, if I was feeling irascible and pedantic, I could make and push the idea that Linkin Park fused hardcore and hip-hop a long time ago. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#0033CC">Corbin</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPM_9a68.html" title="WP:WPM"><font color="red">∫</font></a> <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W"><font color="orange">1</font></a> <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEA_d033.html" title="WP:MEA"><font color="gold">ɱ</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="lime">p</font></a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPATRA_5b5c.html" title="WP:SPATRA"><font color="blue">s</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CorbinSimpson_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/CorbinSimpson"><font color="indigo">ɔ</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPMU_ef61.html" title="WP:WPMU"><font color="violet">♫</font></a></strong> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson">Rock on, dude!</a></sup> 05:04, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Largest Object Removed From Human Skull</dd>
<dd>The largest object removed from a human skull is a 20.32-cm (8-inch) survival knife, which was plunged into the head of 41-year-old Michael Hill on April 25, 1998. Michael survived the ordeal and the next day astonished doctors by functioning normally, although it was soon clear the knife had caused permanent damage to his memory and paralyzed his left hand. Looking back on the nightmare, the father-of-one says, "I didn't feel the pain initially and it was only when I was at the hospital that it hit me and I felt like my eyes were bulging out. I know people in worse shape than me now and so I consider myself lucky."</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>;why did you move the article back to the disambiguation,since there are only two cases where there is an article,its easier to direct michael hill to one article,then at the top of that article the link to the other,like i did,what do you think?</p>
<ul>
<li>The rule on Wikipedia is that your approach would only be permissible if your Michael Hill could honestly be said to be <i>significantly more notable</i> than any other person of the same name with an article. Since that clearly isn't the case, your Michael Hill does <i>not</i> get the undisambiguated title "Michael Hill". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 21:22, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>i dont mean nececerly this michael hill,but you couldnt apply it to the other michael hill either because there both not notable enough?<a href="../../../1/9/2/User%7E192.30.202.14.html" title="User:192.30.202.14">192.30.202.14</a> 21:33, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>No...a disambiguation page at the main title is the appropriate solution in this kind of situation. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:28, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Don't delete</b>- I am aware of the group pish posh and there information can be easily located.Being that he died so young, it is hard to find information on the ninternet. They also were very esoteric and have more of a cult following than a mainstream internet one. I don't think's its fair he should be deletead just because you cant find information. If you cantact me i would be happy to direct you to the people closest to him and his family( who wn the irhgts to his hundreds of composistions and contributions from such a young age.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Is that even a site? There seem to be 5 active users, and mostly petty posts. The entry is entirely misleading as to the nature of the site. If this entry still exists for historical reasons that would be fair, but then ALL verbs should be modified to be in the past tense (People For Change WAS this and that). Currently, there is nothing going on there of the sort described in the entry: this statement is objectively verifiable by anybody who cares to look. --FairGirl 03:56, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> For the simple reason that it was good enough for 2 years and relevant to the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Underground_d747.html" title="Democratic Underground">Democratic Underground</a> page. Our intent in mentioning this page in our comments was to show how partisan the fight over <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Independent_8866.html" title="Progressive Independent">Progressive Independent</a> had become. Both sites were created in protest of Democratic Underground's policies and attest to the disatisfaction of Progressives (properly filed under criticism). If some people here feel that neither PFC nor PI are notable, that's fine, but the criticism of DU remains and the fact that many people, (even though they're still carried on DU membership rosters), have left it to form other projects, remains. Both instances should be noted under the criticism paragraph of Democratic Underground because it IS criticism. And as in a printed encyclopedia, when a reference is made to a person, place, thing or organization, there should at least be a corresponding description, in my opinion. Otherwise you stem the flow of knowledge for which we rely on encyclopedias.</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is about facts. Facts are that people die and statistics change but the notable events of the time remain notable. When approximately 1000 mostly Dean supporters abruptly left left DU in 2004, taking their pocketbooks with them, that was notable at the time- very notable.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This AfD nom is politically motivated, a CYA response to defense of the Progressive Independent article. Moreover, 'notable' is not the same as 'important'. 'Notable' is an artificial quality that can be created with enough money even absent any sort of real value at all. The advertising and public-relations industries make billions of dollars every year doing just that. (I would add to Atlant's comment, above, by noting that <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">User:Jersey Devil</a>'s ascription of meatpuppetry is completely one-sided: his and other deletes are motivated by high-minded principle, but the keeps are nasty meatpuppetry. This is consistent with bad-faith political motivation, since it implies that persons urging keep are not stakeholders in the issue, but were merely recruited 'off the street' as it were.) <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 16:51, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: That's a startling series of assertions; do you genuinely believe that someone whose very first contribution to Wikipedia is in a AfD voting "KEEP!" (generally with an extremely passionate defense that makes no attempt to address or refute the reasons for the nomination) is in fact <i>not</i> invariably a supporter of the article launching in with the sole purpose of plumping up the totals? There's a honking big template sitting at the top of the page that seems to disagree with you. Whether they intend to be "disruptive," per se, I leave to the mindreaders and soothsayers, but it is unmistakable that their purpose is invariably to defend their article to the end -- or alternately, as in this particular case, fight those they perceive to be their "enemies" on every battleground they can find -- as opposed to dispassionately gauge whether the article satisfies Wikipedia rules and guidelines for inclusion. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:16, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep, with editing</b>: <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerseyDevil_2aab.html" title="User:JerseyDevil">JerseyDevil</a>, a DU member, has argued for the deletion of TWO articles about former DU splinter sites. There couldn't be a political motivation, here? Nahhhhh...and OF COURSE we must judge this RfD "objectively", no matter what the nefarious motivations of those arguing for deletion may be. Funny how Wikipedia mirrors real-life, with Democrats and Republicans collaborating to squelch dissent and alternate viewpoints. Well, as someone who was BANNED from People For Change and strongly disagrees with the political agenda of that site, let me state that although I do believe this article violates NPOV, reads like an ad, and is need of some serious editing, it should be kept. Unlike some people here I'm not gonna let my political bias or a petty grudge drive me to try to censor or silence articles that reference a website or organization I disagree with. The Progressive Independent article has already fallen victim to censorship egged on by vindictive and politically-motivated Wikipedia editors/users, it should not happen again. --Nicky Scarfo 03:00, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: So ... stipulating that JerseyDevil is arguing for the deletion of this article solely out of political motivation (and that's presumably Wrong), it is therefore alright for you to argue for the retention of this article out of political motivation (and that's presumably principled and Right)?

Maybe it has to do with my deep hatred of people trying to use Wikipedia to promote their non-notable sites. You could easily prove me wrong, and show notability per web in the article forcing me to change my delete vote but you won't because your forum is not notable and thus you must come here (as a meatpuppet mind you) and smear other veterans users here who have earned their reputations by...you know, actually contributing to other articles.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 00:17, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Argument for keeping</b> The Abyss (and it's spirital crossing) is a major concept in a global religion, and while certainly not mainstream, it has tens of thousands of adherents (if not more). The concept of the Abyss is a core theme of arguably the most notable occultist of the 20th century, Aleister Crowley. Moreover, the concept appears in many books, by Crowley as well as more recent authors. The Abyss represents a culmination of spiritual attainment, and the current stub is but a placeholder for a potentially rich and useful article that can bring further insight to a complex and growing religion. Give it a chance to grow before judging its merit. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshami_0cbd.html" title="User:Ashami">Ashami</a> 06:14, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Thelma article is large enough on it's own and since Wikipedia isn't paper, there is nothing wrong with having more information on it. Since Thelma is the basis of most modern occultism, it's pretty far from nn. That Thelema is a "Fringe religion" doesn't mean anything. Greek polytheism could also currently be considered a "fringe religion" but Greek mythology is still important from a historical perspective. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 22:24, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - to correct misrepresentation, Thelema is <i>hardly</i> the basis for "most moderrn occultism" - modern occultism is an extremely large topic, and there are many large, well-established occult organizations which are non-Thelemic, even anti-Thelemic. The second supporting argument is ill-conceived as well, but I will leave the reason for that as an exercise for the reader.&#160;:-) -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> 15:13, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If <i>major</i>, <i>well-established</i> occult organizations consider themselves anti-Thelemic, that shows the influence of Thelema just as much as if they considered themselves pro-Thelemic. (why bother considering yourself anti-Thelemic if Thelema is just a non-notable fringe religion?) The question here is the verifiability and notablility of Thelema, not whether or not people like it. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 22:13, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - you like to mischaracterize people's positions, don't you? I never said that Thelema was non-notable. I believe that it is notable. It is the specific concepts that are not notable enough to have separate articles. They can all be described in the main article. -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> 01:30, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Thelma article is large enough on it's own and since Wikipedia isn't paper, there is nothing wrong with having more information on it. Since Thelma is the basis of most modern occultism, it's pretty far from nn. That Thelema is a "Fringe religion" doesn't mean anything. Greek polytheism could also currently be considered a "fringe religion" but Greek mythology is still important from a historical perspective. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 22:30, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - to correct misrepresentation, Thelema is <i>hardly</i> the basis for "most moderrn occultism" - modern occultism is an extremely large topic, and there are many large, well-established occult organizations which are non-Thelemic, even anti-Thelemic. The second supporting argument is ill-conceived as well, but I will leave the reason for that as an exercise for the reader.&#160;:-) -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> 15:12, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If <i>major</i>, <i>well-established</i> occult organizations consider themselves anti-Thelemic, that shows the influence of Thelema just as much as if they considered themselves pro-Thelemic. (why bother considering yourself anti-Thelemic if Thelema is just a non-notable fringe religion?) The question here is the verifiability and notablility of Thelema, not whether or not people like it. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 22:14, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - you like to mischaracterize people's positions, don't you? I never said that Thelema was non-notable. I believe that it is notable. It is the specific concepts that are not notable enough to have separate articles. They can all be described in the main article. -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> 01:30, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is <b>not true</b> that everyone who shows up to a deletion discussion gets an automatic vote just for showing up.</p>
<p>The deletion process is designed to determine the consensus of opinion of Wikipedia editors; for this reason comments from users whose histories do not show experience with or contributions to Wikipedia are traditionally given less weight and may be discounted entirely.</p>

However, ballot stuffing is pointless. There is no ballot to stuff. This is not a vote, and decisions are not made upon weight of numbers alone. Furthermore, the presence of many new users in discussions like this one has made some editors in the past more inclined to suggest deletion.

His wiki article is at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_McCall_Smith_49f3.html" title="Alexander McCall Smith">Alexander McCall Smith</a>. The book currently ranks about 2,500th on Amazon.com and 5,400th on Amazon.co.uk. I'm voting delete because there are thousands of books like this and they are not sufficiently notable to deserve their own article. Smith is not a "major" author, but he's notable enough to get an article and that's fine. But unless this book is a milestone in his career, (like <i>1984</i> would be for George Orwell), then I don't think it should get its own article. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 15:48, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Dr Ross has impressive credentials and a promising future: however his accomplishments thus far do not merit a Wikipedia entry. The ensembles Dr Ross has conducted are all minor. As far as I can tell, none is a professional group, and none is significant enough to have its own Wikipedia entry (as of the time this article was listed for deletion). The article reads like a resume, which perhaps it is.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Dr Ross doesn't even seem to be the most distinguished orchestral conductor named James Ross: a Google search reveals <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:vfr9wq_lZCoJ:www.music.umd.edu/bios/jamesross.html+james+ross+conductor&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:vfr9wq_lZCoJ:www.music.umd.edu/bios/jamesross.html+james+ross+conductor&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4" rel="nofollow">another James Ross</a> born in Boston, Massachusetts, who has studied with <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Masur_298c.html" title="Kurt Masur">Kurt Masur</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiji_Ozawa_c8a3.html" title="Seiji Ozawa">Seiji Ozawa</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Bernstein_093b.html" title="Leonard Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>, conducted the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leipzig_Gewandhaus_Orchestra_6ab4.html" title="Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra">Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra</a> and has a position at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Maryland_3b4c.html" title="University of Maryland">University of Maryland</a>, but no Wikipedia entry. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 09:18, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. A close one, but consensus seems to be that this is not notable enough for a standalone article. However, it was a close call between deletion and relisting (or closing as no consensus), so the poor article quality swung it.

<li><b>Keep and rename:</b> From the electoral commission site: "Application by Pauline Hanson's One Nation (NSW Division) to change its registered Party Name and Party Abbreviation" was refused June 2005.<a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/Who/party_reg/decisions/phondnsw.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/Who/party_reg/decisions/phondnsw.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> There is however <i>One Nation Queensland Division</i> which was registered on 22 April 2005.<a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/Who/party_reg/registered/onqld.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/Who/party_reg/registered/onqld.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> This is a separate party to <i>Pauline Hanson's One Nation</i>. Article should be <b>kept</b> and <b>renamed</b>. I think, ironically, it is not clear if One Nation is indeed one national party or a series of separate state entities. For example, if you look at those who objected to the renaming of the NSW branch you will find it is their <i>One Nation</i> colleagues in WA who did not want any confusion. Accordingly I support keeping a state branch article - this is not quite the same as an individual branch as per comments by User:Capitalistroadster. I agree it may well be a copyvio but I did not find evidence of that when I searched.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 00:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually I might be confused and it might be a Queensland branch of <i>Pauline Hanson's One Nation (NSW Division)</i> which wasn't allowed to change its name in June and thus a separate entity to the Queensland One Nation mob registered in April last year.

<li><b>Response:</b> I am not sure that wishful thinking that something is dead or dying is a reason for deletion. I can find no evidence of a web based copyvio, although I agree it may have been copied. However,it doesn't appear quite fluent enough for any publication, even a pamphlet with dot points that have been compressed.

<li>It wasn't my reason for voting delete. My stance is that a branch or division of PHON does not warrant its own article - not even the major parties have separate articles for state divisions.

<li>I'm at this Uni, and so I'm not goint to notvote on the issue at hand. However, I'd suggest that if you want it to stay 'deleted' that you make it into a redirect back to the Uni article.

<li>I would generally tend to agree. The main reason this is on Afd is the redirect I did previously was already reverted.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. This does seem more of a content dispute than anything else, but the fact that this it is a name used at least somewhat commonly in India rules out a complete delete. Of interest is the fact that the word "Gurunath" does not even appear on the <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shri_Gurudev_Mahendranath_94d2.html" title="Shri Gurudev Mahendranath">Shri Gurudev Mahendranath</a> page, which certainly does not help the argument that the Gurunath article should be about the word coinage claim. The page will be kept, but primarily to mention the use as an Indian name. The other section should be removed, or put at the bottom of the page *after* it is at least mentioned (and referenced) on the Shri Gurudev Mahendranath page. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 14:14, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Insufficient notability with respect to content. There are between 4 and 50 google hits when you search for "shri gurudev mahendranath" and "gurunath" or "mahendranath" and "gurunath". Most of these don't even apply to the content. Whereas "Gurunath" alone gets almost 52,000 hits, since it is a common name in India. The individual who gets the most hits (1,140) for "gurunath" is "yogiraj gurunath".

<li><b>Comment</b> This doesn't address the topic of this AfD, which is the issue of notability. Google hits for Gurunath consist of 50,000 given names, titles, and religious proclamations. The only individual that gets more than a few Ghits for Gurunath is Yogiraj Gurunath. Wikipedia has already deemed twice (based on two AfD's - you and I both attempted at different times to have Yogiraj Gurunath page deleted) that he is notable enough to keep on wikipedia. I don't think "Gurunath" by itself has any use to be on wikipedia. So either the page should be deleted, or it should be a simple redirect to Yogiraj Gurunath. Also don't forget that until proven otherwise, you are still a confirmed sockpuppet of Adityanath per wp:rfcu.. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 03:01, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Since the word is a title and not a name, it would be inappropriate to redirect to any one individual. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">User:Hamsacharya dan</a> is a student of Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath who is trying to inappropriately promote his guru on WP.

<li><b>Comment</b> Question: What do you think the word "Gurunath" means? Guru + Nath = Spiritual teacher + Irradiant Lord . These are ancient words that come from an ancient spiritual/religious context. Isn't that how we often name our children in the west - based on religious or biblical connotations? Well it's no different in the East. That why the word Gurunath came to be used to name children in India. Isn't that obvious? Not the other way around - Mahendranath didn't take a "given name" and turn it into a religious title. That's ludicrous and probably unprecedented. It's like saying "You have achieved a great spiritual stature. I now bestow the title of 'Jimmy' on you." Maybe in Wikipedia getting a title of "Jimbo" might mean something great...but that's neither here nor there. The term Gurunath has been used as a title for saints and avatars for thousands of years. "Bolo Sri Sat Gurunath Maharaj Ki Jai" is a proclamation that is perhaps millenia old.

<li><b>Delete</b> - just because one cannot find references in libraries or the Internet doesn't mean it cannot be apart of a living, breathing tradition. For example, buying a Lonely Planet book on India will give some information about local customs and sayings that one wouldn't necessarily find in a formal publication. Also, there are some publications that are either out of print or very hard to track down - further still remember that India is one of the biggest publishers of books...the wealth of literary gems found there beggars belief when one takes time out to look for things (again some translations not always being available in English). The religious tradition in India is VAST. It is impossible to have it all readily available for us all that are information or reference hungry. Also, it takes alot more than taking a short visit or googling and then thinking one knows India (and Her manifold religious traditions) inside/out in actual fact. 86.10.229.248 19:11, 22 April 2006 (UTC)Shaninath

<li>I don't understand what the big deal is about deleting it. We are trying to grow out and become more known and grow in the Halo community. We are starting to get a good idea of where we are headed, manly in the creation of our own Machinima movies, but not limited to that. Right now our forum members don't understand what the big deal is about deleting the artical. This would only help our growth. And thats what we are striving to do. Grow. And to be clear, TwoThumbsDown is no sockpuppet, and neither is Kolten27. They maybe the trouble makers of the HWS Forums, but us three are the most technology minded in general and knolegable about Wikipedia. They would never do anything distructive or without having a good reason to on this site. =<a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewton465_811a.html" title="User:Newton465">Newton465</a> 02:44, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem is that you want to use Wikipedia for self-promotion, and that's strongly discouraged. Web sites only get into Wikipedia <i>after</i> they become notable. Otherwise, every website on the web would have an article. Also, writing an article about yourself or your own stuff is generally discouraged. Have you read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>? Those will make things clearer.

<li>So becuase we are memebers of the forums, it means that we are making the article about ourselves? Let me remind you that TwoThumbsDown and I are NOT moderators of the forums (refer to article which is in question) and that the both of us have done most, if not all, the editing to this article. Therefore, we did not make it about ourselves. This article is also NOT an advertisment for the forums. All information included is imformational and nothing is said about why, how even how to join. <a href="../../../k/o/l/User%7EKolten27_1197.html" title="User:Kolten27">Kolten27</a> 03:08, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I understand your concerns about the advertising, John. A sticky situation indeed. I've read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and I would like to note that Brunsvold (referred to as "HoodedGnome" above), the one responsible for the creation of the website in question has indeed won an award (in his case, from a local college) and recieved recognition from a local newspaper as a result. Once again, I request some patience from all of us so that Brunsvold can sort this out. Thanks for being this patient with us for this long, anyway. It is our fault for not noticing this criteria before. If we are unable to provide proof of notability soon then the proposal for deletion is justified, in my view at least. I am also curious as to what we can do to clean up this article in the meantime to remove any self-promotion that you may notice.--<a href="../../../t/w/o/User%7ETwoThumbsDown_260c.html" title="User:TwoThumbsDown">TwoThumbsDown</a> 03:28, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a <i>massive</i> and very interesting list of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongue-twister.html" title="Tongue-twister">tongue-twisters</a> in numerous languages. Unfortunately, I believe this isn't suitable material for an encyclopedia, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It keeps expanding forever.</li>
<li>Most of the tongue-twisters are unverifyable and some may have been invented by the authors.</li>
<li>A lot of the content isn't really tongue twisters, but other linguistic peculiarities (such as long strings of consonants or vowels in words, phrases made out of homonyms etc).</li>
<li>Most importantly, the topic itself is unencyclopedic. Only a few examples would be required to illustrate the concept of a tongue-twister, Wikipedia needn't host a database of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I wouldn't want such a great list to be completely deleted. Maybe Wikibooks would host it, or some other way could be found to keep it online and editable.</p>

<li>Wikipedia is not paper</li>
<li>Not sure you can <b>verify</b> a toungue-twister. Its seems akin to verifying that the sky is up. It isn't like there is an official United Tongue Twister Board of America or something. It is the most arguable point of deletion, though.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> we have deleted similar lists before, such as lists of jokes. Also, the very fact that tongue-twisters are unverifyable, pointed out by previous users, is an argument for deletion in my opinion. Wikipedia is supposed to explain the concept of a tongue-twister (in the article <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongue-twister.html" title="Tongue-twister">Tongue-twister</a>) and perhaps provide a few examples to illustrate subject, not list every tongue-twister in existance. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERain74_e81f.html" title="User:Rain74">Rain74</a> 16:41, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know how to contact this user, Colin Keigher, as his own page does not have an email address to which I can direct queries;</p>
<p>The reason I wish to query is why he would put a deletion flag on this information. Yes it could be incorporated into the Radio Amateurs of Canada page; but the information is rather detailed, and many Wikipedia users might not know to go to Radio Amateurs of Canada; nor that the youth education program is hosted by RAC; while I assume that 'youth education' is a searchable phrase.</p>
<p>I'd like to see the deletion flag removed. This is a legitimate page, and has been sanctioned by the Chair of Youth Education, who asked that it be included in Winipedia.</p>

<p>The material on Youth Education does indeed reflect what is at the RAC website; this is as RAC wishes the information be displayed. I don't see anything within the policies and guidelines which prohibit 'promotion' -- and that term would only loosely apply here, as the information is informative about how to become involved in a social program for the common good.

<p><b>Keep Intact</b>: This obviously is no "ad", at least not in any commercial sense. Surely enthusiasm in a description is not cause for deletion. This is a summary of an obviously excellent program (YEP) aimed at youth. There is no fee levied. Radio Amateurs of Canada is a not-for-profit organization representing the interests of federally licenced Radio Amateurs across Canada. That means promoting what is not only a hobby but a valuable service. Witness the fact that RAC sponsors the Amateur Radio Emergency Service which offers trained and equipped volunteers, all at their own expense, in times of emergency, such as floods, hurricanes, forest fires, ice storms and tornadoes, to name a few. Not only does the RAC YEP encourage an understanding and appreciation for this hobby/service, but it offers a fun way of learning many educational basics, including mathematics, physics and geography. This article should definitely not be deleted. No valid argument has been made for such a drastic action. --ve3bdb 0321Z 19Apr06</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Look, I'm a licensed ham myself and I understand the importance of youth outreach -- the hobby isn't getting any younger and a lot of those involved in it now are snarky and unpleasant old men. But Wikipedia is not a promotional venue, and this in my book comes off as an ad, or at the very least a press release, neither of which has any place on Wikipedia. At the very least this article needs a massive rewrite into a simple description of the program from an outside POV; realistically, this particular part of RAC isn't notable enough on its own for a separate article to begin with and really should be added to the main article on the RAC. I would say exactly the same thing about an equivalent subdivision of the ARRL or RSGB -- the groups themselves are notable, but individual sections of them aren't, any more than a special interest group of something like the Association for Computing Machinery would be (and the ACM is much bigger). A final point is that no one, not the authors of the page, nor the subject, has final say over what a Wikipedia article says. Some governing body may have written and approved the article, but it isn't theirs to control -- once it goes on Wikipedia, the author gives up control. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:00, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agree totally. (And, for the record, I passed my RAE - British exam - at 14, and got my full Class A at 17. However, I've given the hobby up in favour of the internet and I can see it dying out if more young people aren't recruited. <i>None of which</i> makes the subject of the article any more notable.) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 06:39, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- It's actually from a TV show, not a game, though I've never seen the show so I can't tell you how accurate it is. It's basically the equivalent of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_special_abilities_c3fe.html" title="List of Dragon Ball special abilities">List of Dragon Ball special abilities</a>, except about the One Piece franchise instead of the Dragonball franchise, and without the descriptions and pictures. I don't have anything to do with the article but I think it at least deserves a discussion before being deleted, since the Dragonball Attacks article sets precedent. 4.226.111.130 21:09, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Kotepho is quite right; this is a list of "special techniques" from a television show.

<li><i>What makes this different than any of the other special technique lists on Wikipedia?</i> Nothing, really -- and they should all go into the bit bucket as fancruft, minutiae that is not of the slightest interest to anyone outside the circle of fans of those specific shows (and perhaps not even then).

<li>What makes this article different is that these "special techniques" sound like they're more or less ad-hoc: they aren't used more than once or twice in the show. If some of the techniques are used repeatedly, they <i>might</i> deserve an entry in the main article. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 04:54, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The same thing applies to a majority of <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_Goku_%28Dragon_Ball%29_accd.html" title="Son Goku (Dragon Ball)">Son Gokuu</a>'s techniques in Dragon Ball; he only uses a handful of them more than once or twice. As for these lists being considered "fancruft", fancruft seems to me to be more or less a matter of opinion. Even Wikipedia's policy on such seems to be rather ambiguous on the subject. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_S_f5c0.html" title="User:The S">The S</a> 17:58, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>That seems a reason to not list those techniques on <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_Goku_%28Dragon_Ball%29_accd.html" title="Son Goku (Dragon Ball)">Son Goku</a>'s page, then - not a reason to list more similar information here. As far as fancruft goes, a reasonable working definition (given on <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>) is that fancruft is material which is only of interest to a small set of fans, and which has no relevance to the world at large. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 19:28, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as being well beyond the level of detail which would be of any interest whatsoever to anyone who did not already know it. Fancruft? I would say so. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> this indiscriminate. Oh, and what makes it different is that at least two of the other examples, Pokemon and Superman, have a following several orders of magnitude larger. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:57, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Correct - I only translated it with an aim of placing the rebuttal in the discussion. I personally disagree with every single word, and wonder why our French friends keep it still.

<p>Weak Keep. Maybe allow some time to establish notability? I'm tempted to just call it a Neologism and say delete, but it does seem to be in widespread use in the fandom, and different users have started to reference it in other articles. So it could be argued there's a desire for an article. Really should've waited longer before starting an article though.Furthestshore 14:31, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> due to precedent (<a href="../../../f/o/n/Fonzie_syndrome.html" title="Fonzie syndrome">Fonzie syndrome</a> and Sunnydale syndrome, both "unofficial" terms used by the fandoms to describe a phenomenon).

<p>Keep. Look at the article Sliding_timescale. Like this it talks about something that clearly exists in comic books, even if it's not an "official" word. This is something that [i]is[/i] important enough to get an article and the article has to go somewhere. A title widely used by fans is the best choice until there's an official word. Did Superboy Prime change coninuity? Yes, verifiably. Do fans make jokes about how far it could go? Yes, not [i]as[/i] verifiable, but there's such a thing as common sense. Is there an official word yet? No, so, within reason, any title for the article would be acceptable, but a word the fans use would be best. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.143.243.114 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.143.243.114_26b1.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.143.243.114">contribs</a>) .</small> (unsign added by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:11, 26 April 2006 (UTC))</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - this article was initially created to house minor Biblical figures who should be noted in a truly comprehensive non-paper encyclopedia, but who lack sufficient information to merit an individual article; see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Uel_2caf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Uel">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Uel</a>. It is incorrect to say that the entrants completely lack notability: they are named in the Bible. It is equally incorrect to say that the list will <i>never</i> be complete - there are a finite number of persons so named for whom individual articles would be inappropriate. Granted, some Biblical figures maybe beneath mention on <i>any</i> list, but there are always bound to be some who are worthy of listing, even if they can never be articles. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 22:41, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the decision to delete Uel (biblical figure) was a mistake; being mentioned in the Tenach is good enough for being notable, and whereas Wikipedia seems to have a hang-up with short articles, other encyclopedias have no qualms about one-line articles if that's all there is to say about the topic.

<p>Despite its relative length, this is clearly a vanity article about an obscure individual. Please note that his main claim to fame is a short student film. The rest of the information, such as about his political activism or interest in learning Moroccan Arabic, is utterly irrelevant and unnoteworthy. There were also inappropriate mentions of this individual in other articles, such as a bizarre in suggestion in <a href="../../../c/u/c/Cuckold.html" title="Cuckold">Cuckold</a> that unfaithful women shout "Jam! All! More!" while having sex with their husbands as a way to evoke Jamal Morelli, the real object of their desire; another example is this mention under <a href="../../../f/e/s/Fes.html" title="Fes">Fes</a>: "the Ville Nouvelle is a bustling commercial center with a popular American Language Center and filmmaker Jamal Morelli's studio." Finally, every result on Google seems to be either a Wikipedia article on which his name (inappropriately) appears, or from sites such as answers.com that reflect Wikipedia's content.<a href="../../../w/f/g/User%7EWfgiuliano_b80d.html" title="User:Wfgiuliano">Wfgiuliano</a> 22:56, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>DO NOT DELETE - and please stop deleting everything on Jamal Morelli which I and others have created. I tried to get rid of horrible things like the JAM ALL MORE; people have tried and then it is put back on. Jamal Morelli deserves to be included as a man of note for his contributions to art, peace, Moroccan/American exchanges. The assessment of his life work is strange. Interest in Moroccan Arabic? He brought it to the racist South during a time people were being arrested for that. Jamal Morelli is known as the first male Muslim artist to work with 20,000 people strong Fellowship of Isis. He worked with recording star Myshkin. And "Secrets of the Sisterhood" was not a student film. I feel hurt that so much work is just scrapped in an instant.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And as far as an interest in Moroccan Arabic being in some way subversive or novel in the late 20c! my whole (American) family took courses in it in 1963‑65.... <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 20:41, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not delete: Who said it was subversive? Where does it say he was interested in it? Jamal Morelli was the first to bring Moroccan Arabic to New Orleans - this is, and was, a great achievement. Why is Nadia's work (and ours) being completely wiped out by Wfgiuliano? Our artists are not represented at all. And Bill, at the ALC in Fes, they still use the only Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic from Georgetown University - 1960-1965! We are excited at someone taking our culture abroad at a time of incredible hate between cultures. I am sorry the cafe is not letting me to log in. But I will try somewhere else. Please, be considerate of the fact we have to pay to contribute each time. Thank you for patience and forgive errors, Khalid Idrissi.</p>
<p><br />
Oh, boy! This started as a simple good deed: getting a particularly obnoxious vanity page deleted from our beloved Wikipedia. Now it has turned into a crazy (albeit somewhat amusing) cultural battle.</p>
<p>&gt;Interest in Moroccan Arabic? He brought it to the racist South during a time people were being &gt;arrested for that.</p>
<p>That is such sheer lunacy that it's actually funny! It's really one of the most preposterous statements I have ever read. I wonder if Mr. Morelli has been telling his Moroccan friends that he risked his liberty, life, and limb in order to heroically bring the forbidden language, Moroccan Arabic, to the benighted American South? I think Jamal Morelli must really be a character, if not he surely suffers from paranoid delusions.</p>
<p>&gt;We are not equipped here in Morocco with endless amounts of time in cybercafes (no, we don't have<br />
&gt;as many computers at our homes as you do)<br />
&gt;Please, be considerate of the fact we have to pay to contribute each time.<br /></p>
<p>Uh, no, we won't be considerate of that, or at least we shouldn't. Such statements are logical fallacies (appeals to pity). What everyone should do instead is to consider your arguments on their intrinsic merit, or lack thereof.<a href="../../../w/f/g/User%7EWfgiuliano_b80d.html" title="User:Wfgiuliano">Wfgiuliano</a> 05:21, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>we will not be able to compete with you, mister wfgiuliano. you are quite violent. and if the most preposterous statement you have ever read is that during the years of 2002 on people were be arrested for arabic sympathies, with respect to you, sir, read more.</p>
<p>For the information of the anonymous individual: the current American governmment, for which I have little sympathy, is actually <i>promoting</i> the study of Arabic in this country in order to have Americans who can help them wage further wars of aggression. Therefore, "bringing Moroccan Arabic" to the US could not possibly land anyone in sunny <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guant%C3%A1namo.html" title="Guantánamo">Guantánamo</a> since it coincides with government policy. And since you seem to have a very poor understanding of the US, let me explain something else to you: the reason why courses in Moroccan Arabic are rare in the US is not because teaching it is unlawful or frowned upon; it is simply because too few people are interested in it. The many Americans currently learning Arabic are usually sensible enough to study modern standard Arabic rather than dialectal forms of the language, which would make about as much sense as someone from China learning <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gullah.html" title="Gullah">Gullah</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno-English_4eb6.html" title="Hiberno-English">Hiberno-English</a>. <a href="../../../w/f/g/User%7EWfgiuliano_b80d.html" title="User:Wfgiuliano">Wfgiuliano</a> 17:00, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Other details:</p>

<li>Alexa ranking is 3,757, which indicates a traffic of 150-200,000 unique visitors/day. By contrast, the website for the Biography Channel (an American cable channel, which also publishes its own magazine, <i>Biography</i>) is 34,893, and Encyclopedia Britannica is 2,864.</li>
<li>It is far and away the most popular website on the Internet devoted to general biography.</li>

<dd>Someone asked for a citation. A proper citation is not specifically necessary here because this is not an article. However, I will humor you, so I did this: <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/People/Biographies/" class="external autonumber" title="http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/People/Biographies/" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> (Yahoo) and <a href="http://dmoz.org/Reference/Biography/" class="external autonumber" title="http://dmoz.org/Reference/Biography/" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> (DMOZ), plus <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=biography" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=biography" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=biographies" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=biographies" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> (the top 100 results for Google searches of Biography or Biographies, extracting anything that purported to be a site devoted to general biography). All I correlated with <a href="http://www.alexa.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, Alexa. That dragnet, simple as it is, would certainly have unearthed any site that met the criteria. Nothing came close.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Almost nobody refers to it as the Notable Names Database, which explains the dearth of hits with that name.</li>
<li>The figure of "150 unique results" returned in a Google search, given in the AfD above is patently false. This person simply went to the end of the Google results and assumed that since there were no more results returned by Google, that is all there is and all pages are copies of these. This is wrong. For reasons of speed, Google trims the results -- this does not mean this is all the unique ones there are. This is true of <i>all</i> searches. By this person's logic, there are only 856 unique results returned for the English word "cat", which is simply absurd. The message displayed on the last Google page returned for "cat" (86th page) is, "In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the 857 already displayed." Out of 676,000,000 total results. Under this presumption, 99.99987% of all web pages are duplicates of others. Of course your mileage may vary depending on which Google datacenter you hit.</li>

<li>Probably more than 99% of the facts presented in Wikipedia are unsourced. I would not be surprised if the true figure were closer to 99.98% unsourced or thereabouts.

<p>Even author admits that dragons are not real, but goes on to list types of species that are "known."
