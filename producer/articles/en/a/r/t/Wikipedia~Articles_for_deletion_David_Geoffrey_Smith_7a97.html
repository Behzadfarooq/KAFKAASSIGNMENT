<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm not sure what <a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayou_Banjo_6dc6.html" title="User:Bayou Banjo">Bayou Banjo</a> is searching on Google; a search on David Smith yields 227M matches, David G.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Your outrageous accusations have no basis, you have absolutely no basis to accuse me of vandetta. Please familiarize yourself with <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">WP:PA</a>. You obviously do not know how to properly perform a Google search. Try putting your search term in quotes. You will not get many hits. Quit changing the subject, this article is cluttering up wiki. I do not know this person, and I've never heard of him until now. In searching for additional info, it quickly became clear that there wasn't much to find.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. How many of those 11.9M matches are actually for this individual? If they all are, as you claim, then it's reasonable that 1% of the matches would be from major news entities or other verifiable sources (i.e. not blogs, personal pages, etc.). That would still be 119,000 sources to quote, and there are <i>no</i> references to major news/media entities in the article. Having a common name does not equate to notability. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 12:23, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I believe this person, has distinguished himself, based on several items extracted from the information posted to the bio. I would submit as examples:
<ul>
<li>This person has demonstrated a leadership role in IT at <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Martin_7877.html" title="Lockheed Martin">Lockheed Martin</a>. Lockheed Martin is one of the largest IT and advanced technology contractors in the world.</li>
<li>This person has demonstrated a leadership role in a $700M IT contract. That represents one of the largest federal IT acquisitions of the last 10 years.</li>
<li>This person has demonstrated a leadership role at a Federal agency, in developing its enterprise architecture. Specifically, this person has demonstrated leadership at the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Environmental_Protection_Agency_228d.html" title="US Environmental Protection Agency">US Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Mapping and environment are joined at the hip - for example, the commercial market segment leader in geospatial technology is named, not by accident, "<a href="http://www.esri.com" class="external text" title="http://www.esri.com" rel="nofollow">Environmental Systems Research Institute</a>". Doing this kind of work for the national environmental agency of one of the most powerful and technologically advanced nations on earth places him near the pinnacle of that profession.</li>
<li>This person appears to have been actively involved in the development of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographic_Information_Systems_aeb3.html" title="Geographic Information Systems">Geographic Information Systems</a> (GIS) for over 20 years. Modern computer-based GIS in its' current incarnation hasn't been around for much more than 20 years itself, placing this individual among its veterans and pioneers.</li>
<li>This person has demonstrated leadership at a statewide level, with development of statewide interagency technical standards, as well as holding statewide quasi-judicial office.</li>
<li>This person has several published works.</li>
<li>This person is a member of <a href="http://www.ncees.org" class="external text" title="http://www.ncees.org" rel="nofollow">NCEES</a>. NCEES is the national organization which sets national policy for the engineering and surveying community, and which defines the yardstick for professional licensure. Only a fraction of one percent of engineers and surveyors are ever eligible to be members of NCEES.</li>
<li>This person has excelled and demonstrated leadership in not just one field, but in multiple fields at a statewide and national level. --<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawnTreader_e120.html" title="User:DawnTreader">DawnTreader</a> 03:55, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
