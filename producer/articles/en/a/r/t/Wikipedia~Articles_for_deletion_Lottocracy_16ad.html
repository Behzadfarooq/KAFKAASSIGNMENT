<p>Furthemore, how strange do delete an article with an important message just becuase of a name. What is a neologism and what is wrong with it?</p>
<p>If I look in Wikipedia for Neologism I find:</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> is a word, term, or phrase which has been recently created ("coined") â€”often to apply to new concepts, or to reshape older terms in newer language form. Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context.</p>
<p>So there seems to be nothing wrong with a neologism!</p>

<li>I can only say one thing: I am a scientist, go to my homepage <a href="http://oase.uci.kun.nl/~aven1935/" class="external free" title="http://oase.uci.kun.nl/~aven1935/" rel="nofollow">http://oase.uci.kun.nl/~aven1935/</a> and you will see that I was involved in the publication of 55 scientific papers. My last paper was in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology (2005). I must say I am very disappointed with this answer.
<p>I have always considered the British people as open minded. In Holland there is at least one official publication with the term lottocracy (lottocratie) in the title, which was one of the reasons to present this article to Wikipedia. It is most disappointing to hear that a concept, which meets almost all of the above criteria, among others, it really introduces a solution to the problems facing our world going to an end, is simply wept from the table by a single subject. In scientific publications one usually has three referees to judge a paper. In Wikipedia one seems to be sufficient.</p>
<p>At the same time I know that the above words have no value whatsoever. In Holland we would say: spoken to a deafman's ear.</p>

<li>Hm, okay does seem like Ad van der Ven is promoting his idea. However, I still think a Redirect would be good. It seems like many people reinvent the term and it has an obvious meaning. The redirect would not be acquiescing to AvdV; it is more like "if there's anything about Lottocracy, it's as a synonym or subtopic of Demarchy". Demarchy exists and is a more serious article, a redirect will stop people from recreating 'lottocracy' thinking they invented it. I myself immediately understood the concept from the name 'lottocracy'. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>â€”<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">01-13</a>&#160;08:28<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></li>

<p><b>Do NOT delete this Article!</b></p>
<p>First of all it is not original research.</p>
<p>The idea of lottocracy has been described in detail in the chapter <a href="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/leonbook/node16.html" class="external text" title="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/leonbook/node16.html" rel="nofollow">A Concept for Government</a> of the book <a href="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/leonbook/leonbook.html" class="external text" title="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/leonbook/leonbook.html" rel="nofollow">The World Solution for World Problems</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 90-9002592-8</a>). The book is officially published in <b>1988</b>, which is, according to present standards, long ago. I cannot help it when the general public is not informed. Since the time of it's publication the book has been available, though, as a hard copy in the Library of Congress (Washington DC), the British Library (London) and, among others, in the Library of the University of Princeton (Princeton, USA). You can also find the book at <a href="http://picarta.pica.nl/LNG=NE/DB=2.41/" class="external text" title="http://picarta.pica.nl/LNG=NE/DB=2.41/" rel="nofollow">PiCarta</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>Dear Doktorb,</p>
<p>Would you really be so kind to wait a little with your comments. I am in the process of editing. This will take a few minutes. So, please, ...</p>
<p>Moreover, I do not know what you mean. The author of the book has died several years ago. Therefore, again, I do not know what you mean. I am <a href="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/" class="external text" title="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/" rel="nofollow">Ad van der Ven</a>, a honest scientist (having published 55 papers in well-known scientific papers) and I repeat, I am not the author of the book.</p>
<p>Now I am continuing.</p>
<p>Second.</p>
<p>The term lottocracy is not my term, but the term of the author. The term has been used seven times in the book! I cannot help it, that the author uses this term to label his idea.</p>
<p>I really think, with all my heart, that the above referees have been rather careless and have made their recommendations too easy!</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - to the author of this article: I can understand your frustration, but please note that Wikipedia is not an academic journal and this is not peer-review. For a topic to merit an entry in wikipedia it needs to be notable in its own right. This discussion is largely about whether or not this concept is notable. It is being termed <i>original research</i> by other editors because it is not a term in widespread use, discussed by multiple notable authors but, rather, a term used in a not especially notable book by a not especially notable author. It may be a brilliant idea, but until it becomes a <i>notable</i> brilliant idea, it isn't appropriate as a topic for an article. Other editors have suggested that the concept is essentially the same as <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sortition.html" title="Sortition">sortition</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demarchy.html" title="Demarchy">demarchy</a>, so perhaps some of this information could be integrated into one or both of those articles. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattley_a310.html" title="User:Mattley">Mattley</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattley_ace2.html" title="User talk:Mattley"><sup>(Chattley)</sup></a> 13:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dear Mattley,</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration. You are the first one who makes a comment in a kind and most informative way. I do understand what is meant by "notable". I am a scientist with many publications, among others a book, and at least I consider the topic certainly notable. But that will probably not do and I am well aware that the concept is a matter of subjective interpretation. Some will consider a topic notable and some not. In that case one still can hold to the criterium of importance, which by the way is also subjective. I can only wait and see.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I will certainly consider most seriously your suggestion to discuss the topic under the heading of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demarchy.html" title="Demarchy">demarchy</a>, which by the way is in some respects completely different from the concept of lottocracy.</p>
