<li>The summary section of this article in the mother article is almost identical to the actual content of this one. The only additional content is ONE paragraph, namely <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Smyrna_7464.html#Occupation" title="Occupation of Smyrna">Occupation of Smyrna#Occupation</a>! (not to mention about its selective content)</li>
<li>There is no {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} template in the mother article (for obvious reasons), despite the fact that the original edit stated <i>"moved from Greco-Turkish War to have its own page"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_%C4%B0zmir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40501636" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_%C4%B0zmir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40501636" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<p>Also, the title of the article, although a military term, is largely POV, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is anachronistic since the city was officially named "Izmir" later; should be "Smyrna"</li>
<li>it is a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradox.html" title="Paradox">paradox</a>; an army does not "occupy" a city if the majority of population is of same ethnicity; it "liberates" it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare the existing title to Temporary liberation of Smyrna to see the contrast of the two POV's. Either a more NPOV term should be used, to bridge those two extremes, or the article should be deleted under any name. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 00:45, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am quite annoyed that this article was tagged, covered in pov, then nominated for deletion within the space of an hour. I took the time to carefully research and cite the contents of this article, and i intended to return to it when time permitted. Firstly, this article is not a pov fork. There is no pov implied in the title or the article (and its content is not selective, i've tried to show the treatment of Muslims and Christians within this city), it is simply the most common term used for the Greek presence in Izmir during the Greco-Turkish war by historians. It is certainly more notable than Greek administration of Ionia, 1919-1922 as suggested by the nominator. Granted, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Smyrna_7464.html" title="Occupation of Smyrna">Occupation of Smyrna</a> may be even more notable, but i was prepared to rename it to this, this was not an issue for me. Secondly, as to its right to be separate from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>, that article covers the Greek campaign from the landings in Izmir, to the Greek incursion right across Anatolia. I intended this article to deal solely with the Greek presence in Izmir over the war and in due course would have expanded it from its current state. Put simply, is the title verifiable through third party sources? Yes. Is the subject worthy of an article? In my opinion I believe it is. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 01:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article was created 8 whole months ago, and since then, no notable <i>fact</i> or <i>source</i> has been added to it. As Hectorian pointed below, it would be more legitimate to have a possible article named Occupation of Smyrni 9 September 1922-July 24 1923, talking about the turkish control of the city until the signing of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Lausanne_64b1.html" title="Treaty of Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a>. This article is a narrow POV selection, both geographicaly (should be <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionia.html" title="Ionia">Ionia</a>), and as a timeframe. Those 3 lines of text should be part of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>, or Greek administration of Ionia, 1919-1922, or <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 10:08, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

However, I find myself persuaded by the need to avoid a POV fork given the opposing historical and national views that still resonate from these events. The current content of this article is not much more than in the corresponding section of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>, which is currently entitled <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html#Greek_landings_and_consolidation.23Occupation_of_Smyrna" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greek Occupation of Smyrna</a>. There's currently little apparent value-added from a separate article to offset the POV fork potential. If the content were significantly expanded so that the value of a separate article could be made more apparent, I would be more inclined to support a <b>Keep</b> vote than I am now. If the article will be expanded, it would be reasonable to allow some time for this to occur.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The article deals with a specific event, part of the 'Greco-Turkish war (1919-1920)'. In its current state (under this title and with that content) the article serves as a POV-folk. Though it is claimed to refer to events connected with the city, it talks about Alasehir and Ataturk, not to mention that through hersays and selective usage of sources it has the place of a 'turkish pov-vehicle'... Concerning the title, it expresses the clear turkish pov, talking about 'occupation'... for the greeks, it was 'liberation' (having in mind that the majority of the population were Greeks). in addition, the Greek army landed in the city under permission of an international treaty (the one of Sevres), which had been signed by the then legitimate turkish government. Apropos, a possible article named Occupation of Smyrni 9 September 1922-July 24 1923, talking about the turkish control of the city until the signing of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Lausanne_64b1.html" title="Treaty of Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a>, would be more legitimate, since the turks of Kemal took a city with Greek majority, without being legitimised to do so under any treaty... Furthermore, the city's name was 'Smyrni' that time, not Izmir (also have in mind about this how the majority of the city's population and the world, or even the Ottoman administration called the city). I would agree with NikoSilver in the creation of an article named Greek administration of Ionia, 1919-1922, since: 1. this is the most NPOV title, and 2. it would talk about the whole area under Greek control (roughly corresponding to the histori region of <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionia.html" title="Ionia">Ionia</a>). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 06:51, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We have been here before, Greece occupied izmir a whole year before the Treaty of Sevres was signed, that is why its presence is referred to as occupation by historians. Even George Horton uses the term "Greek occupation of Smyrna". So your claim it landed under the provisions of a treaty is false. Second, invading a territory with the same ethnicity does not make it a liberation. It is still the territory of another sovereign. But all this is pointless, the title of this article is the most commonly used term for the events and it can be verified through impartial third party sources. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 10:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Garnet: I've no idea if my answer will be pointless, but if u look in the historic facts, u will see that Smyrni, at the time of the landing of the Greek army was not territory of another sovereign... The Ottoman Empire had been defeated in WWI, and so had sovereignty nowhere... (unless someone would thing he is ready to talk about 'French occupation of Alsace and Larraine...' (again, prior to the signing of a treaty). but even if we accept that the Ottoman Empire still was sovereign, the Greece administered the area, did not conquer it.... (that's why the ottoman flags remained in their place and there was a committement for a referendum). moreover, saying that since the treaty of Serves was not yet signed, we are free to name the article occupation, i'll have to remind u that the article does not cover the period 1919-1920, but more... In addition, under this pretext i can create another article, 'Turkish occupation of Smyrni 1922-1923', where the 'Great Fire' will be also discussed (more or less it would be as povfork as this one). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 19:11, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This debate seriously doesn't belong here, but just for the record: Being defeated in a war does not strip a state of its sovereignty over its territory, according to early 20th century international law.

<dd>My point is that as much legitimate it may be to call the greek administration of Smyrni as 'occupation', the same validity could apply to the territories Germany, Austia-Hungary, or anyone else's who was defeated in WWI (early 20th cent.). But it seems that the Germans are not pushing any pov concerning Gdansk or Lorraine...

<li><b>Comment</b>: I was the first to suggest a <b>merge</b> into the mother article, but that's not a matter of deletion and should preferably be discussed on the article talk page and not here. I'd be in favour of a merge because in principle I'm not a friend of splitting controversial topics up into a multitude of subarticles, as happens unfortunately far too often. I do <i>not</i> endorse the arguments made by the nominator in the second paragraph of his nomination; in my view, both "occupation" and the name "Izmir" are perfectly legitimate here. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:10, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see your point. To my knowledge, there weren't any events <i>after</i> the war.

<dd>No, strike what I said. I misremembered what I had read. I don't think there is any claim that the occupation extended beyond the end of the war. Re-reading the above, it appears that the Turks retook Smyrna after the end of the war. In which case, the occupation COULD be part of the article on the war or it could be separate. The question remains... is there enough encyclopedic material to warrant a separate article on the occupatio alone? Based on what's in the article now as opposed to what is in the article on the war now, I think there could be but it's a judgment call. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 09:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Let me be more clear. The article on the war has only two paragraphs on the Occupation of Smyrna. The Occupation of Izmir article has much more than that and can stand on its own as an article. If the Occupation of Izmir article were only two paragraphs, it would be a definite candidate for merging into the article on the war. However, because the Occupation of Izmir article is as big as it is, it is a judgment call whether to merge all of that info back into the article on the war, thus expanding the two paragraph section into a much larger section. I could support the merge or the keeping of the article as a stand-alone. I lean towards the keeping of the article as a stand-alone but, as I said, it's a judgment call.</dd>
<dd>If the Occupation of Izmir article is merged into the article on the war, it might be considered to be taking up a disproportionate amount of space in the article on the war. This is a good argument for pulling out the details of the occupation and having it be in a separate article.</dd>
<dd>If the Occupation of Izmir article were much larger than it is right now, there would be no question that the article should be a stand-alone.</dd>
<dd>Thus, I don't see this as being a POV fork issue at all. IMO, it's only a question of whether there is enough encyclopedic material to warrant a separate article. I think the answer is "Yes, just barely".</dd>

In my defense, that other text was not clearly identified by the section headings as relevant to Smyrna. I have added in section headings to help the reader understand the flow of the article on the war. At this point, I am sitting on the fence, leaning towards a merge of the two articles. I have changed my vote above accordingly. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 17:29, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The whole argument that it needs merging because of the lack of content is pointless. No one is disputing its relevance or notability, only the amount of content, but this is something which can be expanded in time, and which i did intend to expand (i only rewrote and sourced it a couple of weeks ago). If it is merged, then put simply, i will recreate and expand it when i have time to do so. But it is unfair that other editors will not have the chance to expand it, and the onus will rest on me to research and expand the article to a state which will survive another merge request. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 18:36, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, there is a misconception here that the occupation of Izmir and the Greco-Turkish war were one and the same thing. The Occupation of Izmir was only one stage of the war. The others include, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC_8ed7.html" title="First Battle of İnönü">First Battle of İnönü</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC_a9c5.html" title="Second Battle of İnönü">Second Battle of İnönü</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Sakarya_7c4a.html" title="Battle of Sakarya">Battle of Sakarya</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dumlup%C4%B1nar_039c.html" title="Battle of Dumlupınar">Battle of Dumlupınar</a>, and finally the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_Smyrna_c397.html" title="Great Fire of Smyrna">Great Fire of Smyrna</a>. These are all significant stages of the Greco-Turkish war. The current level of content should not detract from the fact that it is a notable part of the war which deserves its own article. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 18:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That doesn't make sense, the greeks attacked and occupied Izmir which was part of Turkey, just because most of the people there were greek doesn't mean it doesn't count as an occupation. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmanalp_531b.html" title="User:Armanalp">Armanalp</a> 18:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
