No. Did the user repeatedly remove AfD notices from the articles he or she was working on until an admin blocked them? Yes. In my opinion, no apology necessary for using the term "possible malicious motive," especially given Fan1967's research.

<dd>Is there a <i>well documented</i> cast (like more than one person)? Is there a <i>well documented</i> shooting schedule? Without those things, I think there are serious problems with <i>almost certain</i>. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 15:56, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For the matter of including the movie in Wikipedia, I base myself in one of the WP:NOT guidelines: supposing the movie had already been released, would it be a fair article? From what I know, it is the sequel of a notable movie (that has its own <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stir_of_Echoes_6e9c.html" title="Stir of Echoes">article</a> at Wikipedia). We have the producers, director, screenwriter, main actor, distributor and estimated date of both shooting begin and display. Knowing <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Lowe_ed9d.html" title="Rob Lowe">Rob Lowe</a> is starring it (just to point my neutrality, I have never heard about him until this AFD), and knowing that in out of 26 movies he acted (according to his article), 23 have articles, I believe this article could exist as a stub. That behaviour is common in the cvg environment in Wikipedia, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Avatar%7E_The_Last_Airbender_%28video_game%29_dd3b.html" title="Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)">Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:17, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem lies in your very first sentence. "<i>Supposing the movie had already been released</i>". It hasn't, and as cited a few times above, Wikipedia has very clear guidelines regarding including speculative articles. —&#160;<span style="font-size: 88%; font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><font color="#009900"><b>Mike</b></font></a></span>&#160;•&#160; 16:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but it also has to be "almost certain to take place". Until a film reaches theaters, that's almost an impossible criterion to meet. IMDB is very unreliable for things like that (Boondock Saints 2 comes to mind), and whether an article in Vogue constitutes "well-documented" speculation is certainly debatable. I'm not trying to change your vote (although, after this lengthy of a discussion, I don't think I'd call it a "weak" keep), just offering info. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody has disputed the notability, <i>if the movie existed</i>. The question is whether there is enough evidence it actually will. And the next time somebody tries to claim Variety as a source, it would be nice if they could actually post a link <i>to Variety</i> instead of a rumor-mill site that says "Variety reports that".

<dd>(edit conflict) I can change it (as I did many times in the past) if it is probed this movie is a hoax (in example, the Variety source from which all these media sites did not exist) or there wasn't at least a confirmed actor, the director and distributor (like in X-Men 4). Note that these are my own thoughts based on the policy, and why I support this movie but not X-Men 4. The Variety article exists <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943335?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943335?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and so far there are that minimun of elements _for me_ (including being the sequel of a movie that is considered notable in Wikipedia). If tomorrow this Lowe denies he will be starring the movie, I would change it to <i>Weak Delete</i> because it is just a step behind becoming Wikipedia worthy. The <i>Weak</i> qualifier in this case is not because I am unsure, but instead because, right now, it has the minimun elements for notability I require. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 17:52, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, now read the crystal ball stuff closer. If things are verifiable - and this is - it can be kept. Is the event notable? Absolutely, it's a sequel to a major motion picture, and it stars Rob Lowe. Seems like it doesn't violate either of your reasons. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:24, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are you going to badger <i>everyone</i> that votes to delete this? Kind of poor form, isn't it? <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 22:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a discussion. If pointing out faulty logic is badgering, then perhaps I will be. But when people cite policy as a reason for deletion, and cite it incorrectly, should they not be pointed out? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:44, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If they were clearly, obviously wrong, sure. But since your interpretation of that provision is only shared by about half of this page... well, it's up to you, I guess, but it just seems a little heavy-handed to me. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 01:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b><strike><b>Delete</b> Aggressive mass crystalballism. I don't take to IMDB pages that are pre-production, which in IMDB terms are 'rumors'. IMDB&#160;!= notable, as IMDB lists <i>everything</i> that appears in TV or movies, in the smallest degree.</strike> Ahh, vote change.

<li>Crystal ballism is for issues that cannot be verified. <i>Variety</i>, a well respected entertainment publication, verifies this quite clearly. How does this qualify as "mass crystalballism?" --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 11:34, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Discussing every Delete vote does nothing, and may annoy some. You had had your opportunity of establishing why it should be kept in your vote, there is no need to discuss every vote, especially if they are not <i>Weak</i> votes. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 13:54, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We disagree. Certainly, if people are annoyed by someone pointing out their faulty citing of policy, people could be annoyed by faulty citing of policy in a deletion discussion, too. Discussing every delete vote (which, BTW, I have not done) does plenty - it notifies the closing party that there is a problem with the rationale given. AfD, being a discussion, almost requires it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:56, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The one who will close will read all the votes and determine which ones are correct. You have already explained why it should be kept. Letting an "I disagree" in most Delete votes (better?) does not add to the discussion. I <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and think someone who votes have read all the previous votes and determined which one was correct (if any), and supported that. AFD is a discussion, yes, but in a discussion with friends you don't just shake your head and say "You are wrong." after hearing every opinion. Once you give all the arguments you can think of, it is better to sit down, take a breath, and watch the development of the discussion.
