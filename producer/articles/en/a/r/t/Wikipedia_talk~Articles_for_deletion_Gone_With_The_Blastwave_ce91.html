<p>I would argue against the proposal for deletion on the grounds that the website we are talking about is currently voted among the top 10 webcomics on Buzzcomics.com, and is still growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Also take into consideration the inaccuracies of Alexa, since it only monitors a certain group of people. For example, a lot of people don't want toolbars in their web-browsers, and when less than 1% of the world's internet users have even downloaded the toolbar, it can easily be incorrect, since different people go to different sites.</p>
<p>Quote from Alexa.com:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In addition to the biases above, the Alexa user base is only a sample of the Internet population, and sites with relatively low traffic will not be accurately ranked by Alexa due to the statistical limitations of the sample. Alexa's data come from a large sample of several million Alexa Toolbar users; however, this is not large enough to accurately determine the rankings of sites with fewer than roughly 1,000 total monthly visitors. Generally, Traffic Rankings of 100,000+ should be regarded as not reliable because the amount of data we receive is not statistically significant."</dd>

<dd>It covers a representative sample- so do <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nielsen_Ratings_70fa.html" title="Nielsen Ratings">Nielsen Ratings</a>. Yes, the numbers are not active, but overall, it's generally close on the rank, and when the site hosting it, not even the comic itself, is that low, it's probably not visited very much. Anyway, if you disagree with it, you're allowed to remove the template. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 02:52, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seriously, how do people still trust Alexa? Their stats are obtained through a toolbar in IE, and not so long ago, their software was considered spyware because of the surrepticious way it just popped in people's computers... Yes, I'm ranting, but how does a former spyware company suddenly get their image so clean as to serve as a meter of popularity of a website? Their bar isn't even much widespread. If you are considering an article for deletion, you should get another means to measure the page rank, especially when we are talking about a webcomic, a site with one and only one purpose, and a limited audience by nature. 85.138.58.241 21:35, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh and may I suggest that for webcomics, buzzcomix and topwebcomics are probably better ways to measure the popularity? GWB is in the top10 at buzzcomix, but much lower at topwebcomics since Morr only registered in that site yesterday. 85.138.58.241 21:38, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So wait... Does alexa actually calculate the rank by the info it gets from only those people who have a toolbar installed in their IE? I mean... that... is. just. silly. If so, it should be stated that only about 32% of my visitors use IE. (Morriperkele 22:45, 22 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>There is nothing anywhere in any deletion criteria that says an article should be deleted because of it is about something obscure, regardless of the source. 166.70.7.139 22:50, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, there is. An article's subject should have a certain notability, or else people could come here and write about their fantastic randomly-made-yesterday webcomic with a grand total of 10 readers. However, I feel that GWTB is well past that stage, with both a history and a fanbsae large enough to write an article about; at least when it is among the top 10 on Buzzcomics. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainman_16b7.html" title="User:Brainman">Brainman</a> 22:58, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, what would be enough traffic then? Current monthly report says 25 000 distinct hosts served (not that is really anything to brag about). Or was the issue in the quality of the article? (Morriperkele 23:48, 22 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Check this out: <a href="http://download.alexa.com/index.cgi" class="external free" title="http://download.alexa.com/index.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://download.alexa.com/index.cgi</a> Quote: "*System Requirements: Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer 5.0 or newer See the alternatives for Firefox users." So this actually means that Firefox users can also install this... crapware, but not the official one from alexa... Great, wow, I wonder how many people switch from IE to FF just to continue being buggered by crapware. The most incredible fact is that the alexa page rank is generally regarded throughout the internet as a valid indicator of a site's popularity. It boggles the mind. And as I already pointed out, even if it was valid, it is not a good indicator for webcomics, for obvious reasons. Oh btw I post at the shoutbox as Wraith. 85.138.58.241 00:18, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Shouldn't this be a formal AfD rather than a talk page thread? This seems to be non-standard. Wp:WEB no longer considers Alexa rankings a valid measure of notability, so I think that can be dismissed quickly. The notability criteria, however, does need to be addressed. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 04:28, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article is currently <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prodded</a>. Anyone can contest the prod by removing the template, and it would have to go to AfD to get deleted. Yes, Alexa isn't in WP:WEB, but that doesn't mean it doesn't help prove that this isn't notable. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 05:55, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The thing is, this already IS pretty notable for a webcomic, and still gaining more regular visitors. I will not remove the template, I'd prefer to actually prove that this IS notable for a webcomic. Wraith 82.154.70.62 08:31, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
