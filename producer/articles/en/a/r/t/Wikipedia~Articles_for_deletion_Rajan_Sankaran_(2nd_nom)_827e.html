<p>Despite confident assertions to the contrary in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajan_Sankaran_d416.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajan Sankaran">the last AfD</a>, the article still doesn't assert notability, and no evidence for his notability has ever been provided. Indeed, it's practically at speedy delete level at the moment because of this. Certainly, if there's actual evidence that fits <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and so on that shows he's notable, and we can use them to improve the article, he shouldn't be deleted, but no such evidence exists in the article, and, even in the last AfD, none was ever provided.</p>
<p>Allow me to summarise the current article, because it might help anyone objecting to the deletion see why it needs improved:</p>
<p>Rajan Sankaran is educated as a homeopath, and has a business he inherited from his father. He developed a few theories about homeopathy, and self-publishes books <a href="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/company.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/company.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (note the company site is a subpage of his website) and has a computer program for sale <a href="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/vquest/vquest.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/vquest/vquest.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He has learned an effective way to get information from patients - just like every new practitioner of any form of medicine, conventional or alternative, does after a time.</p>
<p>If there's more about him that makes him unambiguously notable, please, please, add it to the article. Because the current article is not showing it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 06:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>NOTE FROM NOMINATOR</b>: Since this nomination (and after most of the votes), Abridged has improved the article significantly.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom's reasoning.

I'm not sure present notability guidelines address this problem.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> A very notable homeopath. His books are widely distributed and influential<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22influential%22+rajan+sankaran&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22influential%22+rajan+sankaran&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. He lectures to sold-out audiences around the world. He is frequently cited in other publications in his field. His writings have been incorporated into the main homeopathic databases. Note that he's far more notable than <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Campbell_af7d.html" title="Anthony Campbell">Anthony Campbell</a>, a virtually unknown critic of homeopathy that <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> and others have supported in an AFD. It is especially fascinating that the points they used to support Campbell (i.e. editor of a homeopathic journal, prominent member of an association, author of a number of books) are, in Sankaran's case not given any validity. The only discernible difference between the two (other than Sankaran being obviously more well-known and respected) is that one has criticized homeopathy and one has promoted it. There has been an obvious effort to remove articles about extremely well-known and well-regarded homeopaths (the AFD for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Vithoulkas_c798.html" title="George Vithoulkas">George Vithoulkas</a> was a striking, even breathtaking example) and to promote articles of insignificant critics. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 16:29, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. DGG has a good point in that we probably should be comparing notability to the notability of others in the field. But this begs the question then: despite insistence otherwise, would this actually make notability subjective? --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 18:55, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> following improvements to article. Notability needs to be assessed as against other homeopaths, not the medical profession generally.
