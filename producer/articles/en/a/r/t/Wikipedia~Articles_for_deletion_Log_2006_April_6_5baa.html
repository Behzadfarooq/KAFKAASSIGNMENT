<dd>That's a little misleading. Virtually all verifiable real school articles for several months have been kept. Looking over a year, it's the overwhelming majority. It's often the those wishing to delete, which will point this out. We don't delete municipalities, and we don't delete schools, if they are verifiable. I find it annoying that some people miscontrue deletions of schools lacking verifiability (which I've voted and/or nominated for deletion) as being a general allowance for deleting a verifiable school. We should not be deleting articles on an entirely random basis, as you're currently seeking. Please, don't try to go back in time, and undo what's done. This is a waste of time, and we all know it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:37, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I don't think you mean to misinform, your comments are potentially misleading. You say don't "undo what's done" as if there had been some inflection point where policy changed. That is not the case. There is no consensus on a policy to keep all schools. The fact is we <b>do</b> delete schools that are not notable. I agree with you that we should not be deleting articles randomly, we should be doing so based on their importance or non-importance. The waste of time is in creating articles on non-notable subjects, which then take time to delete or (worse) take time to police them for up-to-dateness and vandalism in the case they are kept. Editor fatique is a real problem on these non-notable articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 22:47, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Amen. The vandals tend to hit the big articles which makes it really frustrating if you're trying to do a good edit on one of them. Yes, some do vandalize the small articles, but there are bots and people who just pay attention to the "recent changes" page to take care of that. Even if vandals DID focus on "small" articles that would not be a legitimate reason to delete, as we don't delete based on the possibility of vandalism. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowPigNowNow_a5b5.html" title="User:YellowPigNowNow">YellowPigNowNow</a> 23:28, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you're saying John Seigenthaler didn't deserve a page? Anyway, defamatory content can, and often is, posted on chemical pages that are not commonly viewed, but are important nonetheless. The problem isn't with obscure articles. It's with anonymous vandals. However, Wikipedia is based on the idea that anyone can edit, so vandalism is a risk the community is obviously willing to take. I don't think the possibility of vandalism existing in the future is a proper concern in the deletion process, but I realize you feel differently. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowPigNowNow_a5b5.html" title="User:YellowPigNowNow">YellowPigNowNow</a> 00:28, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Let's see. You can't find anything wrong with the current content (or history since June), so you manufacture some scenerio that might happen in the future. Shall we also delete all the RAMBOT township articles because somebody might write "<i>Mayor skinner molested me.</i>"? As somebody who regularly edits and watches many school articles, I *know* how absurd your claims regarding vandalism are (though like any article area, it obviously exists as a problem). As somebody who rarely edits school articles (except to nominate them) you simply don't know what you are talking about. At least research something before commenting. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:36, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(resetting indent) I'm not digging through deletions outcomes on schools becuase it is irrelevant how many schools have or have not been kept in the last few months or the last few years. Just because a <a href="../../../c/a/b/WP%7ECABAL_ad8b.html" title="WP:CABAL">cabal</a> has formed to try to blindly keep all school articles, regardless of notability, does not mean that the rest of us are to be intimidated. The fact is that even with the cabal to protect every school-phone-book entry, there has been no change in policy to protect schools from deletion. My arguments about vandalism apply not just to schools but to all non-notable articles. Schools are no different from restaurants or shopping malls. If there is something special about them, then by all means lets have an article about them. If not, then lets delete them and get on with more important articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 01:45, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many of us spent a lot of time (wasted judging buy your comments here) discussing this issue. I personally started out from your viewpoint. However at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> the only possible compromise was the merge to district or town page with no loss of content and a redirect in place. You may well disagree with this but until you have gone through the archives you will not appreciate this position. Not to mention reopening the can of worms will just waste a huge amount of time from your own perspective. The original goal was to reduce the number of school AfD's since they serve no purpose other than to cause fights. As Rob says, how many verifiable schools have been deleted recently? It is a fools errand to persue this to the end game. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 03:03, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No to being a member of the cabal (so far as I'm aware) because he does not participate in auto-pilot keep-voting. No to being intimidation because he says he thinks people should relax, which is very different to inflamatory language such as "you don't know what you are talking about". However, I think his recommendation is a bad one. Especially when he says <i>The argument "what if someone did this particular thing 100,000 times" is not a valid argument against letting them do it a few times.</i> You have essentially demonstrated what is wrong with this statement when you tout the fact that some non-notable schools have survived deletion as an argument why all non-notable schools should survive deletion. That is exactly the danger with letting these kinds of articles stand. They continually lower the bar for what is to be included here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 03:35, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Re: "you don't know what you are talking about". He has a point. Have you read through the archives on this discussion? They are long and tedious but necessary because all your arguments have been made before. As I said above, i was saying exactly what you are saying now.

<dd>What compromise would that be? What Rob is saying is that schools don't get deleted very often, so just keep them all. That is not a compromise. To answer your question, I am familiar with the debate over schools. I think some of the best arguments are in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Delete" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Delete</a>. So, yes, I know what I am talking about. I am aware some people want to keep all schools, regardless of whether there is anything special about them or not. I am aware some of these people have tried and failed to establish a policy saying we should keep all schools. I am aware we should be discussing here this individual school and whether it should be kept. Unfortunately, we are deviating off of that mark a bit. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 03:53, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

These arguments (delete, merge and keep) have been discussed to death. The compromise was that crap school articles can be merged and the school page would be maintained as a redirect. Do i think this is a good compromise? Not really. i do think it is likely to be the only comproimise that can work. Read the archives and see what you think.

<dd>I have not read every word of the discussion, but I have read large chunks of it. My favorite quote is "merged crap is still crap" - which Rob said at one point in Archive3. If I understand the context correctly, he was arguing to improve articles to good quality, versus just merging stubby stuff together to make it look more "keepable". However, there is no compromise there, as far as I can tell. Just within the past 24 hours the proposal has been marked as rejected policy<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=47213567&amp;oldid=47209185" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=47213567&amp;oldid=47209185" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and Rob agreed to this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=47214505&amp;oldid=47214348" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=47214505&amp;oldid=47214348" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Therefore, I don't see how any compromise has been reached. I see that we are left to discuss each case here on its merits, just as we do for non-school articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think Rob supports that move since there is a description of how to write a school page on the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. i did notice man in blacks 'reject tag' although i was not quite sure what it meant. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html#Current_proposal_for_schools" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools#Current_proposal_for_schools</a> seemed to be a workable solution to keep schools out of AfD and therefore to stop these huge long discussions which are time sinks. i still think that solution is better than the strife that comes from AfD and schools.

<dd>I and probably most people, didn't really love the merger compromise. But, we accepted it, as the best so far. I voted to oppose it as *official* policy or guiedline. But, it was me, who put the merge compromise wording onto to the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> page itself (so it wasn't just on the talk page). I also regularly cited it in AFD. This was an effort, to support compromise, even when the compromise, wasn't my personal version. We all gotta live with a lot of stuff we don't like. That's the only way this thing works. You have to understand the compromise doesn't have to be official, to be used. No new policy is needed to do merges, as policy has always allowed that as a regular editing decision. However, some people misuse <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>, and mistakenly used it to justify deletion. All the confusion over its meaning, led me to accept labelling it as a rejected guideline. Anyways. For this article here, I will happily accept a merge/redirect, even though it's not a perfect solution. I don't vote "merge" per se, because some misinterpret it as being "like delete", which it is not. Paradoxically, you've increased the chances for a stand-alone article. Had you just done a redirect, I doubt anybody would have minded. I have done nothing to prevent a compromise, and we can easily have a compromise for this article. Once the AFD is over, a discussion of what to (e.g. merging) can be done. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:53, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Is it necessary for books to sell in order for someone to count as notable enough for Wikpedia? The charge in the archived articles that the book on Macros was from a subsidy press diminished the claims of notability for that volume, but what about the others? Standards for professors is that their publication exceeds that of the average prof at a university, right? There's no real requirement that people read the books they publish. This man isn't a prof, but he seems to have published a number of books in Tamil fiction. I'm not familiar with either him or his books and haven't read any Tamil literature in 15 years, but just judging in terms of the article, it seems NPOV and sufficiently notable for a keep. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 06:33, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> mindful of systemic bias, maybe the lack of google hits is due to searching using the Roman alphabet and/or searching with one of several possible spellings. But the fact that it was originally a vanity article and the list of publications is shaky (marginal vanity, little readership) makes me lean toward delete. Change to a keep if someone familiar with Tamil literature thinks this guy is notable. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 07:05, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay, this one is a bit tricky. There is, of course, a porn star named <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_%28porn_star%29.html" title="Gauge (porn star)">Gauge</a>, who is undoubtedly very notable as an adult actress. This article, however, is about a male adult actor. Because the article is unreferenced, I'm finding it difficult to verify his existence let alone notability. Because of Gauge's (the actress) overwhelming success in adult entertainment, Google is proving futile in that regard. I am guessing that the subject is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0572806/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxmYj11fHBuPTB8cT1HYXVnZXxleD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=3;ft=3;fm=1" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0572806/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxmYj11fHBuPTB8cT1HYXVnZXxleD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=3;ft=3;fm=1" rel="nofollow">Gauge McLeod</a>, because that is the only other "Gauge" listed on IMDB. If this is the case, then it is a very obscure actor with only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Gauge+McLeod%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Gauge+McLeod%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">204 Google hits and only 3 unique.</a> I would say that this isn't very noteworthy. I am perfectly willing to see this article kept if it can be sourced and notability can be shown for its subject.

<li><b>Tentative delete</b> googling for gauge and gay also shows up too many unrelated things. However none of them on the first page seem to refer to this person.

<p>We aren't trying to advertise our mod, just giving information, since in the whole article is no web or file link to it. If you want we could put a file link to verify it.</p>

<dd>Even if this article is not an advertisement, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and as such is not the place for information on non-notable game mods, however good they may be. In order for this article to be kept, there needs to be some sort of reason why this mod is notable such as a review by a major site, an appearance in a news article, etc. Also, articles shouldn't be based on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 03:03, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We were trying to make the mod when one of our friends created this page, so i thought that i should make it a little worthwile for viewing. If it is no good, then delete it, but please let me know if you do. -Commander Bubble 03:25, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All the Vandalism was done by some other people who don't personally like some of one of the users. They have a vendetta against each other and are intent on damaging anything he does. It was possibly Amarsbar as well. -Commander Bubble 03:28, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> I don't think that this even needs explaning. This, IMO, is what's wrong with Wiki. Completely useless lists that help no one and provide no useful information. This doesn't meet the crieria laid out at <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> and certainly doesn't meet any kind of notability criteria I could come up with.

<li><b>Keep</b> The current list is highly inaccurate (as another poster has correctly said, "Most porn starts *DO NOT* deepthroat"). Never-the-less, the list has value even though it is likely to always be somewhat out of date and open to debate. Personally I don't think something should be deleted just because it is a target for vandalism, it should just be made to be reasonably accurate and then increase the difficulty of editing (as has been done with articles in the political arena).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> article is not self promotional, the last paragraph (as of this writing) in fact clearly states that the quality is debated. Moreover, this can be re-written, and will be because Lunar Anime has changed entirely since the article was deleted in December. However, CSD A7 (the article under which the article was originally deleted), is completely different from the nomination (<i>vanity self promoting page about anime group. 100% original research as well.</i>). If the issue is notability, then please don't be quick to judge. I will now re-write the article so that the group is clearly notable (at least, compared to fansub groups). Just for the record, I am in no way associated with Lunar Anime. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 12:43, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Lunar is very notable within the fansubs community, but in truth we're talking about a niche within a niche. I would support their inclusion as an example of a fansub community, though I also have to admit it does present an issue of what groups are notable - does that make Lunar notable and, say, <a href="http://www.ayu-anime.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.ayu-anime.net/" rel="nofollow">Ayu fansubs</a> not? Does it make a case of quality vs quantity (Lunar is known for the former and derided for (lack of) the latter)? In any case, they are one of the more notable groups out there, so I suggest the keep, with the qualification that the article be vastly improved; otherwise <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fansub.html" title="Fansub">Fansub</a>--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 12:57, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, fansubbers are not notable. Less presense than other net groups that wikipedia documents, outside anything but anime-fansub-watchers (which is in the order of a hundred thousand to a million people worldwide). Also, as the lifetime and membership of these groups varies so wildly, and there's no secondary sources to base an article off at all, I don't see how any viable article can be written on them at all. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 13:56, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I doubt there are only one million fansub watchers, as Lunar's subs, without Bleach (which is more popular than all its other series combined), make up over 3 million downloads. Moreover, just because there isn't an article on Dattebayo Fansubs (assuming you were referring to them with the GNAA link) doesn't automatically mean there shouldn't be one. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 15:03, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're misrepresenting the numbers, obviously many of the same people watch more than just one show, so you can't add torrent figures and claim independant users. Also, no, I was saying that the GNAA are more notable, and have a wider impact, than any fansubbers. When someone takes a group to court or something that gets *a specific group* recognition outside the really quite small fansub-culture arena, then maybe there'll be something to write an article on. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 17:56, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see why <b>everyone</b> is reacting so badly to this article. "Women's Logic" is a term, it is a noun just like "encyclopedia" or "the internet". If you google the term, beyond some joke pages made to ridicule women, you will find serious discussions on how women and men in general approach situations differently. There are entire businesses which sell products catered to help men understand "Women's Logic" so that Men can become more successful with Women; Women's Logic is a thing which evidently most men don't understand. <a href="http://www.alovelinksplus.com/advice/the_dating_wizard/understanding_womens_logic.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.alovelinksplus.com/advice/the_dating_wizard/understanding_womens_logic.htm" rel="nofollow">The Dating Wizard: Understanding Women's Logic</a>. I wasn't trying to be rude or sexist, I started this article to try and bridge the gap between the male understanding of the world and the female's understanding of the world. Evidently, since most people refer the world as a man's world, there is a large disparity between the sexes. <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_Differences_1fda.html" title="Gender Differences">Gender Differences</a> primarily focuses on physcial differences this article could focus on mental differences between the sexes. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelendin_c15f.html" title="User:Celendin">Celendin</a> 10:26, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an implication that irrational behaviour is a function of faulty logic. It's not. Women know perfectly well when they are being illogical, just the same as men. Why a man or woman might <i>choose</i> to behave illogically, and why that behaviour might be successful, is something completely different. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 10:54, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that is not really a reason to delete the article. The implication of "faulty logic" is a POV shared by many men, but it isn't really a reason why we shouldn't describe "Women's Logic."
<ul>
<li>Try this, then. Wikipedia isn't a blog, a bulletin board or a soapbox.

</ul>
</li>
<li>By creating an article solely about women you’ll assuming that being a man is natural and that women are an oddity. A nearly %50-%50 split in birth rates doesn't support this. Your also assuming that male psychology is easy to see and trivial.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You uncritically accept Ancient Greek views of women. The ‘Women's Logic applied to Dating doesn't fit with hard research into hunter gatherers. You also say most women would support Mede killing her children but offer no support.</dd>

<ul>
<li>The article isn't even about <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a>, it's about motivations and behaviour.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There may be several pages where bits and pieces of this material might be merged to: no doubt references for most of these beliefs are out there. But <i>this</i> article seems a blunderbuss shot of pop-culture clichés about the difference between the sexes, assembled under a silly title.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Yes, there is a bit of worthwhile content here, once it is described as a POV and not simply asserted as a fact, but it belongs in other articles.

<dd>In fairness, I think Celendin was arguing that this organizations which purport to describe "women's logic" are examples of a phenomenon which exists and therefore merits an article, not that thie article should itself help men become more successful with women. On the other hand, the article was not written with that sort of distance from the subject in mind. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 19:23, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not changing my delete vote, but I think the pendulum has come a bit too far here. Certainly this article is biased and absurd, but the phenomenon it is attempting to describe -- that many men today regard women as having a unique and irrational style of reasoning -- is a real one, and does deserve to be mentioned somewhere. This idea is the reason for the success of garbage like <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_Are_from_Mars%2C_Women_Are_from_Venus_6a1a.html" title="Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus">Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</a></i>. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 19:23, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Enterprise Audit Shell was just released this month. Google doesn't know much about it yet.</p>
<p>The official annoucement has been recorded in the sudo archives at: <a href="http://www.sudo.ws/pipermail/sudo-announce/2006-March/000062.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sudo.ws/pipermail/sudo-announce/2006-March/000062.html" rel="nofollow">Officia Enterprise Audit Shell announcement on sudo mailing list</a></p>

<li><a href="http://eas.strchr.net/" class="external text" title="http://eas.strchr.net/" rel="nofollow">Official EAS Support Forum</a></li>
</ul>
<p>EAS has a significant history. Simply do a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sudosh" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sudosh" rel="nofollow">Google Search for Sudosh</a>. EAS is the new version of Sudosh, hence the release 2.0.00.</p>
<p>Regardless of EAS started out on Wikipedia as AFB, it no longer fits the requirements for deletion. The article isn't a commercial advertisement, it's free Open Source software. The article isn't a vanity page about myself, I don't even have a page about myself on Wikipedia. No where in the article is my name mentioned. The article has been rewritten to be an informative and descriptive about the software. The article also meets the Software requirements that it must be innovative. The entire reason why <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudosh.html" title="Sudosh">Sudosh</a> is so popular (all the Fortune 100 companies use it and many branches of the government) is because of its innovation. EAS replaced Sudosh and added newer innovative features on top of it.</p>
<p>The article has been completely cleaned up to fit the Wiki guidelines and is in similiar format to other <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Source_1846.html" title="Open Source">Open Source</a> software like <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudo.html" title="Sudo">sudo</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudosh.html" title="Sudosh">sudosh</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apache.html" title="Apache">apache</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dd>By deleting this article you are effectively killing the EAS Open Source project because Wiki has a strong link to Google.

EAS is the alternative to PowerBroker, which costs $1,500 per server installed. EAS is free. Why delete it? If it gets deleted, someone else will add it, and we'll go through this all over again.

<dd>Saying EAS is sudosh is complete bullcrap, sudosh is sudosh. Feature-rich means nothing. This is an advertisement for EAS, it's trying to convince people that EAS is better than sudosh. If you want this article to stay you will have to make it read like an article rather than a pamphlet. If this is deleted it will be a good thing, then the person who comes along to make the new article may make one that read like an encyclopedia entry, rather than an advertisement. 65.95.124.5 04:03, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>EAS is sudosh. I'm the author of both sudosh and EAS. I know. This isn't an advertisement. I gain nothing from this, I receive no money or sales from this. All of this software is open source. I don't need to convience people that EAS is better than sudosh. Check out the sudosh mailing list yourself, you will see tons of feature requests back from last year. I worked for 1 year adding these features and what grew from the requests was a new version which I simply called EAS because a lot of the original functionality has changed. The article doesn't read like a pamplet, if you want it better, let it stay and people will edit the article, just like sudosh has been editted. Dhanks 04:07, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> If EAS is really sudosh 2.0, why go through all the trouble of renaming it and just add a small section about it to the sudosh page? Satisfied customers would naturally look for an updated version of what they already own instead of looking up a whole new project. Simply using wikipedia to manipulate google search rankings is just plain <b>wrong</b> IMHO. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBige1977_d3fc.html" title="User:Bige1977">Bige1977</a> 04:13, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> EAS has branched from sudosh and turned into its own framework leaving sudosh behind. The name change was required. This article WAS NOT created to change the ranks in Google -- it was created to let people KNOW ABOUT THE NAME CHANGE. I've made comments in the article <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudosh.html" title="Sudosh">sudosh</a> that the name has changed to EAS. Obviously EAS has more to document that Sudosh, merging the articles would be confusing and large. Dhanks 04:20, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Compromise Proposal</b> I think it is more likely at this time that a user of sudosh, the current established product, would enter the query sudossh to find more information about enhancements, future versions, or information on competing products. Since Open Enterprise Shell claims to be sudosh version 2.0, in the interiem it should be best that it stay in the sudosh article. If in the future various open source unixish distros decide to include open enterprise shell, it then should get its own page in a more abbreviated form than it is now. Personally I think that Dhanks energy should be promoting his fork of sudossh to be included as a package with various unix/bsd distributions which would be greatly more important to his market share than a mere wikipedia article. <i>For now Enterprise Open Shell should be a redirect to sudosh, if dhanks promises not do change the redirect.. Sudosh should mention with a link to his project page that Enterprise Open Shell is a new fork of it.</i> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBige1977_d3fc.html" title="User:Bige1977">Bige1977</a> 07:30, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm the article's creator. I agree the article's subject is too trivial to merit an entry. I created it to see if <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_N_f8bb.html" title="User:Matt N">Matt N</a> would seek and destroy the article. Matt has engaged in a revert war to prevent the inclusion of a link to <a href="http://www.xenisucks.com" class="external free" title="http://www.xenisucks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.xenisucks.com</a> in the <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xeni_Jardin_8fc4.html" title="Xeni Jardin">Xeni Jardin</a> article. As far as the "poorly written" dig, Matt himself is responsible for removing content that made the article <i>slightly</i> more encyclopaedic. Matt is very fond of Xeni Jardin, and works hard to protect her Wiki presence. That said, I agree the article should be removed. I also think Matt should permit a xenisucks link in the Xeni Jardin article. Tafinucane 23:33, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, there's now material that doesn't appear to be a copyvio, but it still reads like an advertisement. There could be about two paragraphs of potentially encyclopedic information, tops; they can go in the main UBC article. Having a separate article here is asking for trouble.

<li><b>Maybe</b> - I think the intention was to significantly cut down the information on the main UBC article and replace it with a link to this one. As it stands now it is far too self promotional, but I'm not convinced that it can't be turned into something relevent. As I said in the talk page, I think an article naming the fraternities on campus, saying where the frats are, what they do and giving a brief history would be an acceptably noteworthy page. I don't know much about the frats and sororities, but I'm under the impression they are a reasonably important presence at UBC. <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETastyCakes_4007.html" title="User:TastyCakes">TastyCakes</a> 06:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - takes this info away from the main ubc article. Also, STOP shatering the interests of new contributors. They are adding TRUE KNOWLEDGE, that is not getting in the way of other articles, about places which are notable. UBC is a very large University, and donated content should not be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>The position espoused supra, recapitulated on Nick's userpage as "All factual information, as long as it doesn't get in the way of other factual information, should be included, open sourced, and allowed to be readily accessed through Wikipedia and its forks" is not altogether without merit; it is, though, wholly contrary to Wikipedia policy, which policy reflects a consensus of the considered and deliberate judgments of many Wikipedians. One may surely object to policy and even essay the changing of policy, but it is likely that his/her offering opinions on individual AfD discussions will not be as effective as his/her proposing broader or bolder changes to the sundry criteria of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, inasmuch as that policy, more than any deletion guidelines, which tend simply to incorporate by reference and interpret WP:NOT, is the policy most at odds with the sort of encyclopedia envisaged by Nick (I should say that I would likely disagree with the changes Nick would seek to make, but seek simply to suggest that, if a debate is to occur, it needs to occur at a different level).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This page isn't describing each individual fraternity so the fact that most Fraternities and sororities have there own page is irrelevant. It is describing the particular Greek system at UBC which is different in some ways than say a fraternity or sorority at another school. It is information and not "cruft" as some people seem to be referring it to. The information is plain and simple and there’s nothing trying to promote it, its just once again stating the facts about the Greek system at a University. This is supposed to be the most comprehensive encyclopaedia on the planet.

<dd>"Cruft" = extraneous, useless or pointless "information". Mere "information" alone doesn't make something Wikipedia-worthy; if so, my penis size or my cat's middle name (both, surely, "information") would merit Wikipedia articles. To merit inclusion, information must be <i>notable</i>. There's nothing notable here. Contrary to your assertion, the article describes nothing about the UBC frat system unusual to any other frat-bearing school; most frats have rooming houses, hold events and participate in inter-Greek councils. This boils down to a mere list meaningless to a non-UBC student and probably not meaningful to many of those. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:40, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, so writting in an article truthful information like "RGTraynor has a 2 inch dick and his cat's name is Tinkerbell Fairy the Pussy" would be cruft, as his small penis and the very wussy name for his cat would be totally extraneous, useless or pointless "information", ie Cruft. But this article, and many others tagged as "cruft" are just information that elitists and deletionists far too often label as cruft and then claim lack of notability. But guess what? RGTraylor's penis size is not included in this article. Neither is his cat's middle name. Therefore the analogy used by all you deletionists is pure bullshit and</dd>

These actions, being logically inevitable are similar to what happens when you take a breath, e.g. something that has a result so predictable as to be certain in happening.

<li><b>Keep.</b> - As I mentioned in the edit summary when I originally edited out the tag, if you check the discussion page I've made a short list of the additions that will be added to the page. I haven't had time to do it yet - but hopefully will make time later today. The 2 concerts were significant for several reasons. (i) They were the first major concerts performed by one of the biggest selling pop groups of all time. (ii) They were released on a best selling, US-platinum video. (iii) The concerts set a record in the US for the most watched Pay-Per-View concert in history - beating the previous record set by Woodstock '94. Therefore the concerts and video release are more than worthy of being noted on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmers_934f.html" title="User:Rimmers">Rimmers</a> 13:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep,</b> bad faith nomination. Aside from being identified as the largest single donor to the University of Georgia (well in excess of $20 million, with a major building and a scholarship carrying his name, he was also chairman of the executive committee at Merrill Lynch, a notable achievement in the financial field. Admittedly, this record of substantial real-world effects is hardly in the same league as the records of such Wikipedia notables as <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Amy_77d6.html" title="Air Force Amy">Air Force Amy</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craphonso_Thorpe_ccbd.html" title="Craphonso Thorpe">Craphonso Thorpe</a>, but I think it justifies his place in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Response</b>. My comment regarding bad faith is based both on a pattern of behavior by the nominator and the deceptive summary of the article he gives. Being the largest donor in the history of a major public university (in the mid- to high-eight figure range) is not appropriately described as "gave a bunch of money to his alma mater." I also think the borderline personal attack on me in his nomination comments, setting up a straw man argument, is arguably a sign of malice and bad faith. I believe that an editor who nominates an article for deletion has an obligation to accurately fairly describe the disputed matter. I think that misrepresenting the contents of the article or the nature of its subject in order to promote its deletion should be viewed as vandalous, as a deliberate action to impair the integrity of the project, since it manifests an expectation that the article would not be deleted under the application of consensus policy and guidelines, and indicates that the nominator is attempting to avoid the guideline. Frankly, I find it unsettling that so many AfD editors find it appropriate to make caustic comments about article authors -- usually charging vanity and self-promotion, forms of bad faith editing, quite often made without any sound basis -- but find it inappropriate to call those who make such baseless comments to account. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:27, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>My comment regarding bad faith is based both on a pattern of behavior by the nominator and the deceptive summary of the article he gives.</i> Looks more like it's based on anger-management issues and reading comprehension problems/mind-reading delusions. Whether Ramsey donated $20 or $20 million to his university (you know, "giv[ing] a bunch of money to his alma mater"), that's not an achievement as far as I'm concerned, which is what I said. I failed -- and still fail -- to see anything he did on the way to piling up the cash for the donations he made makes him the least bit qualified under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. There can be a difference of opinion, but that gives no call for you to, as a friend of mine puts, "make shit up" about motivations, nor to distort the English language to justify your pouting. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:51, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Schoolboy hoax, featuring a faculty including Arnold Schwarzenegger, and "Will Hung". I at first thought this was vandalism, and there was a real school article somewhere behind this that some kids had messed with. But they'd created it much as it appears here.

There's one in Scotland, but this has never been about that place. I would strongly recommend against moving to BJAODN, as it's not actually funny, and this sort of thing shouldn't be encouraged. I had prod tagged it, but decided they'd only remove it.

<li><b>Comment</b> We're sorry, in retrospect we should have put it on Encyclopedia Dramatica. I'm not sure how the rules work, but maybe our admitting it's all a sham allows it to be shifted to speedy deletion? We don't want to be blocked- at least not permanently. We didn't see it as being such a serious problem, but now we can see the issue. Sorry about this.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> i have read the book, and i liked this wikipedia entry very much. found it useful for english analysis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I the main creator of this site never intended readers to believe the school was an actual place and so I only labelled it as fictional when I realised that people were considering the school to be an actual place. The novel in which this school is found is not well known and this site is aimed mainly at a small few that have read or are interested in the contents of the book, for this reason it would be unjust to delete the site as there are some people that have genuine intrest in its contents.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> While I accept that the article was not malicious, it is certainly not verifiable, and given that the book <i>William in the Middle</i> is not listed in Wikipedia, Amazon or Google (with Orbost) I would challenge whether it is well known. To give the details of a character or institution as they exist in a novel or TV programme/film is sound, to invent details that were never the author's intent is not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article describes the fictional academy in the book fairly accurately and though the book may not be well known, who is to say that it won't have future success.
<ul>
<li>when and if the book becomes popular enough to be noteworthy, then this article may become relevant as an encyclopedic entry.

<p><b>Weak delete</b> His books are listed on Amazon.co.uk, and one of them is in the top 10,000, so must have sold some number. But the article is self-publicising, and makes no attempt to conform to a Wikipedia style.

<p>I do not beleive that this person is notable enough for an article. The relevant criteria on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> appears to be "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events", as there is no spefic bullet for people in the legal proffession. The claim of notability in the article is that he represented the Attorney General of Canada in a notable court case. However, a Google Canada search for <tt>"David Frankl" Canada</tt> gets "about 21" hits, of which 3 are about this person - and one of those is this Wikipedia article. A search on Google.com for <tt>David Frankl</tt> results in 731,000 hits; of the first 20 results two are about this David Frankl, one of which is the Wikipedia article (most of the hits seem to be about a doctor from Oregon, although there are at least three other high-rating David Frankls).</p>
<p>While a non-notable biography is a CSD criteria, this article does make a claim notability. Also based on the recently deleted <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliot_Frankl_c023.html" title="Elliot Frankl">Elliot Frankl</a> (undergoing a deletion review that will almost certainly uphold the deletion), I expect this nomination will be contested.

<li><b>Keep</b> I feel that it is notable. On other websites all over, I have seen users saying "So i herd u like..." whatever. Maybe we should just change the title to "So i herd u like" b/c they don't always use "mudkips". But mudkips was the origin. So basically, if this should be deleted for that reason than <a href="../../../o/_/r/O_RLY__dcc3.html" title="O RLY?">O RLY?</a> should be deleted at well. If I must do more research and find stuff, I will. But first, try Google searching "So i herd u like" (keep the quotes). You'll find a lot of stuff, about the MudKipClub too. But if it still doesn't seem notable, is there anywhere I can add this to another article about Internet memes and phrases? I don't know if <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a> will work, I don't know if it will fit in the quotes section or anything, and <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeviantART_5bd3.html" title="DeviantART">deviantART</a> won't work... if there is any where that it will fit elsewhere in Wikipedia, I will gladly surrender the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm a longstanding DeviantART member, and I've never "herd" of this. The associated DevART account, MudKipClub, has just 2,527 pageviews (for comparison's sake, my account has over 22,000+). The phrase gets just <b>147 unique Google hits</b>, and most of that very modest number are all from the same site (not even DeviantART, but a belgian site). Doesn't seem widespread or well-known, either on or off DeviantART. And then there's verifiability to consider... <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:27, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are several Mark Daltons of varying degrees of notability - I'd say this is one of the less notable. Total externally verifiable data: pretty much zero, if we use only reliable sources.

<p><b>Comment</b> No opinion for now on notability, but when one googles for "Mark Dalton" the first thing that shows up is his personal webpage and multiple other porn sites.

<li><b>Keep</b> if the criteria for deletion is that porn actors are not notable, then they should all be deleted. My argument is that they ARE notable in their own profession. Furthermore, the listing of porn stars allows a centralized listing of information so that you don't have to weed through the plethora of useless links and pages that have no pertinant information. If there are other "Mark Dalton"s out there, then certainly the designation "(porn star)" should alleviate the confusion. Archer 20:05, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Comment</b>: I just want to say how absurd I think it is that all of these porn star articles are going up for deletion. If you check the playboy playmates on wikipedia, you'll notice the inclusion of tons of them, many having their own pages. I did a bunch more research on this man,Mark Dalton, and he was the 2002 Men magazine man of the year, the equivalent of playmate of the year for gay men. Suggesting these are somehow unworthy, while keeping all of the rest of the articles for hot women, is just hypocritical. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowPigNowNow_a5b5.html" title="User:YellowPigNowNow">YellowPigNowNow</a> 22:43, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>KEEP--Definitely keep. Dalton is one of the most notorious/famous gay (for pay) stars circa 2006.</p>

<p>This page should not be deleted. eMoo is not only a software toy but is a cult icon in our local peer group. It is a humorous item we have and we would like to share it with the world. This is my first article and I am upset that you choose to riddicule something of ours, which I have prooved noteable. My Website is noteable as it provides graphical design services (3rd Party Reference: <a href="http://www.vgfuture.com" class="external text" title="http://www.vgfuture.com" rel="nofollow">VGFuture</a>). eMoo is neither rude or offensive and is a fully justified existant item.</p>

<dd>The reason I'm appearing to be a killjoy is because I choose to isolate the article from its author. You made a perfectly valid point that there are many policies, guidelines and criteria and it's close to impossible to know which are enforced, which are just unspokingly assumed and which are ridiculous. So, whilst this article is unlikely to threaten any endangered species, and I'm unlikely to lose too much sleep over it, I still have to make a judgement based on the various widely held perspectives about matters such as this. It just so happens there IS a widely-cited guideline for this very type of article, and since I have seen no verifiable evidence that it meets the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> the judgement I've had to make is that it is in Wikipedia's best interests to not include a somewhat frivolous advertisement.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Responding to Flapdragon: An encyclopedia is a work that deals with all fields of knowledge (it comes from the Greek words <i>enkyklios paideia,</i> meaning general or well-rounded education.) This article is not a user's guide, it simply describes the word. This includes how it is usually used by people. The fact it isn't in English is irrelevant, as that sounds like an argument to delete other entries like "<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a>," as well. That article describes how Russian is spoken. Does that mean it is a how-to?--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 21:40, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Except that "Russian" and "language" are words of <i>English</i>. So in a Spanish encyclopaedia, would you expect to find English words commonly misused by Spanish people learning to speak English? No, an encyclopaedia is definitely <i>not</i> an indiscriminate collection of "all forms of knowledge" (and the Greek etymology is neither here nor there). For example, it's not a place for bus timetables, details of how to work my washing machine or your sister's school timetable. It's also not a manual of how to do things such as change a car tyre or speak a language. Articles on the grammar of a language are not aiming to teach you to speak the language, and more than a diagram of the brain is there to help you do brain surgery. Can I suggest read you read the page on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>?

Also, Wikipedia is larger than the <i>Espasa</i> (as it is sometimes called). I have read "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>" several times, over time, and I think you are misinterpreting it. For example, there is the Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia passage, which states: "This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability . . . since Wikipedia requires no paper we can give more thorough treatments". Finally, I hope you are not inferring that the entry is a collection of indiscriminate, non-notable information, as this word is used by millions of people every day. I think it illustrates how complex the history and usage of a word can be, and how much meaning can change over time. It also illustrates the need for native speakers when preparing advertising campaigns.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 23:32, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>None of the above -- the fact that WP has lots of space, the fact that a word "is used by millions of people every day", nor incidentally the fact you've worked hard on it -- makes this an encyclopaedia article. So in your ideal world you would just go through adding every word of every known language detailing its nature, etymology and possible misuse by non-natives? That would be, well, kind of, a dictionary, wouldn't it? Just like the ones you mentioned above.

<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, because I haven't been here long. But this article does not fall under the description "tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes" that do not belong in an encyclopedia...it's not a lesson on speaking Spanish, it's an exploration of a linguistic phenomenon. You'll find other such phenomena with their own articles, such as <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucular.html" title="Nucular">nucular</a>. Whether or not someone would look up the word is irrelevant; no one can really judge what information someone will have a need for in the future.

<dd>Well, if you have a problem with the form of "embarazada" then suggest the article be moved, not deleted. Yes, "nucular" IS a word, just like "embarazada." Both have their own articles because both are examples of linguistic phenomena. I really think that because "nucular" is more well known, being English, no one's disputing its article, while this article remains under fire. <a href="../../../k/e/p/User%7EKeppa_ff7d.html" title="User:Keppa">Keppa</a> 00:00, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Really? As I've already mentioned more than once, WP is not there to teach you how to do things, for eaxmple to help you avoid pitfalls in learning a foreign language -- it's not an instruction manual, nor is it a usage guide, dictionary or manual of idiom: "Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used" if you want a verbatim quote.

<dd>I agree with you. Parts of the article do fit the passage you just quoted. But it is, for the most part, an acceptable encyclopedia article in my eyes.

It's not possible to "fix" it, since there is no scope for an article on the "subject" of <i>embarazada</i>, which is a word of Spanish not a subject like <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_grammar.html" title="Russian grammar">Russian grammar</a>.

<dd>Yes, that's true. Nothing wrong with that, though. Thanks to Primetime for pointing it out to me because of our shared interest. It's not like we have an agenda. This is still my opinion.

<dd>It's <i>exactly</i> "like you have an agenda". And yes Primetime did ask people to vote to support him. He contacted you without (AFAIK) any reason to believe you would have specific thoughts on this article, but because he saw your names on a list of people who inherently disapprove of deleting stuff. Furthermore he didn't just bring it to their attention, but specifically asked people (most of them very new to WP) to support him "as a favor" (or even "a <i>huge</i> favor"): "I would be greatly in your debt" -- no doubt a favour that could be returned when asked for. Even so only a few of the people contacted have shown any interest, so maybe that shows that even among hand-picked inclusionists itr's hard to find a much interest in keeping this one? Of course Primetime didn't mention that this was the reason for the sudden appearance of a troop of inclusionist cavalry over the hill. While I'm not aware of anything that specifically forbids this behaviour, this is certainly not the basis on which such decisions should be made or influenced. I wonder how it squares with <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>?

<dd>Please do not quote snippets of my message out of context. I asked some people not to support me but simply to vote. Your first quote is not even what I wrote, so I think that it should be crossed out. In any case, tallying the votes of those who weren't invited shows that consensus is clearly for keeping the entry. Further, your assertion that Keppa has an agenda is unsupported by evidence. He has given a much more clearer rationale for keeping the entry than your "because my unique interpretation of a phrase in a policy told me to". (I doubt the writers of that policy even forsaw an article such as this, i.e., an <i>essay</i> on a word--not a definition. That WP:NOT passage seems to me to be designed for banning descriptions of slang and dictionary definitions.)--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 15:51, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Out of context? How does the context change things, please? And if we're getting snippy, please withdraw your allegation of misquotation. The three phrases I quoted come directly from your appeal for support. Clearly the people you contacted wouldn't be doing you a "huge favor" by voting to delete your article. You appealed to their sympathy, but the question of how much work you'd done to it is of course not a valid argument for keeping an article.

<dd>He may not have said "Vote to keep my page!" but he certainly implied that he'd like you to vote to keep it. Anyway, this is not a poll, it is a way of finding consensus, so no one is actually "voting" here. And I wasn't passing judgement, I just thought it might defeat the point of this if people go round asking people to give their opinion simply because they are inclusionist. I just wanted this to be taken into account when administrators try to see where the consensus lies. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="#FF0080">Con</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="#008B8B"><b>Dem</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7ECondem_4705.html" title="User talk:Condem">Talk</a></sup> 04:47, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's clear that Keppa sincerely believes that the page should not be deleted. Your implication that he did so simply because I would like it if he did is proven false by his well-reasoned justifications given above. In fact, he has given the clearest justification of all the voters for his opinion. For example, you have not stated what you think deleting the page would accomplish. You have not stated why visitors to Wikipedia do not deserve to get an explanation when they type in <i>embarazada</i> in the search box. If one were to distill Flapdragon's reasoning for nominating the page it would look something like this: "Because a phrase in a paragraph designed to bar short definitions and slangwords from Wikipedia told me to do it." (I doubt the writers of that policy even forsaw an article such as this, i.e., an <i>essay</i> on a word--not a definition.) In any case, those who browse through the articles nominated for deletion do not represent the general Wikipedia usership, so I'm unsure what your definition of "consensus" is.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 05:30, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I said, I wasn't passing judgement - I'm new, and I noticed it, and thought it might be relevant to the discussion. My reasons for wanting the article deleted are that I don't think the word is notable enough to have its own Wikipedia page, and that Wikipedia ought to have articles on things, rather than words. I agree that the fact that the word Embarazada can be funnily confused is interesting, but an etymology of the word doesn't belong on wikipedia. If you remove this section of the article, you are left with a short fact about a false friend and an example of its usage which is now also on the <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_friend.html" title="False friend">false friend</a> page. I also think it's extremely unlikely that anyone would try and find an entry for the word Embarazada in an English encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="#FF0080">Con</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="#008B8B"><b>Dem</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7ECondem_4705.html" title="User talk:Condem">Talk</a></sup> 05:41, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And as I've said numerous times in numerous deletion votes, or whatever we're calling them now, telling people about a vote in progress isn't stacking the vote. I should hope that we're all independent enough to read the article and form our own opinions.</dd>

<dd>There are plenty of articles that contain information about etymology. I gather from this fact that etymology is something that the wikipedia community finds acceptable in an encyclopedia article, or they'd all be up for deletion. I think the comparison of etymology is appropriate in this article. The only thing I would object to is the many examples of possible usage of the word; I think this is what most people refer to when they say the article should be "streamlined" and I agree. If it doesn't directly relate to the linguistic phenomenon being discussed it should be removed.</dd>
<dd>But please don't complain about the army of inclusionists that has suddenly come to persecute you. Inclusionists do alert others of pages that may deserve attention. We're still free human beings. I reviewed the article and formed my own opinion. If there are people who share your viewpoint, they're obviously not aware of the issue, so find them and bring them here. It's really the only way we can even try to determine consensus. <a href="../../../k/e/p/User%7EKeppa_ff7d.html" title="User:Keppa">Keppa</a> 19:59, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And there's three more words that should be added to WP on the grounds they can be misused by learners of Spanish: <i>este</i> (<i>ésta</i>), <i>porque</i> (<i>por</i>), <i>que</i> (<i>qué</i>). I'm not trying to score points, but where is this going to end? Presumably not till every word of every language has an entry in the English encyclopaedia.

<p><b>Keep</b>. Sorry, Flapdragon, but this seems to be such an important issue, that may well be required to be in the public eye, precisely because I am sure a lot of people will want to refer to it in an encyclopaedia and it has nothing to do with textbooks, tutorials or readers as such. We are not trying to teach anybody anything as such but it has become important enough to become a concept, and as the "embarazada" concept it has taken on a life of its own and people, will appreciate to be warned not to "embarrass" themselves using the word in the wrong context. By all means, use an disambiguation article and put all this and similar problem usages into it, but somewhere people should be able to read up on it in Wikipedia. It was bad enough to keep the English "hopefully" controversy out of Wikipedia's pages, but at least you would not have embarrassed yourself using "hopefully". But this... Well, I think it needs to be in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 23:33, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I've put the question twice now, but no-one has been able to explain how someone would find this entry (except perhaps by the far-fetched links from irrelevant articles that Primetime has been adding!). <i>Hopefully</i> is a different matter: it's a well-known linguistic controversy <i>in English</i> that someone might well look up to see what WP had to say on the subject. This is just one of untold numbers of mistakes English-speakers might make in translating into Spanish. Are they supposed to look up every word they produce in WP to see if it might be a mistake? And why the obssessive emphasis on this one single example of the well-known phenomenon of the <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_friend.html" title="False friend">false friend</a>? Are we to expect in-depth articles on every foreign word an English-speaker might be misled by?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Hi, Wikipedia has some guidelines on what makes a person notable - see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If Mogroide meets one of these criteria, please add <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to the article. Remember that the requirement for Wikipedia is "verifiability not truth" so you need to show that Mogroide has made an impact that has been recorded by third party sources.

This is an experiment in using community knowledge as a filter for authority. Technorati, Google Blogs, and other blog related search engines have constructed mathematic algorithms that do a poor job of filtering through unique content and informationally valuable blogs (primarily because of the relatively new explosion of blog popularity and the inherent vulnerabilty of the blogosphere to spam). I'm interested to track the progress of this page as it gets edited by wikipedia visitors, to see if "the group" can come up with a better top ten list than the search algorithms.</p>
<p>If allowed a significant lifespan on wikipedia, i beleive this page could generate a very interesting reference page on a) the wisdom of crowds theory, b) verticle blog communities, c) user perceptions of authority in the blogosphere. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kbzimm (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kbzimm_14e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kbzimm">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

Although it <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Independent_Baptist_College_2fc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Independent Baptist College">survived its previous AfD</a> as no consensus, two months ago, and there were some thoughtful comments, the fundamental problem of the institutions not identifying themselves collectively (at all, let alone by this label) and a complete lack of any sources whatsoever remains unaddressed. Some proposed merging it with another article which no longer exists as it, too, was deleted as unverifiable and original research. The article is an orphan, the only inbound link in main space is a redirect, which itself has no inbound links.

I completely forgot to check it hadn't been prodded already when I prodded it, but given the major disparity between the claims made and the level of google attention (i.e. none), this has to be either a hoax, or at best a fictional character in a not particularly well known kids programme.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Nothing has changed since the previous nomination four months ago, when these same issues were raised. This is article is not research or speculation original to Wikipedia, it is about <i>other people's</i> research and speculation - sources are cited liberally throughout. The nomination claims that no sources are provided to verify that the debate exists within the fandom when down at the bottom of the article in the clearly-labelled "external links" section are two links to very extensive pro- and con-Holocaust pages. As for the section in the article on the moon, after the first AfD an attempt was made to merge the whole subject in there and it was ultimately split back out again because it took up an inordinate amount of space there. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:26, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Apparently, the book addresses it in such a way that it's clear the moon was never damaged and that the supposed event never happened. I still think we can <b>merge</b> it in the Forest Moon article and note that it has been a significant discussion point between fans, but an entire article is overkill. Perhaps the forest moon article can get a link to the Star Wars Wiki.

<ul>
<li>The article <i>does</i> cite sources. Most significantly, these sources indicate that the debate has some presence within "official" material:
<ul>
<li>In one of the <i>Star Wars Tales</i> comics, an Imperial veteran of Endor makes an apparent reference to the holocaust theory, after telling the story of his unit's trouble with the Ewoks in a bar. Another character dismisses it as a myth, saying that most of the Death Star's mass was obliterated in the explosion, and that the Rebels "took care of the rest."</li>
<li><i>Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy</i> describes how the Rebels managed to use <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflector_shield.html" title="Deflector shield">shields</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractor_beam.html" title="Tractor beam">tractor beams</a> to protect their strike team on the moon of Endor</li>
<li>The First issue of 2005's <i>X-Wing</i> minisiers from Dark Horse comics, begins one week after the battle and shows Rebel ships dousing a forest fire begat by debris from the Death Star.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And of course the two external links at the bottom of the article show how much attention has gone into the issue in the unofficial "fan" community. Other sources are cited throughout the article when specific issues such as the Ewok's survival post-RotJ are discussed. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:33, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Verifiability requires multiple reliable sources about the topic, and the information contained within the topic. Of the three official sources you cite, only one of them even alludes to the possibility of an Endorian Holocaust ("apparently"), and contains none of the information about it presented in the article. The other two refer to circumstances around the destruction of the second Death Star but don't actually talk about even a hypothetical Endorian Holocaust. Fan discussion is not verifiable, and the overuse of phrases like "are speculated to be", "Pro-holocaust debaters", "some also argue", and "has been proposed by fans" are indicative of inherent unsourced POV. Which fans? How many? How do you know this is a representative sample? Are you referring to Internet fandom only? This is the reason that verifiability is required, because these claims are not falsifiable or provable in any reputable source. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 20:53, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Fire when ready, commander</b>. Sorry, that should be <b>delete</b>. In May last year I said <i>This is not canon. Everyone lived happily ever after, that's why they all were dancing (badly) at the end of the film. It wasn't in those awful books set after the films either. Delete, lest be we swamped with articles like Theoretical genetic mutations that would have arisen if Leia had married Luke or The sex lives of Ewoks.

It has been defended as an article about the debate but it clearly isn't that, listing as it does every reference used in said debate. It is the debate.

<li>So books don't count? Star Wars books are canon too. Just because it wasn't in the film doesn't mean it's unimportant.

<li>Exactly. In the books and comics that I have read (in some cases to my misfortune, Kevin J Anderson should be thrown into the Sarlac) that had references to Endor, said forest moon and it's irritating furry semi-sapient race were fine. Ergo it never happened. Thus not only is the debate pointless and daft in the extreme, but it is not a debate that has garnered any interest from the world outside (and therefore been reported in the media in the same way that Star Wars versus Star Trek has). As such while maybe worthy of a brief mention on the Endor page (with the citations being used to show why the wretched place survived) or fthe Star Wars fandom page, it does not require a detailed examination of the evidence on it's own page. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> <a href="../../../s/a/b/User_talk%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_5ef7.html" title="User talk:Sabine's Sunbird">talk</a> 09:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with David Sneek that the paragraph in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_moon_of_Endor_b610.html" title="Forest moon of Endor">Forest moon of Endor</a> is enough, and the whole thing is non-canonical at any rate (a notice on the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Endor_Holocaust" class="external text" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Endor_Holocaust" rel="nofollow">Wookieepedia article</a> notes that "Events, opinions, and individuals described in this arcticle are neither present in any authorized source nor claimed to occur in the Star Wars universe"). It might be worth adding the two external links from Endor Holocaust to the main Endor article, so people can read the arguments for themselves if they really care, but a seperate article is too much, even for me.

<p>"Latent human factor" gets seven google hits. None when filtered by "Lisa Williams". The survey "published online" is a blog. If this is a real study, there should be real sources. Otherwise, I'm inclined to believe this is a joke article. User:Reyhani, not the article creator, but the blogger cited, removed external links in the article and the prod notice without comment. I'm not sure why, but the article still appears unverifiable. I'm open to verification if provided.

<p>I disagree strongly, it might be unverifiable right not, but see what happens in a few weeks time when this study is circulated in academic circles. Being new to wiki I am sorry for any mistakes on our part but please do not just dicredit this study. This study is of great importance to our interpretation of how teams work when they have to succeed. It explains the phenomena of why "underdogs" win at time when it seems impossible. In short, please bear with us. We hope to also post the entire study or at least important pieces of it. We feel that this study is a contribution to the content of wiki and will be appreciated by informed readers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Reyhani (<a href="../../../r/e/y/User_talk%7EReyhani_e0e7.html" title="User talk:Reyhani">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Reyhani_9083.html" title="Special:Contributions/Reyhani">contribs</a>) 17:48, April 6, 2006.</small></p>

<p>What a pity that you are all looking at this matter so pesemistically to not value good material. Can WP not pride itself by being timely and even ahead of other medias. WP should be proud to contain such material and I truly hope that this research will not be deleted and we will not be robbed of this valuable contribution. PS googling something should really not become a standard of judging, especially when we are dealing with fresh academic research <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Reyhani (<a href="../../../r/e/y/User_talk%7EReyhani_e0e7.html" title="User talk:Reyhani">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Reyhani_9083.html" title="Special:Contributions/Reyhani">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>I understand your position, but "fresh academic research" needs peer review, yes? And Wikipedia doesn't have the kind of setup to do that, so we have to wait it out.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>As far as Googling, that's just our way of looking for references when none are provided for us.

<p>This is a child actor that appeared in 5 episodes. Not notable. And the same goes for more soap opera child actors (funny, several of them played Kyle Jenkins on The Young and the Restless). IMO, cildren that appear in the show without singificant contribution, do not belong into enciclopedia. MAybe when they become adult and perform in prominent productions with important roles but certainly not now.</p>

<p>Excuse this confused AfD nomination... This editor has added several identical articles under many different titles. Some of them he was kind enough to upload with nonsense vandalism intact, allowing for G1 deletions. Others are like this one - I don't think the article matches the title and the picture.

<li><b>Keep</b>. You guys seriously need to read the article. I admit I used to contribute to the article, and I've been a fierce opponent of fancruft, but realize the article isn't so much about how to play the game as much as an analysis of the gameplay and the professional scene. It's well written; it's not just a compilation of strategies; at the very most it should just be rewritten.

<li><b>Comment/Request</b> I don't see how any of this is "cruft" in the sense of being either a strategy guide or a manual. Can someone quote some objectionable section if you think so? I didn't write the upper sections but to me they read like a description (that could be useful to a number of people), not a prescriptive guide. People seem to be aggressively slinging around terms like "fancruft" just because this is an electronic game. I doubt a similar description of a sport would attract this level of negative attention. Even if the article needs to be modified somehow, simply deleting it would seem a huge waste given the large amount of information here that is not easily available in compiled form elsewhere. Also see <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_the_gathering.html" title="Magic: the gathering">Magic:_the_gathering</a> for an example of a similar article that is also perfectly worthy of Wikipedia (it's even on the "good article" list). <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShardPhoenix_3069.html" title="User:ShardPhoenix">ShardPhoenix</a> 07:39, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why things like player rankings (objectively determined) are not permitted for an electronic sport, but entirely permissible for say, tennis</li>
<li>Why deletion is preferable to say, putting up a request for sources; cleaning up some of the bad sections.

To have a wikipedia aritcle on a unique aircraft that <b>MAY BE</b> real, but has been modelled in a flight simulator constitutes a unique and notable a)article and b) aircraft. To say that the aircraft is not unique is to say that <b>every</b> fictional plane or aircraft based on rumor is not unique...and obviously this is not the case at hand. Although I see how bandwidth may be an issue, I do not agree that the stipulation of non-notable applies. That would be the equivilent of saying a hand built model is not unique, and each modeled aircraft for flight simulator is painstaikingly modeled part by part. <b>ASSUMING</b> the black manta is not real (which it may or may not be, I don't know) just because there is an article about an aircraft that was made for a flight simulator is in itself unique. Therefore the aircraft itself is not entirely unique, however, it is notable that a designer went through the effort to build an aircraft. I will also add that this aircraft is worth of distinction and has already won an award from another design group. I have adequately shown that this aircraft is both unique and worthy of distinction and excellence. As per your guildlines for deletion, all of the titles of non-notablility, non-excellence, and not worthy of distinction do not apply.MachJok 04:42, 31 March 2006 <small>User's first edit, AND NOT THE LAST</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>This aircraft, although fictionary, has a significant impact on the users of Flight Simulators. This aircract is, to my knowledge, a commonly "flown" aircraft in the world of flight simulator. People deserve to know the origins of the aircraft; similar to the reason why people need to know about the orgin of the United States just on a smaller level. If this article is deleted, it might fluster up some commotion within the Flight Simulator community. There are also lesser articles on Wiki which i will leave unamed that make this article stand out beyond belief.

<li>Here are the notability guildlines:</li>
</ul>
<p>Software is considered to be notable enough for inclusion if it meets any of the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. The software has been verifiably the subject of non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the software developer. A single story in major news media or an independently written book would be sufficient, but multiple works would be needed for lower-profile sources.</p>
<p>2. The software is/was innovative, significant, or influential in some specific way, and this is verifiable from reliable sources independent of the software developer.</p>
<p>3. The software is among the core products of a notable software developer or vendor.</p>
<p>4. The software is included in a major operating system distribution such as Fedora Core or Debian, and the maintainer of the distribution is independent from the software developer. Note that for very large distributions such as Debian, some of its packages are not widely used; use judgement or statistics such as the Debian Popularity Contest.</p>
<p>5. The product is so well-known that its trademark has suffered from genericization. (ibid.)</p>
<p>6. The software has won an independent award or honor, including mention as one of the top ten applications in its class in an independent published list. Notes:* Creating an article about software you have personally developed is strongly discouraged but not forbidden. It is indeed easy for an author to overestimate the notability of their work. If such work is notable, someone else will eventually start an article about it.</p>
<p>- * The number of users has been considered for some times as a criteria for notability; however, a fixed number does not make sense when evaluating different kinds of software, and agreeing on a specific number does not seem feasible.</p>
<p>- * Software that can be proved to have a consistent number of users (beside the creator(s) and their friends) but do not meet the above criteria may be merged into the article describing their main functionality (for example, JoeBloggsDiskEditor may be merged into a section of disk editor.)</p>
<p><br />
1) does not apply, this work is not trivial. you may find the aircraft at www.flightsim.com, www.simviation.com/aeroworks and others.</p>
<p>2) does not apply, 3000+ downloads plus numerous repaints is influetial, as no degree of influentiality has been required this does not apply.</p>
<p>3) This is a core product for this developer. Not everyone is a bigshot like M$. size of a developer is irrelevant. unless the name adds profit, since this is <b>NON-PROFIT</b> it is irrelevant</p>
<p>4) Are you telling me that '<i>ALL</i> of the fictional aircraft are part of a "major operating system distribution"??</p>
<p>5) Not all of the fictional aircraft are well known...sorry this stipulation is irrelevant</p>
<p>6) <b>THE SOFTWARE HAS WON AN INDEPENDANT AWARD</b> see <a href="http://www.motisvirtualjetdesign.com/CDAAWARDS.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.motisvirtualjetdesign.com/CDAAWARDS.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.motisvirtualjetdesign.com/CDAAWARDS.htm</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>Ah, yes, more unilateral declarations of victory. However:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) "Because I said so"? Less than a convincing argument for saying it's not trivial. See <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">Begging the question</a>. And finding a piece of software on a website doesn't <i>a priori</i> make it non-trivial.</dd>
<dd>2) That barely rises to the level of assertion, let alone argument. How many copies of Flight Simulator have been sold? What percentage is 3,000 downloads of that? Why does such a remarkably influential thing like this get only 18 unique Google hits?</dd>
<dd>3) You somehow left off the adjective "notable" from "software developer". Hmmm.</dd>
<dd>4) Irrelevent/inapplicable.</dd>
<dd>5) Clearly fails, though not really applicable.</dd>
<dd>6) Ah yes, the "Team MoTIS" award. Clearly very major, despite that fact that "Team MoTIS" gets only 21 unque Google hits and '''www.motisvirtualjetdesign.com''' shows NO incoming links according to Google.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Your comments fail.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) This article also fufills the first criterium.</dd>
<dd>2) the number of FS2K4 copies sold does not reflect anything, every plane is influential in someway and once again no definition of influential has been given.</dd>
<dd>3)Are you saying that I have to be a big wig to post my stuff on an open source encyclopedia? hmmmmmm I thought encyclopedia's where about <i><b>expanding</b></i> the knowledge of the human race and sharing it with others.</dd>
<dd>4)you are right #4 is totally inapplicable to either argument</dd>
<dd>5)No generalization....on any of the fictional aircraft</dd>
<dd>6)The Motis award fufills the stipulation for an independant award. web engines are not reliable for <i>"unique"</i> or incoming links.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Re-rebuttal</p>
<dl>
<dd>1)<i>Objectively speaking it fufills the terms of deletion</i> There you go, I'm glad you agree with me.</dd>
<dd>2) If you're going to claim that this is "influential", its installed base as a percentage of FS2000/FS2004 copies in circulation is <i>completely</i> the point. <i>Once again no definition of influential has been given.</i> Then why the claim it is?</dd>
<dd>3) Boy, as Wolgang Pauli once said, that's not right, that's not even wrong. What it is, is a bunch of tangential handwaving.</dd>
<dd>6) The word "objectively"? I do not believe it means what you think it means.</dd>

<p>First, This is not a "ballot stuff" - I don't know who originally put up the TR-3 article but I am sure they never thought it would get contested. Really, deleting things from an encyclopedia? I am the designer of the aircraft in question so consider my bias. I use wikipedia religiously, and to see one of my own creations on this site was the realization of the sum of all our efforts (I didn't create this plane alone) and to the impressiveness of how the Wikipedia works. How do you define notable? I think the fact that the Federation of American Sceintists has their own page on the alleged aircraft TR-3 speaks volumes. A quick google search on the aircraft in question should yield plenty results. Or perhaps it's the fact that it is an aircraft for Flight Simulatorand you may be thinking the flightsim hobby itself is not of any notoriety. If you go to www.flightsim.com and do a file search for *.* all your doubts about the popularity of the flightsim hobby will swiftly be laid to rest. What is the problem with leaving the article? Logic suggests, that if it's not notable to you - don't read it. Leave it for those who enjoy such things and let it go. Alot of aircraft designers for FS make aircraft such as Boeings and Cessna's - this is the rule and not the exception. People get what they expect when they download common aircraft. But every once in a while an aircraft comes along that people download and they just have to ask the question "why not?" When people download an aircraft such as the TR-3 it makes them wonder and ask questions. It inspires creative and constructive thought - something all too rare nowdays. That is the driving force behind what I do and why I make "fake airplanes" So it's fictional - yes. So is Star Trek - it's still here. So it was created by a bunch of flightsimmers - yes. Pretentious? - Well it's not any more pretentious than people who feel they are obligated to correct and cleanup things, and leaving it here would do no more harm that useless pages such as this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Calton" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Calton" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Calton</a> You see, in our hobby alot of people spend their hard time making things for free - Microsoft has known this for years and has always created their sims as an "open source" that anyone can edit and modify as they see fit (Hello Wikipedia...?) red_ace1 12:14, 31 March 2006 <small>User's first edit, <i>quelle surprise</i></small></p>

However, the fact that someone not affiliated with the company dedicated the time to create an article about this aircraft shows that it had an impact. And Obli most of the Fictional Aircraft have NOTHING to do with real life...unlike this aircraft which is rumored to <b>actually</b> exist. The purpose of Wikipedia was to create an online encyclopedia that people could access. If you want to split everything up into Fictional and Non-Fictional on 2 seporate Wiki's good luck handeling the overlap.....and Obli are you telling me that ALL the article contain only "deep, esoteric knowledge"??? AND WHY is every one counting google hits? the plane will be more widely sene on the download page for Flightsim.com not the company page...........you are making assumptions that have no credibility...google hits count for very little when the most widely seen page is the page on flightsim.com where it is downloaded. So far the main aircraft has been downloaded 3266(main aircraft) + 560(non company repaint) + 372 (non company repaint) = 4198 times....where as the most identifible airliner the 747-400 has been downloaded 9107 and both were put up within a month of each other, and for a concept aircraft that is really good. If you want proof look through all of the concept aircraft at flightsim.com MachJok 03:16, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. You may receive more favorable results from improving the article rather than arguing here. I would also point out that the 747-400 has notability outside the scope of a flight sim model, and is probably not a good example for comparative purposes. In other words, a dedicated article about a particular flight sim model representation of the 747-400 would probably be equally (in)appropriate for inclusion. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 08:25, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not going to fight for this deletion because the issue has been taken up previously. The present content is not the same as the New Kalachakra page at all and is totally changed from other versions before it. Someone claiming it is identical is not in good faith. I prefer for people to unvote the deletion tag here and not intervene myself. People can just make up their own minds about it. Also, how can one see New Kalachakra so as to compare the claims of Jonas Silk&#160;? I'll just let people judge and it's really just one <b>keep</b> vote that starts the ball rolling to keep it. The best test would be for people to look at <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalachakra.html" title="Kalachakra">Kalachakra</a> to see if they're the same and then they'll see that Jonas Silk is just saying rubbish.

<dd>I think it is quite plausible that there is a real theological dispute here. Unfortunately, this has never been documented on Wikipedia with anything resembling useable sources; instead, what we get is a series of half-intelligible rants citing mostly unrelated websites. Assuming that there is an underlying real-world controversy, it's actually quite unfortunate that the one user who seems to know about it has so far been unable to productively add info to Wikipedia about it. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 20:19, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is a dispute about this. Simon Cursitor, the camps that are hashing it out in this are the following&#160;: the <a href="../../../g/e/l/Gelugpa.html" title="Gelugpa">Dalai Lama</a> camp that's trying to silence the camp of <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shugden.html" title="Shugden">Shugden</a> that suports a kind of demon-spirit called the King-spirit aka Gyalpo or "Dolgyal", another of its names. Then there's the camp of others that are not really concerned with this mess in politics of Tibet, which is my <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakya.html" title="Sakya">Sakyapa</a>, (<a href="../../../n/g/o/Ngor.html" title="Ngor">Ngorpa</a>) school, Tibets second bieggest behind the Dalai lama school (both the feuding parties above - Dalai and Shugdens - are of that same school feuding amonst themselves&#160;!!!). ALso compounding on this dispute and overlapping it is another closely related dispute&#160;: that around <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonang.html" title="Jonang">Jonang</a>. They're actually the same because Shugden was taken from our Sakya school in the 17th cent. and used by the Gelugpas and produced their fighting about it today. (It's very complicated unless given good space on the page to elaborate scholarly a bit and not just quick like here). Now, Kalachakra was the main teaching of Jonang and passed down to all from it. It's main master was <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taranatha.html" title="Taranatha">Taranatha</a>. Now the person who knows about this all is me. I can make this page go in other directions&#160;: englobing the subject of the king-sprit and the Jonang page of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_on_Jonang_2015.html" title="Ban on Jonang">Ban on Jonang</a>. This will thus make it lose even more of what was part of the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalachakra.html" title="Kalachakra">Kalachakra</a> page (which is already not important on it). I know this seems complicated for those who don't know about it, but I'm tryig to explain here. Those who know here, will understand this though, and maybe weigh in seeing the intent is honest and good on my side. I can make an effort to reformat and wikify the page. I can encyclopedize it with references to all the words in the first introductory part and so forth. I've never taken the time to go into such detail because of the flak from either of these parties involved always meddling in each and every move I make. Now the people intent on getting me deleted are doing so from POV motives because they're either with the Shugdens or with the Dalai. There are also those who want to further the ban on the Jonangs against the Kalachakra being claimed back by the Jonangs and this is POV too, of course. This is furthering a three hundred year old ban. But all these guys want me deleted so they can basically go back to bashing each other. My article doesn't really bother them, because I speak about neither of them, just about my own schools approach that's non-sectarian and non-confrontational, being part of a tradition that came before them, and has no links to them (either of them). The Jonangs belong to my school before the Dalai school took it over and banned it forcefully. If I can get even half a mandate to be able to work peacefully and just work on making this page legible, well good. Or else I give up. These boys jumping me and ganging up for lynching because this is a disputed subject makes me laugh honestly, because it's like building a sand castle in a hurricane. They're so POV that it's laughable too. So, yes, Simon, it's a disputed subject. The people deleting it will only go POV back into in their own camp and the subject will still; not have been resolved. I propose to make a different article altogether and take it into real historical research without POV whitewashing which is what is going on at the other page that doesn't accept anyone giving a different version of a history that they admit themselves is "a mass of contradictons" (that's what they say on the page itself. Ha ha ha&#160;! They can't go forward and are too stubborn to back up and admit they're stuck in deep trouble. Ha ha ha&#160;! None of them have done my research and can't even match their own facts up. They just say they don't know and it's all full of contraditions. Ha ha ha&#160;!). If I get that mandate peacefully from you all, then I admit you all pitch in for correcting and so forth but not all the POV attacks. I can scale down the similarities of the pages and make up for different approaches to the subject. We can enlarge the new approaches and minimize the common parts. This is thus an honest proposal to solve a problem that indeed is an internal Tibetan dispute. I'll make all efforts to make this good with all my best efforts. I'd like people to carry this with me and bear with me in this. This is not a clear and easy case but a difficult thing to be worked out peacefully and relying rather on scholarship than on fanatical POV writing. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 18:51, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi there, this is Rudy Harderwijk, (webmaster of www.kalachakranet.org, www.jonangfoundation.org and www.rimebuddhism.com); if I may give my POV; I think the basic information on this page is OK, but this page is called Kalachakra Kings - to begin with, an expression I've never seen or heard of before, then the page meanders out on all kinds of subjects - very good as such, but why is that information not simply where it should be - on the pages of the Kalachakra tantra, Shambhala etc.? All the references to the "ban" and Shugden give the strong impression that this page was not created to supply information, but to give a POV. (Rudyh01 - April 9, 2006).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalachakra.html" title="Kalachakra">Kalachakra</a> is a page that doesn't respect NPOV. It's not a space where anyone but the Dalai lama followers can write. It's a cult-following ambiance recreated on a Wikipedia page... using Wiki for POV purposes. Plus it admits itself that "its sources from Tiebtan historians are a mass of contradictions". So, that's the blind leading blind, (even admitting it themselves). Better be on ones own and sticking to real scholarship. Kalachakra is all lies and blind. Don't bluff people with your fake sites, Rudy. You know your site closed down because the things I published didn't jell with the offical Dalai Lama line. Don't try to tell people here you're just an innocent poster. You're here to bait me for the Dalai Lama. He's not that kind of person but compassionate and you're using him for your own agenda&#160;: protecting your sites that would be invalidated by this page because it invalidates most of your outdated, sectarain and POV data. Admit that much, eh&#160;! You're trying to claim that the Dalai lama didn't ban the Jonangpas in the 17th cent.

<p>Article reads like a sales pitch, totally unencyclopedic and non-contextual, half of the article consists of vanity editing, while the subject of the article seems legit, judging from a Google search, there's no way of understanding what the article really is about at its current state, and having it around certainly doesn't improve things.

<li><b>Comment</b> I reserve judgement for the moment. Sean, if you read the guidelines on notability and biographies of living persons and verifiability (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>), and think you meet the guidelines, you can take a crack rewriting the article as if a neutral 3rd party wrote it. I would consider overlooking the fact that it is an autobiography if it otherwise meets the guildelines. The key to remember is that wikipedia aims to be a verifiable neutral encyclopedia; why would someone look you up, and what should they be able to learn here that they won't learn from IMDB or a myspace profile? And are you prepared to have your article edited and rewritten by others, possibly to include negative information about you (assuming it exists and is verifiable)? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:13, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment/Reply</b>Thanks for the feedback. I've editted the article so that it is brief, neutral and verifiable. I think "Sean Hood" is notable because he has written several produced movies, one of which, Halloween:Ressurection, made 30 million at the box office. See <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28film_series%29.html" title="Halloween (film series)">Halloween (film series)</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Interestingly, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Halloween%7E_Resurrection_9a75.html" title="Halloween: Resurrection">Halloween: Resurrection</a> says it was written by someone named Larry Brand. --<font color="orange"><strike><i><a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory</a></i><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">0</font></a><b><a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">96</a></b></strike></font> 20:07, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The on-screen credit is "screenplay by Larry Brand and Sean Hood" see [<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0220506/fullcredits" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0220506/fullcredits" rel="nofollow">Halloween Resurrection on IMDB</a>]. The wikepedia article <a href="../../../r/e/s/Halloween%7E_Resurrection_9a75.html" title="Halloween: Resurrection">Halloween: Resurrection</a> should be editted to reflect this. Also, a screenwriter's filmography is a list of the films the writer has worked on; the screenwriter's co-writers are usually not listed. See <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Goldman_7b64.html" title="William Goldman">William Goldman</a> as an example. Note also, that films are listed for which Goldman's work went uncredited, such as Fierce Creatures - 1997 (uncredited). All the information in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hood_9ba7.html" title="Sean Hood">Sean Hood</a> is correct. The only question is whether to allow it, since I myself wrote it. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanhood_0d7e.html" title="User:Seanhood">Seanhood</a> 04:16, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I did a quick search on Google and couldn't find any mention of Orvis Jordan in connection with a Campbell Institute or the CCW-USA. As I'm not familiar with either organization, can you provide further information about them so your claims can be verified? If you want to make a compelling case for keeping this article, then please add <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources for his <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> to the article. Also, I assume "Melton's Encyclopedia" is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810384175/104-7420784-9337514?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810384175/104-7420784-9337514?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, correct?

<p>Tell you what: if it is that important to you to delete my article, go ahead and delete the article. The entry on ICCC, CCW, and Jordan's role in the CCW is in Melton's most recent ENCYCL. OF AMER. REL. You may have to dig a little in hard copy books to confirm OFJ's role in Campbell Institute. A google reference to his listing as "heretic of the week" in an old CHRISTIAN STANDARD journal used to be on the web. Jordan wrote an article disputing the historicity of the Jonah story. This will be my last attempt to ever write or edit wiki. Parkridge1998 (signed)</p>
