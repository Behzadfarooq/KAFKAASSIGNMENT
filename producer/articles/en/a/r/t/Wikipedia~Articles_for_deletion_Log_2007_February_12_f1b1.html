<li><b>Delete</b> The scientists who are quoted clearly must have written peer-reviewed articles. This WP article will be very feeble if it can incorporate no references to peer-reviewed literature. (MSNBC.com doesn't count). Someone who looks up this issue on Wikipedia will figure that we are naive followers of everything published in the New Scientist. If appropriate references can't be supplied before the close of this AfD, I'm voting to delete.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a non-notable subject. No serious references are given to show that this "theory" is even being considered seriously by even a minority of the scientific community. It is idle speculation that was turned into a simple gee-wiz story. According to WP policy, notability is not the same as "newsworthiness". See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. Beyond this major policy issue, I can not see how this stub can be expanded. There is just NO information that has been published. The proponents for keeping such an article should at least give a list of at least a few peer-reviewed articles demonstrating that serious scientists have published in this domain.

<li>Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that the article needs a peer-review reference to keep. It is just that the reference links only mention the original theory in passing. I'd like to see that original publication to judge the merits of the prediction. The Toronto reference looks more more like a generic computer simulation of what might happen if the galaxies collide rather than something based on telescope observations of the galaxies aproaching each other. The opening statement of this article is likely incorrect. It does not appear that the authors of the Toronto and Harvard links were the ones proposing this theory.--<a href="../../../m/u/3/User%7EMu301_1a75.html" title="User:Mu301">mikeu</a> 05:08, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are about 90 <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microgaming.html" title="Microgaming">microgaming</a> casinos owned by dozens of companies (casino list here: <a href="http://www.microgaming.com/pjncasino.php" class="external free" title="http://www.microgaming.com/pjncasino.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.microgaming.com/pjncasino.php</a>). All the 90 casinos are almost identical apart from colour schemes and different websites. There is therefore no cause to comment on any one particular group unless special notability can be established - this article says *NOTHING* that isn't true of other microgaming casinos, and is therefore a redundant article. This company is privately held, non-notable, nothing useful to say other than act as SEO-bait for this company.</p>

not spam at all. the jackpot factory group is a using microgaming technology, therefor the link from the microgaming page is legit as well as the text published. i can see no difference between this page and other group of casinos that are linked from the microgaming page. Niv.</p>

<p>Hey - no one is trying to hide anything, i'm not sure why are you calling me a spammer though: all i said is that there is no difference between this page and other Microgaming's groups pages. if you think it is for seo reasons you can always delete the links to the 4 casinos, either than that, it is exactly like the other pages, therefore, in my opinion, not spam at all.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm calling you a spammer because the two changes I listed above were spam. That makes you a spammer. Clear?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There *is* a difference between this page and the other Microgaming groups: Fairground Gaming is a PLC quoted on the stockmarket, and intrinsically more notable. Grand Prive is also up for deletion. Fortune Lounge is notable because it caused a major spam controversy. Carmen Media is marginal, but slightly more notable because it has at least some profile as it is a Gibraltar-licensed company with a degree of openness. Jackpot Factory doesn't have that. Perhaps if you can think of something that makes Jackpot Factory notable, then it can stay, perhaps if you could find some 'Inspirational Stories' <a href="http://www.casinomeister.com/forums/casino-complaints-non-bonus-issues/12659-jackpot-factorys-inspirational-stories.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.casinomeister.com/forums/casino-complaints-non-bonus-issues/12659-jackpot-factorys-inspirational-stories.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> about how Jackpot Factory casinos cure cancer, then that might establish notability. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 10:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I edited the article to try and meet everyone's concerns. (1) Notability: I added a section on the awards that Jackpot Factory and its component casinos have won. Surely, an organization's being recognized as the best in the world in its particular field is notable. It is far more notable than such trivial accomplishments as being quoted on the stockmarket or being licensed in Gibralter. (2) External Links: I deleted all external links except for the link to the Jackpot Factory official website. I thought they were helpful but, for some reason that I do not understand, they seemed to bother people. For the sake of peace, I got rid of them. Peter54 15:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Casino awards have no value whatsoever. They are based on payments to the awarding body. I mean come on, "Top Gambler: Best Online Casino Graphics 2006 – First Web Casino". Best Online Casino Graphics? They are all the same!!!! There are nearly 100 Microgaming casinos, and the graphics are the same in every casino. How can anyone think these awards have value. These awards are just BS for casinos to use in their marketing (as you are doing here). Apart from payments to the awarder (to be casinomeister-accredited you have to pay casinomeister), where these awards are supposedly based on reader votes (not sure that any you have listed are), these are spammed by the casinos '$50 bonus if you vote for us', and so on. Casino awards are worthless. It's absolutely laughable that you even suggest that your casino group is 'recognised as best in the world'. So aside from those silly awards, there's absolutely nothing in the article that's notable, as everything that's listed there is just general 'Microgaming casino' stuff.</dd>

<dd>(1) What is the evidence for your assertion that awards are granted on a corrupt basis? Jackpot Factory casinos have been recognized as the Best Online Casino by Top Gambler, Gambling.com, and Got2Bet. That is why I say Jackpot Factory has been recognized as the best in the world in its field, which is definitely notable. If there is evidence that the awards are corrupt, I would be interested to know what it is. (2) The best way to understand a rule is to see how it is applied in actual practice. It is ridiculous to say that the Notability rule allows articles on Carmen Media, Fairground Gaming, Fortune Lounge Group, and Grand Prive, but does not allow an article on Jackpot Factory. If a rule is to make any sense, it must be applied in a consistent manner. Peter54 07:44, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does operating a group of Microgaming casinos make a company notable? I wouldn't have said so. Microgaming itself is notable, but there doesn't seem to be anything interesting to add about the individual companies - they all have the same games, near-identical graphics, same software, and mostly are offshore companies with no solid enyclopedic info available. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 20:21, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But there's nothing encyclopedic to say about these offshore companies. There's no useful info to add. You'd have articles for Fortune Lounge, Vegas Partner Lounge, Trident Entertainment, Casino Rewards, Grand Privé, Jackpot Factory, Ashanti Entertainment, Casino Action, MiniVegas, Roxy, and all 10 articles could be created using a search and replace. E.g., "Trident Entertainment is a group of Microgaming casinos. All of its casinos are certified by eCOGRA. It won CasinoPlayer's Best of Gaming award in 2006. It owns the following sites'. The same content, with a different spurious award found off some obliging website (trust me, every casino on the web has won a 'World's best casino' award *somewhere) would work for the other articles. There's nothing there that extends what <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microgaming.html" title="Microgaming">Microgaming</a> already says. A private group that owns a few of the 100+ identikit Microgaming gaming sites is not of itself notable. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 01:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I do a fair amount of online gambling and have heard of none of the mentioned sites. It all seems to be a bit of an advert to me and contains a number of unneccessary links. <a href="../../../t/s/m/User%7ETSMonk_5f92.html" title="User:TSMonk">TSMonk</a> 13:29, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the article is weak, but the subject is strong. This company is a significant player in the consumer electronics field for yachts and boats. It is the result of the spinoff of Raytheon's consumer division and merger with other notable manufacturers of navigation gear.

<li>Bpmullins makes an interesting point. However, guidelines don't call for the deletion of notable topics due to poor sources or inadequacy of the article, except for bios of living people. Here are verifiable links to help establish notability [<a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=Raymarine" class="external text" title="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=Raymarine" rel="nofollow">Google Finance Profile</a>] [<a href="http://today.reuters.com/stocks/CompanyProfile.aspx?symbol=RAY.L" class="external text" title="http://today.reuters.com/stocks/CompanyProfile.aspx?symbol=RAY.L" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>]. More work to do. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 17:01, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>1.6 million G-hits show that this is probably notable; however, the curse is that there is so much chatter out there which makes it tedious to find independent sources worthy of WP standards. Need to spend more time, but should not delete the article. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 17:51, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The link for <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_Bai_257a.html" title="Li Bai">Li Bai</a> is not exactly a misspelling; it's the correct romanization of a mispronunciation committed even by native Chinese speakers. The character 白, typically read as <i>bai2</i>, could also be read as <i>bo2</i> on occasion; in fact, <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_Bai_257a.html" title="Li Bai">Li Bai</a>'s name (same 白 character) was typically read as Li Bo in the past, which makes people think Tai Bai should be read as Tai Bo. But anyway, I thought hatnotes were preferable to dab pages in the event of only having two items to disambiguate? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 15:16, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Replace</b> with a redirect to <a href="../../../t/a/e/Tae_Bo_0692.html" title="Tae Bo">Tae Bo</a>.

The poet himself is actually quite famous, but I think it would be problematic if we created a redirect for every misspelling of a name. Moreover, <a href="../../../t/a/e/Tae_Bo_0692.html" title="Tae Bo">Tae Bo</a> is phonetically the same as <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taibo.html" title="Taibo">Taibo</a>, so I think most people searching for "taibo" will be looking for the martial art rather than the poet. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:53, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not sure this should be deleted, but it definitely should be cut down in length. The author is the Mr. Sauer's wife (see the talk page), and a Google search confirms that Sauer has been active in architecture. What do you think?

Also, with apologies to Mrs. Sauer, even her own comment on the talk page makes it clear that the point of this article is to raise Mr. Sauer's internet profile and notoriety which, again, Wikipedia is not for. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 18:19, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is definitely a work in progress and needs to be rewritten, but Sauer appears to have been a pretty big deal architect. For instance, <a href="http://www.aaschool.ac.uk/library/saggio.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.aaschool.ac.uk/library/saggio.pdf" rel="nofollow">in this pdf</a> if you search on his name you can find a mention of an article on his work in an Italian architecture magazine. He is also prominently mentioned as a mentor or authority in many places on the web. I think he will end up being notable enough, after a bit more work on the article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 23:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As another editor pointed out on the talk page to this article, the article itself is a POV violation, granting credit to those named (on uncertain grounds) as "conspiracy realists," and leaving all those unnamed to be regarded as supporting so-called "baseless theories." The article is sourced by a single link to a message board. Without reliable, third-party sources to document the existence of "conspiracy realists," this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 01:03, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A search on Google for "Zydeisland" returns 176 hits. "Zyde Island", the phrase, returns 59 results. Most, if not all of these, are self-promotion on web forums. The article claims the site had 16,000 users at its peak, and I would imagine that 16,000 users would account for more Google traffic. The article is mostly the work of one user (User:Ikahootz), and features such elegant prose as "The game won many awards and a quick google search of "ZydeIsland" will show you this and the amount of fans it did have." and "There has always been rumur it may return some day...". Has anyone else even heard of this? Action Jackson IV 01:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The entire page is one sentence: CBS Has Ordered Survivor 15, It Should Premiere In Fall 2007. I would not even put an expand tag because it hasn't been ordered, so it's wrong info, and "it should" sounds like the person that put it in really wasn't sure.

<p>Essentially the same argument applies here. The entire page this time is two sentences: "This season will begin in February of 2008. If there is a season or two after this, then Jeff could retire or host until the show finally is cancelled." Neither statement is sourced or anything beyond speculation. Survivor 16 wouldn't start filming until November 2007, and wouldn't air until a year from now. <a href="../../../f/i/j/Survivor%7E_Fiji_44ed.html" title="Survivor: Fiji">Survivor 14</a> just started airing last week.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> "Shred Metal" + "Music" has over 20,000 Google hits, and I've seen the term used in print publications. A shred guitarist may or may not play shred metal, and I could even imagine a shred metal band with, say, reggae rhythm and ethnic instrumentation. However, I have difficulty drawing the line between <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_metal.html" title="Speed metal">speed metal</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_metal.html" title="Punk metal">punk metal</a>, and shred. I have heard the terms used interchangably. It's my hunch that bands described as "shred metal" can also fit into one of the above categories - but that alone wouldn't negate the importance of "shred" as a category (think: there's comedy movies, dark comedy movies, and satire, and possibly libel if you want to go that deep). The article <i>definitely</i> needs expansion, however - as it stands it's a useless article. --Action Jackson IV 03:05, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm going on a <b>weak keep</b> here. It's a distinct style, but just enough where it warrants its own article. Expand it. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 03:15, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a directory. Although a lot of work has gone into this, it doesn't appear to be salvageable. Perhaps it could be put on a Web site. The authors could easily go to a free blog service like Google's and set it up as one or more blog posts, then revise as needed, although the real work would be in getting people to that Web page. Pgr94, the use of the word "Individual" in the quote you cite clearly indicates (although it doesn't explicitly state) that the rule concerns individual chapters of organizations within a list of chapters of that organization. If the word "Individual" were not there, much less the first word in the sentence, you'd have a better case. "Individual" clearly is used to emphasize the difference between local chapters and national/international organizations.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC) (edited)</li>

<li><b>Keep Some</b> some have notability and i am working on notability for Union Mill ES. A few have no use but some are notable. Floris is I belive the oldest public school in Fairfax county and Clifton is one of the oldest in Northern VA, although not public in the begining. Union Mill is named after this mill on Bull Run creek that supplied stuff for the battles of Manassas in the Civil War, and has a grindstone from the mill (see photo in article) on display in front of it. I have no notability for Herndon, Sunrise, or Mosby, however. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeepOnTruckin_39c2.html" title="User:KeepOnTruckin">KeepOnTruckin</a> 21:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. I believe the major problem here is likely the absence of references in this articles or a plethora of relevant links that could help establish a more fine-tuned and reliable article. I believe that if enough information can be presented for an independent article, then in the terms of public schools, the school should receive its own article. The main reason behind notability guidelines is to allow for sensible articles that are not commercially representing or self-representing. If an article is able to provide a good deal of substance that is backed by <i>reliable references</i> then I support it. However, for the meantime, since this article does not adequately meet all of these guidelines, it should me merged. Another option is tagging the article with clean up tags and need references tags to see if that information is actually available. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 22:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep all</b> per KeepOnTruckin. Fairfax County Public Schools is a notable school district in the US.

<li>The first citation you give is a short mention in the article; the article is not about Sunrise Valley, it is about efforts to teach children about finance.

Also, you have misread the Denver-post/washington-post article, the first half of the article was devoted to Sunrise Valley, more than a "short mention". The article clearly satisfies the criteria of having multiple reliable sources. Also there are now strong claims of notability.

<li>I apologize if you feel this is a personal attack, that's not my intention. But I have to note that your arguments were being selective, e.g. you noted that the 2nd reference is of a "community paper", but failed to mention that the first reference is from the nationally-distributed "washington post" posted in Denver. Of course, this bias is probably unintentional on your part, but to avoid further nick-picking, I suggest we just move on, and not to challenge each other's argument unless there is gross error or something significantly new to add. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 07:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> All schools are notable to me, and I am happy to read an article on any school on wikipedia, regardless of district. Brianyoumans, you have consitently stated that the reason you want these articles deleted is because they have no assertion of notability/they arent notable enough to be on wikipedia. Let me say this again, citing the guide to deletion (my apologies if I am making the same argument twice) <b>"the fact that you haven't heard of something, or don't personally consider it worthy, are not criteria for deletion. You must look for, and demonstrate that you couldn't find, any independent sources of sufficient depth."</b> "Lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion, because (among other reasons) this isn't specifically stated in the deletion policy; and since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Paper" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and has no size limits [except those of the server...not important here], there's no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include "everything" that fits in with the other criteria, such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>". If these schools are such a non-notable topic, then people wont search for them. They arent harming Wikipedia, but they are helping anyone who read them. In fact, if "we delete articles solely due to their obscurity, currently obscure, or seemingly obscure, subjects may gain more popular interest at a later date. In such a case, deleted articles will constitute a loss of valuable (and perhaps, in the transitory world of the internet, irreproducible) information." "Non-notable" is a non-NPOV designation, therefore not abiding by policy. The person who authored the article probably believes that the topic is notable enough to be included. "Writing 'Delete, non-notable' is not about whether the articles should be in Wikipedia, but rather that it is a quick phrase that does not tell everyone else why the article is non-notable". Brianyoumans, <i>you</i> need to prove that all these school articles aren't notable. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeepOnTruckin_39c2.html" title="User:KeepOnTruckin">KeepOnTruckin</a> 04:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel no need to demonstrate their non-notability. I think you are confusing "notability" and "verifiability". I'm not sure where you are quoting from, but my fundamental objection to these articles is that, since they are not (in my view) notable, they then fall under "Wikipedia is not a directory" and "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If you come up with something notable on one or two of these schools, the articles can always be recreated. But how likely is it that ALL these schools are notable? This isn't <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Wobegon_eb1a.html" title="Lake Wobegon">Lake Wobegon</a>, where "all the children are above average".&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>KeepOnTruckin has misunderstood the instructions on the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> which clearly states that the need to check for sources is part of the nomination process. We can therefore assume that the person who nominated the article was unable to find any suitable sources to justify the notability of this particular school. The onus is not on the people involved in the deletion debate to find such sources. We can only judge the article on what is written. If there are sources which prove the school's notability then it is up to that article's editors to do a re-write and include suitable references. As the article stands there is nothing in the article to indicate that the school is in any way notable and it should therefore be deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahliarose_da64.html" title="User:Dahliarose">Dahliarose</a> 20:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all, especially Amanda Young</b> First off, I'd like to thank Otto for notifying me about the AFD nominations, as most people would have done.

<li><b>Merge all, except Amanda</b> - Unless each article has significant out of universe information, they should all be in one large "List of Saw characters". Amanda is like Jigsaw, a major componant of each film, although that it is unknown until the third film. Research needs to be done to find out of universe information for her and Jigsaw, but the character should have her own page. The rest are minor and not too much out of universe info will probably be found about them, though that isn't suggesting that it shouldn't be tried. But I agree with Otto that we shouldn't masquerade expanded plot summaries as character descriptions. Wiki isn't an indiscriminate collection of information, but that doesn't mean we can't make these characters encyclopedic. One list, contain casting information, person reflection by the actors on the characters, and a bried description about who the character was in context with the film. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 18:57, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You've obviously never seen the films, or else you wouldn't have made such an ignorant statement. There ARE characters in the Saw series who would fit your viewpoint, the ones who appear in one scene and are dispatched gruesomely because they go against Jigsaw's life philosophy. If you have confused these characters with the ones in these articles, then you are grossly mistaken. All of these are complex characters with their own motivations, histories and secrets, many of whom have appeared in more than one film. Calling characters like Jeff and Matthews mere horror film victims in the same line as the horny teenagers from the Jason films does them a great disservice.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 20:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>'Telling someone off'? I was asked by a fellow Wikipedian Huaiwei for my opinion and I merely gave it. As nominator I explain myself. I was telling off someone for ad hominem attacks, which disrupts VfD. A valid point is never retorted. The discussion topic revolves around the article subject, not the nominator. Are you alleging <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks are all right?</li>

<p><b>Metacomment</b>: I previously closed this debate as "delete" on grounds of lacking reliable sources, esp based on Huaiwei's comment <i>it is unlikely that there will be many publications on these elite units, let alone the key people behind them. It is difficult to find good sources, but notability isnt based on how many good sources there are in cases like this</i>. But I'm willing to entertain more input on the issue of sources so I'm re-opening debate. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-12 05:14Z</small></i></span></p>

<li>As nominator, I agree. I think my main purpose for throwing this out is to get some directives on army personnel. At present Wikipedia is pretty blurry over their inclusion/deletion. I'm not so concerned about this one particular officer. As a LTC, he is right smacked in the middle of the Singapore officer hierarchy - though I'm less concerned about rank than with genuine contributions. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Maybe I've missed something, but I am curious as to how these editors know about the man if there are no publications - word of mouth and reputation?

<li>Thank you very much for allowing more air time on the above matter.</li>
<li>I believe my statement has caused some misunderstanding there. I was actually refering to the lack of a high number of courses, but not on the non-existance of any source. The book in question was published by the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Armed_Forces_4830.html" title="Singapore Armed Forces">Singapore Armed Forces</a> in 1995, and available from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Library%2C_Singapore_a18c.html" title="National Library, Singapore">National Library, Singapore</a>/<a href="../../../s/a/f/SAFTI_c735.html" title="SAFTI">SAFTI</a> library. I am not sure if this link will work, but here is the book's entry on its catalogue <a href="http://vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?fullRecord+14276+3031+7674336+1+0" class="external autonumber" title="http://vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?fullRecord+14276+3031+7674336+1+0" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. The book was a special commemorative volume produced to mark the formation's 35th anniversary, and was previously not readily available for public viewing until the tie-up between the military and national libraries. Such is the difficulty of obtaining information on otherwise "classified" information, and the difficulty in looking for sources as I earlier alluded to. Hence, it is not always feasible to use google searches to establish notability on certain topics.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 07:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per some of the points mentioned above. The article at least claims notability. And he is a Lieutenant Colonel, which is not super high up the ranks it is still nothing to sneeze at! That is staff level. Hmmm... arguably all staff level officers are notable? Heh, perhaps not. But still, it does make it more likely. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 10:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Assuming good faith there is a reference given, but there should be two sources to meet the "multiple" criterion. I think that it should be kept and tagged for more sources which validate notability, which comes from creating the commando group. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 21:18, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There appears to be only one book describing his work, and that is not suficcient to meet the requirement of multiple independent and relaible sources. He is mentioned in the article on the commando forse, and perhaps that mention could be expanded to a paragraph. Lt. Col. in a small military organization is not inherently notable. Doing your job well, even in the military, does not bypass other requirements for demonstrating that a person has notability per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:26, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> This article has merit in that it describes someone important to the Singapore Army, but he did not have much worldly recognition, beyond those who had to study his history for their mandatory service in the Singapore armed services. The US military trains a lot of personnel from other nations, to a variety of degrees; his training would have been sponsored as part of a larger military training program to act as a general counter-point to ongoing cold-war fears at the time. In fact, I am not clear what active duties he participated in. Other military pioneers were usually involved in some active duty.--<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakujo_a2c9.html" title="User:Shakujo">Shakujo</a> 05:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem is, the average Singapore Joe/Jane doesn't know that many people outside his or her select band of notables. A person well known to one Singaporean may not be well known to another. You are talking about some who have problems remembering their MPs, the Minister for Environment, the CoA etc, let alone a LTC for a Battalion who seldom hog the news. Ironically, if he murdered or was killed, he'll be remembered. We know <a href="../../../h/u/a/Huang_Na_d278.html" title="Huang Na">Huang Na</a> and Mr <a href="../../../t/t/_/TT_Durai_2548.html" title="TT Durai">TT Durai</a>. Just a general observation.

<dd>Notable is a very vague notation <b>anywhere</b>. But there are certainity degrees of it. This fellow is definitely on the very low side even among active military soldiers. I wonder how notable he is if he doesn't even appear in an search of the ST archives for the last 50 years. If I didn't know better, I would have thought your coment about the Average Singapore Joe is meant to be insulting to the rest of us. Anyway I think the fact that the sources aren't independent coupled with the lack of real world notability (even taking into account how ignorant people who aren't wikipedia editors are&#160;:) ), makes me wonder why anyone would support keeping this article. Excuses about military secrets can only go so far. Otherwise people will start creating articles about Joe X that nobody can verify and use the same execuse. .<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarontay_fcc6.html" title="User:Aarontay">Aarontay</a> 18:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article, so obviously I thought he was noteworthy enough to write an article about. The anonymous guy above is right in that he's notable in the Salt Lake Film Scene, which I'd like to try to document on wikipedia.

So... There's my defense. And as far as the Sundance stuff, I actually saw the documentary and it's also on the IMDb and all of that info is fairly easy to find on google. Would citing more newspaper articles and other sources make this qualify as more notable?

<li>Okay, most of the sources on there are newspapers and news sites, but I'll see if I can find more. And I'm new to the wikipedia thing, so "keep" and "don't delete" seems tantamount to the same thing to me. I was just following suit with the dude above me.... Also, there have been a lot of recent articles that mention the film he's producing, but not him specifically, are those links worth adding?--Utahfilmmakers 03:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I came to add a few more sources, but it seems as though the dude with no profile and Cool Hand Luke the admin did some of that kind of stuff for me.--Utahfilmmakers 02:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As I noted on the talk page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_68h_2180.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/68h">deletion debate</a> seemed pretty <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogus.html" title="Bogus">bogus</a> to me… there is no "68h" series except for in this article. The debate was carried out carelessly with most of the <i>keep</i> comments coming from folks who obviously didn't follow the links, or have no prior knowledge of these chips. ... Check these google results: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=wPB&amp;q=68h+microprocessor+6800+6502+-wiki+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=wPB&amp;q=68h+microprocessor+6800+6502+-wiki+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">68h microprocessor 6800 6502 -wiki -wikipedia</a> gives 79 hits but the first few obviously mirror us. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=2PB&amp;q=%226800%2F6502%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=2PB&amp;q=%226800%2F6502%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">6800/6502</a> gives 342 and 6502/6800 gives 801 (which says something about the relative popularity of the original&#160;:vP ).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term 68h is not used outside of Wikipedia. When people talk about the similarity between the chips they invariably use "6502/6800" or occasionally "6800/6502." The other Wikipedia page referenced in the debate used 68h to refer to the Motorola series only, not the 6502. Indeed the derivation would seem to be an adaptation of <i>68k</i>; where <i>k</i> is the <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> suffix for thousands, <i>h</i> is for hundreds. In this case this should be a redirect page to <a href="../../../6/8/0/6800.html" title="6800">6800</a>.</p>
<p>There is almost no activity at this page. The most significant edit since the last AfD was a tag disputing factual accuracy.</p>
<p>Besides the list of processors, this article only asserts that the processors form a family. Although there is no article on <i>microprocessor family</i>, the term generally implies source code compatibility and not merely a shared design team. This article's assertion is analogous to saying the <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD_K5_0c24.html" title="AMD K5">AMD K5</a> and successors are part of the <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD_29000_ef28.html" title="AMD 29000">AMD 29000</a> family.</p>
<p>My vote: <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola_6800.html" title="Motorola 6800">Motorola 6800</a>. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotatoswatter_0aa8.html" title="User:Potatoswatter">Potatoswatter</a> 02:56, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This AfD was incorrectly made and orphaned, accounting for the date discrepancy. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotatoswatter_0aa8.html" title="User:Potatoswatter">Potatoswatter</a> has just added this to the listing. <b>Abstain</b> from me. <b><a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../h/o/b/User_talk%7EHobbeslover_fb13.html" title="User talk:Hobbeslover">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hobbeslover_dec5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hobbeslover">contribs</a></sup> 05:46, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This was posted on the talk page: - I agree.

<li>Most of the editors in the prior AFD discussion wanted the article <a href="../../../r/e/n/Help%7ERenaming_%28moving%29_a_page_4970.html" title="Help:Renaming (moving) a page">renamed</a> to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola_6800_family.html" title="Motorola 6800 family">Motorola 6800 family</a>, and the 65xx content cut out and pasted into <a href="../../../m/o/s/MOS_Technology_65xx_48a8.html" title="MOS Technology 65xx">MOS Technology 65xx</a>. Rather than <i>simply doing that</i>, which requires no more than the ordinary editing tools that ordinary editors have, and that entirely addresses the above argument that the two familes should not be intermixed, you have brought the article back to AFD for a second time. Fixing the article in a way that addresses your concerns is entirely within your reach using the editing tools that you yourselves already have. It does not require AFD. It does not require administrator intervention. <b>Speedy close.</b> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>The result of the debate was "keep". That was one suggestion by <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">user:AJR</a> which did not spur particular discussion. In any case, there is already a category for the Motorola 6800 processors and this article doesn't contain significant content to start something better. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotatoswatter_0aa8.html" title="User:Potatoswatter">Potatoswatter</a> 22:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It contains an introduction and several annotations against the individual processors. Picking up <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a>'s idea and running with it was something that <i>you could have done yourself</i>. It's actually taken you more edits to write on the talk page and then start and continue this AFD discussion, than it would have for you to have hit the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Help%7ERenaming_%28moving%29_a_page_4970.html" title="Help:Renaming (moving) a page">rename button</a> to rename the article to the suggested name and then hit the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEditing_dd53.html" title="Help:Editing">edit button</a> twice to cut the 65xx content out of this article and paste it into <a href="../../../m/o/s/MOS_Technology_65xx_48a8.html" title="MOS Technology 65xx">MOS Technology 65xx</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, for one articles take me longer than conversation. And for two, I'm not personally in favor of doing that. I think <a href="../../../6/8/0/6800.html" title="6800">6800</a> does a fine job of introducing the family and removing the page is better than trying to hack it. When someone wants to write a 6800 family page, it will be easier to do from scratch. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotatoswatter_0aa8.html" title="User:Potatoswatter">Potatoswatter</a> 03:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The irony is, I'd prolly have just been <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> if there weren't an authoritative vote resulting in "KEEP." <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotatoswatter_0aa8.html" title="User:Potatoswatter">Potatoswatter</a> 03:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Anyway, yeah, I didn't realize it was a pain for any administrators when I did that. I just thought I'd get the attention of anyone caring about/watching this article so as not to step on toes. Given the effort everyone's put into this here discussion, I guess I owe it to go over to 6800, copy a few paragraphs into a new 6800 family article, maybe expand a little, and redirect 68h there. Thus freeing 6800 to grow to describe more about that chip (dates, sales, engineers) and improving organization. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotatoswatter_0aa8.html" title="User:Potatoswatter">Potatoswatter</a> 03:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is not quite this simple. First, he is not notable as a academic, having not received a doctorate and taught only as an istructor. Failed major party candidates for election to national legislatures have always been considered notable--there are only about 500 a year, and at least the top 1000 politicians in the US are notable, And, while we are at it, since WP is not a news service, I thing the governing principle on "maintaining " articles is once N, always N. But as this article does not make clear but its references do--he is not a candidate from a major party, but lost in the primary runoffs.

<p>Non notable person. Does not meet notability criteria.</p>

<li><b>delete</b> The whole Jinny debate, is like "a can of worms" as there doesn't seem to be clear facts if it's true or not. Minus that, the article just doesn't seem notable enough. DannyDoodles 07:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b>This reference <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jinny" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jinny" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> gives the real name of jinny as "Real Name: Alessandro Gilardi, Claudio Varola, Federico Di Bonaventura &amp; Walter Cremonini ". Confusingly British Book of Hit Singles states Jinny as having the real name "Janine Brown". Also noted that this entry mentions only 2 hit singles released in 1995. According to reference below there were at least six singles released over a period of 5-6years. It also suggests that the 1995 tracks were also released several years prior. Was this also by Carryl Varley and does she claim to be the singer of all of these tracks? Whilst the reference below does show an unlabelled photograph that could match the pictures from the article references, a search on Google images shows a "Jinny" cover for a single called "Feel the Rhythm" with a male singer on the cover <a href="http://images.google.com.au/images?hl=en&amp;q=jinny%20feel%20the%20rhythm&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" class="external autonumber" title="http://images.google.com.au/images?hl=en&amp;q=jinny%20feel%20the%20rhythm&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. (It does also show the same photograph of a blonde female for "Wanna Be with you"). If Carryl Varley is the singer "Jinny" then I agree it does meet notability but the references don't seem to support it, except by her claim. <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotmann_94e3.html" title="User:Hotmann">Hotmann</a> 01:23, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - The fact that in the link provided below, the picture is of Carryl Varley, and that she can be seen as the singer in the UK video suggest's, that she is Jinny. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Dinkle_fe5f.html" title="User:The Dinkle">The Dinkle</a> 01:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To begin with, I want to remind everyone that there is not policy of notability on schools. The requirement of stating some assertion of notability is mainly created on the fact that millions of articles that are <i>commercially based</i> or focused <i>individual</i> self-promotion would be littered all over wikipedia. I believe that if any article that is not advertising in this said manner is viable. In addition, as an additional requirement, I believe that articles should have some substance and according to policy, they should have some referenced material or at least list some legitimate sources. This article appears to have some information, and I am sure that in the future, individuals could work on and improve the article based on these sources. As always, we should not be excluded articles on wikipedia on just notability alone; self-promotion and commercial characteristics of articles with illegitimate sources should be the targets of deletion. This article appears to have some possibility for growth, and I believe that if until some templates for clean up and additional sources are added, and <i>then</i> if no progress is made on the article within a few months, then the article can be properly assessed. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 19:42, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am sorry, but your application of the that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">policy</a> is misrepresented. No consensus has yet been reached on the matter in accordance with schools. There are only a few distinct categories of information for which policy has stated should not be here. This does not follow under one of those categories. I believe that the proper maintenance and addition of school articles will foster a higher level of involvement in wikipedia and help to introduce newer less willing users of wikipedia to become contributors as well, and in effect, become involved in a larger scope with wikipedia, adding material in a broader scope. I think that the attempt to create a entire set of articles covering the given Virginia School District was quite a commendable job, and the combined participation by several editors will only help to foster growth in all areas of wikipedia, eventually improving this excellent community tool and service. We should not be discouraging the growth of this overwhelmingly useful community portal which is turned to as a source of information by so many people. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 2:29, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

But hey, don't take my word for it, instead check out some of the references or do a search to find some and improve Wikipedia. Now, Inkpaduta, you make a good point here: "But for some reason the editors of Wikipedia find cartoon and game characters more exciting than humdrum schools and such". Now, to cite the guideline on deletion:"General notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy." So, we as wikipedians aren't who decides whether a school or cartoon characters are more notable; the world is. The business about wikipedia not being the yellow pages or a directory, heres the part on that:<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a>. That is trying to keep individual businesses from advertising or promoting oon wikipedia. Now, i could be wrong, but last time I checked, a school system is not a business.</li>

The purpose of creating this assertion on notability is to prevent business and people from self-promoting themselves. Obviously this is not the case, and, in fact, this could be a much more useful article that promotes contributions around wikipedia from otherwise unlikely users. Wikipedia is a very powerful tool, and we should be working to improve and expand it, not just try to delete every article that we think should not be here. Every article can be a useful tool as long as it meets the general procedural standards such as style, non-commercialism and proper research. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 6:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the quote, but it doesn't really have much in terms of this discussion or the official wikipedia policy. Notability is not the only definer of an article; there are many characteristics such as the style and quality of research which can make any article that is not commercial or promotional a proper and acceptable article. Wikipedia will never be perfect, and deleting every article for just one reason is not helping at all, and is perhaps hurting. You are distancing the community that uses wikipedia, and very likely are preventing the contributions of otherwise hesitant users. I am sorry if your egotistical attitude is getting in the way of making wikipedia better and more accessible for both users and contributors. In the end, we can only benefit from any additional information that is presented to us on a factual and non-biased basis.

<dd>To "protect" a school article such as this, or any article, it is best to begin by doing searches via Google or other search engine, for notable comments. It is especially helpful if a local community paper has listings of articles involving the school. Both good and bad notations of the school should be included to ensure you are not creating a biased pro- or anti-school POV. Consider how <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach_Channel_High_School_6994.html" title="Beach Channel High School">Beach Channel High School</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> was treated and see if you can likewise put in a good half-dozen or more references for each of these schools.

<li><b>Delete All</b>. Not obviously notable. I think we're beginning to see a pattern here: the strategy of the schools clique seems to be to start with high schools, then get all middle schools in, and then elementary schools. Meanwhile we're getting articles on every g*d-darn mall in North America, people are adding half the streets in their home town, and churches, post offices and funeral parlors are not far behind. The entire thing is turning into a running battle between the elitists ( in which category I include myself ) and those who are temperamentally opposed to elitism. There's no middle ground, any more than there is between scientists and the students of the fluffy subjects, and, just as scientific thinkers/rationalists are in a minority, so the elitists will be here. It might be better just to accept that Wikipedia is screwed and create an elitist fork.

<dd>I specifically include Luther Jackson Middle School for deletion. I can see why people are going to claim notability, but I don't think it's a particularly notable piece of "notability". If we accept it, we'll also have to accept an article on the oldest school in the district, and then someone will push for the "largest", and then the "smallest", and before we know it we'll be back to schools whose teams have won some local sports competition three years in a row. The line I want to draw excludes Luther Jackson Middle School.

<dd><b>Comment</b> While it is true that some of the articles do not have notability, that schools that the articles are discussing do have notability, this can be found by a google search. WMMartin, if you have just glanced through the article, and, seeing no assertion of notability, decided it needs to be deleted, please help contribute to wikipedia instead of demoishing it. Also, if you are biased towards all the articles just because they are schools, may I kindly suggest that you focus your attention more upon deleting nonsense and commercial articles with absolutly no use here instead of school articles that can be improved and are reasonable inclusions on Wikipedia. To your point on accepting all sorts of school articles: Let them be accepted. Schools are not bad things, and they are allowed on wikipedia, and wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia and therefore can have articles on everything with no limits (except those of the server, and right now this talk page is most likely taking up more space than the article itself...touche). Your account, like Brainyoumans' is one that mostly participates in deleting pages (cite your userpage) which is ok with me when you are deleting useless junk that does not belong on wikipedia. Now, I might be wrong, but a school is not useless junk, and most of us would not be editing here had we not gone to school.

<li><b>Comment</b> - (same as at other AfD requests) - I believe there was a breach of proper protocol... First, you should mark the articles as unsourced. Then allow the authors/editors of the articles, say, a week in order to add citations and references as a proof of notability. ONLY ONCE some time has past in which the notability of the school can be proven or disproven should they be nominated for AfD. I think this entire swath of deletions was premature. It also causes editors to pay attention to defending their work rather than build on it. Stop this AfD movement and let people make better articles. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 06:20, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think in the future I will in fact put these articles up in smaller batches, to make it easier for people to participate. I would point out that only one article out of 13 AFDed here has shown any notability. I think that editors need to consider seriously whether or not an article is needed before creating it.

<li>Its quite difficult to be discussing the deletion of a large group of articles on 3 different pages. Anyway, All schools are notable to me, and I am happy to read an article on any school on wikipedia, regardless of district. Brianyoumans, you have consitently stated that the reason you want these articles deleted is because they have no assertion of notability/they arent notable enough to be on wikipedia. Let me say this again, citing the guide to deletion (my apologies if I am making the same argument twice) <b>"the fact that you haven't heard of something, or don't personally consider it worthy, are not criteria for deletion. You must look for, and demonstrate that you couldn't find, any independent sources of sufficient depth."</b> "Lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion, because (among other reasons) this isn't specifically stated in the deletion policy; and since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Paper" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and has no size limits [except those of the server...not important here], there's no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include "everything" that fits in with the other criteria, such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>". If these schools are such a non-notable topic, then people wont search for them. They arent harming Wikipedia, but they are helping anyone who read them. In fact, if "we delete articles solely due to their obscurity, currently obscure, or seemingly obscure, subjects may gain more popular interest at a later date. In such a case, deleted articles will constitute a loss of valuable (and perhaps, in the transitory world of the internet, irreproducible) information." "Non-notable" is a non-NPOV designation, therefore not abiding by policy. The person who authored the article probably believes that the topic is notable enough to be included. "Writing 'Delete, non-notable' is not about whether the articles should be in Wikipedia, but rather that it is a quick phrase that does not tell everyone else why the article is non-notable". Brianyoumans, <i>you</i> need to prove that all these school articles aren't notable. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeepOnTruckin_39c2.html" title="User:KeepOnTruckin">KeepOnTruckin</a> 04:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Zeppo Network, Inc is a S-Corp founded in 2004 which is the IP holder of the ZeppOS management software which turned down a multi-million dollar buyout offer in July of 2005. Instead it formed a subsidiary, Empowered Internet Solutions to distribute the software in a grass roots effort. This company has since become the largest web solution provider for the state of Hawaii. Over the past several months Empowered Internet Solutions has launched sales offices in California and Florida. It has been featured in many trade magazines. The content is relevant and needs to stay. Thank you.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertholf_df38.html" title="User:Robertholf">Rob Bertholf</a> 08:02, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A walled garden of marketing for a company that markets a "content management solution". I'm not convinced by appearances in obscure business publications, which are more than likely not much more than paid ads. Out. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 23:03, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate the cautious sentiment about a new post and the constructive direction I was previously steered. I am however now growing weary of the unjustifiably elitist mentality shown by Brianyoumans. In rebuttal, I would hardly call Biz Journal (Pacific Business News) an obscure publication. Admittedly, we have done much in the way of paid advertisement in large state magazines but I have not listed that here. Articles were written on me by both the Pacific Edge and InMagazine due to the fact that they found my vision and success <b>notable</b>. Nothing which was posted was driven by a sales agenda. The content posted is factual and unbiased. The fact that The Zeppo Network provides research and development on search engine technology and offers a content management system is not something which should be looked down upon. Fact is we have turned down a substantial buyout offer, we own the largest market share in the state of Hawaii and have two rapidly growing regional sales offices now in California and Florida. The only point which I feel is valid is the fact that I posted the content with a username which was not made up. Had I posted the content from various fake accounts we would not be having this discussion. To remedy this situation, I have asked my employees, my pr firm, my friends and my enemies to become active on these posts to alleviate the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. Over the next 24 hours there will be numerous posts by previously named sources which I hope proves to satisfy you all. I honestly feel the post adds valuable content and am open to suggestions on methods for solidifying my companies place here.

<li><b>Comment</b> Searching on "ZeppOS" and "content management" on Google gives you only 913 hits... many of which aren't even relevant. Search for "OpenCMS", and you get over 3 million; even "Hot Banana" "content management" (another commercial system) gives over 86K hits. You are a small regional firm, and while I wish you much luck, I don't see why you or your products need Wikipedia articles, especially ones written by your marketing department. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:54, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Appology accepted Brianyoumans, I think that intentions are everything, had we met in person you would sense my sincerity and even been the one to start the post on the Zeppo Network&#160;:) Evangelism is what it is, my energy typically is quite contageous and the product speaks for itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>The Sell</b> I have avoided any marketing spin in the wiki posts, but here is some additional info to set the stage for who we are.
<ul>
<li>The <b>Zeppo Network</b> started its R&amp;D on search technology in 2003, the ZeppOS platform was developed to fill a need for logically storing data found in a website.</li>
<li>The <b>ZeppOS</b> software is different than the typical CMS systems we see popping up which are extremely polarized; either overly complex or easy to use but limited in functionality. We received our last patent pending in July 2005 using Heller and Ehrman for a standard web platform. ZeppOS is unique in the fact that it arguably has more functionality than any competitor yet has a very easy to use navigation and usability. The system was created with the designers in mind, most designers do not use a CMS because it limits their creativity, our system showcases designers abilities.</li>
<li>We presented the software to several companies, one of which being Yahoo International. They were interested in purchasing the software but did not have the same vision for methods of deploying it. The large ISP's who were interested in the product wanted to mass distribute it with generic stock templates, we felt this would provide the wrong image of the software ultimately limiting its potential. We then started contacting local web design companies to distribute the software but found that their reach was limited. I am sure we would all agree that most web design companies do not have a bigger vision and typically service 2-5 clients a month maximum. We then formed a web solutions company specifically structured to rapidly deploy higher end custom web solutions at a very low rate. <b>Empowered Internet</b> proved itself in the Hawaii, in 2006 while confined to a limited market we deployed over 20 sites each month. Some very large projects to include military bases, community colleges/educational institutions, four chamber of commerce’s (to include the main Hawaii Chamber), and many small and medium sized businesses. We partnered locally with Clear Channel broadcasting and deployed sites for Budweiser and Time Warner Cable. With just one month in two new markets we have already laid the groundwork for replicating the success we found in Hawaii.</li>
<li>The bigger picture is to continue gaining market share and then launch Zeppo Search which will allow us to feed relevant web content to search engines. There is a much bigger vision which we do not advertise for obvious reasons. I have presented all I intend to sway your opinions on this post. If you have any hoops to jump through I will have one of my team to do so.

<li><b>Comment</b> I dissagree, it seems it has been justified that there is enough regional interest due to the industry dominance in the state of Hawaii as proved by press clips and TV interviews.

<li><b>Merge and trim</b> into one article and re-write / remove undue weight from much of the content as much of it is repeated and has the feel of an advertisement.

<li><b>Delete</b> See <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>.The schools appear to be referenced to their own website and the state education department. What is needed are multiple references that are to reliable and verifiable sources independent of the subject of the article, and which are not trivial or pro forma such as "school starts next week" or "classes cancelled because of snow." The school itself should be a primary subject of the story, in other words not "Teacher at X school dies in car wreck". In my own town, I could find a dozen articles talking about the founding of a school, controversies about the curriculum or the administration, articles about innovations, and articles about expansions to or safety hazards in the building. Based on AFDs, we have been more willing to keep articles on high schools than on elementary or middle school. Per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> is is appropriate to mention them in the article on the town or school system. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. To begin with, I want to remind everyone that there is not policy of notability on schools. The requirement of stating some assertion of notability is mainly created on the fact that millions of articles that are <i>commercially based</i> or focused <i>individual</i> self-promotion would be littered all over wikipedia. I believe that if any article that is not advertising in this said manner is viable. In addition, as an additional requirement, I believe that articles should have some substance and according to policy, they should have some referenced material or at least list some legitimate sources. This article appears to have some information, and I am sure that in the future, individuals could work on and improve the article based on these sources. As always, we should not be excluded articles on wikipedia on just notability alone; self-promotion and commercial characteristics of articles with illegitimate sources should be the targets of deletion. This article appears to have some possibility for growth, and I believe that if until some templates for clean up and additional sources are added, and <i>then</i> if no progress is made on the article within a few months, then the article can be properly assessed. Also, lastly, I want to reemphasize the point addressed before, these articles are most likely a very good stepping stone for future contributions from otherwise, unlikely and hesitant contributors. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 22:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have not the least objection to articles about schools at any level, if there is something notable to say in the article. I like local history when it's interesting, and many localities and local institutions could potentially be intersting. But it merely confuses the notability of the truly notable ones to have articles on each and every one. Let the notable ones set a standard, and the other may try to see if they can find something comparable.

<dd>I believe there was a breach of proper protocol in that case. First, you should mark the articles as unsourced. Then allow the authors/editors of the articles, say, a week in order to add citations and references as a proof of notability. ONLY ONCE some time has past in which the notability of the school can be proven or disproven should they be nominated for AfD. I think this entire swath of deletions was premature. It also causes editors to pay attention to defending their work rather than build on it. Stop this AfD movement and let people make better articles. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 01:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The question is not whether an article is well-done, or even whether one can find reliable sources for the information. The question is, "Is the subject notable? Is it interesting in some way?" If the answer is, "This is a fine school (or library, or church, or street, or club), but one cannot really say anything about it that would interest someone not from the district", then I believe the answer is that we shouldn't have an article on it.

<dd>It quite obviously <i>is</i> germaine; if I had thought these schools to be notable, we wouldn't be discussing deleting the articles. And more to the point, a number of random editors appear to agree with me. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> is only a proposal, by the way; it may well go the way of SCHOOLS 1 and 2. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 03:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of the nuber of random editors who agree with you, whether or not an article gets deleted is not determined by the amount of votes. All schools are notable to me, and I am happy to read an article on any school on wikipedia, regardless of district. Brianyoumans, you have consitently stated that the reason you want these articles deleted is because they have no assertion of notability/they arent notable enough to be on wikipedia. Let me say this again, citing the guide to deletion (my apologies if I am making the same argument twice) <b>"the fact that you haven't heard of something, or don't personally consider it worthy, are not criteria for deletion. You must look for, and demonstrate that you couldn't find, any independent sources of sufficient depth."</b> "Lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion, because (among other reasons) this isn't specifically stated in the deletion policy; and since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Paper" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and has no size limits [except those of the server...not important here], there's no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include "everything" that fits in with the other criteria, such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>". If these schools are such a non-notable topic, then people wont search for them. They arent harming Wikipedia, but they are helping anyone who read them. In fact, if "we delete articles solely due to their obscurity, currently obscure, or seemingly obscure, subjects may gain more popular interest at a later date. In such a case, deleted articles will constitute a loss of valuable (and perhaps, in the transitory world of the internet, irreproducible) information." "Non-notable" is a non-NPOV designation, therefore not abiding by policy. The person who authored the article probably believes that the topic is notable enough to be included. "Writing 'Delete, non-notable' is not about whether the articles should be in Wikipedia, but rather that it is a quick phrase that does not tell everyone else why the article is non-notable". Brianyoumans, <i>you</i> need to prove that all these school articles aren't notable. --<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeepOnTruckin_39c2.html" title="User:KeepOnTruckin">KeepOnTruckin</a> 04:26, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think I took a close enough look at the CEFPI site to be able to say; there is a page of award winners, and a page of "entrants" - and Liberty is listed under "entrants" and NOT under "winners". The "award type" I think is just the <i>category</i> that it was nominated in. Also, if you go to the Samaha Associates site, their design for Auburn Middle School is mentioned as having won a CEFPI award - and Liberty isn't.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, I was slightly offended when - upon googling my school name - I found that there was not a Wikipedia page. I created a page for Rocky Run Middle School using verified information from the school website. Since then, it has been added onto by others, which only proves that the site is useful and used. My younger sister will be attending RRMS next year and she and her friends find the information useful. I believe this article has as good a reason as any to stay. By the way, Rocky Run's Jamie Sawatzky won Virginia History Teahcer of the Year in 2006 and the school has won numerous other awards. It is a great school and this information should be out there for people to see. --Thank You. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElesi_3d2c.html" title="User:Elesi">Elesi</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../e/l/e/User_talk%7EElesi_dec2.html" title="User talk:Elesi">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elesi_3a99.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elesi">Contribs</a></sup></span> 22:59, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tagged Mass killings and Carmet ellison as hoaxes, didn't tag Nerissa strong on the basis of some trivial google hits (a press release from a local source and some myspace stuff).

<dd>As an aside, I don't think that strict interpretation of the CSD is serviceable. By my estimation from patrolling new articles, we get about 50 every day where the entire content is "I'm Pricilla Bittlesworth and I'm the sexiest and most talented person in TEH WORLD." They invariably get delted on A7 grounds (or A1 if they're truly trivial), regardless of the fact that that's most certainly a <b>claim</b> of notability (the person would be notable if it were true). If the view were taken that any claim of notability, no matter how easily disproven or how unvarifiable, exempts an article from A7 then this Afd process would be substantially and unduly emburdened. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 11:46, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a potentially POV redirect. "Killing" and "murder" have very different connotative meanings.

<dd>True true, that is a very good point. Then again most readers probably wouldn't understand the subtly of the POV?

<li><b>DELETE</b> - No longer notable, also it is well covered in the Air America Radio, and Gloria Wise articles. Nearly all the sources on this page are extremely biased (right wing newspapers and blogs), and a quick Google reveals that very few unbised and factual sources can be found for this story. Now that this issue is past, a summary on the AAR page is warranted, but not a seperate article. I realize that this links to a lot of pages, but that is due to a "related articles" link in the Air America template. In October of 05, some reasons to keep were that it was "a subject that it seems a few people want to discuss" Now we know it is basically a deflated conspiracy theory and it is simply not much of an issue anymore. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENut-meg_ecbc.html" title="User:Nut-meg">nut-meg</a> 07:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> We know that <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> is a hoax, but it's a Zeitgiest thing - an issue which somebody may wish to know the history of, even if it's all resolved.

<dd>Dhartung, Im not sure what he's talking about, because until recently I don't believe I have edited the Air America article at all. But I had initially pared down the section on Gloria Wise in the Air America artlcle, as it had terrible NPOV problems and a lot of false or misleading information.

<li><b>Merge</b> into Air America Radio article after boiling it down to a few well referenced points. This is too much writing about a legal squabble over an $800,000 loan. A big law firm will have a number of cases at any instant which are far bigger than this and just as non-encyclopedic. Most of the references are to partisan newspapers only a cut above the National Enquirer. The one reliable source, the New York Times, just says Franken talked about the matter. As for a notable subject not being able to become non-notable, a better analysis is that it was never really notable in the first place, with the application of 20-20 hindsight. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 23:13, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (or at most, <i>merge</i> per Dhartung and Inkpaduta above). It seems to me that if an article needs to include "incident" or "controversy" in its title, odds are that article usually cannot stand on its own and is better off included in the parent article. A succinct summary in the parent article does not have to mean that the sub-topic cannot be done "justice". This is not wikinews or similar. Only very rarely is it necessary to break-off a single event into a separate article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with the decision to remove the article from Wikipedia, though I was the one who added it. Though it is obviously B.S., its merit lies in the likelihood of common-sense insight coming to the surface due to the copious amounts of ambiguity inherent in the system. However there are many other, better-established systems which operate on the same principle and can be used for many of the same purposes (feng shui, for example). It is redundant, for this reason I support its deletion. <a href="../../../r/w/6/User%7ERw63phi_5cf7.html" title="User:Rw63phi">RW</a> 09:41, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Purely a news item, this is not <i>encyclopedia worthy</i>, merely <i>newsworthy</i>. Article belongs on Wikinews.

<li><b>Keep but expand</b>. The article as it stands is barely above stub level: six names, a paragraph, three references and one See also. But the subject in itself is encyclopedic: what is the background of the suspects, how was the plot foiled, how does this relate to the wider British Muslim community, what are the consequences of this in terms of measures and legislation, etcetera. A lot can be written about this subject, and it's up to us to do so. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Brievenbus</a></sup> 10:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wrong. See our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. It's up to historians, journalists, and others to do the research and write all of the things that you list. As encyclopaedists, our task is to summarize and condense what they have written and published. If you want to make a case for keeping this article, arguing that it's up to us to perform original research isn't the way to do it. Cite sources to show that a lot <i>has been</i> written about it, by others, not that a lot <i>can be</i> written about it by us. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:39, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly, it's up to historians and journalists to research what I have listed. Historians will do so in a few years time, but journalists are already digging into the issue. That's what the references are for. This particular case has received widespread media coverage from all over the world, and the relevant information in those sources needs to be gathered to form an encyclopedic article. I agree that the article isn't as it should be atm, but that is no grounds for deletion. Digging into the issue ourselves would be original research, gathering what journalists have written about the issue is not. I merely said that a lot can be added to the article, I never said that the original research for it should be done by us. Because that's indeed not our task. What we can do is gather the original research of reliable sources. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Brievenbus</a></sup> 01:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is highly newsworthy, but in time will become historic. It is desirable that the article is shaped contemporously rather than afterwards. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia yes, but it is an encyclopedia with several advantages over traditional ones. Among those advantages is the ability to document history as it happens.212.219.242.194 12:43, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

That's for journalists, not encyclopaedists. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_sources_and_content_98bf.html#Being_.22wiki.22_does_not_mean_being_first" title="User:Uncle G/On sources and content">"wiki" means "fast", not "first"</a>. If you want to write about "highly newsworthy" things, you are in the wrong project. The project for editors who want to be journalists, and which decides what to include based upon its newsworthiness, is <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="n:Main_Page">Wikinews</a>. <i>This</i> project <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_Pillars_90a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Five Pillars">is an encyclopaedia</a>. Encyclopaedists condense and summarize documentation that has already been written and published outside of Wikipedia. If in time the events do become historic, then Wikipedia should have an article. But you yourself imply that they have not yet become historic; and it seems somewhat premature, and skirting dangerously close to flouting our <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiography_of_living_persons_c3d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Biography of living persons">Wikipedia:Biography of living persons</a> policy, to have an article that does little more than simply list the names and ages of specific, identifiable, people who have yet to be actually convicted of the crimes that they are charged with. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:39, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but expand</b> (Disclaimer: I started this article) One of the many reasons to keep this article is that it marks a shift in terrorist tactics, from mass casualty bombings to the use of Iraq style beheadings on the streets of Britain (this will get put into the article when i have the right source). As to legislation, the first thing the police talked about was upping the max 28 day detention without charge to 90 days. Also the "police state for muslims" quote stirred up a hornets nest, especially as he was released under a judges order as he did not think they had enough evidence to continue holding him without charge.

<li>You make an interesting point. But in fact it is possible to say: Even failed terrorist plots, when they involve new tactics, commonly have an effect on security policy: The shoe-bomb incident resulted in shoes being checked and often taken off at airports; The liquids incident resulted in containers with liquid being banned. Also, others may copy this tactic. Obviously, those other incidents involved public transportation and this is limited to Muslims in the military, and obviously nobody has a crystal ball, but it isn't a wild guess that this incident will have a strong effect on Muslims in Western military organizations. In fact, it's overwhelmingly probable that attitudes (of Muslim and non-Muslim soldiers) and policies (about protecting Muslim soldiers) will be affected. Soldiers with intimate knowledge of Muslim languages and culture are extremely important in Western armies today. I'd bet the rent money that this will be important five and 10 years from now, just as the U.S.S. Cole, Black Hawk Down incidents have been influential.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 15:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC) (minor edit for clarity)

<li>If this incident does lead to any such changes in the future, then yes, it would deserve an article here. However, it has not, and a guess about what <i>may happen</i> as a result is not of any encyclopedic value. Even if one person thinks that it is "overwhelmingly probable" for x to occur, until x actually does occur, that argument is invalid. Also, I cited WP:CIVIL for comments like "how important could it be for us to actually use our heads?" Believe it or not, most people in this discussion are using their heads, and then supporting that thought with policy and guidelines. You should not lose sight of this just becuase your opinion is not universally shared. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 21:35, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

Even taken out of context, it is a criticism of poor argumentation, and in context it shows I'm advocating that editors prize common sense more as they apply rules. Speaking of common sense, to suggest that this terrorist plot might not affect policies and people in the future is simply to ignore how past terrorist plots in the West, when they've been innovative (or at least brought tactics to new countries), have almost invariably affected people and policies up to the present.

Bearing in mind the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_Style_77eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary Style">Wikipedia:Summary Style</a> recommends that sub-topics within a particular topic are split out to prevent articles becoming too long, you inevitably end up with articles on minor topics which would never expect to see on, say, Encyclopedia Brittanica. I accept that not all newsworthy events are encyclopedic topics, but when does the first become the second? The definition of encyclopedia - a comprehensive reference work - gives a clue in that people should have to want to refer to it. The event must have some historical relevance - perhaps a new law, a new political movement or something. It must be part of a greater trend, not an isolated instance. It should be part of a larger narrative. The article on a notable event - unlike a newspaper coverage of an event - should analyse the context and explain the impact and consequences of the event rather than just detail the event itself. This is, in fact, a good example of an event which <b>is</b> part of some much greater themes. When we start writing decent articles on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_the_United_Kingdom_96ae.html" title="Terrorism in the United Kingdom">Terrorism in the United Kingdom</a>, Islamist Terrorism in the United Kingdom and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom_642f.html" title="Islam in the United Kingdom">Islam in the United Kingdom</a>, events like this one will be key parts of these overall narratives. It's good to have articles with an indepth coverage of events like these - after all, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_is_not_paper.html" title="Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> - so that we can use our summary style and integrate them in. Isolated events with no wider consequence - like a highway crash perhaps - can be newsworthy but not encyclopedic, but this article is definitely both. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a>(<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewRT_58ab.html" title="User talk:AndrewRT">Talk</a>) 01:02, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I can't see any reason to delete it? Gaysimon 16:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It's largely fabrication and exaggeration. I know the guy and he's a rampant self-publicist. In fact you'll probably find he wrote the article himself. The very minor role he did play in the events stated happened many years ago, and if you read between the lines you'll see that he didn't actually do that much. It's basically a vanity piece. 86.146.93.170 12:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Although I've just noticed that you appear to have written the original article, so I guess you're him. 86.146.93.170 18:47, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I'm not. The only requests I've had from Chris Morris have been to REMOVE material from the page, which I did because that specific info was unsourced and untrue (according to him). He doesn't seem publicity hungry to me, his own website doesn't mention anything about his campaigns and he declined to be interviewed for a uni article I did last year. Gaysimon 15:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia isn't the place to settle personal scores, is it? Chris Morris is well known in the gay community and this article has been on Wikipedia for years with edits by many members and ratings by WikiProject Biography and WikiProject LGBT studies. I think 86.146.93.170 could actually be accused of vandalism here. Randomhouse 20:47, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well known in the gay community? I don't think so. The only thing he's noted for is something to do with the age of consent many many years ago. He was one of a great many people who were involved in that campaign, including myself. The other one was trying (and failing) to arrest Mugabe, which got about 10 seconds on the evening news one evening (primarily because the *genuine* prominent gay activist Peter Tatchell was involved, otherwise nobody would've cared). If you want to keep him on then that's up to whoever makes the decisions. My suggestion for deletion isn't based on malice. If everyone who's ever been involved with a campaign was entitled to their own Wikipedia entry then the size of the site would double overnight. Although judging by the way you previously edited this article to make him an "outspoken" activist (rather than the.. ermm.. other type of activist?), I can only assume you're a mate of his. And I hardly think you can call an "article for deletion" vandalism. This is why Wikipedia has a democratic system for deletions. I haven't made ANY alterations to the actual article text. 86.146.93.170 11:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By the way, would you also like to edit the article to include details of his supposed past (and presumably present) ownership of a gay porn site, or would that go against the rosy picture you're trying to paint of him as the next prime minister? 86.146.93.170 11:33, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't want to add information about the gay porn site because frankly I don't think it's a very nice thing to do. As I said before, I'm not doing this out of malice.

However, once again, this is the reason why we have a democratic system on Wikipedia, so if people believe he should be kept then I'm not going to contest it. 86.146.93.170 09:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as a significant factor in <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutherland_v._United_Kingdom_65eb.html" title="Sutherland v. United Kingdom">Sutherland v. United Kingdom</a> and the Mugabe incident, although I think it should be made clear that Morris's case was never heard by the European Court. At least as I understand it, the case was purely Sutherland v. United Kingdom; the Morris case was essentially identical, but never went before the court: "[Morris's] case was never heard, but he helped publicise the campaign for equality." <a href="http://www.stonewall.org.uk/information_bank/criminal_law/66.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stonewall.org.uk/information_bank/criminal_law/66.asp" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 16:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The fact is neither case was actually heard in court but the likelihood of them winning (based on the Commission's report) was enough to force the government to change the law. The binding settlement was with them both. They may have fallen out in later years but it was significant at the time that it was a young couple fighting this and not a professional politician. Big respect to them for that and let's remember the good they both did at that time. Nick 80.225.131.144 17:40, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

In past AfD discussions, it has been consistently the consensus among experienced editors that political youth organizations don't provide automatic notability even to their national officers, let alone to their candidates or to local group officials. To pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, such a person must have been a primary subject of third-party coverage that says more than "this group exists on campus and So-and-so is its chairman". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This list appears to be superfluous as the politicians listed all have articles already. However, I would be fairly sure that not all members of the House of Representatives since 1901 do not have articles and there might be a case for a list to guide our efforts in article creation.

<li>I am not disputing the <i>potential</i> for an article with this title to be useful. I am disputing that the current article is either useful in its current state, or more useful than an empty page as a starting point for a useful list. It has less than 10% of the people eligible to be in the list, and at least one who should not be on it. Prior to this AFD, nobody had shown any interest in attempting to complete, update, or maintain the list, which contains one person who will retire from the <b>senate</b> in 2008.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Does a list help navigation if it is not comprehensive and is unlikely to ever be comprehensive? As the nominator observed there is no clear criteria for inclusion or exclusion. If you have a look at the politics sub section for example there is a scattering of prime ministers but not all, the inclusions are definitely random and a very small proportion of Australian politicians which have wikipedia articles are listed.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 20:39, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your detailed response. I think it would be appropriate to merge this list into a number of smaller, more targeted, and thus more maintainable lists (e.g., List of Australian musicians, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_politicians_22c1.html" title="List of Australian politicians">List of Australian politicians</a>, etc.), and then to rename this list <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a>, leaving it with links to all of the List of Australian "profession" articles. In response to your points:
<ul>
<li>Although the list (and thus any list based on it) is incomplete, I think it can be made comprehensive by looking through <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralians_01c8.html" title="Category:Australians">Category:Australians</a>.</li>
<li>The current inclusion criteria of "people born in Australia" should obviously probably "notable people born in Australia"--we do not want a directory of millions of Australians. WP probably has articles on a few thousand Australians <i>at most</i>. Once they are distributed over 10 or more articles, their maintenance should be far less problematic.</li>
<li>I think changing it to "<i>notable</i> (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) and born in Australia" would make it an unambigous and quite exclusionary membership criterion. We could add a hidden note to the article that only individuals who have WP articles should be listed (all of the "Year" pages (e.g., <a href="../../../1/5/2/1526.html" title="1526">1526</a>) do so.</li>
<li>I want to make 2 points regarding references. First, the article links themselves constitute "soft" references (the same is true of including individuals in a category). Second, the requirement for living persons only applies for "negative material" and, I don't think country of birth qualifies under this.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If I can get your support, I am willing to go ahead and split the article myself, add the specific inclusion criterion (notable, Australian, and politician; notable, Australian, and musician; etc.), and try to make them as comprehensive as possible (by adding notable Australians who are on WP)--of course, it would take several days and I would certainly appreciate any help&#160;;-). I look forward to your comments. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Changing the lead to "<i>notable</i> (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) and born in Australia" would make it a <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">self reference</a> which is generally frowned on. Making a hidden comment about only adding entries for people already on Wikipedia destroys the suggestion that the list is important <i>because</i> it contains redlinks (a comment below). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 22:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I actually meant changing the lead to "notable and born in Australia" -- I did not intend that we should put "per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>" in the article itself, but rather to clarify what I meant as notable. Also, I don't really buy the argument of importance <i>because</i> of redlinks--I think the value of the list lies in aiding navigation and being informative. In fact, I think all redlinks should be removed (either completely deleted or un-linked and left as black text <i>only if</i> there is additional <i>cited</i> information about that person). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:30, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem with categories is that the subject has to have an article. In the "Science and Technology" section there are 15 redlinks, all for people or objects or organisations that should have an article. There is much larger number of redlinks there than other sections, reflecting the poor covereage of Australian Scientists in WP.

Graeme Clark should surely be mentioned in the article on the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochlear_implant.html" title="Cochlear implant">Cochlear implant</a> - he isn't&#160;?!? - does that mean he wasn't a significant contributor or that the Cochlear implant article is incomplete?

Similarly the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stump-jump_plough.html" title="Stump-jump plough">Stump-jump plough</a> should be updated to include the Smith brothers, inclusion on the list is no substitute for not making sure the article which is the focus of their achievement is more adequate. The only other orphaned red link is Nathaniel Szymczak - in my ignorance I have never heard of him, he is not linked anywhere - it may be that he should have an article but a red link on a list that fails to explain why he is notable is no solution!--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 20:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, although I can easily create new lists, I'm wondering as to value of a List of Australian academics or aviators that contains only 5 or so names. I have removed all names from the "Architecture", "Politics", and "Sports" sections (leaving only links to the main articles). How about renaming this page <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a> and spinning it off into separate lists where possible, but leaving in particularly short sections? This would leave in sections like "Academia" and "Law", which would later be turned into unique lists of their own once WP gathered more articles on Australian academics and jurists, respectively. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am open to the possibility of a list of lists of people. Some of those lists will be fine, but some will likely suffer the same problems as this list - unclear inclusion criteria. I support the lists complying with <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> that have objective, citable references for membership and a realistic chance of being complete and maintained (such as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister_of_Australia_1ffb.html#List_of_Prime_Ministers" title="Prime minister of Australia">prime minister of Australia#List of Prime Ministers</a>). I don't support lists where membership is based on some subjective estimate of notability or on the existence of a Wikipedia article. "List of Australian aviators" could include every <a href="../../../q/a/n/Qantas.html" title="Qantas">Qantas</a> or <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Blue_630c.html" title="Virgin Blue">Virgin Blue</a> pilot, which makes it unsuitable as a list unless we honestly believe they should all be in it. "List of pioneer aviators in Australia" could be defined to only include people who were pilots before World War I started, for example, which makes it a closed list with a defined membership criteria that makes every member notable. An academics list must require a higher standard than "Has a Ph.D. and is employed by a university". Some of the subheadings will be easy to make suitable criteria for. Most will be hard or impossible.--<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you are being a bit too literal in your interpretation. A "List of Australians" should not include every Australian who ever lived no more than <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_people_4823.html" title="Category:Australian people">Category:Australian people</a> should. Lists on WP are assumed to be about subjects who are notable (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Lists_of_people" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Lists of people</a>). The lead sentence itself states that "this is a list of <i>notable</i> people", so you've automatically excluded anyone who does not belong in WP. Is every Australian pilot notable? Of course not! So, naturally, they won't be included. I really don't see what's wrong with having a list of notable Australians. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The problem is, do we know if the term Ecomophism (as 'coined' by Rion Wight) is the same ecomorphism as discussed by A. Turner et. al? <a href="http://www.lunchoverip.com/2007/01/dld07_norman_fo.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lunchoverip.com/2007/01/dld07_norman_fo.html" rel="nofollow">This link</a> , provided in the article doesn't mention the term. Don't get me wrong, the architectural approach mentioned in the article does describe a 'trend' (which can probably be traced back to Robert and Brenda Vale and others in the mid 70's, the concurrent oil crisis and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Lovelock_d6ef.html" title="James Lovelock">James Lovelock</a>'s gaia hypothesis) - my problem is I'm not sure this approach is any different to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_design.html" title="Green design">green design</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainable_design.html" title="Sustainable design">sustainable design</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_design.html" title="Environmental design">environmental design</a> etc.etc.etc. (or whatever other articles we have on the subject), and I'm not sure the term is in wide spread usage and so may fail notablility criteria.

<li><b>Keep, but improve</b> Article is more interesting and informative than the typical high school article, and the school's status as the first high school for blacks adds to its notability. It's not very well organized and written, and it needs sourcing. I don't know if it is possible to tell whether the content in the article appeared first in publicschoolreview or here, since both sites accept user contributions (the same person may have contributed to both sites). However, it should not be hard to improve upon the current article. I found the school's own website and added a link to it, along with an interesting factoid that I picked up during the couple of minutes I spent investigating the school. --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 19:09, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Another added comment (related to allegations of copyright violation): Earlier I said "I don't know if it is possible to tell whether the content in the article appeared first in publicschoolreview or here". Having studied the page history, I now believe that it is publicschoolreview (which accepts user conributions) that is using content from Wikipedia, specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gibbs_High_School&amp;oldid=91124808" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gibbs_High_School&amp;oldid=91124808" rel="nofollow">Revision as of 05:05, 30 November 2006 by SmackBot</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gibbs_High_School&amp;oldid=88119437" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gibbs_High_School&amp;oldid=88119437" rel="nofollow">Revision as of 21:05, 15 November 2006 by 66.194.104.5</a>. The Wikipedia article includes contributions from and rewrites by various different registered and unregistered users, starting in September 2006. I believe these November versions are the only ones that have the same wording as the publicschoolreview page. In particular, notice the Notable alumni discussion, where the writeup about Michelle Dowdy has changed several times (the language in the two cited November versions was different from earlier versions and was changed again on December 14), and where Jeffrey Lacey was to added the Wikipedia article on December 3 (Lacey does not appear in the publicschoolreview page). Surely Wikipedia doesn't delete articles for copyvio because another website copied from Wikipedia without attribution.--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 04:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, there's not much to discuss, unless someone can determine when the text was added to the above website -- we could then tell whether it was there first, or here. Personally, I was going to wait until the AfD closed and then report it as a possible copyvio for investigation (in this case, that would involve blanking the page, since all versions include the potential copyvio text, but blanking while an AfD is ongoing is not optimal). I'm not sure whether it meets G12 -- the site doesn't claim ownership of user-submitted content, so it doesn't fall under the site's copyright; it could still be a copyvio (the original author would retain the rights, if it were submitted there before here), but I'm not sure it's "blatant." I don't see any means of determining when the text was added to that website, though, short of contacting their agent for claims, and that's a step I'm a bit hesitant to take as an individual editor. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 04:18, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Sandberg is a fairly significant name in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">transhumanism</a>--as mentioned in the entry, he was chairman of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Transhumanist_Association_755a.html" title="World Transhumanist Association">World Transhumanist Association</a>, and <a href="http://jetpress.org/volume14/bostrom.html" class="external text" title="http://jetpress.org/volume14/bostrom.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> on the history of transhumanist thought says (in section 4) that he was also a major contributer to one of the organizations's founding documents, which laid out the ideas behind a more "academically respectable" form of transhumanism.

<li><b>delete</b> He is clearly not yet notable as a scientist--5 peer reviewed papers in specialized journals , and still a postdoc. <s>He is not mentioned in the WP transhumanism article</s>--and they list quite a number of people over several centuries as their founders.

<li>In response to DGG's comment above, Sandberg is in fact mentioned in the "History" section of the wikipedia <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">transhumanism</a> article, which says "A number of similar definitions have been collected by Anders Sandberg, an academic and prominent transhumanist." Looking back, it appears this sentence has been there since May 5 2006. He is also mentioned on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_transhumanists.html" title="List of transhumanists">list of transhumanists</a> article, one of only 54 entries. While I agree he is not notable as a scientist, I think most people with a significant level of familiarity with transhumanism would agree he is a notable transhumanist. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 03:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC) You are quite correct that he is mentioned, right in the middle.

<dd>I am very familiar with the Transhumanist movement, both with its movers and with its mover-wannabes. Anders is a wannabe. He has not done anything notable as yet that merits a Wikipedia page. Maybe some day he will do or write something significant, but he hasn't yet. Anyone who researches the matter sufficiently will very likely concur. I'm still waiting for anyone to show me anything he's done that's notable. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 06:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What do you define as "notable", exactly? There are a number of prominent transhumanists who haven't written books on the subject (Nick Bostrom, Robin Hanson, Max More, etc.)...do you have any criteria for notability besides writing books or founding transhumanist groups? I'd say he's notable as a thinker and commentator, someone whose thoughts and opinions are valued by other prominent transhumanists, as evidenced for example by how frequently he's quoted in books by others such as Kurzweil and Hughes, and by the fact that he is often invited to speak at transhumanist events or collaborate on group efforts such as the founding documents of the WTA mentioned above. The opinion of his peers should count for more than the opinions of us wiki editors, I think. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 07:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

TV news programs and magazines like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a> would in my understanding be considered reliable, see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, and I think a notable ezine like <a href="../../../b/m/e/BME_%28website%29_cf0b.html" title="BME (website)">BME</a> would also be considered reliable in its specific subject area of body modification, although this one might be more of a gray area. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 00:37, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One-liners are not very productive.

If not then it seems to me you are relying on your own subjective sense of what a "reputable source" is, not wikipedia's official policy. Also, can you answer my question about what would be a reliable source on the subject of transhumanism, as opposed to the subject of science? <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 01:05, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ampligen entry contains big mistakes (e.g. Ampligen phase III trial for CFS was completed in 2004, Bioclones' marketing rights are being challenged by Hemispherx Biopharma, Ampligen raw materials are no longer manufactured by Ribotech) and lacks relevant indispensable elements (e.g. the results of the phase II and phase III trials for Ampligen for CFS, relevant Ampligen patents)while containing a lot of irrelevant material (patent to infuse tobacco ). The serious side-effects that are referred to lack correct evidence. The link that is offered is a testimony of one person who cannot even prove that her problems were caused by Ampligen... It's a hopeless task to correct all the mistakes and the set-up of this entry, so someone should start from scratch. Well, as I don't feel called upon to contribute, let me suggest that someone who is called upon to contribute to compare the Wikipedia Ampligen entry with the information in the following fairly dependable research report <a href="http://www.boenningandscattergood.com/research/CI/HEB%20%282006.12.1%29.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.boenningandscattergood.com/research/CI/HEB%20%282006.12.1%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.boenningandscattergood.com/research/CI/HEB%20%282006.12.1%29.pdf</a> and in the Sec filings of Hemispherx Biopharma <a href="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000946644&amp;owner=include" class="external free" title="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000946644&amp;owner=include" rel="nofollow">http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000946644&amp;owner=include</a> I for one, as Ampligen is an experimental drug, would wait for an EMEA European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) <a href="http://www.emea.eu.int/htms/human/epar/eparintro.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.emea.eu.int/htms/human/epar/eparintro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emea.eu.int/htms/human/epar/eparintro.htm</a> or FDA equivalent. <a href="../../../w/a/m/User%7EWamper_4c05.html" title="User:Wamper">Wamper</a> 15:35, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Insufficient reasons given for deletion. The desire to remove any perceivedly irrelevant material is not a reason to delete the article but a reason to reach consensus regarding deletion of such material from the article. Omission of perceivedly indispensable information is not a reason to delete the article (and counterproductive), but a reason to add the information if available. If an article is full of errors and contains no sourced information, that would be reason to AfD, Prod or Speedy. However, the nominator only provides four perceived mistakes, which is not a reason to delete an article. The mere suggestion that the article is full of errors is not sufficient. The AfD process is not intended to invite other editors to check an article for mistakes not listed by the nominator and not geared to replace consensus discussion on the talk page. <a href="http://www.boenningandscattergood.com/research/CI/HEB%20%282006.12.1%29.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boenningandscattergood.com/research/CI/HEB%20%282006.12.1%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> doesn't strike me as the best of sources, if only because it sounds like a commercial and introduces this 40-year-old drug as "new" and "21st century". <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvb_5b28.html" title="User talk:Avb"><small>talk</small></a> 16:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> as the main contributor, I obviously want it kept, but I probably shouldnt vote in the interests of fairness.

<p>After reading the Ampligen entry, I want to say that to me it is not credible that Thedreamdied on the one hand knows all the things he knows, and doesn't know all the things he has wrong on Ampligen in his article. It's clear to me that Thedreamdied's aim was not to write an informative, well-balanced, well-documented article on Ampligen, but to discredit Ampligen by stating e.g. that it has serious side-effects, a false and defamatory statement, or by stating that "As of 2007, a new trial is recruiting" while, in order to suggest that the completed phase III will not be sufficient for the FDA, Thedreamdied "forgets" to add that this concerns an open label protocol study, carried out to obtain additional safety data (Phase 3 studies), that are typically used when the controlled trial has ended and treatment is continued so that the subjects and the controls may continue to receive the benefits of the investigational drug until marketing approval is obtained. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/drugsbiologics.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/drugsbiologics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/drugsbiologics.html</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonklo_d3c4.html" title="User:Donklo">Donklo</a> 22:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The charatcers are now somewhat more in the public eye than before due to the film and the oscar nominations, I say both should stay, as the creator of Effie White's page, I needed information on the character and had to seek it out from multiple sources, surely wikipedia is about gathering information and sorting it out in one place? I think it should stay! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Flamer on (<a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlamer_on_ba20.html" title="User talk:Flamer on">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Flamer_on_5fc1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Flamer on">contribs</a>) 11:56, 6 February 2007 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>If it were to stay, it would need to be throughly re-written. It basically repeats information from the plot summary. An article on the character(s) should detail their creation and development, their particular character personality traits, and, in the cases of these two characters, how they relate to their real-life counterparts, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_Ballard_3bba.html" title="Florence Ballard">Florence Ballard</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Ross_60d9.html" title="Diana Ross">Diana Ross</a>. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 17:52, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd <b>Keep</b> The Effie White page, as the main character of a major movie. This character is the type who has already developed amongst at least Americans (I cant speak for anyone else) as a reference; i.e. her situation was like Effie Whites.

<li>I have now personally written a whole section about the comparison between Florence Ballard and Effie White. Hopefully now, the page will stay.

<li><b>Delete</b> as duplication of content from the parent article mixed with original research.

<p>My original stated reason for putting a prod on this page was "Articles on manipulative tricks and how-tos of this kind are inappropriate for Wikipedia.

This is simply wrong, as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> clearly explains that references must be <i>reliable</i>, and in this case the reference is just a discussion forum. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 16:12, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. This page should not be deleted, Bella Morte is a legitimate band with a very, very large underground following, if this page were to be deleted I'm sure some fans would catch wind of it in a few days and post a new one back up. Perhaps citing some of the online interviews that are in the external links, as well as citing Bella Morte's page on Metropolis Records' site to prove they are signed onto a major label, could prevent this page from being deleted?Nikolai Revolutionary 02:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This isn't misusing the process. Please assume good faith. I don't see paragraphs of information there, or even an encyclopedia article.

<li>That it is one sentence long does <i>not</i> make it a dictionary article. You don't understand the difference between a stub dictionary article and a stub encyclopaedia article.

<li>I've read <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">WP:DICDEF</a> and I still think this one-sentence article is better suited to Wiktionary than to Wikipedia. Please do not get upset or take it personally. If you think the article can and should be expanded, then by all means do so.

<p>The article concisely states the firm description and scope, with no self-promoting gratuity, and provides unbiased 3rd party references. The article provides a brief synopsis of “notable” existing and proposed buildings. The article also provides a non-promotional history timeline, which is informative and educational to an architectural firms progression. Please see my user page for additional info.

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>, references must not <i>only</i> be third-party, but must also be reliable and non-trivial. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not a "pick any one" criterion. First couple of sources (Architecture Week) are trivial directory-style listings (likely paid ones), third one trivially mentions the company (one sentence!), and the rest don't mention this company at all! A non-trivial source means the company is the <i>focus</i> of a <i>full piece</i> (not blurb or directory entry) in a reliable, editorially-controlled or scholarly peer-reviewed publication.

As for the architectureweek reference, I simply provided this to indicate what this firm specializes in (as there are many various aspects to this profession). Architectureweek is a free online weekly newsletter with a free directory that is derived from the wiki “Archiplanet.org” website. I could refer the article to the KKE website for the same information, but I thought that would appear too self-promoting. And to address your comment that some of the sources only cite one instance of mention to the compnay, it is not uncommon for these design professional's to be briefly credited. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact the architects routinely rank as one of the least unhappy and lowest paid professionals. One reference does not indicate KKE, but Howard F. Thompson, whose firm/work was acquired by KKE. Also, I noticed someone deleted the pages content…I believe this should not have been done. As stated in wikipedia’s deletion review process “While the review is in progress, you are welcome to edit the article, <i>but please do not blank it</i>…” <a href="../../../j/i/s/User%7EJisher_5768.html" title="User:Jisher">Jisher</a> 22:41, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a way, yes. <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> recomended I place it here for review. Here is the brief history on my attempt at this article: The article was first posted on 2-2-07, and this was my first ever wiki attempt. That article was speedily deleted by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">Chairboy</a>. I revamped the article and reposted it on 2-8-07, but it was then speedily deleted by <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> who indicated it was "reposted spam". The thing is, I believe he was quick on the gun and must have reviewed the first (2-2-07) artcile deleted by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">Chairboy</a>, as he made mention of references only in the original 2-2-07 version.

<li><b>List on afd.</b> Assuming that I understand the sequence, it seems an example of over-hasty and rather careless process. There's no point in trying to defend decisions made on such a basis--with the record as confused as that, the course is to have a proper AfD debate in the ordinary way. The ordinary way works fairly well. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see your point of the lack of mention, but as I indicated above, acknowledgment of the design team is often very brief, if at all (for most projects).

<li><b>Delete.</b> It's a complicated case because these folks designed the Mall of America, but the article's format and style does not sit well with me - i.e., it doesn't place this company's relevance in a broader context. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 01:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>YachielMan: There are very few architectural firm articles available for reference that I could find as an example of format.

<p>Pretty much this ENTIRE ARTICLE is based on <a href="http://www.bryancore.org/bsg/" class="external free" title="http://www.bryancore.org/bsg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bryancore.org/bsg/</a> alone, indeed, there was copyvio from that site until earlier today.

I'd also like to point out that neither article is well-maintained (check the logs - edited maybe once a month), so merging them will make them more maintainable by focusing what minor effort there is. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 18:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC) •</p>

<dd>Yes, but "That Adam considers a Copyvio" is implying that others wwouldn't consider it as such. You brought it up, I just said there was one previously (not naming a section), as it does make me worry that the other sections might have hidden copyvio. Also, I was referring to Holobaramin (~649 ghits), monobaramin (649 ghits as well), apobaramin (348 ghits), and polybaramin (218) - that whole section is clearly non-notable, anyway, and other sections, if anything, are *EVEN WORSE*. This is why it should be merged: there's not enough to say about it that isn't single-source. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 21:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For instance, take this section, "Recent baraminology research": <i>In 2003, the Baraminology Study Group applied "analysis of pattern" to multidimensional biological character space data on sunflowers and fossil equids. They found a strong linear relationship and continuity among the sunflowers, and termed this relationship "biological trajectory." In applying the method of fossil equids, they found a branching relationship in the data, which indicated a divergence in ancestry. The linear relationship corresponded to the known chronological order of the fossils.<a href="http://www.bryancore.org/bsg/opbsg/002.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bryancore.org/bsg/opbsg/002.pdf" rel="nofollow">[48]</a></i> - This is a summary of a SINGLE, NON-NOTABLE PAPER.

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> This is useful information for several reasons. First, it is clearly a major component of creationist pseudoscience. Creationists, and those trying to decipher creationist nonsense and blather will want to have access to this to be able to understand what they are encountering. This is the principle function of an encyclopedia; to provide a ready source of information about some subject. Second, this term will not likely be covered in standard science texts, because it is pseudoscience, but still those trying to defend against this pseudoscience need to understand it to arm themselves. This makes a WP contribution even more relevant. Third, the only other source of this sort of material will be in the copious creationist websites and tracts. None of them of course will identify it as pseudoscience, which it is. They will only talk about how wonderful it is, misleading the naive. So, in the absence of any proper scientific reference, the only information the public will have is badly biased. This is why it is REALLY important for WP to discuss it from a neutral point of view. Is it plagiarism of a single source? Possibly. Is it still pretty scanty? Yes it sure is. So it should be expanded, and fleshed out, so it can form a resource that is balanced, describing what baraminology is, its relevance, history, providing links, etc. This would be a very useful contribution. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That isn't a reason to keep it by itself, it might just mean they will all redirect to created kind. As far as I can tell, the notion of baraminology hasn't been discussed in any independent reliable sources. Heck, the TOA which is one of the most prominent pro-evolution/anti-creationist/whatever-term-you-prefer groups has not a single mention of the term. <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?q=Baraminology&amp;sa=Search&amp;sitesearch=www.talkorigins.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/custom?q=Baraminology&amp;sa=Search&amp;sitesearch=www.talkorigins.org" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>keep</b> this is a concept used by a considerable number of people in a definable way, and the use of it is (unfortunately) widespread enough to be notable. I have added some additional distinction to make clear that it is not a science, and that the terminology it uses is not scientifically meaningful. There are different groups of creationists, and they use different terms and have organized their field in various ways. They shouldn't be considered as a homogeneous mass, as the disputes among them make evident. There is a single biological science, biology dealing with testable relationships. This is not true of creationism, as its concepts are derived on other bases. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The colours/paints for instance seem pertinent to only one game, other general power-ups don't have impact outside of the game itself, nor are they iconic like Mario's magic mushrooms (crazy man!) or the Master Sword from LoZ. I'm not against articles like these, but they must offer a strong case for their existence, otherwise it makes a mockery of deleting articles like 'list of BF weapons' etc. etc. which are born from unchecked list-lust. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 13:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Further, the 'common items' are either obscure items used in one particular game, health restoratives (a vast amount of games use these, there's no real need to list them all) and the 'candy' invulnerability item, again invulnerability is not a new or scarcely used concept. That leaves 'magical items', such as the Star Rod, used to defeat the end boss of two games (with a couple of cameo appearances in other Ninty games) and the Rainbow Sword, used to defeat the end boss of a single game. There's no need for this information to be destroyed, but popping it into a seperate article means scrutiny, and it ain't standing up to it. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 14:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article has been speedied, prodded twice, and this time hit with a notability tag. As it has been prodded twice I am bringing it here for debate. I have no opinion either way, save that it would be helpful if we were <b>consistent</b> in our dealing with schools. FWIW, I brought a primary school to AfD only to see it survive. As I say, consistency would be nice --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 19:53, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I tend to err on the side of keeping middle schools, but this one does not even assert notability. -<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 21:49, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. To begin with, I want to remind everyone that there is not policy of notability on schools. The requirement of stating some assertion of notability is mainly created on the fact that millions of articles that are <i>commercially based</i> or focused <i>individual</i> self-promotion would be littered all over wikipedia. I believe that if any article that is not advertising in this said manner is viable. In addition, as an additional requirement, I believe that articles should have some substance and according to policy, they should have some referenced material or at least list some legitimate sources. This article appears to have some information, and I am sure that in the future, individuals could work on and improve the article based on these sources. As always, we should not be excluded articles on wikipedia on just notability alone; self-promotion and commercial characteristics of articles with illegitimate sources should be the targets of deletion. This article appears to have some possibility for growth, and I believe that if until some templates for clean up and additional sources are added, and <i>then</i> if no progress is made on the article within a few months, then the article can be properly assessed. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 22:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. First, I feel that the subject is not notable: this is just another piece of software for helping people do their job, and that is not per se notable. Further, this looks like disguised PR rather than a genuine article. If adequate sources ( that is, not provided by CASTLE Software or its affiliates ) are not provided by the end of this debate, I feel that we don't lose much by deleting. Of course, we should allow re-creation if decent references/sources can be found, and a better assertion of notability made, but right now the article looks to me like a cunningly disguised puff piece... No doubt CASTLE Software are aiming to sell their product to other customers, and you can be sure an article like this will help them. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To begin with, I want to remind everyone that there is not policy of notability on schools. The requirement of stating some assertion of notability is mainly created on the fact that millions of articles that are <i>commercially based</i> or focused <i>individual</i> self-promotion would be littered all over wikipedia. I believe that if any article that is not advertising in this said manner is viable. In addition, as an additional requirement, I believe that articles should have some substance and according to policy, they should have some referenced material or at least list some legitimate sources. This article appears to have some information, and I am sure that in the future, individuals could work on and improve the article based on these sources. As always, we should not be excluded articles on wikipedia on just notability alone; self-promotion and commercial characteristics of articles with illegitimate sources should be the targets of deletion. This article appears to have some possibility for growth, and I believe that if until some templates for clean up and additional sources are added, and <i>then</i> if no progress is made on the article within a few months, then the article can be properly assessed. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 22:55, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> and merge any useful content. Middle schools are notable educational institutions as a class, and WP quite properly has an article on the subject. The middle schools in a region may together constitute a notable part of the cultural and institutional life on that region, and may possibly warrant an article, though I take no position on the appropriate size of the region. Loudon County, being notable as a fast-growing region, probably justifies an article on its middle schools. But not on each individual one, unless there is something truly notable about a particular one. For the moment such content can be merged, and we can then see if there is enough to justify an article on a particular one. I have checked each individual article, and found nothing that might be. In fact, the information would be much clearer in a single article, since almost the entire content of each articles is a description of the changing boundaries between the different zones and the schools into which they feed. As a final note, the article nominated has the revealing comment thatit follows the: "standard Loudoun County Middle School plan," <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:06, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I haven't been on Wikipedia in awhile, but I noticed today that one middle school's page has been deleted and the rest are recommended to also face the same fate. I think Sukh17 said most of what I wanted to say, and being the one who created these pages, I made them for the purposes of being there for others to improve on them in the future, that's what Wikipedia is all about. I also now also realize that making pages for schools that don't have too much info can also get deleted too. In any case, if there is some way for the pages to either be consolidated into a new article of some sort, I'll be happy to help with that.

<li><b>Keep</b> - it's notable as an example of a popular fraud which the FDA has taken action against. Its discredited, fringe nature should be made more clear in the article.

<p>this person is not notable. That she exists is notable in that it proves the Powell speech was not based on a fabricated anecdote, and the rivers of blood speech is highly notable, but there's really nothing that can be usefully said here that does not better belong under Enoch Powell - she has no notability whatsoever on her own account. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 01:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The identification of Cotterill is not unchallenged (although I think it's pretty clear that it was her). However, the Rivers of Blood speech is pretty much inseperable from Enoch Powell's reputation.

<dd>But the articles only exist because of Enoch Powell. She has no notability of her own. And the reason for the recent media reports is the information that she was source for the Rivers of Blood speech only emerged recently. Having been covered by the media once, she lacks notability, and she appears to have lived a pretty unremarkable life, and there's little chance of any future information being published about her. It's only that she was discovered (retrospectively) recently that there's any sourcing. If this had been found out 40 years ago she would be a footnote in a history book, just because there's online sources doesn't make her notable. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 11:29, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Cherie Blair is only notable because she is married to Tony Blair (she would not be notable as a barrister), but she has a separate article because she has a life of her own, and because it would unbalance Tony Blair's article to include excessive detail about her. In any case, footnotes in history books often make the basis for very good articles. <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 11:42, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> defines notability in the sense of "attracting notice" not "importance". There was a radio program about her, and a newspaper article, so she has attracted some notice - I'd agree two media pieces is very marginal; though that may increase. My view is that Wikipedia is not paper, so accepting marginal articles has little downside providing there is a verifiable neutral-ish source, so if an editor chooses to write a resonable NPOV article on the margins of notability I'm happy to accept it, especially if it keeps the content out of a more mainstream article. <a href="../../../r/w/e/User%7ERwendland_44de.html" title="User:Rwendland">Rwendland</a> 14:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not an expert at this, so I am sorry if I have over reacted, but I felt obligied to blank this article and nominate it for deletion.</p>
<p>1. Even if the Golers were found guilty in a <i>criminal</i> case (a statement which is not made in the article I blanked), referring to them as (mildly) "people who mistreat children" potentially opens Wikipedia up to liability for slander in a <i>civil</i> case. (The issue, for example, in a criminal case is guilt or innocent of particular criminal offences, not whether or not they were unsanitary, which could be the basis for a civil complaint.) Or so it seems to me, but then I'm no lawyer either.</p>
<p><br />
2. In the States, there are some rape shield laws to protect the victim who comes forward with allegations that, usually, she was the victim of a sex crime. Even on Court TV, a rape victim's face is not shown. Using this as a baseline (holding Wikipedia to a higher standard, I would argue, would not go amiss), I believe it to be entirely inappropriate to actually list the name of a child would was allegedly sexually mistreated. I believe it to be inappropriate to name the child even if the child is now an adult and even if the Golers were found not guilty in the criminal case. (Naming children might discourage other children from coming forward if they see they will be listed in a Wikipedia article in the future; so it does not matter if the child in this particular case is an adult or not.) Because a child was named in the article (and hence, will always be listed in the article's history), I believe the only cure is a deletion of the article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The case gained Canada-wide notoriety in the 1980s when Canada's leading investigative reporting TV programme exposed the story to the remainder of the country. It appeared that over the course of generations (roughly 100 years!), the family had practiced an unprecedented level of incest and inbreeding. I understand the desire to protect the innocent, but the case has gained such notoriety, and the name "Goler" is so well embedded in Nova Scotia culture, that the gesture is pointless. In fact, one of the siblings, under her own name, now gives public lectures about her experiences and about child sexual abuse. References to the Golers when discussing incest or abuse have entered common usage in Atlantic Canada and to remove the term from Wikipedia would amount to denying reality. The entry is relevant.

<p>I originally was going to list this as a NPOV problem, given that it claims the group is just a nasty bunch of corporate types who want to kill the cute little animals, has been written as an attack piece, lacks citations for its claims and what doesn't explain what the group's aims really were. Unfortunately the group is now defunct, and the group's website is now dead. So given that the group no longer exists it's difficult to establish notability for it, and it makes it almost impossible to describe what the group really wanted, so the article is essentially doomed to being a biased piece contrary to NPOV. In other words, it's an ex-group and of dubious notability, and to make matters worse the existing article is contrary to NPOV and probably can't be fixed as the group has disappeared. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 18:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Failing NPOV is not a reason for deletion and besides, it isn't so bad that some judicious editing won't fix it up. Notability seems reasonable... a significant effort to influence an important political issue of the past several years. The website may be gone but much of the content can still be retrieved from archive sites like this[<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060424011005/http://www.saveourspeciesalliance.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060424011005/http://www.saveourspeciesalliance.org/" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>].</li>

<p>There is no reason for this page to exist. Suzie Crabgrass is not an important enough character to warrant her own page, and neither are the other characters I am also nominating. Likewise, we have no need to know the streams of unimportant, not referenced information. Additionally, there is no need for the pages now all characters have their own paragraph of the pages listing the kid and adult characters in the show. They are no longer part of the Ned's Declassified toolbar, and therefore are linked to by very few pages. I am also nominating the following related pages because [insert reason here]:</p>

<p>This is a nelogism. There was no Sarajevo Civil War, this term has been invented and placed into wikipedia. There was a siege of Sarajevo by Serb forces, not a civil war in the city. None of major media called siege of Sarajevo "Sarajevo Civil War". It's simply unacceptable and unfair to invent non-verifiable terms and insert them into wikipedia. It's against wikipedia's policy. There just doesn't seem to be enough published information out there to satisfy the notability and verifiability guidelines for a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - There is a huge article <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Sarajevo_c670.html" title="Siege of Sarajevo">Siege of Sarajevo</a> witch explainded everything what is inside this article. Also, there is no article witch leads to this one (except list of BiH topics). This article is missing references and external links, so accuracy of all informations is disputed and that includes name of the article (everybody calls it "Sarajevo Civil War"). So why do we need to have two different articles about the same thing (<a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Sarajevo_c670.html" title="Siege of Sarajevo">Siege of Sarajevo</a> and Sarajevo Civil War) and besides that, one of them is short and accuracy of all informations in that article is disputed?

<p>Subject is only borderline notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is often mentioned in the news but apparently only because of alleged improper sexual relationships (e.g. <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0640,cramer,74593,6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0640,cramer,74593,6.html" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>, <a href="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature_full.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature_full.html" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>, <a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature.html" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>). Since the subject or his publicist has been blanking most of the article and he's only notable due to a single incident, this entry should be deleted. I disagree with the talk page reasoning that "Bruce McMahan is notable on account of wealth combined with the fact that the legal conflict between him and his daughter has made him a public figure" - there aren't that few multimillionaires who are more notable than him.

<dd>He's clearly notable. He's 1) "primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person" and 2) "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events, such as by being assassinated."</dd>

<dd>You argue that "Since the subject or his publicist has been blanking most of the article and he's only notable due to a single incident, this entry should be deleted."

Perhaps subject is clearly notable in the mind of poster Exeunt because he is a related party to dispute in question and trying to do damage. How does he know about a PR firm, how was he contacted via email, how is that he refers to the damage to this person's reputation as justifiable in user talk. If this is indeed notable, then Wikipedia should list all wealthy people, and all people who have been accused of sexual impropriety, include all tabloid newspaper and televison content on this database. In my humble opinion, poster is biased with an agenda, not a true contributor to Wikipedia. I am the one who in a good faith edit accidentally blanked the article which I corrected. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by TypeFive (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TypeFive_eace.html" title="Special:Contributions/TypeFive">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>So you're telling me you're a neutral contributor with no ties to Liner Yankelevitz Sunshine &amp; Regenstreif LLP who just happened to blank the page for the third time after it was restored? It's disingenuous (very lawyer-like!) to accuse me of being someone with an axe to grind with McMahan; I frequently edit Wikipedia, have no agenda other than improving this project and protecting it from <i>private interests</i>, and I have the advantage of not being a sock puppet and lawyer hired by Mr. McMahan to protect his image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and the funny thing about the subjects of tabloid stories--they're notable. What's true and notable about their lives would make it into a good Wikipedia article about them. <a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExeunt_5da0.html" title="User:Exeunt">Exeunt</a> 22:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Anything with this much controversy must be notable. The article seems to be suffering from edit wars by interested parties. At this point we have one solid reference, but should have more. The corporate bio is good background, but not sufficient to establish notability. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 22:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Be careful what you are accusing people of TypeFive, it is ironic to accuse someone of being 'not a true contributor to Wikipedia', and then fill your comment with poor logic, and not sign your post correctly. As for the article in question- Exeunt, you say that there is much coverage, <strike>do you think you could link to/cite some more directly?</strike> As for the matter of whether people WANT the information on Wikipedia, if information is properly sourced and relevent, removing it constitutes vandalism. It is not for the subject of the article to decide what is in it, otherwise all murderers would demand that the articles on them ommitted the fact that they had killed somebody. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 22:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry if I am not up on all the protocols of Wikipedia as far as signatures and did not post accordingly.

<dd>I can, when the sources are not reliable, and the material is defamatory. This isn't the New York Times publishing something, but a much more minor paper.

<li><b>Update</b> - Okay, the Dealbreaker.com article just references the Broward-Palm Beach New Times articles, so it's not useful. That should be stricken from the article. And the Villiage Voice article is exactly the same as the B-PBNT article, written by the same author, so that one's out. It's looking a bit weaker, but the two B-PBNT articles and NY Post article still support it.

<p>I am not able to answer you Kesh. I have sent two lenghty responses regarding your question, but they are not going through due to an editing conflict of some sort.--<a href="../../../t/y/p/User%7EType_Five_d1f4.html" title="User:Type Five">Type Five</a> 00:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC) I will try again. Wikipedia policies regarding biographies of living persons presume that the articles can affect the subject's lives (two parties in this entry), show some degree of sensitivity, are unbiased which I don't believe the author is from his comments and references to law firms, etc.), presumption of privacy, criteria for non-public figures, justification, verifiable sources of high quality, etc. Kevin, I am not kidding about anything, I am a newcomer, I admitted that I blanked a page before I understood how to improve an article, and I was unsure of how to do the signature. I will try to keep this neutral however.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your efforts at trying to explain. There are a few misunderstandings here, though. First, the policies state that the <i>article</i> must be unbiased, not the editors! I have my own personal biases on many subjects, but I still try to maintain neutrality in all my edits. I do have some concern that the reference cited are not of high quality, I'll grant that. And it needs rewritten to be more encyclopedic. However, as of yet, I don't see that it violates policies. It's weak right now, and if the references <i>are</i> shown to be of poor quality, then I would agree that it should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 01:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Type Five, my appologies. Welcome! You are wrong on this though, and with all due respect, you are trying to push rope uphill at this point. The best that can be done is to try to diversify the article to demonstrate the subject's finer points. Rich doesn't make him notable, and incest doesn't make him notable, but the two are sysnergistic. Per WP guidelines what is noticed and documented is notable, and this poor fellow has definately been noticed in major way. Good luck with mastering that signature function! --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 01:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks Kevin. Kesh, I have looked up the London Standard on this site as well as the other sources, they all seem to be cited as tabloid or alternative, but I guess they are sources.

<p>I'm happy to help build this article to include more than the scandal, but don't see much more well referenced information available through the obvious sources. Can we expand the information on his charitable work and his leadership in the investment community?

<li>New Times and Village Voice are one in the same company. I retract my argument that the two references demonstrated broader editorial review of the same contributing writer. I have removed the New Times article from the bibliography since I believe the Village Voice article demonstrates a broader geographic interest in the scandal. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 02:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you click on discussion on the article page today there is a warning box regarding controversial and potenially libelous content for bios of living persons. In an effort to create an encylopedic quality quality article, the entry is now really reading like a tabloid. The vibrator entry is particularly troublesome. I suppose the subject matter (wealth, sexual accusations, lawsuits)is interesting to some, but I still feel the article is what Wikipedia is not.

<dd>So you argument is 'Wikipedia is not a tabloid, therefore we don't talk about controversial topics?' Something else that Wikipedia is not- Wikipedia is not censored. There is no reason to shy away from talking about more unsavoury aspects of people as long as we source it well.

<p>I'd like to put Timeline of trends in music from the United Kingdom for deletion, along with all its subpages. These pages are really crap. Maybe redirecting to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_the_United_Kingdom_0b09.html" title="Music of the United Kingdom">Music of the United Kingdom</a> would be good, but otherwise the page needs massive reshuffling - the music trends dealt with in these pages is just <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk music</a>, and doesn't seem to mention any other sorts of music. I've talked with the <a href="../../../o/g/g/User_talk%7EOgg_5334.html" title="User talk:Ogg">article creator</a>, but deletion may be the best thing to do with this, IMHO <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontchav_896a.html" title="User:Montchav">Montchav</a> 14:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Extremely Weak Keep with conditions</b>, unless there is a Celtic-Anglo-Saxon folk music time line in existence already. Its not a bad encyclopedia topic, its just badly organized and lacks much information. It also isn't written into sentences. This should be flattened to maybe three articles, one for 1500-1899 for all three regions, one from 1900-1959, and one from 1960 on. It needs sentences, complete with capitol letters, commas, verbs, and periods, like this one.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems inevitable that occasionally you will find one whose original author has lost interest in it, and no one has stepped forth to move it ahead. It also seems inevitable that you will find a page whose focus has changed from what the originator had in mind. This may have happened to these pages. Neither of these events is grounds for deletion. Timelines for music, though, serve valuable indexing functions and serve the needs of human browsers.

<li>Oh, I am too. This list was one of many that made <b>2000s</b> <i>the</i> single worst article in Wikipedia. I created it as an "article" simply because it was difficult for anyone to realize how bad this was as a section, until it got out in the open, so to speak, on its own. Hey, you want to see lists—bad lists—and lots of them? Go over to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>, go into history, and check out the article from <i>before</i> January 27. Oh my god is it awful and disgusting. This "article" was simply part of it. You want to put up some more AfD? Just click on the linked articles that are on the bottom of the current <b>2000s</b>.

<dd>I'd disagree that they were not the major subject of some of those articles.

Notice the difference? There is no <b>major</b> in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, so instead you need to ask yourself was it one of the subjects of the article?

<li><b>Delete, but...</b> there are too many articles here for me to process them. I won't endorse the nomination with a standard "delete all" until I am convinced that they all should be deleted. I would prefer that the pace of this name-purging be slowed to about ten per day, as with the mass deletion of mast articles. Of the ones I did see, most were deletable, but I thought Ari could perhaps be saved. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 23:26, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> I looked at a few more. Here's a rule I'm suggesting: keep name articles <a href="../../../i/f/_/If_and_only_if.html" title="If and only if">if and only if</a> they assert a fundamental cultural notability. This would include Adina, which appears in the Hebrew Bible, and Akash, which is derived from a universal element in the Hindu religion. It would exclude names where the only relevance is "some people have this name." <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 23:33, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Only ten per day? Ok, I suppose that makes sense. I will do that in future, but this has started now, so I can't really do much. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 23:36, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep all</b>. Names are labels, and as such don't have a <i>definition</i>. The articles I looked at from the list (Andrew, Annelise, Ayesha) are stubby, but include more cultural/use information than fits a dictionary, I think. Is there anything in the <a href="../../../g/i/v/Category%7EGiven_names_bd2c.html" title="Category:Given names">Category:Given_names</a> that you think is keepable? I would oppose deleting everything from it. Articles like Ani (Name) are too contentless to keep, but your approach seems too broad-brush to me. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 23:44, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Articles must not be blanket mass-deleted like this with one vote. I followed the link from <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arif.html" title="Arif">Arif</a> to this page. I don't know about the other articles but if you would bother to read it, it is not a dictionary entry and contains a lot of useful encyclopedic information about Sufi historiography that would be a travesty to lose in a mass deletionist purge that seems to be all the fashion these days. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arif.html" title="Arif">Arif</a> is definitely a keeper, but since you have included it with the others I have to vote <b>keep</b> on all of them. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 23:49, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, is my first instinct, but I should disclose I'm the one to write it, and I'm generally inclusionist. I'd also be fine with <b>merging</b> as listed above - the only reason I went the whole article route was because someone else had a suggestion somewhere (can't find it now, though) that a page be created for the team (and perhaps for the Medusa Web as well), being major adversaries for <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psi-Force_791d.html" title="Psi-Force">Psi-Force</a>. Not sure what you mean by an nonverifiable reference to Marvel Comics, though - everything in there is readily verifiable by anyone who reads the comics (and, given the much higher sales-required-to-avoid-cancellation numbers of the 80s, there might well be more of those comics out there than many current ones.&#160;;)). <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_Ghost_f501.html" title="User:Wandering Ghost">Wandering Ghost</a> 00:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, at least for the moment. I've got some of the comics somewhere and I'm happy to add some citations and issue numbers to help verify this. There might be a case for merging this back into <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psi-Force_791d.html" title="Psi-Force">Psi-Force</a>... but I don't think deletion is appropriate. It might also be worth considering that the New Universe characters are currently being revived and republished with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newuniversal.html" title="Newuniversal">newuniversal</a> series (as well as some trade paperbacks collecting the older material).

<li>Well, I'll try to find some suitable sources in the next day or so, but in the mean time I've found one www.marvunapp.com profile connected to the team - <a href="http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/dehmandoosha.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/dehmandoosha.htm" rel="nofollow">Dehman Doosha</a>. Probably the most notable character connected to the team would have been <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodstvow.html" title="Rodstvow">Rodstvow</a> - and again, although it's not an acceptable reference for Wikipedia purposes, search google groups for "Psi-Force" and "Rodstvow" and you'll find a few old New Universe posts relating to "Russian psychics", "soviet super folks" and "soviet super heroes" - they'd be references to Crasniye Solleetsi. As noted, I'll see if I can find some acceptable sources, but I suspect these will mostly be issue references, not online material. --<a href="../../../m/r/p/User%7EMrph_0090.html" title="User:Mrph">Mrph</a> 19:38, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, to my knowledge, there's nothing in Verifiability that suggests that information has to be verifiable online, just as long as it's verifiable. The information comes from primary sources - the text of the comics itself, which is okay so long as no interpretation is there (though yes, it should be cited, and I'll also get started on that), and which, if I'm not mistaken, is frequently the often-unstated source for pages based on fictional stuff. The fact that it doesn't have much presence on the web might count against it notability wise, but again, I'd prefer Wikipedia to be inclusive, especially with respect to things like imprints a publisher is no longer really using from the time before ubiquitous internet. The wiki community should have enough people who own and have ready access to any particular comic, even obscure ones, that information about it can be verified. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_Ghost_f501.html" title="User:Wandering Ghost">Wandering Ghost</a> 21:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you <b>personally</b> confirm that the information comes from the comics, I will believe you. But I don't believe any other strange website. For example, what the heck is this www.marvunapp.com&#160;? Does it have a reputation? I also extremely suspicious about the names of charachers. It is a very corrupted Russian. I doubt professionals did not check with Russian speakers, unless it was done intentionally. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 22:13, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabian_Nicieza_5adf.html" title="Fabian Nicieza">Fabian Nicieza</a> definitely messed up on that - I think it got some comments at the time (specifically regarding Rodstvow, but I'm not surprised to hear that the others are just as bad) --<a href="../../../m/r/p/User%7EMrph_0090.html" title="User:Mrph">Mrph</a> 22:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Doesn't appear notable.

<p>Apart from the obvious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> (the author is the subject, as shown in the copyright statement on the image page) there's no real notability here. He's a YouTube contributor. That's it. The only other source in the article is <a href="../../../t/h/e/THE_9_on_Yahoo%21_0153.html" title="THE 9 on Yahoo!">The 9</a>, which is a videoblog, not a news source. Article <i>asserts</i> notability, so I didn't speedy it as another editor requested, but I still feel it should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see how you can claim the external sources are associated with the subject of the article. The second one, fine, that was showing the subject was on Yahoo's show. The first source though is Yahoo.com's official website. How is one of the biggest companies in the world associated with the subject? It's not. It's an independant (a pretty big one at that) source. And the third one is from the BBC's Political campaign website. Same as above. Unless you were in the UK and have seen the episodes on the channel Trouble (as referenced) with your own eyes, i do not know how you wish me to validate this. There are many emails from the companies and many statements from others discussing the tv episodes and commercials, but as i know that will be irrelevant to you i am currently unaware as how you wish me to proove these. Until an external sources actually 'writes' about me, as opposed to showing my episodes on national tv then i cannot. You could ask the tv companies themselves if you wish, but i'm pretty certain you won't. Needless to say the sources are external and are CLEARLY not associated with the subject. Unless i own Yahoo and the BBC, in which case i would need a much bigger Wiki article i think. If you don't live in England, then you wouldn't of seen these, so notability is arguable depending where you live. Thank you for taking, time to consider this. -<b>Jordanjj</b><sup>Talk</sup> 00:34, 12 February 2007 (GMT)

<li>The 9 just shows whatever's on that day. There's nothing selective about it. That BBC "source" is a blog that has just has a comment on it from you saying, "Thanks for using my clip, was nice to see my face on tv," to the guy who the article is <i>actually</i> about. Neither of those constitutes a reliable source or significant media coverage. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 01:49, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you would have taken the time to watch the short video clip on the BBC website, the video clip which it states was aired on national tv, you will see me on it. I would have thought this would have been an obvious first step upon seeing that page. As for the Yahoo link Yahoo 9 does a daily show reporting on 10 currently 'hot' subjects on the internet. The video linked is from September 5th 06 were if you also take the time to watch, at number 5, is the video referenced in the wiki article. If this cannot be simply comprehended then well i hold little faith that justice will be seen for my wiki if this is the competence of the people who's fate it lies in.Jordanjj <sup>Talk</sup> 10:47pm, 13 February 2007 (GMT)

<li>You just proved my point: "The 9" has nothing at all do with any sort of discriminating content, and the tiny BBC clip has a tiny blip of you. We require actual <i>coverage</i> in multiple independent sources, not just passing mentions. Game show contestants have more air time on national television than this, and they don't each get their own articles. I'm sorry you feel that correctly applying our guidelines makes me incompetent. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 04:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
