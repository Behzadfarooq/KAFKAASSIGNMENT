<p>Contested prod, with that prod reason being that this article was to be deleted had she lost the race for Congress.--Brokendowntoyotacamry 20:48, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>very weak keep</b> as I don't know the policy on runners up in national campaigns, but this is a fairly well documented article on a former mayor of a town. It meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and is locally a notable individual. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 20:52, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. No <i>ex offico</i> notability for small town mayors. National campaign now over and failed <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:07, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This has been one of the most contested House races for two cycles now and it has generated a huge amount of national press coverage - Farrell may very well run again in two years which will continue to keep her in the news. Even if she completely disappears tomorrow an article about her could still be useful for anyone interested in CT politics. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 21:21, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> seems to pass WP:RS and WP:V, as for notability its a toss up. They are notable after the last race and for having a political position equivalent to a Mayor, which is more then just an alderman at least. For now I say keep unless some compeling arguement comes forth with why Mayors arent notable. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't live in Conn. and I've heard of her. The article needs some work, but it seems reasonable to have an article on her. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="#F0B400">Che</font> <font color="#004411">Nuevara</font></a> 21:43, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> too soon to have yet another debate. This article has already survived AfD twice. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 22:19, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> She <i>was</i> a candidate. Now she's just mayor of a town of 25,000 people. "May very well run again" is crystal-ballism. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:33, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> She's clearly one of the most important politicians in Connecticut, having run two high profile campaigns for congress and she doesn't cease being an important politician just because she lost this election. She's an elected municipal leader, raised millions for her last bid, etc. Also, this has ALREADY been argued -- how many AFDs is this going to get?--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 05:03, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The main argument to keep in previous AFD's was that she was still, at that time, an active candidate. She no longer is, which nullifies that argument, so it is valid to reopen the discussion. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 05:27, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b> Highly misleading AFD request -- there has never been any consensus to delete <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Farrell_6b4b.html" title="Diane Farrell">Diane Farrell</a> pending the outcome of the election.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 05:03, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> She may run for office again. Not to mention if she is deleted and she does run again a future editor might not know about her 2006 run for Congress and not only that they will have to start all over again. Plus many other candidates that lost this year (and in past elections) still have articles. MrKing84 07:48, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Does somebody have it out for her? Why a third attempt? Is WP paper? She's run two very competitive campaigns the latter of which got national attention; she was elected twice as "selectwoman" (equivalent to mayor); As I wrote in the 2nd attempt to delete her: <i>please note in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that one positive factor is: "Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage". As of this writing, she gets 429 news.google hits, and " 'Diane Farrell' + candidate" gets over 100,000 google hits. Further, that she lost last time by only 4% shows that she is a significant figure in her district (as well has holding previous elected office)</i> -- <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 15:04, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> She was deleted in the first AfD request, early in the election process, because she was only an ex-"mayor" of a town of 25,000. She was kept in the second AfD request because the CT 4th CD race had become so noted. Farrell's notability is that she ran against Shays. Her information should be included in the 2006 Connecticut 4th Congressional article. It does not rate a seperate article unless all current and former mayors of small towns are allowed individual articles. -- Wspta 15:27, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I have mixed feelings about this. If the final decision is to <b>not</b> keep the article, I highly recommend a redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_4th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Connecticut 4th congressional district election, 2006">Connecticut 4th congressional district election, 2006</a>, as was just done in a similar case: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Samm_Simpson_8948.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Samm Simpson">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Samm Simpson</a>. A redirect preserves the page history (and older versions of the article), which would be valuable should (for example) Farrell again be a candidate in 2008, which would clearly (in my opinion) make her again quite notable again. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 18:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
