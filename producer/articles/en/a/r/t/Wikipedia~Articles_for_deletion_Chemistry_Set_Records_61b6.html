<p>Seems that other than listing the name, and how to do describe an entitiy without that, there is NO self promotion nor is there any link to Chemistry Set Records (but there should be). NN - except on about 50+ artists Myspace sites. (Per Google search) on independent white boards such as www.thejamzone.com with no affiation Also see below: Talk:Chemistry Set Records From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search My opinion is to keep it so that users are aware of this aspect of the whole "Weed" thing. I have researched on Wikipedia only to learn about the file sharing of music side. What's important to us Artists is to know how to get our music into the system and Wikid doesn't explain it anywhere else like this page does. I did a search for independent record labels and there had to be 50 entries in the "c" but Chemistry Set Record was not listed there, wonder why is that.?--Brokerdelete 21:32, 16 May 2006 (UTC) Electric Doormat, Bret, Jeff Marklein, Countrside (UK) and other artists who use CSR find this entry to be completely legit - proof? Visit Myspace.com/jeffmarklein Myspace.com/countrysideland Myspace.com/bretgrey Myspace.com/electricdoormat Visit www.chemistrysetrecords.com and select the "musicians" link and tell THEM that CSR isn't relevant. You do realize your being extremely discriminatory and favoring other labels which we artists have never heard before all over the Wiki place. Don't be biggots. Jeff. _ _ _ Wes, you gotta help me before I slam my head on the table real hard. Please please please explain why this info is worthy of a big old tag about being considered for deletion: Chemistry Set Records is an online 'label' and ICP (Independent Content Provider) for Weed™ which is a service developed by Shared Media Licensing (“SML”) [1]that lets you sell your music over the Internet and continue earning revenue even when your fans share your music with others. Note that there is nothing but factual information there. I guess you'll have to search "Chemistry Set Records" in order to see the links and you'll see NOT A SINGLE ONE even goes to CSR. There are couple internal Wiki links and only one external which is the "SML" which goes to www.weedshare.com Hey if THAT is the issue I'll gladly remove that link. You do realize that peeps going to weedshare's site helps me in no way right? So am I a vandal and spammer or something again here? Wiki is ridiculous, but Wes, you are a righteous dude so I'm hanging in there a bit longer (on 6 hours sleep). --ChemSet 15:33, 16 May 2006 (UTC) WHY would you consider this for deletion? What is the trip here man? Just type a reason here or something --24.182.12.127 15:23, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per head-spinning-inducing screeds. Anons, please note that ranting about unrelated articles isn't going to help the case of <i>this</i> article. Also, "Someone doing something first" isn't notable per se, unless the action really is world-changing (think of then-famous and now-famous bands getting leverage from <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napster.html" title="Napster">Napster</a> - while this is just some company hopping on the bandwagon a lot later). In this case, Weed may be notable, but there's no evidence about the company's notability (unless some is provided); as such, it may warrant a small mention in the Weed article. But unless this company is notable in its own merits, it doesn't need an article of its own - so please, read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> carefully and explain a contrary point. (And what does <a href="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=arist" class="external text" title="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=arist" rel="nofollow">rising up</a> have to do with P2P music distribution, anyway? Sorry, not intended as a lame spelling flame or anything - I was just so colossally disappointed when I thought I might learn some new musical term that I <i>had</i> to complain. Sorry.) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:37, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Doesn't have any resemblence of spam. Doesn't have a link to themselves even. It's true no other known ICP also has a online radio station to PROMOTE and EXPOSE the artists who have files available for download in Weed format. No less "notable" than other entries. Also true that Wiki has NO information for the interest of aspiring artists (all existing Wiki is on file sharing and addresses music fans instead of bands and artists).--69.178.130.210 21:18, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Everything within this article is NOTABLE.</p>
<p>Chemistry Set Records happens to be THE FIRST <a href="../../../i/c/p/ICP_ec78.html" title="ICP">ICP</a> to not only offer the Arist access to the <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weed_music_distribution_service.html" title="Weed music distribution service">Weed music distribution service</a> system but to ALSO play their songs online via stream audio radio station on SHOUTcast.com.</p>
<p>(How do you think their songs get put into the weed digital format? You can't just got to the Weed site and say "ADD ME PLEASE" as the response will be "GO THROUGH AN ICP PLEASE")</p>
<p>You are completely missing the point that until now Wiki ONLY has information about the end user aquisition and <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_sharing.html" title="File sharing">file sharing</a> the Weed file alone, and ZERO info on how an Atist can get into the system. This is wrong completely wrong of you. Please reconsider.</p>
<p>The system in itself is NOTABLE and a few seaches around the net will produce many indepedent publications mention over the last 3 or 4 years... I haven't the time at the moment but will post some the history and technology behind it tomorrow.</p>
<p>A business plan like Weed shows a new use of technology, etc and is therefore notable. But the COMPLETE picture and this side of the equation has been missing on Wiki for all these years for some reason.</p>
<p>Same thing with GarageBand.com I was completely shocked that until I came along and added a page for that Wiki seems to have slept through THE BIGGEST thing for unsigned artists on the net SINCE 1997</p>
<p>Lastly, instead of simply suggesting deletion, why not add constructive critisism or ways to correct to your satisfaction (never understood that part)--24.182.12.127 15:09, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
