I guess a personal page is slightly different from a fansite, although I think it's fairly applicable.

<li>Well, I might make a similar claim of basically all the links (except O'Reilly and HOTU), which are hardly authoritative or well-known, seem like glorified versions of Mr. Bill, and O'Reilly appears to be a trivial reference at best. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 23:52, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Spammy article about game whose claims to fame are 1) won independent adventure game of the year award from a review website that has 2 writers and an editor<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051104023949/diygames.com/aboutus.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20051104023949/diygames.com/aboutus.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> 2) won a couple of lesser awards in a contest that is based on voting from an online forum on the website of the company which makes the obscure create-your-own-adventure-game software that the Game uses.<a href="http://www.americangirlscouts.org/AGSAwards/rules.php?section=generalinfo" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americangirlscouts.org/AGSAwards/rules.php?section=generalinfo" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 06:31, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, my gut tells me this article should be deleted, however this article does in my opinion meet <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. My personal tipping point was that at least one of the websites that reviewed this game is itself notable (<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_Gamers_5db4.html" title="Adventure Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a>), and the content of that page is a non-trivial discussion of this game. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 07:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> GameTunnel, Adventure Gamers and Just Adventure all seem like perfectly acceptable critique of the game. It isn't WP's fault or problem that the indie/freeware developing community doesn't receive critical review in printed sources or the major gamesites, it's up to the indie community to club together and generate websites that can do that. On the other hand, when that is accomplished when will WP stop rejecting review sites because they're not Gamespot? The adventure genre is not widely covered by the published gaming press, this includes 'proper' games sold through stores, not just web-distributed ones. That's resulted in a far stronger online presence from smaller sites reviewing these titles, some of which are featured in this article. Whilst I don't accept AGS awards as being sign of anything in terms of articles belonging to WP, honest reviews are another matter. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 08:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Further to that, in my eyes this is a clear pass of <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, which is not policy but certainly makes a good start. The sources seem perfectly reliable which passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 12:31, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As QuagmireDog says. <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_Game_Studio_5281.html" title="Adventure Game Studio">Adventure Game Studio</a> is hardly obscure, having been the subject of numerous print articles <a href="http://americangirlscouts.org/agswiki/AGS_in_the_media" class="external text" title="http://americangirlscouts.org/agswiki/AGS_in_the_media" rel="nofollow">AGS wiki link</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/v/AdventureGamers_0897.html" title="AdventureGamers">AdventureGamers</a> report on their awards results, and have in their own awards often given them to many of the same games. Also, look at the index of this O'Reilly book: <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gaminghks/inx.html" class="external free" title="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gaminghks/inx.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gaminghks/inx.html</a> and you'll see that Fatman gets a mention. As do the AGS Awards, I notice. I'm also not sure how the quantity of staff is relevant to a review site's reliability? Roger Ebert (insert favourite film review here) is just one guy, you know... See also the reinstatement discussion at <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html#Speedy_delete_of_The_Adventures_of_Fatman" title="User talk:JzG">The original deleter's talk page</a> --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmaccormack_886d.html" title="User:Amaccormack">Amaccormack</a> 12:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I can't find any references to print articles on the AGSwiki page linked. The AdventureGamers website is not obviously a significant source. Getting a passing mention in an O'Reilly Book as an example of an AGS game doesn't prove much. <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> has won a <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> for his review work and is the first film critic to have been awarded a star on the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_b01f.html" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, and has his work published in 200+ newspapers. If the people behind DIYGames can claim a relatively comparable level of recognition, that would make up for their being few in number <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:42, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I took a look at the corrected media link that Amaccormack sent me. My opinion of AGS is not that it may not be very obscure, but its is still peripheral to games culture. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:51, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, nn webgame. Web content is not subject to lower standards of notability, even if "It isn't WP's fault or problem that the indie/freeware developing community doesn't receive critical review in printed sources or the major gamesites". <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 14:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Lower standards? No less than 8 rival adventure sites have reviewed it! WP+SOFTWARE does not state that the non-trivial need to be in print. Since anyone can make a print-on-demand book via <a href="../../../b/o/o/BookSurge_be4c.html" title="BookSurge">BookSurge</a> these days, the printing doesn't really add very much in notability IMHO. Just Adventure, one of the reviewing sites has been described by <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> as "an editorially rich destination for adventure gamers on the Web. It prides itself on pulling no punches and digging for scoops." PC Player touted Just Adventure as "the ideal meeting place for adventurers old and new." JA have been quoted on box covers, in magazine advertisements, and in newspapers. Adventure Gamers built a solid, dedicated readership over 7+ years, owing to its reputation for high editorial standards. The website has been quoted in magazines and on box covers, has been cited in game-related books and appeared on television several times. Adventure Gamers has over 20,000 unique visitors <i>every day</i>. gametunnel.com have been on G4TV in February 2006, September 2005 and January 2005. etc. etc. if you care to look. Please, if you are going to deny the validity of the references in the article, please specifically denounce each one, with evidence, until there are less than 2 left and the article then fails WP:SOFTWARE. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmaccormack_886d.html" title="User:Amaccormack">Amaccormack</a> 16:05, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, commercially-released indie games are rare, and this one was reviewed on HOTU, which is one of the major game sites and only rarely covers indie.

<ul>
<li>Sorry, I should have worded that better. My point is that most indie games are not, and will never be, on HOTU, because Sarinee only adds good games (per the site charter). Thus, I would say that any indie game covered on HOTU is notable for that, moreso if it earned a Top Dog rank.
