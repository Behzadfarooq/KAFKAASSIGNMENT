<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. I could opt-out and take the easy path (close as "no consensus"), but that would be wrong.

<p>As <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> said it in starting the 5th AFD for this article 6 months ago, "Frankly, it is time this went." I agree. It has now been 6 months since this article was last nominated for deletion. During that period the article has been tagged as needing verifiable sources, none have appeared. And it is my belief that none ever will. This article is simply not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. The entire premise of this supposed game leads to having no verifiability at all. As such, any user can add their interpretation of "the game," and claim it as the truth.

The single foreign language article used in support of this article is <i>not</i> reliable - not a news article with proper vetting process, but a whimisical column; also the author appears to be playing "the game" himself. This article has been given <u>ample</u> time for better sources to show up and there has even been an online campaign with an its own special website tasked since March 2006 to find such references for the article or - indeed, <u>to deliberately plant such references in the media</u> - see this mission statement on the website:<a href="http://www.savethegame.org/wiki/Lose_The_Game" class="external text" title="http://www.savethegame.org/wiki/Lose_The_Game" rel="nofollow">"<i>The Lose The Game campaign is an attempt to influence major media outlets into covering The Game, thus providing "reliable sources" to cite on Wikipedia</i>"</a> and the <a href="http://www.savethegame.org/wiki/List_of_reliable_sources_referring_to_The_Game" class="external text" title="http://www.savethegame.org/wiki/List_of_reliable_sources_referring_to_The_Game" rel="nofollow">list of reliable sources so far found or planted by the campaign</a>.

<dd>(This again?) No, I'm not - that's a logical fallacy. Just because a person has heard about the Game, doesn't mean they chose to play it. You may like to think they're playing it or losing it, but that's of no consequence to them. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 09:22, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because it's of no consequence to them doesn't mean they're not playing it. The first rule, "knowledge of The Game is the only thing required to play it", really should be written "knowledge of The Game means you are playing it", but that's informal writing.

<dl>
<dd>I can't find where you explained why this is a logical fallacy. Someone does not have to give consent to be a player of a game. In the example I gave in previous discussions, I can create a new game right now called Kernow's Game. Whoever next edits this page will win Kernow's Game. Now the next person to edit this page will win Kernow's Game whether they want to or not. I'm sure that many of the gladiators of ancient Rome did not want to participate either, but if they got killed they lost. If you think about The Game, you lose. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 14:28, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Almost by definition, this is <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">something made up one day</a>. It isn't a board game or a computer game or anything similar; its a meme. It has been mentioned in one (1) newspaper, in a way that doesn't appear to be remotely close to the tone of a traditional newpaper article. I suspect this was a humor piece, at best. Furthermore, the presence of a website with the self-stated goal of convincing otherwise reliable sources to cover the topic <i>for the purpose</i> of earning recognition as a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable topic</a> here is disturbing. Keeping in mind that the article <i>itself</i> suggests that knowledge of the game is scant in the article's likely audience (but high in places with heavy Wikipedia participation), I do not think it is <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">a violation of good faith</a> to believe the website's goal was successful, and that this article exists because <i>De Morgan</i> did not realize it was being used by those wishing to prop up a Wikipedia article.

<dd>(ec) A great many articles require further verifi<i>cation</i>. That is one of the long-term challenges facing Wikipedia. Someone with a book about children's games can probably reference many of the above, while some articles in that vein will eventually be merged elsewhere or deleted. The article under review here, however, does not appear to be verifi<i>able</i>, and, furthermore, has been through the AFD process now six times with no better documentation to show for it than one Dutch-language newspaper article that, based on its apparent tone, clearly had a generous editor. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 02:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(There are also 500+ group "hits" when searching "I lost the game", and many of them seem to be similar groups, raising the number even more.) That's easily 10,000 members, and even with a high incidence of overlap (which I haven't seen, considering the other groups aren't usually found in the "related groups" section, which seems to highlight groups with large overlap), there must be at least 4,000 considering the one group of 3,975. The groups state similar rules, if not the same rules, just using different words. To me, considering I'd guess that most people on Facebook are real people with real names, and that Facebook is a major Internet site, it looks like this is an activity participated in by many people from many places in the world, from a source that can't be discounted. It also seems unlikely that someone would join such a group without at least learning about the game. Also, while it is true that many groups link to the Wikipedia article, if the article was removed it wouldn't stop people from playing the game. Most of these groups are unlikely to change or be removed and anybody with a Facebook account can check that these groups exist. I'm not sure how best to include this in the article, but based on this, The Game seems verifiable, reliable and notable to me. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelso_ce03.html" title="User:Telso">Telso</a> 03:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

This is one of those situations were a consensus departure from the notability/RS guidelines is the right thing.

<dd>"we are not here to propagate stupidity" - this is your personal opinion that the game is stupid. This is not a valid reason for deletion.

It talks about looking at other ways to prevent people who have a <b>financial interest</b> from manipulating because current measure aren't working. In addition, that doesn't even look close to an adopted guideline, it's just a discussion of how to deal with that issue.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject is known to be real and notable. There is no doubt of its existence and nature. To destroy the article is to harm Wikipedia as a reference work.

<dd>The argument against the De Morgen article is <b>not</b> that its in a foreign language. The argument is that the article does not appear to be a news report subject to the factual vetting process assumed by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> but is rather a whimsical column. Furthermore, this column is the only published source that had been found. Moreover, the column asserts that this game is predominantly played in the USA and the UK - the two major English-speaking countries - and yet only this one Flemish newspaper column is available as published source. And keeping such an article with such tenuous and sligh referencing <i>does</i> do more harm than good to Wikipedia as it suggests that other articles can get away with such minimal and dubious referencing too, making a mockery out of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>/<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 06:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed with Bwithh here. I don't care at all that the article is in Dutch. A quality source is a quality source whether it is in English, Dutch, or Bantu. But this is not a quality source -- it does not read <i>even a little bit</i> like a serious newspaper article, and it is the only remotely appropriate source besides. WP inclusion policies typically require multiple, independent, non-trivial, reliable coverage. This is not multiple. It is arguably less than reliable and quite possibly less than independent: the efforts that the game's advocates have been using off-WP serve only to raise the necessary bar; when an advocacy website <i>states</i> that it is attempting to arrange for media coverage <i>for the purpose</i> of concocting reliable sources, it should be absolutely guaranteed that WP will hold every single proposed reference to the highest possible standard. Wikipedia is not for this kind of bald-faced system gaming. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:43, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also agree with Bwitth that the Dutch newspaper reference is lousy in terms of reliability and with Serpent's Choice that any new sourcing should be held to the highest standard. However, good documentation or not, I don't share Kizor's view that Wikipedia is harmed (in any substantial way) by losing this article. See <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> for how there's already a huge amount of stuff that we don't currently document that we really should (maybe we'll get to some of it, but for now, we're not exactly suffering from the absence). This article under discussion is just a drop in the bucket compared to that. It would matter if it was an <i>important</i> article (and we do rate some articles for importance). If it's unimportant, we can by definition afford to lose it no matter how thoroughly documented it is. The bottom line is: notability by RS is an argument favoring inclusion, but not an automatic discussion-stopper. In this case, it's outweighed by the other issues. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 10:26, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As additional evidence for verifiability and notability, I offer a Facebook group dedicated to the game <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204300302" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204300302" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> with 4,000 members spanning the US. The game exists, it's been around longer then the Wikipedia article, and this article presents a publicly visible view of the game, not hidden behind the login walls of social networking sites. While outside campaigning for VfDs is certainly to be frowned upon, the article should be reviewed on its own merits, not the actions of its supporters. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachlipton_a56e.html" title="User:Zachlipton">Zachlipton</a> 20:11, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The "Facebook defence" has already been commented on above.

<dd>The second sentence of WP:RS reads "This page is a guideline, not a policy, and is therefore mandatory only insofar as it repeats material from policy pages." I think that plenty of information can be verified about the game and it's popularity simply by looking at a large number of individually somewhat suspect sources, many of which have been cited above. (See for example the rules listed in [Mao (game)].) If we can verify facts about the game, from this reading it seems that the existence of any reliable sources at all is not necessary. 71.225.71.44 17:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Borderline <b>Keep</b>. I know this game exists because I have heard my son and his friends play it for several years (and they clearly did not invent it or they would have claimed credit). From the past deletion discussions and the widespread locales where Wikipedians have stated that it has been played, in my view its lack of coverage in the press is not an indication that its existence is in question, but rather a indication of how uninteresting The Game is to those who don't "play." I think it is stupid but I also think it is widespread and is barely encyclopedic enough to keep. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 05:37, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The AFD listing says that "The entire premise of this supposed game leads to having no verifiability at all." It doesn't. There's no reason there can't be a decent news report or similar about the game, it's just that we haven't found a good one in English yet. The article even has a reference, it's just that it's in Dutch, and the website's registration system is currently broken so we can't read the article. It is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, it's just not adequately verified yet. The listing then says "As such, any user can add their interpretation of "the game," and claim it as the truth." That's not true either. Anyone can and does add their own nonsense, as with any article: this is a wiki. Like any other article good changes are kept and unverifiable <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> nonsense is argued about and removed.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> has changed significantly since the last AfD. It now requires <i>multiple</i> published sources which this article does not have. Editors that want this article kept should really be discussing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and whether a topic with only one published source can still be notable. Someone should find out the reason it was changed to require multiple sources in the first place. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 06:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I have commented below, WP:N is a guideline, not policy. A little "common sense" tells us that this article is an example of "the occasional exception" to WP:N guidelines on multiple sources. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 12:55, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Regardless of the number of available published sources, this is a real game with widespread popularity, and is obviously notable. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlereon_9ed2.html" title="User:Alereon">Alereon</a> 07:18, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, mostly for pragmatic reasons. At this point, it should be obvious that Wikipedia policy doesn't make this a slam dunk delete or a slam dunk keep. (Anyone who included "speedy" in their vote needs to put their view of WP policy in perspective, I'd say.) This AfD is nothing but the old deletionist vs. inclusionist debate rehashed for a thousandth time. If the policies and guidelines about inclusion are clearer someday and happen to swing it toward "delete", bring it up again. But right now, the choices are a sketchy delete and a sketchy keep, and sketchy deletes create many more hard feelings. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 07:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>If there is any keep vote which could convince me, this is it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 17:45, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It has one reliable source right now, and needs at least one more to pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. But WP:RS is a guideline, not policy, so occasional exceptions are allowed. One is enough to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is policy. I think in this case we can allow the article to stay. It would certainly be nice to have more sources since the article can't expand beyond what is currently there, but I don't think it should be deleted until more are found, since the source provided seems reliable. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 07:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It really bothers me that people try to observe guidelines only when it is convenient to do so—guidelines are not sacrosanct, but shouldn't be discarded without very good reason. One source in a foreign language which requires registration (which someone above suggested was not working at the moment) should hardly be the exception to the guideline's two reliable sources. Ideally someone who wants to keep this article can just find a published, accessable source, and make this all moot. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 17:45, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, only because the whole point of this game is to forget about it. therefore by deleting this article, we wikipedians are all winning. i am sure that the continued existence of this game in increasing numbers of social circles will cause this article to be brought back again and again. the repeated deletion only serves to exemplify the purpose of the game, so delete away, winners of the game! --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeones_life_3af1.html" title="User:Someones life">Someones life</a> 11:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I guess I base it on the fact that if this were a band and all the bands fans were clamouring keep, and had some foreign language reference I couldn't access I'd say the same. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:45, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and salt</b>. It requires stretching multiple policies/guidelines to justify keeping this article. At some point, we reach the elastic limit. Foreign-language sources without reliable translation are a stretch to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. So is an article that depends on subscription-only sources. A single source cannot satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, so we need to stretch that guideline. Keeping an article on a topic that derives much of its notability from its presence in Wikipedia is a stretch to <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. I just don't stretch that far. If we aren't going to salt, we may as well not bother deleting. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 18:38, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I have no doubt that the game is real and that some people have heard of it. I also have no doubt that I'm real and some people have heard of me, but I don't get an article. We all know why. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeliveshere_c34e.html" title="User:Mikeliveshere">Mikeliveshere</a> 19:45, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
