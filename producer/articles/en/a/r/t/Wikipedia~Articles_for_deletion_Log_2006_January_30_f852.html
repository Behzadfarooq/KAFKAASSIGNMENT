<li>So when there is a source you will accept. Well in that case i understand but still one advice. Remove the words "the company claims" I think you are not the company so you are not alllowed to speak for them in negative way.&#160;;) And the other question, would you accept premier model management as agency for Naomi? DC.
<ul>
<li>If there is verifiable information about the organization, then it will be considered, but by no means assured of acceptance. Personally, I would accept an article with a modest number of models with qualified articles. However, other editors are much stricter, so I don't want to suggest if you spent a lot of time finding sources, you'll be assured of acceptance, as you won't be. Finding verifiable information is merely the starting point of consideration. Generally, when an article is seen as advertising, editors are much stricter in terms of demanding clear proof of notability. But, I can't really speak for other editors. Also, I reworded the article, as best I could, so as to avoid anybody being mislead into thinking Wikipedia is vouching for any claims. We can't state as fact what this organizataion does, because we don't know. We have no knowledge that this company actually represents any models. But, we do know it claims to. All I did is state the facts, as best as is known.--<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:45, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why do you think the linked, already well-documented Wikipedia articles (the references you deleted) aren't sufficient to support an assertion of notability? The publications/writers are listed on the front page of the Efanzines site. We're not talking about terribly obscure stuff here, after all. The site has 30,000+ Google hits, as well. Indiscriminately tagging articles for deletion because you think their creator is a self-promoting jackass isn't good practice (even when the creator is a self-promoting jackass). <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:43, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>PS ...and what you wrote is, the fanzines it happens to have permission to host won an award, not the site. WP:WEB??
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's accurate. Under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion 2, it's sufficient if either "The website <b>or content</b>" has won a recognized award. Since you agree that the site includes award-winning content, what's your argument for deletion? That the site can't be notable because it includes too much content? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:46, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still don't see what your argument for deletion is, since you aren't disputing that the site meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion 2. Energumen is by no means the only relevant content on this point, and, aside from those, quite a few of the fanzines/writers who didn't win Hugos meet the alternative standard that "Being nominated for an award in multiple years is also considered an indicator of notability." <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:01, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is another that I put up, partly because of my close friendship with one of the principals. I think eFanzines.com is the most important site in fandom right now due to the fact that it is one of maybe two that are trying to 1) preserve fanzines from the past by providing a space for the scans to be stored and accessed and is 2) the largest site for current fanzines to be seen by a larger audience. It is an important site, nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Website in 2005 and should be included.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable and approaching vanity. Looks like a group of folks willing to create articles for each other and vote for each other when AfDs come up (see Christopher J.

<li>Look, I've not no connection with the self-promoting clown who created this batch of articles, and the only AfD I object to is this one. This site has content that's undeniably notable (having won the recognized <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Award_a4a2.html" title="Hugo Award">Hugo Award</a>), and the overall site was nominated for that award last year. Nobody here denies that the site is notable under criterion 2 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. "Created by a self-promoting jackass" is not a sufficient reason for deletion if the subject of the article meets notability criteria. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 01:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>regardless of what you think of me or my other posts, if I had never posted anything else, would eFanzines.com be considered? I'd say it would. It does pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> Criterion 2, as pointed out, but more importantly, it's a site that hosts zines created by at least five Hugo winners, many nominees (at least ten that I can find) and at least two Hugo-winning fanzines. It also won a FAAn Award in 2004 and is widely regarded in fandom.Mlloyd</li>

<li>That depends on your definition of the word "town". We know that there was a cluster of houses and business at a particular place in the past. We know some people referred to it with the word "town". We don't know if it ever had any legal status. Nor do we know if it exists today. We might want to think about we categorize things, as we're lumping what could be unofficial place, with "real" towns, that have their own government, or are at least counted in the census. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

Some evidence was offered during the DRV debate but it all traced back to the company's own website and press releases. This does not constitute the kind of independent, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> sources necessary to support an article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 15:13, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't believe <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applies here, because this article is about software, not a company. Would you apply WP:CORP to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Project_caa0.html" title="Microsoft Project">Microsoft Project</a>?

What's the big deal? --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 16:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, because <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> explicitly deals with both companies and products. See the section titled "Criteria for products and services". The existence of the software is not questioned. However, mere existence is not sufficient for an encyclopedia article. The claim that this product is either "one of the first" or "one of the few" of anything remains unsourced and unverified through any citation except sources which were traced back to the company itself. I'm going to stick to our policy that the article must be built from and supported by independent sources. As I said during the DRV discussion, this application does not show up in any of the independent journals or reviewers that would be expected to cover such software. For example, neither <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gartner_Group_87d8.html" title="Gartner Group">Gartner Group</a> nor <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forrester_Research_5d35.html" title="Forrester Research">Forrester Research</a> have any listing for them. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 18:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>IMO, you're taking that part of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> out of context, or at least interpreting the guideline in an arbitrary way (which is, of course, your prerogative). <b>First:</b> Do you mean that all products must first appear under their company names, until such time as that company article gets too big? If Projectplace was sold to We Now Own Project Place LLC of Phoenix, Arizona, would that become the primary article title (IOW, in this case, it makes sense to make the software the primary title)? <b>Second:</b> Are you suggesting that all articles containing uncited claims, like "one of the first", be submitted to AfD (isn't developing sources and ironing out routine editoral questions properly part of the basic WP editing process, with Talk page)? (<b>Also</b>, you refer to <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gartner_Group_87d8.html" title="Gartner Group">Gartner Group</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forrester_Research_5d35.html" title="Forrester Research">Forrester Research</a>. They are big "brands" in online market research, but do they operate equally in Europe where this product's base seems to be, and, how entirely reliable are they as sources? In the 1990s, practically all of their for-hire, research-based dotCom marketing advice was subsequently proven to be absolutely wrong.) It really seems to me, with this second AfD nom, the intent of the objectors so far is to pound this stub into the ground unless it meets <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a> standards. --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 19:20, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Unsourced claims must be substantiated or they must be removed from the article. The question is whether, after removing all the unsourced claims, there will be anything left of the article. So far, no cites have been provided that trace to anything other than company literature. As to Gartner and Forrester, yes, they do have excellent coverage in Europe and yes they are generally reliable sources. (I would dispute your allegation about .com marketing advice but even if true, they were hardly alone in the .com bust.) Regardless, they are <i>independent</i> sources. If you have a different independent source that you prefer, please present it. I used them only as examples. This stub does not have to reach Featured Article standards but it does have to meet minimum <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standards. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 19:58, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Seems like a lot of argument over trying to rekill a stub. There should be little doubt now that this is a worthy stub, so what is the point? You may dispute the ASP information, but it's kind of obvious and simply waiting for a source (like many other WP articles) -- on that point of "notability", are you arguing that Projectplace wasn't launched in 1998 (the domain name was registered 12-May-1998), or that there were many, many other commercial ASPs at the time? In any case, I've added a new section, with a reference. Is that still insufficient? --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 21:14, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your objections seem to have been satisfied. The "notability claim" of being a pioneer in Web applications is sourced -- is that source not good enough? The software won a European Union best practices award. It was selected as the development environment for a university-level teaching method that has been adopted. All of that is cited.

<li>Changing to <b>abstain</b>. Right now, the article hinges on a single independent cite. Bloor Research does show up as an independent research entity. From the evidence I've found, no, they do not rise to the level of Gartner or Forrester but Bloor is not the topic of <i>this</i> discussion. I still think this company is too small to meet my personal standards for inclusion (total revenues in 2004 of approx $6 million and only 34 employees) and that their product is only marginally innovative but the article no longer violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I looked around during the previous DR, and found sufficient material apart from the company web site to indicate that it as notable enough company, and a significant competitor in its field of collaboration software. In addition, the article is software, so I don't see how WP:CORP exactly applies, are we to include only products from companies that meet WP:CORP guidelines? It may be a little uglier than most, but a stub is a stub... To call it advertising and demand references is excessive. (I'll also clean up the stub to make it more stubby.) In fact, looking at their logo just now, I remember I had a demo account way back (1999-2000 or so) along with a couple of other online collaboration services I was trying out. So, unless I'm just plain lying or delusional, yes, I am personally certain that this is a working company that's been around for a while. --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 20:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Plea to Keep</b> - Please read the details (recently added to the page). Though low on exposure as a site, there is real history here which I will continue to detail should this page be given a chance to evolve. I bring more to the table (historically speaking) than was obvious when the first deletion notice went up. The site itself may seem "not notable" at this time, but that is quickly changing and the history leading up to it is notable and something I plan to incorporate in greater detail over the next few days. There are real reasons for posting the entry. I have experienced quite a bit of comic history leading up to the creation of this site. - <i>ChuckMoore</i></li>
<li><b>Google relevance</b> - Please google search on its previous and now alternate domain www.hydrofest.com to see google relevance. The site was retooled when it relauched and moved to the new, specific domain in September of 2004. - <i>ChuckMoore</i></li>
<li><b>Thank you for your consideration</b> I will visit this spot regularly and take your criticism to heart as I expand the entry. I want to be a solid contributor to the community and have all the respect in the world for Wikipedia having used it continually in my daily life for years. - <i>ChuckMoore</i></li>

<li><b>Trying to understand</b> - So is it simply the level of popularity that makes an entry like <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsarama.html" title="Newsarama">Newsarama</a> more relevant for inclusion than Comic Related? Both are comic book websites? More to the point, how about the blog discussed at Comics Curmudgeon, or <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrozac.html" title="Nitrozac">Nitrozac</a>, or Oddlotsirregulars.com, or Comic Book Universe Battles rate entries? Many of these barley have an entry written and do not present any notable bits of historical fact regarding their relevance yet they meet the standard for includion? I thought Wikipedia was more about building an interlocking history of the world rather than simply covering what generates hits in google. I honestly want to understand. - <i>ChuckMoore</i></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Nn, ad, vanity. Chuck, Wikipedia is not an "interlocking history of the world", it is an encyclopedia, and entries into an encyclopedia must meet certain standards.

<dd>The concerns were brought by <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrym_d581.html" title="User:Harrym">Harrym</a> at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, however, the content of the deletion reviews seem to have been purged and updated since, and I am unable to locate an archive for those discussions. If someone more familiar with the system here is able to unearth that discussion, that would be extremely helpful, but in its absence, I'll try to summarize it briefly - anyone else who remembers what was said there is welcome to fill in any blanks I leave behind.</dd>
<dd>The core of the argument was that Valhalla Legends is a programming and software development organization and not one based on gaming. The problem with the original AfD nomination was that the outcome appears to have been based almost entirely on votes cast which were more or less irrelevant to the issue of whether vL should or should not be deleted; this can be in part blamed on the niche which the organization largely occupies.</dd>
<dd>I believe the general concensus of the deletion review was to restore the page and give it a chance to be updated to better reflect notability and verifiability, then be relisted for a more informed discussion. The second part of that chain seems to have been skipped over, however.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I don't want to be overly critical, but the delete vote issued above by is exactly why the original AfD result was challenged and overturned. Valhalla Legends is not a "gaming clan;" attemping to have it deleted based on that reasoning is not going to be productive, in my opinion, and will likely simply to lead to a repetition of the deletion review that caused this relisting if more such votes are filed.</dd>

<li><b>Delete both</b>. I reviewed the DRV comments and can see the concerns raised insofar as <i>fragged out clancruft</i> doesn't cover BNLS.

I note Ikkyu's point but since the existence of the software is inseparable from its single-application use, the notability should be considered jointly. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 07:45, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not quite sure I understand youur comment on my point. As I understand it, the software lets users play some historical (no-longer supported) Blizzard games in multiplayer mode, without having to use the company's Battle.net servers (which were shut down years ago). Whether or not that's notable, 350,000 logins per day seems to document that the software has well in excess of the 5000 users needed for notability, and that's what I based my opinion on. -Ikkyu2 08:43, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to say I find this point of view confusing (and this is not the first time a similar opinion has been posted). If BNLS is a notable achievement (and it seems that you are conceding that it might be), how can it be argued that the creator of that service has <b>not</b> achieved notability? You can't have BNLS without Valhalla legends, but Valhalla legends would be what it is whether or not BNLS had ever been released for public consumption. Essentially I find it difficult to separate the product from the product's creator; perhaps I am misunderstanding how notability applies to different kinds of subjects, but I feel that if a product is a notable achievement, the creator of that product by definition has done something notable. <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZakath_8d11.html" title="User:Zakath">Zakath</a> 19:08, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I wholly reject the assertion that creation of a notable product confers notability back to the creator, particularly in respect to Wikipedia. Take the article on <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Pepper_6c58.html" title="Dr. Pepper">Dr. Pepper</a> for example, even though the creator of Dr. Pepper is wikilinked in the article, it is a redirect back to the Dr. Pepper article. The product is of far greater importance than the creator; he is almost a footnote to the product itself. I don't concede that "BNLS is a notable achievement"... I have no strong opinion on that either way. Valhalla legends has no strong claim to notability in my estimation. A mention in the BNLS would suffice if that article survives the AfD. My vote stands.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: People are apparently not even taking the time to READ the comments that people <i>familiar with this topic</i> are making. Valhalla Legends is <i>not</i> a gaming clan. It has <i>no relation to gaming</i> other than that some of its members play games. That is not its goal, nor is it the reason for its foundation, nor is it rational to state otherwise. I believe I laid out a good case at the DRV for keeping both of these articles. I included links to support my argument as far as possible. I feel strongly that people who are considering voting for deletion should <i>at the very least</i> read these arguments and attempt to rebuf them before casting their vote. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrym_d581.html" title="User:Harrym">Harry Metcalfe</a> 20:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: As <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrym_d581.html" title="User:Harrym">Harrym</a> alluded to, people are dismissing this out of hand and it is frustrating. To comment at Agamemnon: we don't have the opportunity to rewrite the article, and when we do, we are told that we are not verifiable because many of us interested in keeping the article are primary sources, which means that the claims are not verifiable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, dismissing this article out of hand as <i>gamercruft</i> is obnoxious. It's not a gaming organization, as stated repeatedly. I understand what the term means.</p>
<p>To correct the factual inaccuracies on this log, BNLS is not a matchmaking service like <a href="../../../b/n/e/Bnetd.html" title="Bnetd">Bnetd</a> was. It provides the client-side authentication measures to connect and authenticate to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.net.html" title="Battle.net">Battle.net</a>. This enables third-party clients to connect to the official service and emulate the somewhat odd authentication schemes implemented by Blizzard with ease. As noted in the BNLS article, there are alternative libraries and implementations of this service, each with varying degrees of popularity. However, if the 350,000 users per day is accurate, but there were less than the cut-off of 5,000 users, that would mean each user would need to connect to BNLS 70 times per day. This is clearly (I should say, clear to someone within the niche) improbable, as a Battle.net Chat Service (the community name for the protocol) connection is fairly stable as long as it is not violated, and can last for multiple days if not abused. When one considers that Battle.net even allows up to seven connections from a single IP address, maxed out, that means that every single user would be permitted up to ten connections per day to reach this number. Still, this is highly improbable.</p>
<p>Also, many of these third-party clients do not actually play the games produced by Blizzard, but merely emulate the communications protocol involved in the connection. This protocol is extensively (and originally) documented at BnetDocs, as Harrym pointed out in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=37088998#2006-01-11" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=37088998#2006-01-11" rel="nofollow">deletion review</a>. This collection of information also includes information on multiplayer game information, although very few bot developers target this particlar subset of functionality.</p>
<p>The most particular notable distinction that this community has made is that it has been a sustaining force for Battle.net. There is no question that <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starcraft.html" title="Starcraft">Starcraft</a> is an immensely popular game. Developers have made bots for a plethora of reasons -- simply to chat, to log channel activity, to moderate meetings, to host tournaments -- the list goes on. Valhalla Legends has been a highly reputable source of information and services for this niche for some time.</p>
<p>Simply because you are not part of a niche does not give you the right to dismiss its members (by which I mean members of this particular niche, not this particular clan) out of a derogatory term. I understand the implied meaning behind "<i>gaming clan cruft, plain and simple</i>." It is unfounded. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Paveza_b1dd.html" title="User:Robert Paveza">Robert Paveza</a> 02:39, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to agree with <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Paveza_b1dd.html" title="User:Robert Paveza">Rober Paveza</a> here. "gaming clan cruft" is not a complimentary term, and using such terms completely avoids the substance of the argument, which is whether or not the subject meets notability requirements. The nature of the subject <b>is not what is under debate.</b> Valhalla Legends is not a gaming group, and no matter how many people misinterpret it as such, it will not alter the fact that it is not. I have yet to see a <b>single person</b> actually rebuff the arguments that caused an <b>unchallenged</b> reversal of the original deletion vote. While at present I would agree that the article has little to recommend it, <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrym_d581.html" title="User:Harrym">Harrym</a> presented a very persuasive defense of the subject, and I think that if the article were rewritten to better reflect the information he provided, it would be a worthwhile addition to WP. That issue has thus far been ignored by <b>every single poster</b> to file a delete vote.</li>

<li><b>comment</b>, I think this should be merged, since, a few months from now, nobody will care about this phone. This phone isn't even that popular, here in the UK.

<li><b>Merge</b> Calling this phone iconic, or notable is a stretch. It's a mobile phone... it has not changed society at large in any way shape or form. It's not even particularly pervasive. H'd say a merge is probably the best bet for all mobile phone articles, per <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a>. There is some precedence for listing out individual articles on items that have a fan base so to speak; motorcycles or locomotives for example.

So, not an average academic production. For myself, I would say mapping out academia is a reasonable longer-term aim for WP anyway. Those who write books, rather than papers, are the place to start because people are more likely to want reference information on the author of a book they have. That should be a criterion: do people want to look up this person on WP? In the case of Dalin, the answer is a clear 'yes': a rabbi writes a passionate defence of a pope. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a></dd>

<p>This is a short article that reads like a Department of Commerce description.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Seems to be a beach district in the Canete province in Peru but much of the information seems to be based on Wikipedia. It would be useful to have input of Peruvian Wikipedians but we don't seem to have a noticeboard for Peruvian Wikipedians or a general South American one.

<li>Yes indeed, fair enough but I know the criteria as well as anyone and the point of AfD is to give opinions based on interpretation of said critera and nominated articles... Having read the articles it is IMO obvious that this is vanity by someone whose music catalogue is theoretical to say the least. I accept there are two articles here, the second of which might not technically be eligible for speedy but contains the words "recorded in his bedroom".

<li>Hey people, if you feel it is non-notable and all your other wiki-lingo terms to say it should be there, feel free to delete it. I may have misunderstood the 'free space' idea behind wikipedia, I have my myspace to promote from. I wasn't in wikipedia for promotion at all, I thought I could just do it. I'm amazed you're all so tight arse, for want of a better term, about it, just delete it. And don't call me a 'spod', whatever it is, name-calling is neither big nor clever. And my music is not experimental, if you look at the influences there is no mention of Pink Floyd, or drug-induced melodies, it is simple acoustic rock/emo. Also, with regards to 'bedroom recordings', you'll notice that Jonah Matranga, Willy Mason, Blink-182 and Foo Fighters have all released records that have been recorded, at least partly, in bedrooms. You people jump to A LOT of conclusions, I mean, aren't you a bunch of geeks that spend all day on the internet, you'd have noticed my ISP or whatever its called is different to that of a 'Christopher Marshall Mason' (Ha, he has the same middle name as Jimi Hendrix, we'll have to meet up for a drink)</li>
<li>Yep It has to be said he has a point, at least he's in some way talented eh?</li>

<li>Simon, respect for your response there which is fair comment. The AfD arena can be a nasty place and once an article ends up here it's open season. The trouble is, it largely comes down to one word - notability. If an article is clearly unnotable (think about what is found in a paper encyclopedia and read the WP guidelines) then there's not a lot that can be done to save it and and when unsigned comments appear saying "Oh, I've heard of him" it looks crap. I apologize for calling you a spod / experimental, the sentiment was directed towards "Christopher" or whoever wrote the unsigned comment. Signing your own comments would also help, we don't all go around detecting IP addresses for fun. I still think that putting "recorded in his bedroom" looked a bit crap on the EP article... Good luck with the music, I look forward to seeing you here in the future - having your vanity article deleted is a right of passage for many WP users (yup, me included) but in the meantime why not stick around and contribute to some pages featuring music and artists you care about. If you're serious about spreading the word I'd be genuinely interested to hear some of your stuff, if you have any mp3's then get in touch via my talk page. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 13:40, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>This is possibly just inexperience with Wikipedia then, to sign your name (or IP if you aren't logged in) and the time then hit 4 tildes or in other words ~ ~ ~ ~ with no gaps. That's a WP signature and when dealing with sockpuppets (as you may imagine, this happens a lot with deletion debates, the creator of the article saying "I've heard of him" while claiming to be someone else) opinions signed by WP editors with a track record of edits are taken seriously, unsigned comments or comments by users with very shallow edit histories are not treated with the same respect. But anyway Chris, by now I'm sure you've perused Wikipedia's guidelines about signatures, notability of musicians and lots more besides. ++<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 19:09, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>He's apparently an authority on trade, recipient of an international agricultural award, and director of a group of corporations. That's a far cry from "my name is pete and im in the 5th grade and my teacher says im smart".

<li>I must say I agree with MarkGallagher. It took me a while to verify what the bio said. A part of me even expects someone here to post irrefutable evidence of notability -- which may still happen!

<li>True. <i>I</i> might have seen a dozen people incorrectly thinking that vanity is a speedy deletion criterion, but the user who says it is isn't responsible for the other eleven or so.

<li>I stand corrected. The site in the article has been updated since my first visit. The page listed points to a section within the personal site of the author of the article, which bolsters my point about the party's non-notability.

<p>What does "non-notability" really mean... Like most small independent third parties, it is, by definition, non-notabile compared to major parties, but otherwise it is a valid and valuable edition to the political landscape. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.166.64.171 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.166.64.171_205a.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.166.64.171">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non notable. This means not already well known, or not significant in some way. A not well know scientist who made a breakthrough would still be notable. This is a judgement call, but there are many prior examples. See for example <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and WP:BIo.

<p>By your standard any not descript animal with no real defining charateristics would be deleted as non-notable. However, we list them all as separate things. By its own definition it is notable in that it is a thing different and unusual from others. Your requirement is "well known" which should never be the standard for knowledge. If this was a popularity encyclo, sure, but this is suppose to be the encyclo of all knowledge. keep! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/j/p/User%7EMjposner_9302.html" title="User:Mjposner">Mjposner</a> (<a href="../../../m/j/p/User_talk%7EMjposner_cefc.html" title="User talk:Mjposner">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mjposner_3d39.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mjposner">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>This is clearly a small - perhaps even miniscule - political party but it is validly registered in the state of Florida and anyone is free to register as a member which to my mind makes it a worthwhile piece of information to include in this encyclopedia.

<li>Sort of remembering seeing something about something on some sort of news program at some point is not a verifiable source.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Eh, I don't think this is one of those issues where everybody walks away happy. Nonetheless, the AfD as it stands makes a good case. The article is currently a waste of HD space. If by some miracle the article were to undergo an amazing transformation wherein it was wikified, formatted, neutral, accurate, cited, and squeaky clean, I might consider changing my vote. Mostly, I'm against a site that might not be universally considered notable as having an article. My point of view would likely be drastically different if the article were about the organization rather than the website...anyways, if the article shows marked improvement before the discussion closes, I will reconsider my vote, which I think is about as happy everyone gets. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a></strong><em><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Simpson</font></a></em> 09:21, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was no consensus, and as is normal for such a result the article was kept. Someone has queried this result on the basis that he thinks the discussion favored deletion, and he has taken the unusual step of going to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> to try to get it deleted. Since Deletion Review is one of our few forums that are not consensus-based, I think it's probably fairer if the article is relisted for discussion in this consensus-based forum. I recommend, I admit rather lukewarmly, a keep, and present my arguments below. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Looks like a perfectly good article to me. The existence, in the one full part of the United States that does not have statehood, and moreover the one devoted wholly to government of the United States, of streets (mostly avenues) named after all fifty states of the Union, is no coincidence, and a list of those streets is of encyclopedic value. It is of perhaps as much encyclopedic value as the list of streets of Atlentic City that appear in the US monopoly board, or lists of streets in London that appear in the British version. That is to say: not much, but the net value is positive and the article is unlikely to pose any great maintenance problems. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with Tony Sidaway. The article has encyclopedic value, is completely verifable, and is more expandable than a category is. The content is certainly more encyclopedic than other lists we've deemed notable enough for inclusion. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 03:06, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Provides more than a category can, as it includes redlinks, and can include redirects (like if Ohio Drive were to redirect to the park it's contained in). Provides more than a redirect to <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._state_5a68.html" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> can, as it links to the roads. Provides more than <a href="../../../s/t/r/Category%7EStreets_in_Washington%2C_D.C._fceb.html" title="Category:Streets in Washington, D.C.">Category:Streets in Washington, D.C.</a> can, as it pulls out the ones specifically named after states - because, you know, not everyone lives in the U.S. or has the names of the states memorized. (I have split them off into a subcategory, but I don't have high hopes for its survival.) Common sense, dudes. This does more good than the zero harm in keeping it. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a> - <small><a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_SFD_e111.html" title="User:SPUI/SFD">don't use sorted stub templates!</a></small>) 03:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><b>Keep, and enhance</b></i> While it is mildly problematic that there are <i>so</i> many redlinks currently, this only means that this worthwhile list regarding state-named roadways in the U.S. capital (and ancillary topics of DC being a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_town.html" title="New town">planned city</a>) should be enhanced. For instance, it'd be great if a map was devised to highlight all of these roadways. Furthermore, each entry should be accompanied by approximate locations in DC and/or all of them should be categorised/sectioned according to location (e.g., NE, Foggy Bottom, etc.) As well, I'd actually suggest <i><b>renaming</b></i> it to <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_state-named_roadways_in_Washington%2C_D.C._d710.html" title="List of state-named roadways in Washington, D.C.">List of state-named roadways in Washington, D.C.</a></i> (lower case <a href="../../../r/_/_/R.html" title="R">r</a>, since many roadways are named Avenue, Road, Street, et al.).

<li><b>Delete</b> per WP:NOT, etc. Hardly encyclopedic, atomic level detail on streets doesn't even qualify as "almanac style entry".

<li>This has been a strange debate.

<dd>I don't understand use of "per nom." here. The nomination says "possibly a hoax" but it has been clearly established that this entry is not a hoax. It may not be <b>notable</b> and since it remains a very brief entry on something that is basically a prank (very different from a hoax), I would agree with those who suggest <b>merge</b> and add a redirect to the main entry on critical mass bike rides. "Per nom." deletion doesn't make sense when it was nominated as a possible hoax, which it is not.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Kidwell_b545.html" title="User:Ben Kidwell">Ben Kidwell</a> 16:44, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The source you need is one that verifies that the concept "water empire" has been used in this way before it appeared in this article. Otherwise you're writing a (small) work of criticism, not an encyclopedia article. That's what "no original research" means.

<p><s>This is a tricky one, so bear with me while I explain. This (orphan) article has remained a ten-word stub for nearly a year (I was the last editor, stubbing it last March). It <i>may</i> be a real place, and as such I am loath to afd it, but... it doesn't even say what country it is in, so technically it could be speediable. Google returns about 650 non-wikipedia hits for "Copaja", but many of them are for the website of Felipe Copaja, or for scientist Sylvia (S.V.) Copaja, or for other people with Copaja as their surname. Of the first 120 google hits, only one was for a Mt. Copaja, and that 404'ed. Unless there is some extension of this article, or at the very least confirmation of the mountain's existence, it doesn't really have a place here. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'll wade into this debate by saying that while High Schools are mostly notable (really, for some towns more can be said about the high school than the rest of the village combined), elementary and middle schools are rather cookie-cutter, and for the most part aren't notable.

<p>Delete. The un-attributed title "Wild Levitation" turns out to be a butchered version of Paul Harris' "Sooperman" from 1977 - a known variation of the Balducci levitation.

<p>I am not sure about this one. I can't put my finger on a specific policy saying that Wikipedia does not want long comparisons between four characters in contemporary US television and comic strips which continue down into the minutiae of fertility problems, whether they wear glasses, and which of them are noted for tearing their hair out. But I'm sure it falls under <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">WP:WIN</a> somewhere. I just don't know where. Original research? Indiscriminate collection of information? Or merely outstandingly pointless? At least a dozen accounts are listed in the history page, which staggers me a bit, so someone obviously doesn't think it's pointless. But I bring it here for comment anyway. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> 17:08, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I certainly wouldn't want to see loads of articles like this on all sorts of tenuously-related characters ("Jean-Luc Picard compared to Princess Toadstool", etc.), but the Peter/Homer similarity is widely noticed and remarked upon by even casual viewers of both series. I would prefer that each claim be referenced by at least one episode citation, and perhaps some of the less-important points removed (e.g. the glasses). Still, deletion is not cleanup, and this is good information. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:27, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, if you take a look at the edit history (excluding bot edits and vandal/anti-vandal edits) for other schools in the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Category%7EEducational_institutions_established_in_the_1880s_5636.html" title="Category:Educational institutions established in the 1880s">same category</a> you'll see, these articles are being updated much more frequently then suggested, outside of AFDs. I think the problem you mention is when somebody goes and creates 20 substubs for elementary schools built in recent times in a highly centrally run school district. Its much harder finding information for such schools, which I've been open to merging them up in many cases. But, schools, like this one, with substantial history and greater autonomy tend to have a good basis for expansion. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The picture on the page is highly suspicious -- it looks like a college shaming attempt. Anyway, besides that, the assertion that "'Unverifiable information' should not be grounds for deletion in this instance" is hogwash. Unverifiability is always grounds for deletion. It's the only way to keep <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and hoaxes out of the encyclopedia. On the other hand, this article is linked from a few others that appear to be serious.

<p><b>Comment</b> This page was changed to a redirect back to the original article and also all the references on other pages (see comment above) seem to have been inserted by User:Wizard of Gore.

<p><b>Comment</b> Powers, do you mean to suggest that the information on Wikipedia pertaining to the Giant Squid can be incontrovertibly verified? All I’m getting at is that articles should be based on the best information available. If that information can’t be proven inaccurate you’ve no choice but accept it as fact. Dabbler, why on earth would you watch the Master and Commander article? As I understand it Stefan Beck did play midshipman Calamy. If I’m wrong, please forgive me.</p>
<p>Oh, and hogwash? Come on guys.Wizard of Gore 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Response</b>. <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Squid_8f78.html" title="Giant Squid">Giant Squid</a> contains information gleaned from what sources we have available, and thus is the best information we have so far. This article, on the other hand, lists ZERO sources. That's the difference. If there were no sources for <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Squid_8f78.html" title="Giant Squid">Giant Squid</a>, we'd probably consider that a likely hoax as well. Remember, Wikipedia is not a primary source. You say "articles should be based on the best information available." So far, we have NO information available, except the say-so of whoever wrote the article. Since Wikipedia relies on verifiable sources, that just isn't sufficient.

<p><b>Comment</b> It's awfully strange that there's a page on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Master_and_Commander%7E_The_Far_Side_of_the_World_a674.html" title="Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World">Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</a> in what purports to be an encyclopedia. I see also that Dabbler has contributed an article on "trampolining." I don't know which is more pathetic, the fact that he "watches" an article about a crappy movie, or the fact that he thought a children's pastime worthy of explication in an "encyclopedia."

<p><b>Comment</b> I take exception to MisterSketchee’s comments regarding the warm glow of my computer screen. It’s been my experience that virtually all social interaction beyond the WikiWorld is painfully embarrassing at best.

<p>Just a drawing board idea from World War II.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If it were a prototype by an individual inventor, I don't think it would be notable.

<p>This work gives a good example in a comparatively short form of Garcia Marquez's 'magic realism'. As with a lot of his works, a lot of background knowledge is assumed in order to understand it, particularly the history of Colombia. I tend to assume that anyone who approaches any of Marquez's work has the intelligence to know what he or she is doing.

<p><b>Keep it.</b> You can't seriously be considering this. I can think of no more gross an example of subjective morality's continued stranglehold on mass media than this insurrection into the collective free-knowledgebase that is Wikipedia. We've got issues on this website, and we don't need to be judging an ACCURATE, popular article when there are several incomplete, poorly written, and largely false articles existing on the site daily. The "neologisms" argument is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It denies the global community the ability to have its say in what information should be readily available to mass audiences, which is what Wikipedia was made for. Last time I checked, we're not Microsoft. This timid argument is ridiculous.</p>
<p><br />
The idea of banning "Neologisms" is faulty policy to begin with, and that's what this debate boils down to. The gap between 'current' neologisms and legitimate terms is only bridged by apparent common usage. Common usage is related to popularity, which is, in most cases, due to nothing more than personal exposure to the word. Wikipedia is special for many reasons, not least of which is its ability to disperse new--yes, even BRAND new--information to a large, international audience. To deny that Wikipedia facilitates society in this exciting learning process is to depreciate <i>our own website,</i> and self-impose a <b>lower standard</b> of value and influence on society than traditional media. We're peeing on our own feet, folks.</p>
<p><br />
This article strikes at the heart of the faulty "Neologism" policy. We can't just say <i>"wait we don't allow these because we say so,"</i> if it appears as though there is a legitimate reason for the policy ITSELF to be reviewed, which I believe is the real issue here. If you expel the ability of Wikipedia to help new concepts make it as quickly as possible into the marketplace of ideas, you're destroying what makes this site unique and extremely important.</p>

<p>Ok, so "Wikipornia" isn't exactly the most important and valiant example of the flaws inherent in the "Neologisms" policy; that DOESN'T mean that the flaws don't exist. If you outlaw the Wiki-community's ability to help new concepts come to the forefront, <b>you're stunting the vast potential of Wikipedia, and railing against the very concept behind the internet itself.</b></p>
<p><br />
If we decide to delete this, and other similar articles, I wish you good luck in your quest to make Wikipedia as dry, boring, linear, and immediately out of date as a regular encyclopedia. Why don't we just publish a book if we want to exclude the idea of <b>timeliness,</b> completion, community, and open-source R/evolution that began this site?

<li><b>Delete</b> I vote for deletion. Wikipedia is not a slang guide. Anyways, this isn't popular slang at all. "Thousands upon thousands" being familiar with the term is maybe a few thousand people out of "millions upon millions" that speak English. And anyway, like the article says, this term was coined and used about 5 times on Collegehumor.com. Wikipedia does not and should not have articles about inside jokes or slang terms used by every single website's userbase on the web. It's simply unrealistic. Articles about internet subculture are valid articles (think 1337) but Wikipornia is not common enough to merit having its own article. Used 5 times on one website? Please. The only reason this is being debated is because CollegeHumor linked to this article requesting users to "Save Wikipornia." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDapperDan_cd66.html" title="User:TheDapperDan">TheDapperDan</a> 21:52, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no reason not to keep this article. Everyone here citing Wikipedia's "A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide." Needs to read the next sentence of that policy. The next sentence says "Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used." This article, although is a slang term, is not a guide on how this term is to be used, but rather an explanation of the term itself, which is Wikipedia worthy, because it explains a phenomena, not mearly a straight dictionary word with a meaning and definition.

For example, we have articles on <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a>, but not Longcat or RICK JAMES, BITCH! because these memes are not in common usage.

I believe that by censoring popular trends in culture because "they are more fitted for urbandictionary.com" you are only depriving Wikipedia of one of its inherent advantages over standard encyclopedias. Wikipedia has the opportunity to be a factual, first-stop resource, but also has the opportunity to supplement the facts with popular opinions, trends, and other less tangible, shifting elements of culture. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.36.60.116 (<a href="../../../1/2/8/User_talk%7E128.36.60.116.html" title="User talk:128.36.60.116">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.36.60.116_7b36.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.36.60.116">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I really don't understand why people don't want to keep this entry. People are citing two policies which have no baring on this entry at all. The "Wikipedia is not 'A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide.'" states specifically that the artical should not deal with the <b>usage</b> of the slang, not that the article should not be about a slang term itself. "Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used." The article makes no mention of the idea that slang terms themselves cannot have an article.</p>
<p>The citing of <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">WP:BALLS</a> is simply rediculous, because the article itself states that it is NOT Wikipedia policy. The policy which states that Wikipedia can not be used to publish original research cities that coining a neologism in an article is a way of establishing that the article is original, and therefore unsuitable for Wikipedia. AGAIN, the policy does not specifically ban neologisms, and because this article is not a reasearch paper, or an attempt to publish any kind of theory, data, etc, as stated on the Policy page about no original research. Therefore, it doesn't fall into that catagory, and the fact that it may be a "new" word doesn't mean it's excluded because it does not pertain to new reasearch. There is a "content guide" which seeks to have users aviod neologisms, "unless they have realistic evidence of existence via verifiable usage data or, at the least, search engine hits." As the wikipornia article itself states, there are google hits pertaining to the word.</p>
<p>Many people also are saying that it's too new and/or not widely used enough to warrent a Wikipedia article. My question to them is, at what point does it become old enough, or widely used enough to be deemed Wikipedia worthy. If anything this article should be kept because it pertains to something that exists on Wikipedia. It is not a straigh dictionary definition, nor is something not noted or unworthy. The fact that so many people have visited this page and put in their two cents (rightly or not) shows that this article is well known and widely used. I urge the administrators to keep this because it is an example of what is best about Wikipedia: the ability to evolve and be crafted from the ideas of its users. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrlecter491_f1a1.html" title="User:Drlecter491">Drlecter491</a> 00:11, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>In many cases, neologisms get deleted. Protologisms are almost always deleted. It could be via speedy deletion or the Articles for deletion process.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But this is not a court of law, and although citing policy is a good idea, we should always be sure to <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">ignore all rules</a> (see also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_bureaucracy" title="WP:NOT">this policy</a>). There are dozens if not hundreds of neologisms up for deletion at the present moment. We have the neologism policy (and similar policies) because we are building an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, not a phrase book, certainly not a free for all content host. This is undeniably a neologism. It is a routine deletion, one of more than two hundred nominated per day (and this is nothing new). It is wonderful that so many people have taken an interest in Wikipedia, and I hope they stay. But we can not turn Wikipedia into a host for every person with access to the web to post their ideas. If "wikipornia" becomes commonly used (think thousands of google hits), then it should be included. But until then, we leave it (and the thousands of words like it) out. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 01:11, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
