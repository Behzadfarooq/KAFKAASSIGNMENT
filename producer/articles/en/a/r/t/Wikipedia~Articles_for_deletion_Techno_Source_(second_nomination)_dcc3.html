<li>Company press releases can be used to a certain extent, but claims of notability and any other claims that a company would have an interest in not being impartial about would generally need an independent source to back them up.

<li><i>"benefiting from the recent success of its handheld Touch Screen Sudoku"</i> - <b>dubious</b>. Backed up by a guide from a website for the elderly which mentions the product, but says that is "creating a lot of excitement". To me "success" equals "profit", not "excitement". There was excitement about the Titanic.</li>
<li><i>"nominated for Toy of the Year in 2005"</i> - <b>verified</b>, but not much of an assertion of notability. According to the awarding body's official site, <i>"Representatives from any toy manufacturer or toy-related company are eligible to nominate products and/or companies for award categories defined in the T.O.T.Y. Awards Program Guidelines. TIA members may submit nominations free of charge."</i> <i><a href="http://www.toy-tia.org/content/navigationmenu/toy_industry_association/toty/Award_Guidelines/Award_Guidelines.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toy-tia.org/content/navigationmenu/toy_industry_association/toty/Award_Guidelines/Award_Guidelines.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></i></li>

<li><b>Response to</b> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a>: I looked into the award guidelines on the TIA (awarding body) site and it is a multi-stage process. From mid-September to the end of October in 2005, any toy company could write in a nomination for a product they believe deserves one of the 11 Toy of the Year awards. The TIA reviews all of the written nominations, tabulates them, and culls down the list to 5 nominees in each category. The TIA sends out this paper ballot to all TIA members who vote for the winner in each category. The winners were announced in February 2006. See the following site for reference:<br /></li>

<li><i>"featured in the celebrity 'swag' given out at the 12th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards"</i> - <b>verified</b>. Nice bit of trivia.</li>
<li><i>"one of the pioneers responsible for the rise of the 'retro gaming' market"</i> - <b>not verified</b>. The "source" is the interview with the Executive VP, and you can probably interpret his remarks as saying that... but we can't rely on one of the company directors for such of a claim.</li>
<li>Same claim as 4.</li>
<li><i>"with... the Intellivision 10, Techno Source sold over 1,000,000 units"</i>. <b>Questionable</b>. Sourced <a href="http://www.intellivisionlives.com/media/newsletters/news041101.html" class="external text" title="http://www.intellivisionlives.com/media/newsletters/news041101.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.intellivisionlives.com/retrotopia/direct2tv.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.intellivisionlives.com/retrotopia/direct2tv.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The former reports that a spokesman for the company claimed they sold 1m units - well, he's probably not lying, but he's not impartial, and the key is verifiability, not truth. There are a lot of ways to generate a million sales, and getting a million people to pay you full price to own your product is only the most obvious one. The latter, from the same website, repeats the 1,000,000 figure as fact, without attribution to the spokesman. Maybe that means they've checked and it's true, or maybe they just left the source out that time. As I said, questionable.</li>
<li><i>"and received the National Parenting Center Seal of Approval in 2004"</i>. <b>Verified</b> by the sources above. Ok, so it works.</li>
<li><i>"Techno Source has sold more Intellivision games today than Mattel Electronics originally sold in the 1980s".</i> <b>Verified</b>, probably. Sourced to <a href="http://www.thelogbook.com/zine/?cat=3" class="external text" title="http://www.thelogbook.com/zine/?cat=3" rel="nofollow">thelogbook.com</a>, who attribute it to <i>"the original programmers of the classic Intellivision video games"</i>, so no reason to doubt this. But how much can that be, really?</li>
<li><i>"Dr. Toy named Techno Source to its list of 100 Best Products for this assortment in 2005"</i>. <b>Verified</b>... but 100 every year is a lot of toys. Most of the companies on the list are probably not notable.</li>
<li><i>"The company has also grown through the success of its handheld Sudoku and other puzzle games"</i> - <b>not verified</b>, it's the About.com site again, which says that Techno Source sell handheld Sudoku, but nothing about 'other puzzle games', or that it's part of their growth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>After all that, I'm still leaning towards a <s>weak keep</s> <small><i>(see below)</i></small>, as the amount of third-party coverage means the company is probably worth an article, there just don't seem to be strong concrete claims to being a particularly high-growth company (of which there are an awful lot in the technology sector with less ambiguous claims to fame). The claims of growth and suchlike are ephemeral - if I saw even a modest sourced turnover or profit growth figure, I'd be much happier than with a hundred more websites - and it's somewhat dubious how much of an achievement the other claims are. There just needs to be a more rigorous approach to sourcing in the article, being more cautious about the claims to notability if necessary. I do urge editors to check the quality, not just quantity, of sources when they support keeping on that basis.</li>
<li>And I guess selling 1,000,000 creaky old games is probably an achievement, even if the accountant in me is demanding "for how much? did they need to sell at a discount to move that many? did they cover overheads?" etc - after all, if it turns out they were selling them for peanuts and go bankrupt, we still cover notable failures. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:56, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>From that PR: <i>"Techno Source <b>expects</b> their line of Intellivision branded products to surpass..."</i> (emphasis mine) Not only are press releases are not reliable sources for assertions of notability (if a company is truly notable, third-party sources will publish those assertions, and only after they've been through a fact-checking process), but that doesn't even claim that they have surpassed Matell, only that they expect to. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 01:09, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think you are trivializing this award expecially since Techno Source is not even a member of the TIA. The fact that Techno Source was nominated even though they are not a member seems to at least partially counter your point. Some would say that the Oscars are show business glad-handing, but that does not mean that the actors or actresses nominated are any less notable.

<li>Per Tychocat's reasoning above I now think that <b>delete</b> would be the better option. The claims to notability are just too shaky for me to support an encyclopaedia article on the company. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 16:30, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The relevant standard is <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> - as a private company it obviously can't pass the third (stock market index) test. The second test is inclusion of the company on ranking indices by well-known and independent publications - I don't see that in the citations of the article or in the evidence here. The first test is "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself". "Been the subject of "means that the article, or a large fraction of it, needs to be primarily about the company. Coverage of products does not meet the standard. I find no coverage that meets this test. The artcile also reads like advertising copy. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please also take another look at the article. I have added several more sources that show Techno Source winning several awards for their educational products in preschool as well as entertainment products for older consumers. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_23_a5ad.html" title="User:Jay 23">Jay 23</a> 19:02, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said in my comment immediately before the request, the test is not whether there is coverage of the products (that would be relevant for an article on a specific product), it is whether there are multiple works about the company. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This seems like a very difficult standard to attain for a private company because the very things that would make a company notable, such as sales volume, are the very things that are not publicly reported. In terms of notability, several sources I have cited state that Techno Source was one of the pioneers in the retro gaming market in 2003 when they partnered with Intellivision. Additionally, are not some companies defined by their products? In this case, award-winning products that have been well-received and written about by various publications for their entertainment and educational value should prove a degree of notability for the company that produces them.<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_23_a5ad.html" title="User:Jay 23">Jay 23</a> 14:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
