<p><b>Delete</b>. This is a bit silly. All these articles are merely a short stub paragraph of a cricket match... I don't think the Wikipedia has a record of all baseball matchs played worldwide, so I find these articles rather... not useful. If they are useful at all, they need to be merged into a simplier article. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 11:29, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>After reading much of the previous discussions that I did not know existed, (look, the fact I found one out of many means that I'm not alone in the thought that they shouldn't be in the main article space), I believe any of the non-important cricket match articles should be moved to a subpage and out of the main article space. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 23:25, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, it should be noted that some of these matches are hard to verify as you'd need the news source links for these, which I don't see I can easily find. The only link I see is a scorecard for the match, and the article itself is slightly opinionated in how the match played out highlighting what was important in the game. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:05, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have never heard "partial unverifiability" as being a criterion for deletion. It's also new to me that newspaper stories are not reliable sources. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:34, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What I mean is that it is hard for me to find the news sources in question, let alone some other source like a book on this material. I didn't say newspaper stories are not reliable sources, I said that some of these articles are hard to verify. Simply put, I can't find the newspaper stories online about these matches. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:42, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is not to say these articles are not available in print, which I'm certain they are likely are, it is just that I can't find them in particular. Furthermore, who is to say that the article is written in a NPOV view? Certainly not I, perhaps another cricket fan... --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 22:25, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So I was wrong. But it took awhile to find it, and it took a considerable time to make certain that it was what it was. Here's a news link for the first article in the list: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4108956.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4108956.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Most of my searches turn up scorecards, rather than news reports. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 22:30, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, if they are to be merged, how do you merge the page history into the main article?

<dl>
<dd>Never merge page histories when doing an article merge. It makes the history utterly useless. The way to do it is to acknowledge in the edit summary where you are merging from, keeping the history behind the redirect. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 13:23, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, what's to stop you from adding every match for every sport played in the world? Want to go add all the soccer matches? Want to go add all baseball games being playing the world? Basketball? Hockey? I'm sorry, but the level of detail on these articles is something we don't need.

<li><b>Delete all</b>. A cricket match is a one time event, and similar to most other cricket matches. It is OK to have articles on a few of the most notable matches, the same way that I would support retaining an article on the various World Cup finals in football, and I also support that we have a few articles on games of historic significance in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChess_games_13b5.html" title="Category:Chess games">Category:Chess games</a>. But trying to be a comprehensive source on each and every major cricket match is not what an encyclopedia should strive for. These games are of hardly <i>any</i> historic significance, if any at all. They get press attention in the sports press alright, but the games are very seldomly truly <i>memorable</i> and are usually forgotten very soon. We <i>don't</i> have articles on individual Premier League football matches, on individual NHL ice hockey matches, on individual NFL American "football" matches, on individual NBA basketball matches, etc., and there is no reason to make an exception for cricket matches. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, it is not a sports news service, and not infinite. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:40, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep England Games at least</b>. The summer of 2005 will be long remembered in England (and Wales?) for it's amazing series of cricket matches. Of course the Ashes could be in just one article, but to do it justice it would be an extremely long article. I can understand that other games are probably of less value and take up space, but it seems a shame to destroy such a lot of work. <a href="../../../b/e/v/User%7EBevo74_ce64.html" title="User:Bevo74">Bevo74</a> 12:47, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For AfD purposes, Merge and Keep are the same - merges don't require admin priviledges. I am voting with the assumption that they will be merged as was discussed earlier.

<li><b>Keep</b> on the understanding that they be merged soon. I am astonished that AllyUnion saw fit to ignore the "no consensus" summary of five previous AfDs and a centralised discussion. There is absolutely no consensus at all on this issue. If I wasn't heavily personally involved, I would do a speedy keep. Cricket need not become the new GNAA. Please <i>think</i> before nominating: is there a realistic chance of this being deleted? The very conclusive no-consensus before should have shown you that the answer is "no".

<li><b>Merge</b> (per previous vote on this issue). There seems to be two quite separate issues being discussed here. Firstly, is it appropriate to record details of <b>verifiable</b> and <b>notable</b> matches in Wikipedia? I say that if someone wants to write a good NPOV article on these, let them as it expands the usefulness of the encyclopædia. If a fan of another sport wishes to do the same then go for it, for the same reason. Secondly, how should those articles be organised: As individual articles or larger season, comptetition or club articles? I say probably the latter, although I'm not all that fussed. -- <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanbrown_eb80.html" title="User:Ianbrown">Ian</a> ≡ <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanbrown_5157.html" title="User talk:Ianbrown">talk</a> 15:14, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>During earlier discussion on this topic, we were told that these were "temporary" articles that would be merged. Many of us thought that such projects were best done offline until they could be written in a presentable form. The fact that most of these are pretty poorly written articles that you'd expect your local sports news guy to blabber out instead of find in an encyclopedia doesn't help either. There have been god knows how many professional sorts games played in the world ever. Millions maybe. This project has shown that Wikipedia can't even do individual articles for a single season of a single sport well. Trying to do them all would be a disaster, so it shouldn't be attempted. I think it's about time people made good on their promise to merge these articles. so <b>smerge</b> the hell out of them or <b>delete</b> them. I don't much care which. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:29, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete All</b>. Individual matches are generally non-notable, and don't need to be mentioned. There are about 5,000 professional sporting events in the US alone which are at least as notable as most of these cricket games. Having articles on important games is fine (World Series in Baseball, perhaps international cricket, etc), and having season <i>summaries</i> is fine, but mentioning every single game in a "summary" is like having a phone book in an article about a city. Most of the articles are also quite poorly written and would be more appropriate for wikinews or a separate cricket wiki. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 18:30, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

The season summaries which use these reports don't flow together as a result of these results being transcluded, and rather than being a cohesive article, instead serve as shallow containers. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 20:23, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

As Stephen Turner pointed out at the discussion page that I just mentioned, "The people writing the cricket articles claim to be doing something different, however — the articles are supposed to be temporary, as a convenient way of writing season reviews for each team and each competition without duplicating the reports of the same match in several different places. I think these reviews of the whole season are sufficiently notable to be articles, and the sub-articles should therefore be allowed to stay until the end of the season (which is very soon now)." We are not some worldwide equivalent of ESPN or a newspaper's sports section.

<p>It seems like a lot of novel arguments are being made here for deletion, like that fact that they <i>only</i> link to score cards, or that server space limitations are grounds for deletion. If we are going to use lack of citations or server space are reasons for deletion (a) this is a <i>major</i> policy issue which cannot be addressed in a single AfD, and (b) most of the encyclopaedia would have to be deleted. I just looked at 53 random articles; 3 were disambiguation pages. Of the 50 non-dab pages, only three had references and only one was adequately referenced. If we apply the standard that AU quoted at the top, about a lack of a readily available source for <i>all</i> the information, we probably have to delete 98% of our content. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:34, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These articles were written in a bottom up approach when most of our articles should be written at a top down approach. The point that I was making is what is to stop someone from inserting a fictitious entry on a Cricket match to a supposed score card? How are we to verify that? Furthermore, it makes more sense to have a comprehensive encyclopedic article on the entire English season rather than describing each match. This concept is applied for different subjects such as minor characters in fiction works. We don't have an entry on every minor character in fiction works, becuase that's just absurd. Why should cricket matches and sport entries be any different? --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 12:34, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>The point that I was making is what is to stop someone from inserting a fictitious entry on a Cricket match to a supposed score card?</i> - I don't understand what you mean, "supposed score card"? There's enough information on a score card to tell what happened. As for details not on the score card - there will be newspaper reports, etc. Would it be <i>better</i> if there were links to newspaper stories or other reports - sure. But their absence is not grounds for deletion. I don't understand your statement <i>How are we to verify that?</i> I could verify a lot of these matches in the <i>Trinidadian</i> press (from here in Oklahoma), much less the English press.
<dl>
<dd>How are we to tell if a scorecard site is reliable? And I never claimed their absence is grounds for deletion, don't put words in my mouth. I said I can't find anything on them, meaning it's harder for me to verify the information, but it is not to say that I can try harder. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 22:21, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

When we have half a million articles on cricket matches, who is going to have a half million article watchlist to make sure they aren't vandalized? Wikipedia can't monitor it's current articles as is. I've seen pretty severe vandalism and high traffic pages that has sat there for weeks unnoticed.

<li>We have articles hundreds (probably thousands) of minor characters in fiction. And many thousands of missing articles which we should have. As for vandalism - are you advocating we delete articles which remain vandalised for more than a certain amount of time? And can you point to any of these which <i>have</i> been vandalised? I fail to see the relevance, again. I think I need to make a list of '<i>new deletion criteria</i> which have been proposed in this article.

<li>Hundreds or thousands is a very far cry from "most". And many of those could be merged, which seems to be what many people are talking about here. The simple fact is Wikipedia is never going to have a good article on every cricket match ever played. It's basically impossible. So why are people trying? This quantity over quality mentality that has been pervading wikipedia is proving to be pretty harmful, as only about 2/3 of the nearly 800,000 "articles" wikipedia claims to have are actual articles in any real sense of the word. Instead of writing a few thousand poor articles on individual cricket matches, why not write a few dozen good ones summarizing the season, or whatever? We could avoid debates like this, and the project would be vastly better off. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:13, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The point I'm attempting to make is that there is a dam, and water is about to overflow. You let the dam break, you'll have a mess. You let the water come out slowly, you'll have no problem. The issue I have is that, if you allow the content on here to stay the way it is, what is it to stop from another person saying: "Oh, look, they have individual cricket match articles. Hey, my favorite hobby are stamps. Why don't I start making an entry for every stamp I have in my collection?" --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 22:21, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think anyone's actually suggesting keeping them as they are: our intention from very early on was to merge the match articles at the end of the season by substing them into the articles in which they're currently transcluded. This merging does need to happen soon, though. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> <sup><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">?!?</a></sup> 23:26, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No one's voting to keep them as they are? What do these keep votes mean then? Yes, merge them (well, smerge them, really) I think that would appease the vast majority here. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:10, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What do all the keep votes mean? There are <i>really</i> only two valid options on AfD - delete or keep. Merging does not require an AfD. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:45, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>True, to an extent, but the votes still have different meanings. I think if everyone wanted to merge, they would be phrasing these "keep" votes as "merge", as many others seem to be doing. and although an AfD is not required for merging an article, this is not <i>an</i> article. On a project this size it helps greatly to have some sort of consensus to back up (or, in a way, "force" such a merge) particluarly when it had been promised long ago. See AllyUnion's comments below as well, though I'm not entirely sure deletions of redirects are necessary. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:11, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Deletions of double redirects which no one - guaranteed no one - will type in, I see no problems with.

As for "forcing" a merge - if it was that crucial, someone should have asked and it would have been done within a day. The reason why it was delayed was that I wanted to look through and check the articles for typos and things before they were substed (since it's much easier to correct typos in one place than in four) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 15:15, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>The following code here is to fix the articles accordingly.</p>

<li>Gets the text for one of the linked pages (for all purposes, I'll refer this as a <b>main article</b>)
<dl>
<dd>Example: <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_%288-30_April%29_e274.html" title="2005 English cricket season (8-30 April)">2005 English cricket season (8-30 April)</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Example: {{:2005 English cricket season/MCC v Warwickshire 8-11 April 2005}}</dd>

</li>
<li>Substitutes all the appropriate transincludes from the text from the appropriate former subpage moved article (minus the AFD notice and category links)
<dl>
<dd>{{:2005 English cricket season/MCC v Warwickshire 8-11 April 2005}} is replaced with the text from <a href="../../../m/c/c/MCC_v_Warwickshire_8-11_April_2005_4df1.html" title="MCC v Warwickshire 8-11 April 2005">MCC v Warwickshire 8-11 April 2005</a> (minus AFD notice and category links)</dd>

</li>
<li>Takes the former subpage moved article and redirects to the main article

</dl>
</li>
<li>Fixes a double redirect error:
<dl>
<dd>Example: 2005 English cricket season/MCC v Warwickshire 8-11 April 2005 is changed to redirect to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_%288-30_April%29_e274.html" title="2005 English cricket season (8-30 April)">2005 English cricket season (8-30 April)</a> instead of <a href="../../../m/c/c/MCC_v_Warwickshire_8-11_April_2005_4df1.html" title="MCC v Warwickshire 8-11 April 2005">MCC v Warwickshire 8-11 April 2005</a>
