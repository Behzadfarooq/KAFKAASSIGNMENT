<li>[Not a vote: Anon] [Restatement of confusing attempt to vote:] Keep. <s>Do not delete</s> For people (like me), who receive spam mail from wikiverse, it is very valuable to look up the "wikiverse" entry in wikipedia to find out whether it is a respectable mirror, or just a spammer and hijacker.
<ul>
<li>a) Which category would you judge it to be in, based on the present content of the Wikiverse article?</li>
<li>b) Unsigned votes don't count, but in weighing your opinion it would be helpful to me if you'd identify yourself in some way. If you run a website with which Wikiverse has requested a link exchange, perhaps you'd care to identify that site.

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> [, as restatement of confusing vote] <s>Do not delete</s> I agree that it's useful to look up who they are, having just received their spam myself. Why is it spam? Because _they_ didn't create the link, they just inherited it, but they pretend they created it and imply that linking back is a requirement to maintain it. (If they had created the link it would be arguably a legitimate link exchange request.) They also have a spurious domain registration, claiming their city is Daganbanga (not found by Google anywhere), their state is Not Applicable, and their zip is 90210 (as in the TV show). Looks like they plan to first establish a presence, then sell advertising or whatever. They also are setting up subdomains for -- in this instance -- an artist in the form of "artistname.wikiverse.org" -- perhaps in a mild way a real service (but are they selling this?), plus they include a search for current press mention of the artist (small added value). So: is there a "scams" section this might be filed under appropriately? WytCld 15:12, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi everyone, in response to WytCld, I'm one of the programmers who helped create Wikiverse. We never expected Wikipedia to be so hostile to what we were doing, and I'm still not sure I understand why. I'd like to set a few things straight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The first link exchange emails Katz sent were inaccurate in their wording (saying that we added a link), but that was fixed as soon as we noticed people were confused.</li>
<li>The domain registration was not fully accurate to for privacy reasons. The registrar has a privacy option, but the gal who registered the domain figured it would easier to just put in some bogus details. That has been fixed since.</li>
<li>We don't understand why the Wikipedia community is so hostile to Wikiverse. It's the nicest Wikipedia mirror out there. It's non-profit, it has a clean interface, it has an integrated newsfeed.</li>
<li>At this point I don't think there's anything I can say which will convince you we are not the sinister evil spammers you make us out to be. However, for those of you who are not yet biased by baseless accusations I'd like to say: there is no conspiracy, clever scamming or otherwise going on, just a humble little mirror of Wikipedia made some people who love it enough to donate resources to make sure it's always available in one form or another. (Wikipedia is under such a huge load it has been down on numerous occasions)</li>

<li>Speaking for myself and nobody else... <b>I'</b> don't hate Wikiverse. But based on my own observations, I don't think it's notable enough to be worth an article of its own. A brief mention in an article on Wikipedia mirrors is sufficient. The spam controversy <i>should</i> be mentioned briefly, because there <b>is</b> controversy about it. My own vote remains <b>delete.</b> If and when Wikiverse becomes important, I'd have no objection to an article.</li>
<li>By the way, Tomco, as a registered user, you are allowed to vote, which I don't think you've actually done yet. On a new line at the bottom, at the start of the line type an asterisk, then your vote (keep or delete, presumably the former), then sign with four tildes. Perfect formatting is not important, just make it easy for a sysop to spot your vote and determine your intention. VfD is an exercise in forming and determining rough consensus, not parliamentary procedure, so don't worry to much about the exact count and please don't create "sockpuppets" (registering as multiple users to inflate a vote), as Wikipedians really do hate that. Votes can be changed for as long as the discussion proceeds, by the way).

<li><b>Delete.</b> <s><b>Keep.</b></s> (I change my vote. See my note below about "shame on me".) Apparently there is sufficient controversy about this new mirror to justify a Wikipedian dialog. It appears to be something more than just a mirror and may bear watching, or perhaps I should say, policing; and the Wikipedia entry is an excellent place for that. I will say that the message I received from Wikiverse, and which ultimately led me here, could in no way be considered spam. It concerned the Glosa language, and proposed an exchange between one of my Glosa pages and the Glosa entry in Wikiverse. Very precise, very relevant. Of the many link exchange requests I've received, I've only accepted one; this may make two. (Unless somebody else here, with no Glosa pages, and not even an interest in auxiliary languages, received the same proposal? Yeah, that could be spam.) The only questionable aspect of the proposal: <i>Linking back to us will also help maintain your link with us in the future.</i>. If Wikiverse is truly a mirror, then I see no way that an exchange could help maintain the link. (WytCld makes some interesting points above. And I too was intrigued by Wikiverse's use of subdomains for every Wikipedian page; an odd technique. Maybe I will wait a bit before linking. See what I mean? Even this VFD dialog about Wikiverse has been useful for me, already!) <a href="../../../a/i/l/User%7EAilanto_f035.html" title="User:Ailanto">Ailanto</a> 15:50, 2004 Aug 9 (UTC)

<li>Thank you, Jerzy! I appreciate the gentle manner in which you raised your concerns. True, I haven't done much work in this Wiki yet. (And may not for some time; I've gotten myself involved in too many things lately! And Wikipediawise, I'd like to focus on the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> and <a href="../../../i/d/o/Ido.html" title="Ido">Ido</a> sister sites.) As for my user page, I was influenced by the Ceqli discussion, in which self-promotion was oft cited as a major no-no. I assume that user pages are a special case since they would seem to be inherently self-promotional; mine is about <i>me</i>, after all... unless of course I am simply misunderstanding the purpose of user pages. I proudly accept the label <i>unusual</i>... and <i>contrarian</i> too, though in these cases I think that it would only mean that I'm in the minority, hehe. <a href="../../../a/i/l/User%7EAilanto_f035.html" title="User:Ailanto">Ailanto</a> 14:21, 2004 Aug 11 (UTC)

If I create a link to them, there will still be a link between us even if their link to me disappears.

<li>Hmm, which would ensure you had a way to find them to say "Wha'happened??" when they cut off your traffic. Or they may just mean "when we decide whether to continue linking to you, we'll factor in whether you're sending us traffic." (Which difficulty communicating may be a sign of their being not odd, contrarian or unusual, but just fly-by-night, incompetant, confused, likely to fold, and -- dare i say? -- non-notable.) --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 19:02, 2004 Aug 13 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi again. Thanks for sticking up for us (in a sense). Your view reflects the crushing non-wikipedia majority. Your point regarding that line in the email is valid, and I've sent an email to Katz regarding that. I'd like you and everyone else to keep watch over wikiverse for as long you it takes you to become convinced there is no cloak and dagger conspiracy going on. --Tomco 15:13, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The email Wikiverse sent me was to "Webmaster@&lt;one of my domain names&gt;" (with a CC to another username at that domain). There is no LAN associated with that domain name, and no email accounts. Email to made-up user names is clearly an unsolicited electronic message, which, in my mind (and according to m-w.com), is spam. Yes, it is better targetted than most spam--it linked to an article I editted some time ago (even tho' it's a topic I don't really care about)--but it's still spam. Ailanto, et al, using separate domain names for every article just gives them more google presence. Note that the vast majority of the hits for <i>wikiverse</i> are &lt;some topic&gt;.wikiverse.org. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 18:58, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> After reading numerous (many good) arguments on both sides of the aisle, I put it to my own test of keeping Wikipedia reputable: Is it encyclopedic content? No. As valid as some arguments are, this is meant to be an encyclopedia, not a list of warnings, subliminal advertisements, or whatever else this could be used for. It's not encyclopedic, borders on breaking several rules and, in my opinion, is not notable. So I say delete. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyler1534_f063.html" title="User:Skyler1534">Skyler</a> 21:40, Aug 9, 2004 (UTC)</li>

That satisfies my concern except for one thing: If I Search for <i>Wikiverse</i>, only the Wikiverse page shows up, not the mirrors/forks page. So, if the Wikiverse page is deleted, and I come here to find out if there's a relationship between Wikipedia and Wikiverse (which is exactly how I ended up here!) and I search for Wikiverse, will I be led to mirrors/forks? Redirect, search results, something? If yes, then I'll definitely change my vote, for deletion. (I probably will anyway. Just hope I don't lose my <i>contrarian</i> status, hehe.) <a href="../../../a/i/l/User%7EAilanto_f035.html" title="User:Ailanto">Ailanto</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This has all been blown way out of proportion. I'd like to point out the only reason the wikiverse article exists is because someone who had felt deceived by the link exchange request created an article that was little more than a rant against wikiverse explaining that we were spamming scumbags who deserved "to die frightened and alone", trying to explain Wikiverse's point of view in the article (biasing it the other way), and the subsequent Vfd flamewar created much more heat then light and the impression something significant was going on in contrary to the facts</li>

<li>We decided to create a non-profit mirror of Wikipedia that was decent, clean and useful.</li>
<li>We made a few mistakes in the way we promoted the mirror that caused a member of the Wikipedia community to become upset and feel they had been deceived and cheated. He wrote the first article.</li>
<li>My response to this article, combined with a mis-understanding of Wikipedia culture eventually created a huge backlash that magnified Wikiverse into something significant and sinister that outraged the Wikipedia community.</li>
<li>For Wikipedians, the closest thing to deleting Wikiverse is to delete the article about Wikiverse.</li>
<li>It would be convenient for Wikiverse to have an article in Wikipedia about itself, where we can have a dialog with Wikipedia and introduce the site.</li>
<li>But I agree logically that if every minor website created an encyclopedia article about itself in Wikipedia, Wikipedia wouldn't really by an encyclopedia anymore.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The site may be useful, the article isn't. A couple of clarifications. 1. <b>Ailanto</b>: The reason your search for Wikiverse fails is that <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_fe2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks">Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks</a> isn't in the main namespace; if you click the "Wikipedia" check-box on the search results page and re-search, it'll come up. That certainly is a bit confusing, but that's a general issue about our interface, not a reason to keep the article. 2. <b>Tomco</b>: Thank you for finally acknowledging in a less sarcastic manner <i>some</i> of the specific issues others have raised, though it's really not productive to raise straw men like "cloak-and-dagger conspiracy" that obscure those specific issues. I'm still not convinced that you get the particular ways in which you "misunderstood Wikipedia culture" (which are clearly spelled out in the help pages - basically, don't engage in edit wars on subjects you're affiliated with [you could easily have <i>voted</i> to delete the original anti-Wikiverse article yourself], and don't delete others' comments; it's not rocket science). Your assertion that "the closest thing to deleting Wikiverse is to delete the article about Wikiverse", though, is just ridiculous. I might as well say that if someone posts a pointless article about <i>me</i>, deleting it is "the closest thing to murdering me". I think it's safe to say that Wikipedia users do not mistake non-listing for nonexistence, and know that articles are not written in order to "introduce" a site or to "have a dialogue". <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob"></a>—<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a>←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User_talk%7EHob_797e.html" title="User talk:Hob">Talk</a> 15:54, 2004 Aug 14 (UTC)</li>

<p>(Vote above this 'graph if you change the tally accordingly, or below if you don't.) <b>Votes above: DEL 14, KEEP 1</b> (unless someone changed their vote but didn't strike thru the old one). No one has yet double checked me. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 19:02, 2004 Aug 13 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b> so that visitors to Wikipedia who seek information about Wikiverse can be sure of reaching the appropriate passage on <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_fe2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks">Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks</a>. Jerzy, you seem to be counting "delete and redirect" as a simple "delete", so I'm not sure how you want my vote to be reflected in your tally. Do any of the "delete" voters actively object to a redirect? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 01:59, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I do. Please, <b>redirect</b> instead of just deleting. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECAkira_ae77.html" title="User:CAkira">Akira - Cleber Akira Nakandakare</a> 03:09, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>can i point out that the wikiverse google co-op is NOT AFFILIATED with wikiverse.org. I dont understand the comments about abusive messages.</p>
