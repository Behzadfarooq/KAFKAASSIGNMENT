<p>No assertion of notability per the guidelines. A couple of nfos and a short bio compiled by some unknown individual doesn't make an article.

<li><span id="inconvenienttruth">There is no polite way to say this</span>, so I'll just say it. You're obviously too young to remember the composition, timeline, impact and effects of the cracking scene ca. 1985-1995, and you have no idea what the giants whose shoulders you are standing on were up to in their heyday (and they or their successors apparently still are to an extent). I'm having a hard time to refrain from throwing words like "trigger-happy" and "complete ignorance" around. I wish people didn't have such short attention spans and would pay more attention to history, including the history of the IT industry. Also, don't confuse legality with notability. <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 05:22, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>IMHO the above is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman_argument.html" title="Strawman argument">strawman argument</a>. In an AFD, credible (established &amp; verifiable) sources are a <i>tool</i> to establish the article subjects's notability/credibility. Articles on notable subjects are kept (and subsequently improved where necessary). Articles on non-notable subjects are deleted. Once the balance of evidence indicates that a subject is indeed notable, an article is kept. The above note implies that because of a perceived lack of established mainstream sources, the article should face deletion irrespective of its subject's (implicitly conceded) notability. That turns things on its head. Established sources are the means towards the end, not an end in themselves. Granted, established sources are almost always a better tool to establish notability than other, inherently less powerful indicators. (Such less powerful indicators that have been used in AFDs include ample circumstantial evidence, abundant less well established sources, obviousness/common knowledge/accepted wisdom, expert testimony [eg. "I am a marine biologist and I can confirm..."] etc.). But the purpose of an AFD is <i>not</i> to prove disputed individual assertions within an article, it is <i>only</i> to determine whether the subject of an article does or does not deserve an article; ie. whether it is notable. <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 15:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yo. Paradox is pretty important as they have released a major crack for windows vista which is comparable to the "devils own" cd key for windows XP. I have a feeling that people will refer to the crack as the paradox crack. thanks - n84<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 139.184.30.18 (<a href="../../../1/3/9/User_talk%7E139.184.30.18.html" title="User talk:139.184.30.18">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_139.184.30.18_f632.html" title="Special:Contributions/139.184.30.18">contribs</a>) 06:56, March 4, 2007.</small></li>

<li>The article serves it's purpose, it informs people who don't know what the warez group Paradox is as to what it is... I mean come on it's a warez group.. it can't really have much other than what it has it's not like their going to list the name and address of all of their members and what software they've cracked when etc. etc... <a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberwolff_eca4.html" title="User:Syberwolff">Syberwolff</a> 04:40, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thats kind of the issue. In order for content to exist here there has to be an assertion of notability. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, or every warez group, high school club, or otherwise would have an article here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 04:49, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unidentified user please calm down this is a civil discussion. Crossmr: Personally I would assume that "It was founded in 1990" and the vast variety of consoles would lend itself to their notability but if not I could do some research and find some. The only thing I ask is, and I don't know if you did this before-hand because I just looked at the article out of curiosity for the first time, but to mark it as needing varification, or as a stub or something (I'm still new on Wikipedia) instead of marking it for deletion. I believe every informative article should be welcome on Wikipedia as someone may be looking for information on Paradox and this is a good source (perhaps with a little more information, a great source.) And Vironex, he's saying that the article needs more sources citing how elaborate, and more evidence of how popular the group is.<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberwolff_eca4.html" title="User:Syberwolff">Syberwolff</a> 04:58, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because wikipedia has a threshold for inclusion and articles which do not meet that threshold get removed. So far the comments have been in the same vein as the article. A bunch of claims that this is a notable topic, yet nothing to back it up. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 05:01, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow, what the heck is the use of wikipedia if you can't get information on groups like Paradox? Crossmr, do your homework!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.74.86.5 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.74.86.5_b8c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.74.86.5">contribs</a>) 21:48, March 3, 2007.</small>
<ul>
<li>I'm not required to do any homework here. The article fails to establish the notability of the group with any references from reliable sources. Wikipedia is based on verifiability. Regardless of how big and important the group may be to the warez scene if that can't be verified it doesn't count for much on wikipedia.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 04:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Paradox is a pretty elaborate group. How exactly will anyone benefit from deleting this article? I think it'd be stupid <i>not</i> to have this article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's a web group with attitude. What makes them <i>more</i> than that?

<li>Well, they are notable for producing a crack for Vista that verifies the copy as genuine, allowing one to receive automatic updates. No other group to date has accomplished this feat, and it may also be impossible to "fix" given the nature of the crack. The following article describes this process, but does not directly contain content that violates copyright law.

<li>It has a similar format for posting stories. Digg isn't useful as a citation either. The fact of the matter is, this is presented in a blog format, and we have no idea who richard is, or why his site should be considered a verifiable source of information on this.

This article should be removed, not due to the fact that the information in the article is questionable at best I mean we don't edit out information about Nazis but there is no context to the article.

<li>Wow. This article even comes with an editorial about the deletion policy and an editorial about free speech. Now, before I cast my&#160;!vote, lemme tell you a little something about the free speech provisions of the first amendment to the United States Constitution: <b>THEY ONLY APPLY TO CONGRESS</b>. The amendment says that Congress shall not make laws abridging the freedom of press/speech/et cetera, and Wikipedia is not congress - ergo, this doesn't apply. In otherwords, there is no way that Wikipedia can even remotely possibly violate your constitutional rights to freedom of speech. It's simply impossible. Don't believe me? <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_7435.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">Look it up</a> and read the whole thing.

<li><b>Comment</b> One of Wikipedia's inherent biases, which I don't have a ready solution for, is that groups which operate far enough outside the mainstream that the legitimate press either can't or doesn't cover them, are at an inherent disadvantage. However, that doesn't change the fact that all information on this site must be verified. There's plenty of useful material out there that is simply not appropriate for Wikipedia. After all, this is an encyclopeida, not the aggregate of all human knowledge. If this group is written about later, they can have an article then. Groups like <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> existed for decades before there would have been enough good info or media coverage to write a Wikipedia article about them.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 17:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is insanity. Do NOT try to make this about "credible sources". You either have an agenda or are trying to cover up your initial screw-up that was suggesting to delete something YOU never heard about. This is a warez group, they don't use Hilton &amp; Knowles for press releases, they don't give interviews, they try to stay OUT of the media. There are articles and links quoted, but THEIR sources are not reliable enough? These high standards would get a lot religious articles in trouble. Can you please point out exactly what you are after? A glossy paper print of "Top of the pops of the warez scene"? I have no affiliation with Paradox nor the warez scene (other than seeing their stuff on my Amiga 15 years ago), but I do read on the web from time to time about them and other childhood heroes like Fairlight and Razor 1911. Ok, angry rant.Finishing off with a source. Here, mostly from the demo division, but also some cracktros: <a href="http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=156" class="external free" title="http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=156" rel="nofollow">http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=156</a> (Update: Replaced with better link).

<li>"What I'm after" is best summed up by the link I provided above to WP's policies on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

I had no hand in writing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">this policy</a>, but I agree with it and will enforce it. If you want a specific example of a warez article that meets these standards, <a href="../../../d/r/i/DrinkOrDie_e684.html" title="DrinkOrDie">DrinkOrDie</a> has sources such as the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Morning_Herald_ca72.html" title="Sydney Morning Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>, <a href="../../../z/d/n/ZDNet_977e.html" title="ZDNet">ZDNet</a>UK, a couple of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> articles, and a news release from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Justice_619c.html" title="United States Department of Justice">United States Department of Justice</a>. None of those sources alone would prove notability, but together they make a good case. More importantly, they provide verifiable information from publications with editorial review.

This place was createrd by people to share information; not by money grubbing commericalists who try to keep information secrete to protect their profits!!!

After you have done that tell me which side of this debate it sounds to you like it's describing. I would especially look really hard at numbers 2 and 3 on the list at the top. Not trying to be a dick here but honestly you are completely offbase throwing that one out there. I don't see syberwolf throwing alot of legal terminology your way, I don't see him being overly anal about technicalitys in the rules. Just debating a subject is not wikilawyering. Further a notable source has been provided, the APC mag Vista crack article. It establishes notability and is a reliable source. Not every single source in an article needs to establish notability. Other rational arguments have been made for the case of notability as well but you seem to be to caught up in the letter of the policys to have heard them. You are a human being not a RULEBOT5000 please start acting like it. No one needs to change any policy here and no one is suggesting that we do. Here's a qoute from <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">WP:CREEP</a> that you ought to take note of <i>"Our editors are volunteers, and are not obliged to follow procedure if they feel following them doesn't benefit the encyclopedia."</i> and another from <a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">WP:LAWYER</a> <i>"Wikipedia policies and procedures should be interpreted in a commonsensical way to achieve the purpose of the policy"</i> and another from <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> <i>"If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore them."</i>.

<li>Notice how once you prove to him that he's wrong he won't even admit it. I think that '<b>Abiding by the letter of a policy or guideline while violating its spirit;'</b> perfectly describes the current situation. He in interpreting the rules on notability by the letter and violating the spirit of wikipeda itself, to provide information that is truthful. All of the information on the group has been proven to be truthful in one way or another. I believe that the sheer volume of sources we have alone would also provide notability. We have in my oppinion showed many times over how notable this group is and in several different forms.

<li>I currently can't be arsed (due to the amount of material) but <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textfiles.com.html" title="Textfiles.com">textfiles.com</a> could be trawled for info about PARADOX' activities. A cursory Google search seems to return a number of articles related to the group <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?q=paradox+site:textfiles.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ie/search?q=paradox+site:textfiles.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (though not all of these hits are). <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 03:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This appears typical of Wikipedia, a valid article up for deletion on a whim. A few of my own articles have been erased for no good reason and this bad taste the Wikipediaphiles (similar to audiophiles but for Wiki) are leaving with internet users is doing nothing for the general feel good factor it had a year ago. On the topic of Paradox, I'm sure I could go and dig out a dusty CDR from 8 years ago, find the FILE_ID.DIZ file and the related .NFO, fire them up onto Geoshities and call that conclusive proof.

<li>You're being far too optimistic here. The people you're talking to have never heard of FILE_ID.DIZ and .NFO files. See my <a href="#inconvenienttruth" title="">original comment above</a>. <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 01:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Of course. Why explain why these files are relevant when you can insult other editors for not knowing instead?--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 01:09, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Additional thoughts: If there's an article for <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Sector_b630.html" title="Red Sector">Red Sector</a> (TRSI) (and for [later] single demoscene products such as <a href="../../../2E/k/k/.kkrieger.html" title=".kkrieger">.kkrieger</a>), then surely a group of PARADOX' stature deserve an article, too. (Again, it's obvious to me that the OP had no idea of the significance of the cracking scene in the history of IT, much less being actually qualified to assess the relative importance of the major players at the time.) <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 01:52, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>To Djrobgordon: I'm under no obligation to explain anything to you here. These are all voluntary contributions. If you want me to help you, try asking politely. If you don't want to do that, then you're welcome to pay me by the hour and I'll help you anytime you want. Also, is stating an obvious truth really an insult? I may not have been particularly polite above (that's a fair criticism), but I stand by my words insofar as I believe they were right on the money. Now obviously I could dig my heels in and not tell you anything, because you didn't exactly ask a friendly question, but anyway: There was significant overlap between the <a href="../../../b/b/s/BBS_e769.html" title="BBS">BBS</a> scene and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a>-<a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracker.html" title="Cracker">cracker</a>/<a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracktro.html" title="Cracktro">cracktro</a>/<a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demoscene</a>. Both FILE_ID.DIZ and *.NFO files frequently accompanied <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a> found on BBSes. Watch this documentary for details on the BBS scene: <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/</a> Apart from that, in the words of <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Olbermann_9105.html" title="Keith Olbermann">Keith Olbermann</a>: "Use teh Google!" If you did <a href="http://justfuckinggoogleit.com/" class="external free" title="http://justfuckinggoogleit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://justfuckinggoogleit.com/</a>, you would probably discover that there's this really nifty encyclopedia out there, which just happens to have articles on these subjects: <a href="../../../f/i/l/FILE_ID.DIZ_aa0e.html" title="FILE ID.DIZ">FILE_ID.DIZ</a>, <a href="../../../n/f/o/NFO_3fa0.html" title="NFO">NFO</a>/<a href="../../../2E/n/f/.nfo.html" title=".nfo">.nfo</a></li>

<dd>PS: If you want to look at NFO files these days, you have to use a <a href="../../../2E/n/f/.nfo.html#External_links" title=".nfo">viewer</a> that can properly display the good old <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_page_437.html" title="Code page 437">Code page 437</a> (which was <b>the</b> standard).

<li>First of all, your argument above is not a valid argument for inclusion, as per <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a>. Furthermore, the attitude is really, really not conducive here. Furthermore, none of this matters - unless you can produce independent, verifiable sources, your opinion about whether or not said piece of software is important is moot. It really doesn't matter what the nominator knows about cracking, wares, or whatever other topic your care to insult him over - all that matters is that this article does not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and no one has been able to bring it up to standards by providing the necessary sources.

<li>86.56.48.12: You're not helping me, you're helping the article. If you actually have an interest in keeping it, you have a better chance of changing someone's mind by explaining your point. The only purpose of your comment was to point out the ignorance of others, and that's not civil or productive. Do you honestly believe it added any substance to this debate? As to the above comment, those files would prove that this group exists, a point with which no editor has disagreed. The objections to this article are that it doesn't meet Wikipedia standards for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a> and that there isn't enough <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable information</a> to write an article. There are plenty of arguments above about why PARADOX is notable, but none about how it meets Wikipedia notability standards. There are plenty of sources, but almost none of them are usable to establish notability. I have no problem changing my vote on an AfD when the article comes into accordance with standards, but it hasn't happened here.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 02:41, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
