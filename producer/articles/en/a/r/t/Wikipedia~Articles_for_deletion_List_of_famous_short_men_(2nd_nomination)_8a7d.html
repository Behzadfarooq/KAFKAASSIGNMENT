<dd><b>Comment</b>. Isn't that the Pokemon defense?&#160;:) Presence of similar lists doesn't justify the presence of an article. Personally, those other lists should be AfD'd as well for being inherently POV. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 23:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a community that is largely ignored, and yet contributes heavily to the world in which we live. This article helps to shine light on the fact that men do contribute to society regardless of their short stature. However, the article should be limited to men 5'2" and shorter, as per the statistical global average. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_Star_ca1f.html" title="User:Wandering Star">Wandering Star</a> 03:52, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> on one hand, I'm insulted that the list goes up to 5'6 because hey, I'm not that short. But overall, this is a pretty harmless list which could be improved to be at the very least properly referenced. Also, all kidding aside, it should probably put the treshold low enough to make the list manageable (say 5'3),&#160;:-) <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 00:39, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and trim</b> per P.T, as I also find some encyclopedic value in the list, but it should be shortened (absolutely no pun intended, I promise) to a more manageable size- 5'5" really is not <i>that</i> short (this coming from a six-footer). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:54, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is essentially its third deletion vote in four months as the September <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_famous_tall_men_%282nd_nomination%29_64c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of famous tall men (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of famous tall men (2nd nomination)</a> added it in. Limit it to a shorter height if needed, but there are certainly men whose notable relates to their height. Maybe there shouldn't be, but that's not something for us to judge.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 07:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or move and trim</b> Honestly, "short" is subjective. Maybe rename and trim the list to something like "List of men famous for being short" or something like that. As it is, the list goes on to 5'6", which is already average height where I come from. Right now, it seems to read like a "List of famous people by height up to 5'6" Looking at the list, I have never heard of Bono or Woody Allen being as famous as they are for being "short". At this rate of subjectivity, we could have something like a List of famous ugly people. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 21:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Lists of people based solely on a personal chracteristic appears pointless, of only subjective value and therefore unencyclopedic. List of people famous for being tall/short might be worthwhile.

<li><b>Delete</b> along with articles mentioned by WJBscribe above. If considering keep, please give me definitions of "short" and "tall" - the articles are inherently POV as "short" and "tall" are subjective (POV) values. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:JobjÃ¶rn">JobjÃ¶rn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:JobjÃ¶rn">Talk</a> Â° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/JobjÃ¶rn">contribs</a>) 19:25, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well one is "incorporating elements of general encyclopedias, specialized encyclopedias, and almanacs." Almanacs do have lists, in fact almanacs are largely made up of lists. I'm not sure any almanac would have a list of short people, but it doesn't seem entirely out of bounds of possibility.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.
