<li>Vote changed to <b>Weak Delete</b> per Girolamo Savonarola's information below.

<li><b>Comment</b> - correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it extremely faux pas to write a new article about yourself, notability regardless?

<li><b>Delete</b> After reading the results of Girolamo's careful research (thanks!), I'll change my vote to delete.

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, based on the following points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Very sizable percentage of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vox_melba_cylinders_48e5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vox melba cylinders">user contributions</a> are vanity edits, including <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_John_Steven_Lasher_6c68.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/John Steven Lasher">all links back</a> to this article.</li>
<li>Blatant disregard for vanity guidelines as discussed on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a> (specifically under "How Not to Be a Spammer" point number <i><b>one</b></i>), <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>, and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines</a>. Especially notable in the light of the fact that he already had a vanity article, Vox Melba Mastering Labs, speedily deleted for this reason and engaged in a vigorous debate with several editors wherein these policy guidelines were linked and thoroughly explained to him. Nonetheless, he has added an article about himself shortly since then.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Just to clarify for those who have asked above, I bring these points up merely to show that a) the user is familiar with these policies and encountered them before, and b) continues to make a substantial number of edits whose main or only purpose is to highlight himself and his work. Sure the two together are relevant? It's certainly not vandalism, but were this to continue like this substantially longer, it would. I'm concerned, is what. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 23:49, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Non-notability in regard to the majority of the article - while I have no doubt that he facilitated the commercial availability of classic movie soundtracks, I certainly wouldn't consider such a producer any more or less notable than someone who produces, say, the budget classical music CDs for <a href="../../../n/a/x/Naxos_%28record_label%29.html" title="Naxos (record label)">Naxos</a>, or an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assistant_director.html" title="Assistant director">assistant director</a> who has worked on big Hollywood films for several years. Its interesting work involving other notable things and people, but co-relation with such things does not confer notability in and of itself. (Were that the case, you could argue the every name ever listed in a playbill, liner notes, or end credits of any creative work counts as a notable entry.) As for the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Herrmann_ebe6.html" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> info, it is uncited and has a high probability of conflation as it is an autobiographical article.</li>
<li>All of the Vox info relates to companies and divisions founded and run by John Lasher. A quick search on the internet confirms that he runs them in conjunction with the man responsible for his bio on his IMDb page. Furthermore, it seems as though the company was only recently started, which again smells awfully like self-promotional ad-spam. While it is marginally interesting and notable, I believe it would better be served by a brief mention and link in the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonograph_cylinder.html" title="Phonograph cylinder">phonograph cylinder</a> article. Which Mr. Lasher has already done.</li>
<li>The Kinopanorama info, similarly, is somewhat interesting, but of his work, it's been barely seen and by his own admission, only one of his three films in this format has been fully completed or screened en-masse. Again, this would be far more appropriately merged as brief mentions in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinopanorama.html" title="Kinopanorama">Kinopanorama</a> article. Which, again, Mr. Lasher has already done.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I simply don't think that the <b>creation</b> of an autobiographical article is proper in any regard, nor do I think that Mr. Lasher qualifies as an encyclopedic subject at the moment. I am willing to concede the latter point, but only if someone other than Mr. Lasher or his associates feels fit to create such an article. IMHO, the case here is very cut and dry and is about vanity and disregard for the policies and guidelines. I think that Mr. Lasher does interesting work and has worked with interesting people, but this alone is hardly enough to warrant an encyclopedia article written by someone else, much less himself.

<li>I hereby demand that you <b>delete</b> this page about me without further ado. I have read the comments by each of you and am totally disgusted by many of the comments therein. As far as I am concerned, most of you have nothing better to do than to argue amongst yourselves. Other that the moderator, who seems to have some sort of grip on each of you, none of you have any knowledge of my 32-years work in the music and film industries. Obviously none of you have purchased any one of the fifty recordings produced by me, or, for that matter, seen either of the two Kinopanorama films, one of which you deleted from Wikipedia. Lastly, to those of you who stated that IMDB is a vanity site I am sure there administrators would not take kindly to your comments. Entries at IMDB are vetted for authenticity, and only approved after an appropriate investigation is conducted.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, simple fact is, an IMDB entry is no guarantee of meeting Wikipedia's notability guidelines. Being able to back up information with reliable sources does. Assuming you actually are Mr. Lasher, I'm sure you could provide independent sourcing (ie, not written by Mr. Sefton-Parke), and a complete discography for the article, and make it potentially worth keeping, instead of throwing a tantrum. The Hotmail address does not lend much credibility, especially when IMDB and other sites have a different email address listed. -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 00:01, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
