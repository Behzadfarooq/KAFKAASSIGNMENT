<p>Contested prod with the edit comment of 'notable'. This article is a biography where the only claim to notability is the title, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baronet.html" title="Baronet">Baronet</a>. The title, although 'it is a hereditary honour', it 'is not a peerage and has never entitled the holder to a seat in the House of Lords'. This means that the title has no claim to notability based on heridtary right of input to the British Parliamentary or legal systems. So, whilst the first holder of the title may have (had) a claim to notability through the title, all subsequent holders claim to notability based on the title is that a family member may have been notable. Long established consensus is that 'notability cannot gained from relationship' and 'Wikipedia is not a genealogical database'. As the article offers no other claims to notability the subject fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and as the article offers no sources per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> it also fails policy. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 15:43, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This page is a vanity page. Sir Keith Arbuthnot has no notability bar his hereditary title. It's quite clearly a vanity page. Just because some Baronets are notable doesn't mean this particular chap is. Florence Nightingale, for example, was notable - but that doesn't automatically mean wee Jeanie from the Southern General is notable because she happens to be a nurse also. No offence to nurses, by the way, first example that came to mind. Vanity page, get it off. T.Ball.CFC 00:55 13 March 2007 (GMT)</dd>

Inheriting the title of Baron or Baronet is not in itself noteworthy and therefore fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and even the defunct proposal of <a href="../../../n/o/b/WP%7ENOBLE_f60f.html" title="WP:NOBLE">WP:NOBLE</a>. I will look at this again in a few days before I&#160;!vote but unless some other form of notability can be proven that does not relate to simply holding one or more honorary titles then I am leaning towards delete. Also adding "strong keep" as two editor have done above on the basis that this person is a Baron is in my opinion showing strong signing of POV rather than basing&#160;!votes on wiki policy.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 17:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This has nothing to do with being "honourary", which is a word meaningless in this concept. Of couse editors have to express PoV here, without a point of view as to whether the article should be kept it would be impossible to comment at all! --<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounter-revolutionary_958f.html" title="User:Counter-revolutionary">Counter-revolutionary</a> 17:47, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Whatever you think about the British honours system (and I sense that some contributors to this discussion are against it: I confess I myself find it significantly batty and, on a serious note, potentially corrupting) it is a part of public life in the UK that seems to interest plenty of folks in UK and anglophone places which used to be 'owned' by UK. These guys enjoy disproportionate influence to the irritation of some and the delight (presumably) of others, but wiki is (I hope) concerned with facts much more than with reactions to facts (until of course those reactions become facts in their own right: but that's an extract from another discussion). If those people who buy and consult Burke's and its ilk in libraries and record offices google their interest on-line, it would be nice for wiki to be in the 'market' for their 'e-custom'. So please keep it. But please, someone who knows, expand it. The guy must have done something interesting since leaving uni, and if he was really such a blushing violet he surely would not have let them give him an entry in Who's Who.

<li><b>Comment</b> &gt;1 000 minor British aristocrats automatically notable? Clearly not. The fact that they appear in widely distributed works of reference (Burke's, Who's Who...) suggests that someone somewhere thinks them <i>potentially</i> notable. The fact that those works of reference are provided for consultation in libraries in UK and (especially) those corners of the Anglosphere where for good and bad reasons many people have a warm fuzzy feeling for British tradition (<i>ok, I'm thinking of most of Canada outside of Quebec, but I think it also applies elsewhere</i>) suggests either that the acquisiton policies of those libraries are wrong or else that people are interested. Should they be interested? Is that a question for us to ask? Should all &gt;1 000 baronets get a wiki article? Only if a wiki contributor (who is also, presumably, a more than averagely committed wiki reader) bothers to write one. Several people seem to have bothered to contribute to the article on Arbuthnot, tho I agree that no one seems to have found anything very compelling to write about him. But that's my judgement (and I guess yours). <i>Will</i> all &gt;1 000 baronets get a wiki article? Same answer: seems unlikely. That applies across all categories: there are thousands of academics who deserve a wiki article. Some get them: some don't. Ditto medieval bishops. Ditto very small towns in Ohio. There is a wiki constituency who think Arbuthnot is interesting: we disagree. Maybe we disagree about other much more important issues about which we both feel much more passionately: I hope we are not going to move from that to seek to restrict one another's rights to express our opinion. The web offers huge possibilities for opening up knowledge: it's impossible to know which bits of knowledge will be most valued in five or fifty years time. But the troubling aspect is the way that by commonising our knowledge database, the web is actually being used to try and impose sets of politically convenient values on the rest of us. I think that this does not lie comfortably with the wiki mind-set. Or am I wrong about the wiki mindset? Ah, well...

<li><b>Comment</b>, out of interest I went and looked at a copy of Who's Who 2007 and Debretts just to see what level of depth it goes into on people. Firstly Debrett's - this is 1,797 pages - with approximately 13 entries per page and the Sir Keith Arbutnott entry does not state anything notable about him only when he was born and the names of his family members.</li>

<dd>Who's Who - this is pretty much the same book as far as I can see just with even more people, the UK edition alone is 2,529 pages long this year and it has on average 16 people listings or referral's per page - you do the math on the amount of people in it then. Each page is split into two columns with 100 lines per column so that 200 lines per page (over half a million lines in the book). The entry for this person is 6 lines long in one column - that includes a line for his name and address of where they live - the other four lines include where he went to school and the names of his family members inc. ex. wife. In fact the article is almost word for word what is the article except it has no crest shown and it uses abbreviations for much of the textile. There is no mention of anything notable that he achieved except that he went to university. Both entries in both books are identical as far as I can see - are they connected in some way or compiled in the same way?</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: like it or not, being a baronet is notable in itself in Great Britain. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a <i>guideline</i> only, and the template on that page specifically states: "it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception." The nominator of this AfD states although "it is a hereditary honour, it 'is not a peerage and has never entitled the holder to a seat in the House of Lords'. This means that the title has no claim to notability based on hereditary right of input to the British Parliamentary or legal systems." He is wrong in this opinion because all hereditary titles in Britain are notable. Today, 2007, no member of the peerage is <i>entitled</i> to a seat in the House of Lords. The Baronetage is always listed along with the Peerage in all publications and apart from the old right of a seat in The House, they are regarded as both noble and part of the titled aristocracy. Today they are on an entirely level playing field with the peerage. No member of the peerage or baronetcies has ever had "a hereditary right of input in the British legal systems", unless it was passing legislation. This baronet appears in <i>Debrett's Distinguished People of Today</i>, the editors of which contend, in an article in <i>The Guardian</i> (6 Feb 89), contains "the most distinguished people in the country - all those listed truly deserve their place".</li>

<p>I would also contend that deleting biography stubs like this goes against the ethos of the Wikipedia Baronetcies project and will upset the lineage.

<li><b>Keep</b> It appears, in the main, that the 'deleters' do not give much importance to titles inherited from the past whereas the 'keepers' wish to perpetuate our British history. An encyclopedia is to colate and impart knowledge and if it is with data on the past it should be encouraged and supported as: it is our past which forges our future.

<li>To the admin closing this AfD, please note a number of editors who have&#160;!voted on this&#160;!vote have been involved in vote canvassing and now what another administrator has called “lock step” voting. Over the past months a number of editors have been accused of&#160;!voting on the basis of what “they like” rather than using the rationale of wiki policies. A number of central users such as <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounter-revolutionary_958f.html" title="User:Counter-revolutionary">Counter-revolutionary</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> but at times have also included <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFraslet_47a7.html" title="User:Fraslet">Fraslet</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="../../../w/e/g/User%7EWeggie_3196.html" title="User:Weggie">Weggie</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a> and also El chulito and <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInthegloaming_5b21.html" title="User:Inthegloaming">Inthegloaming</a> who I very strongly suspect are/were socks.</li>

<p>All of the above can by generally stated as voting within the anti <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_republican.html" title="Irish republican">Irish republican</a> and pro <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionist.html" title="Unionist">unionist</a>/ <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchist.html" title="Monarchist">monarchist</a>.</p>

<p>Since then there has been what I consider a systematic abuse of the AfD system with a number of a same editors arriving at an AfD on a subject which they either like or dislike and voting to delete or keep on POV rather then wiki policy. The first AfD that occur was –</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_James_McDade_8813.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James McDade">James McDade AfD</a> Nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a>. Result – ‘’’Keep’’’ 13 votes to Keep and 1 to Delete – that vote by as <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> – therefore 100% of the delete&#160;!votes from “the group”.</p>
<p>Then [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gerard_Montgomery|Gerard" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gerard_Montgomery|Gerard" rel="nofollow">Montgomery</a>] – this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. However <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> ended the AfD because of a source that stated that Montgomery was involved in a murder.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Antoine_MacGiolla_Bhrighde_2d9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Antoine MacGiolla Bhrighde">Antoine MacGiolla Bhrighde AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 7 votes and Delete 7 votes – 5 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 71% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Charles_Breslin_62c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charles Breslin">Charles Breslin AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 4 votes – 2 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_McGartland_98f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin McGartland">Martin McGartland AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Keep</b>, Keep 10 votes and Delete 1 votes – that of Astrotrains</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Diarmuid_O%27Neill_6646.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Diarmuid O'Neill">Diarmuid O’Neill AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>No consensus</b>, This is where the real vote staking operation started and canvassing came into effect. Keep 20 votes and Delete 10 votes – 5 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept. Note the first eight&#160;!votes were to Keep and that is when the canvassing started and since then there has been almost total lock step.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Charles_Breslin_62c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charles Breslin">Charles Breslin AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 4 votes – 2 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then we had a AfD of a biography relating to a member of the “British nobility”. This was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot" class="extiw" title="wikipediawikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot">Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 9 votes – 3 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 75% of the votes to keep from “the group” in an article that was deleted</p>
<p>Again back to an Irish republican and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_McCaughey_7c96.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin McCaughey">Martin_McCaughey AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Keep</b>, Keep 16 votes and Delete 12 votes – 7 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 58% of the votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Similar behaviour and calls for deletion in an number of AfD’s of members of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_IRA_East_Tyrone_Brigade_1031.html" title="Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade">Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade</a> such as the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tony_Gormley_6141.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tony Gormley">Tony Gormley AfD</a> – bios of each of those that were merged not deleted can be seen on the of the bottom of the page that they were merged to.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: What a scandalous load of rubbish. So every time the same editors appear on an AfD they are all in collusion or have been canvassing?

It is being argued that the Baronetcy in itself is the notable feature, so that should be the article and the numbered Baronets can be integrated in it.

The present policy just creates numerous short articles with no real information in them, apart from a directory listing of offspring.

<li><b>Keep</b>: <i>Who’s Who</i>, published annually since 1849 and the first biographical book of its kind, is among the world’s most recognised and respected works of reference. The UK Who's Who is the mother of all works on notability. The phrase 'Who's Who of' has passed into the English language due to this publication, and all the other biographical works arond the world can trace their ancestry to it. There are thousands of articles on Wikipedia about people who would be instantly rejected for inclusion by the <i>Who's Who</i> selection board. <i>Who's Who</i> is the ultimate reference concerning <b>notability</b>. To say no references concerning notability have been provided is ridiculous. Invariably when you see politicians, artists, writers being interviewed on television in front of their bookcase you see the big red copy of <i>Who's Who</i> sitting there. Concerning inaccurate comments above, a baronetcy is not a species of Knighthood because a baronet outranks all knights except <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_the_Garter_d5f7.html" title="Knights of the Garter">Knights of the Garter</a>, so not being a species of knighthood is a reflection of the importance of the rank rather than otherwise. Anyone who is in <i>Who's Who</i> has the ultimate reference concerning notability. It trumps all others by an order of magnitude. People may not like it, but thats the way the world is. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 09:23, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I see absolutely no reason why Wikipedia should defer to another publication's decisions on notability, however well-known. If a subject doesn't meet WP notability criteria, there's no way that "being in Who's Who" should be able to save them. Also, Who's Who contains some pretty obscure people. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 11:09, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> but WP's primary notability criterion <i>is</i> being mentioned in other reputable publications; this makes your argument essentially meaningless. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 22:52, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Because Wikipedia is about the real world. Not about some imaginary world like second life. Let's take the example of popular music musicians. Everyone with a top 40 hit seems entitled to a page on Wikipedia. How many people is that 30,000 probably, but for the sake of argument let's say 3000. Well about 30 pop stars make it into <i>Who's Who</i>. So for <i>Who's Who</i> the criteria for inclusion are two orders of magnitude tougher. The wikipedia criteria are "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered" - thats WHY you should 'defer' to the most widely accepted reference on notability in the UK. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 11:24, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The fact there are only 30 pop artists in Who's Who, but thousands of minor members of the nobility, proves my point, in that Who's Who necessarily has inbuilt POV. It also includes many figures in industry, finance, academia etc. who would also fail Wikipedia notability guidelines. An example: the front page of <a href="http://www.ukwhoswho.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ukwhoswho.com/" rel="nofollow">Who's Who website</a> gives some people from the publication who have birthdays today.

<li><b>Comment</b> The inbuilt POV of Who's Who is that of mainstream UK society. That is why people shell out £125 a copy for it and it is on the bookshelf of almost every politician, judge, journalist, writer, artist etc in the UK. Anyone can be nominated in the UK too. You can even nominate yourself, but nomination is a very different matter to inclusion. If your Worldview/POV is restricted to music and football, then that's fine, trying to impose that worldview on other's isn't fine. There are I think 28,000 people in Who's Who out of a population of sixty million. Save up and buy a copy, or go to your Library. Wikipedia is not a working class revolutionary movement, so reflecting the views of mainstream society is perfectly acceptable. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 13:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but the people in Who's Who do not in any way, shape or form represent "mainstream British society". I'm not arguing at all that musicians or footballers are necessarily more or less notable than minor nobility, but the former have their own criteria for inclusion on Wikipedia (see many, many previous AfDs) and so should the latter. Incidentally, your use of the phrase "working class revolutionary movement" indicates that you are trying to impose your own POV on this AfD. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 13:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> They represent the mainstream consensus on notability. Obviously they are not mainstream themselves, otherwise two thirds of the populaton would be in there. I am sorry if I offended you, I was simply trying to point out that your worldview may have been influenced by your environment. You should be very proud of your background, while accepting that it may have given you a perspective not shared by all. Also Baronets are the sixth rung of the Nobiles Majores. They are not minor. We don't really have minor nobility in the UK. Unlike the continent where they do have bucketfuls of aristocrats. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 14:51, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

For example, all members of the English, Scottish, British and United Kingdom Peerage and Baronetage are included, however minor their achievements, but many better-known people, such as some leading footballers, are not. Occasional problems arise with the publication's reliability as a reference source, because the entries are compiled from questionnaires returned to the publisher by the featured subjects.

<li><b>Keep</b> pending a wider debate on notability as it applies to Baronets. To my mind, notability of people does not just come from their own actions; it also comes from their position in life, which may not have been earned but which is there nonetheless. The fact that a significant number of people consider Baronets to be worthy of record and study is a mark of notability, whether or not others disagree.

<li>Those arguments are worse than weak, they are wrong. Most Barons and other peers do NOT get seats in the upper houses of parliament. Both peers and baronets have to have their claims verified by the UK Government home office, upon being proven their are entered on the Roll Of Peers or Baronets, and take their rank in UK Society according to the order of precedence which is enshrined in law. If the UK were like the Italian Republic where there is no government verification or recognition of titles or their rank then you would have a point, as it is please research your statements. If you are using length of service on Wikipedia as a mark of importance, then you can't exactly deny the British aristocracy their importance in English society can you. As Orwell pointed out in Animal Farm, you can't get rid of elitism, you can only replace one form with another. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 11:17, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> AnnabelBuxton is not quite right here. Until 1999, Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom <i>were</i> automatically eligible for a seat in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, subject only to a) "proving" their claim to the title, and b) applying for a "writ of summons" (which is a purely formal step). As Annabel correctly notes, Baronets are also subject to the requirement to prove their claims, and a baronetcy does not make a person eligible for a seat in the House of Lords. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 18:04, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - God bless all here. Some observations on three fronts. <b>First</b>, Wikipedia itself. It has become voluminous, but its quality does not approach its size. Rather like a cyberspace Wal-Mart. Some of the articles are wrong, and there are limits to the iterative/reiterative process. The beast grows, but it may not be improving. <b>Second</b>, the editing. Nuttah68 gives his game away in his first several words. “Contested prod with the edit comment of ‘notable’.” Is this a frank admission of religious prejudice or what? After that sterling intro, he lapses into a jarring imitation of a Prussian lawyer examining precedents and logic. Come on, Nuttah, you don’t care about rules and practice; you want to bloody a “prod” nose. On that last point, I happen to agree with you. I’d like to start with Rowan Williams. Perhaps we could discuss our shared views in a less public venue. Whatever our shared opinions, neither of us is justified in acting on them and then attempting to hide them behind rules which, however hard one tries, do not come in one size that fits all. Perhaps you and I – and Vintagekits – could work together on a similar censorship campaign, but one that’s all to the public good. (I, too, find I can be self-righteous when my prejudices and actions coincide, in the interest of rightness as I see it.) As I mentioned above, Wikipedia is no source, and at least one university history department has banned its use. It has some articles that are so erroneous as to be hilariously funny. One of these is entitled “Cassiques.” Take a look at it. It contains the names of people that never existed. It also contains a number of Ascendancy prods from the years shortly after the Boyne. The Church of Ireland Arthur family from Limerick. The Church of Ireland Bayly family from Ballinaclough. Honored (<i>allegedly</i>, in the Arthur case: one of the article's many errors) by the English power structure. Let’s get rid of that article. There are excellent, uncontroversial reasons for doing so. And there’s also the frisson of prodding a prod. <b>Third</b>, notability. As for Keith A., I find it notable that he married and then had only three children. One or more of the participating editors may have had acknowledged children out of wedlock, and others may have so many as to make the local pastor look askance. Marriage and a manageable number of legitimate children. That was ho-hum in the 1950s. Surely worth a headline today in <i>News of the World</i>. But most of all, I put great store by what my eyes tell me: he is notable enough to be targeted by targeters who have a long history of targeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep the article:</p>
<p>1. The move to delete Keith is based both on his rank and and on the rank prejudice of the would-be censor(s). 2. The article, although brief, appears accurate. A special place in the Wikipedia pantheon. 3. There are bigger fish to fry.<br />
For the conspiracy theorists among us. This is my first contribution to the Wiki process under any name. I do not know Keith. But I am an American, and we don’t stand too much on ceremony. At the same time, this country has a long agricultural tradition. Tunnah, I can smell fertilizer an ocean away.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, after some hesitation. This is a difficult issue: it is clear from the discussions about the proposed <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28royalty%29_f89d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)">Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)</a> guidelines that there is cuurently no consensus either way about whether hereditary nobility itself confers a presumption of notability.<br />
Some of the arguments in this AFD discussion appear to me to be concerning themselves with whether people approve or disapprove of the system of honours and nobility. That's irrelevant: I'm sure that all of us can pints to huge swathes of Wikipedia which cover things we dislike, disapprove of, or think are over-rated.<br />
Other parts of the discussion appear to be a re-run of the arguments which were (or should have been) made wrt to the rejected guideline. I think it would have been useful to have some guideline, whatever it said, to avoid re-inventing the wheel each time this issue arises; but there isn't one, and there's no point proceeding as if we are devising a guideline on either heredity or nobility. Without a special guideline we have to fall back to assessing <i>this particular article</i> under <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.<br />
It seems to me that the 8th Baronet here is a marginal case wrt to <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>: numerous entries in works on nobility and a Who's Who entry seem to me to go a long way to meeting <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, but without unambiguously getting there. The discussion above includes well-reasoned arguments both for against this baronet meeting <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>.<br />
As to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I can't find anything there which suggests that this is a special case.<br />
However, I am persuaded by the arguments above by Charles01: "Whatever you think about the British honours system (... I myself find it significantly batty and, on a serious note, potentially corrupting) it is a part of public life in the UK that seems to interest plenty of folks in UK and anglophone places which used to be 'owned' by UK. These guys enjoy disproportionate influence".<br />
That's what clinches it for me: the fact of being the latest title-holder in a family which includes several notable people and apperas to somewhat influential. However, I don't think that <i>all</i> baronets pass that test: not all families of baronets have anyone notable, and plenty of baronetcies were sold by <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maundy_Gregory_b57d.html" title="Maundy Gregory">Maundy Gregory</a> or awarded to otherwise obscure people who happened to find favour with the government of the day. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 20:38, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, provisionally per WP:BIO: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability." At the very, very least, this baronet has received non-substantial coverage from a wide multitude of independent sources, making him notable. That shouldn't be debatable. In the wider view, to address the concerns of folks supporting the deletion of this article, I'd say I support keeping articles like this until policy is seriously considered and clarified with respect to baronets along predictable and rational lines. We shouldn't just toss articles out because there isn't any specific policy that positively establishes their notability right now. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesocialistesq_d715.html" title="User:Thesocialistesq">-- Thesocialistesq/M.Lesocialiste</a> 21:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, It is patently not - as stated above, I went and looked at a copy of Who's Who 2007 and Debretts just to see what level of depth it goes into on people. Firstly Debrett's - this is 1,797 pages - with approximately 13 entries per page and the Sir Keith Arbutnott entry does not state anything notable about him only when he was born and the names of his family members.</li>

<dd>Who's Who - this is pretty much the same book as far as I can see just with even more people, the UK edition alone is 2,529 pages long this year and it has on average 16 people listings or referral's per page - you do the math on the amount of people in it then. Each page is split into two columns with 100 lines per column so that 200 lines per page (over half a million lines in the book). The entry for this person is 6 lines long in one column - that includes a line for his name and address of where they live - the other four lines include where he went to school and the names of his family members inc. ex. wife. In fact the article is almost word for word what is the article except it has no crest shown and it uses abbreviations for much of the textile. There is no mention of anything notable that he achieved except that he went to university. Both entries in both books are identical as far as I can see - are they connected in some way or compiled in the same way?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I know, you said that but its not especially as each of the 40,000 entrant fills out their own questionaire and effectively writes their own entry - there is no depth of coverage and in this case no claim of notability within the entry and therefore an entry in a book of listing is not enough for pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> - why dont we just have an articles on everyone in the phonebook!--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 13:45, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Let us agree to differ on this matter. I wonder how many articles there are in Wikipedia on living British people. Rather more than 40,000 perhaps. <a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc1dmn_8029.html" title="User:Pc1dmn">-- roundhouse</a> 14:07, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Agree to disagree on what? Are you saying that there is a depth of covering in Who's who? Are you saying that all 40,000 people in the Who's who listing get automatic notability on wiki, if so please show me where it states that in Wilipolicy? we have a lot more than 40,000 Bios - and they must all comply with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>/<a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> or they should be deleted.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 14:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>:It seems to me that the (presumably unconcious) atavistic tribalism in which many of the contributions here are marinated is a much more fascinating, and also a much more serious subject than the issue of whether one fellow's favourite baronet is more or less deserving of an article than another fellow's favourite singer. Many wiki readers have not grown up in the heroic traditions of either Irish Republicanism or of British Imperialism, and would be thoroughly baffled by the passions stirred here. You thought Irish Republicanism and British Imperialism were off topic for this discussion? Take another look. There are plenty of honourable traditions that have from time to time been rendered scurrilous by the atrocities perpetrated in their names. Time may lead to more balance. But how many centuries will pass before an objective viewpoint is widely accepted concerning the crusading movements formally launched outside Clermont in 1095? Wikipedia is about knowledge. Both the honourable bits and the scurrilous bits deserve to be known: you can agree on that even before you will agree over which are which . If the more animated of the protagonists participating here think they will convert each other to one another's cause, then I think that they are doing whatever it is they are doing into the wind. And they must surely know it already. Wiki is trying to build knowledge: where it succeeds in that, it is to be commended. Excluding articles on 'people we don't like' (whether from personal knowledge or simply because we are riled by the curious names by which they wish to be known) reduces the overall bank of knowledge available and thereby renders more suspect that knowledge which remains uncensored. You will not convert your most committed opponents to your cause, least of all by haranguing them and seeking to exclude articles on matters that interest them. But you might at least enhance your own case to the unpersuaded by devoting your undoubted talents to maximising the information (information = facts) available on the causes about which you feel most positively. I guess that is what underlies my own instinct (?prejudice) in favour of retaining and improving articles about ... almost anything that anyone has bothered to write about in cases of stated doubt. So yes, my ‘keep’ vote is to be construed as a vote for knowledge and not as a vote for the British Empire, a subject on which my further views are mercifully out of scope.</p>
<p>There also seems to be a move afoot to encourage selective quoting of statements of wiki policy in support of one's viewpoint in this discussion. I forgot every wiki-policy I ever read so just I took another look. Here are a few quotable bits I found I agreed with after thirty seconds of clicking:</p>
<p><i>“Articles that can be improved should be edited or tagged, not nominated for deletion.”</i></p>
<p><i>“…but ...in some cases, repeated attempts to have an article deleted may even be considered disruptive. <b>If in doubt, don't delete.”</b></i></p>
<p><i>“Treating others with respect is key to collaborating effectively in building an encyclopedia.”</i></p>
<p>I had wondered, as these discussions unfolded, whether I was indeed guilty of having misconstrued the wiki mind-set. It may be so: I certainly don't expect to acquire an intimate knowledge of all the wiki policies any time soon. But it does (still) seem to me that the wiki mind-set prefers wider and deeper knowledge over opinion and censorship. When in doubt, please share the facts with the rest of us and let the facts build your case, especially where you find the facts offensive: you may gather more converts than you'd expected. As for Sir Keith Arbuthnot, I still wish that someone somewhere would find something more interesting to write about him.</p>
<p>For better or worse, I fear I may have alienated anyone else who feels strongly enough about matters thrown up by this article to have participated in the discussion about it. But in the event that you're still there, thank you for reading this.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles01_1cdb.html" title="User:Charles01">Charles01</a> 14:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, this is not an issue of POV or of keeping knowledge away from people (censorship if you wish) this is an issue of notability. You stated in your keep&#160;!vote "The guy must have done something interesting since leaving uni" or else he wouldnt be in Who's who. There are a few things are wrong with that 1. That is not a strong reason to keep and it not based on wiki policy 2. he hasnt done anything noteworthy since uni (or at least nothing is stated about this is the article) 3. Who's who automatically gives a listing to Peers and Baronets if they reutrn their questionaire, so its not on merit and Wiki does not apply the same critieria 4. Wiki is not a crystal ball, we cannot assume that he must have done something or will do something or note if there is no proof.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 14:31, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, that <i>is</i> based on wikipedia policy: <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> states that any subject that's discussed by multiple independent reliable sources is notable. Who's Who and Debretts are independent reliable sources.
