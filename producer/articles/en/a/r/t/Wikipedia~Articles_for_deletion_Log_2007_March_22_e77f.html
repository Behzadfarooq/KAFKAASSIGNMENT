You bring up a good point, though. We do have some articles which are merely about words, rather than about subjects.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Lombardesque "crooked" block of Vermont Street is considered a hidden treasure of San Francisco that many tourists don't know about. There was even a segment on the television show "Bay Area Backroads," hosted by <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_McConnell_e761.html" title="Doug McConnell">Doug McConnell</a>, recently that specifically documented the twistiness of Vermont Street, where the host actually filmed a driven outing there. A bay area resident myself, I have heard time and time again how it could even be more crooked than Lombard Street. After reviewing Google Maps, it most certainly is at least AS CROOKED as <a href="../../../l/o/m/Lombard_Street%2C_San_Francisco_bceb.html" title="Lombard Street, San Francisco">Lombard Street</a>, just in a lesser known part of town. There are many hills in San Fran, but only Lombard and Vermont offer the curved switchbacks.

<p>The result was <b>Speedy keep</b> by me. The AfD was prompted by concerns about copyright violation (and the text read like <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">VSCA</a> as well). Wafulz has deleted the copyrighted text. Therefore the reason for nomination is gone. The article that remains is surely keepable in its own right. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richard Cavell</a> 03:06, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No reason given for deletion.

<p>This series of article presents an extreme amount of undue weight to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starcraft.html" title="Starcraft">Starcraft</a>. They basically outline the story of Starcraft on a level-by-level, mission-by-mission scope, which is wholly unnecessary. Plot summaries must be succinct and kept as small as possible to provide major relevant details- not to detail every piece of a campaign. I believe the main articles <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starcraft.html" title="Starcraft">Starcraft</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Starcraft%7E_Brood_War_d685.html" title="Starcraft: Brood War">Starcraft: Brood War</a> do a fine job as is summarizing the storyline- per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT #7</a>, we should not simply be regurgitating plot summaries of a popular video game. While I usually hate bundling deletions, I feel these are all necessary:</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> I think one page on the Starcraft Storyline overall would be appropriate, given that with the creation of additional works in the series, it could be helpful to cover the otherwise acceptable material in one location. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:30, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that article would do nothing other than serve as plot summary of overly great detail. The scale of the articles is a bit misleading- there are only two video games being involved here, and they don't need such a microscopic level of detail. Right now, the summaries in their articles seem sufficient. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 02:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I think part of the problem is that the article isn't covering the other Starcraft works. Believe it or not, Blizzard has commissioned authors to write novels set in the Starcraft universe. Each of which has its own article written pretty closely to the Episode articles you're pointing at. <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_universe_92ff.html" title="StarCraft universe">see here</a>. I think I'd prefer something that covered the scope of the works in one article, though perhaps with a lot of restyling to try to bring things into a more suitable form. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The thing is, these articles don't cover anything except for the in-game campaigns. No novels, no board games, no comics, nothing. It's strictly a rehashing of every level and bonus mission of the video game. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what? I already said there may need to be a lot of restyling to bring these things into a more suitable form. I am not disagreeing with you that there is some cleanup necessary. I do think, however, the subject itself could be appropriately covered. Given that there's nothing obviously wrong about these pages, I don't see deletion is a necessary step. Editing and cleanup can fix things. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It seems you are under the impression that I'm disagreeing with that particular concern? I am not. However, I am saying something which you seem to be missing. I am saying that because the Starcraft universe has expanded beyond the video game, because there are stories that are part of a cohesive whole, it might be worth considering an article connecting the various materials. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:38, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What you're suggesting isn't a merge though- it's creating an entirely new article. These articles don't incorporate anything other than the missions/bonus missions (ie, they don't cover the game's universe- just the game itself). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 00:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(De-indenting somewhat). Yes, it would be a substantially different article than what's present now, certainly, but I do think the article name itself is fine, and that the content from the existing articles could be used to create part of the the article I'm thinking about. It'd be one thing if they were full of nonsense, but they're not, so I'll accept that there's some potential usage there. I suppose one could start over from scratch, but I see no reason to do that. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That album was released in 1994. This band was formed (under a different name) in 1995. I'm pretty sure the band on that compilation album is a different band with the same name.

<li><b>Keep</b> Good heavens! J.C. is more well-known than most Coast to Coast AM <i>guests!</i> J.C. is every bit a staple of Coast to Coast AM as, for example, Richard Hoagland. When the three clips played highlighting Art's career at his award ceremony, one was the Area 51 flier, the second was J.C., and the third was Red Elk. J.C. Is much more than "just a caller." People do searches on J.C. all the time, just to find out *anything* they can about this man. I would think the unique hit rate on this page alone would be of some merit. No matter, its important that there be <i>someplace</i> where this information is compiled. A new page has been posted, hopefully resolving some legitimate problems. Peace.

<dd><b>Comment</b> @Deepspire: Please keep in mind that many of the Wikipedia participants discussing <i>this</i> AfD are aware of the sock-puppeting that went on during the <i>1st</i> AfD discussion of this article. Anonymous, first-time, 1-issue posters strongly advocating a blatantly non-encyclopedic article tend to seem suspicious.

<dd><b>Comment</b> @<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a>: I did miss the last AfD, and from what was described, I'm glad I did. I don't think this debate should be whether or not J.C, is "notable" enough. I don't want to get into that kind of debate because that will beg every imbicile with a pulse to come in here and clutter our serious discussion with nonsense "votes," peppered with insults. So far this discussion has had some intelligent thought, and I hope not to become flamed by others, but I have reverted my position somewhat. J.C. is <i>not</i> notable enough for an article of such magnitude. However, the sheer number of times J.C. is mentioned on Coast to Coast <i>does</i> merit a mention just to give people a quick idea of "who this J.C. is." I have posted a radically shortened page that I think better demonstrates what I mean. I've stripped it down about as bare minimum as I feel is appropriate. Unfortunately, neither extreme "side" here will probably be happy. Deepspire 11:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> @Deepspire: While I think your edits are definitely a step in the right direction in some sense, I respectfully disagree with your opinion that this discussion should not be about whether Jonathan Christian Webster is notable or not. It is my opinion that this discussion should very much center on whether the subject of this article is notable, and thus appropriate for an encyclopedia. Also, while your edits to the article's length are beneficial, the few sources listed within the article remain very worrisome. The first link is the website of the radio station that J.C. Webster apparently calls. The second link is a AOL home page with an extensive log of the calls made by J.C. Webster to the aforementioned radio station, which may be the source of this article's now-removed girth. The third link is for the "official" forum of the aforementioned radio station. I would posit that none of these links help to establish that J.C. Webster, nor his calls, nor his organization passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. What this article needs in order to be viable is some other <i>outside</i> sources that can cited to build a case that this person, J.C. Webster, is indeed notable. A great example would be some newspaper articles or some links to a local news broadcast discussing the individual. Of course, these types of traditional media are be no means the only way to demonstrate notability, but they sure are more convincing than a phone log.</dd>

If an article is nominated for deletion based on a legitimate reason (such as the subject of the article failing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>) then it must either be improved by editors or be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I do not say this lightly, nor hastily. I apologize to everyone who solicited my help in keeping this article. I think the "keep" argument was more emotionally based, because this page had become a sort of "hub" for J.C. fans. But here's the problem. There is nothing <b>provable</b> about J.C. other than the fact he's anonymously been on <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> a number of times, and they want him back on for a possible "debate." Everything else about him is based solely on what J.C. has said himself. And while many things he's said may be the truth, we can't possibly <i>know</i> that it's the truth. For example, he claims to be "God's general," <i>and he probably believes it.</i> Therefore, how can we assume this "CLAMP" and "compound" business isn't also just more of his dreamed-up illusion? There's simply nothing that we <i>know</i> about him in any substantial and <b>provable</b> way. <i>(We can't even prove his <b>name!</b>)</i> Wikipedia has a standard that <b>must</b> be met in order to be able to be used as a reliable and respected source of information. Thus, until any of this "information" can be substantiated, there is no way this article can be kept and yet still remain within the bounds of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. However, that doesn't mean this article is dead forever. Any notable <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and verifiable <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources will work; court records and newspaper articles on CLAMP demonstrations, etc. If there is any truth to what J.C. has claimed, then there <i>WILL</i> be evidence like that scattered out there; especially in California. It might take some digging, but that's what it's going to have to take. J.C. doesn't deserve any notation here by Wikipedia's own important rules. One final note. I also couldn't help but notice that even the <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> website doesn't devote a page to J.C. Anyway, I've said my piece. Thanks for the discussion, everyone!

<li><b>Comment:</b> I think the issue really being discussed was whether or not this individual is notable. Your comment carries the implication that because you feel J.C. Webster is notable, he must be so. The problem with this line of reasoning is that none of this individual's actions are verifiable via outside sources. I don't have a grudge against the fellow, but I've been doing some digging in my free time and I can't find anything about him. The (very helpful &amp; courteous) comments of Deepspire are evidence to me that some people are familiar with the subject of this article. But is there an argument in favor of keeping this article that is objectively strong? No disrespect intended, but you state that you strongly feel the article should be kept without giving a reason why that should be the case. It would be very helpful if you could explain your position and how it conforms to Wikipedia's content policies.

<li><b>Comment:</b> @<a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a>: I think you confused definitions like I did. There are two definitions of "notable." One being fame, i.e. "A notable caller." The "notable" we are refering to here means the ability to cite in a notation. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a> was kind enough to point me in the right direction: <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. For a subject to be "notable," it <i>must</i> be attributable to "notable source." Just the "truth" that he's called and said things doesn't make it notable. And ironically, something entirely false <i>can</i> be notable. For example, the article stub I've trimmed down is "basic information," and while it all may be true, just my <i>saying so</i> doesn't make it notable. However, if I were also a reporter and wrote a piece for The Sacramento Post, or somewhere "notable" like that, saying exactly the same things, then those words have then become attributable to a "notable source," <i>even if my information was wrong.</i> So understandably, establishing notability is very important not only for terms of credibility, but also for legal reasons. That would be the only reason the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Titor_c1ef.html" title="John Titor">John Titor</a> article has a place here. Notable sources have written about him. Otherwise, the "truth" boils down to that he was just an anonymous person who wrote a few posts claiming to be a time-traveler. That is what we have here at this point. J.C. is simply an anonymous caller into Coast to Coast AM, and until any "notable" things are said or written about him, or are found from archives somewhere, that is exactly what J.C. will remain. No one is trying to pretend that "J.C." doesn't exist, or hasn't made an impact of sorts on Coast to Coast AM. The <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_to_Coast_AM_b201.html" title="Coast to Coast AM">Coast to Coast AM</a> page here does make a mention of him, which for now is all that is appropriate.

<p>=To Scienter, I apologize for not responding earlier, I'm pretty busy this week.

</ul>
<p>Mr. Armando M. Fernandez ought to not be removed from Wikipedia just because Dick lyon hates Fernandez's invention, the mousepad, and has taken an anti-mousepad stand.</p>
<p>Mr. Armando M. Fernandez Invented, named and documented the mousepad. The mousepad has gone various times around the world in various generations of designs. The mousepad has been instrumental in exposing the problems of the mouse since 1979, DATE OF PUBLISHING, the days of the roller ball computer mouse. Later, when the optical mouse showed up, the mousepad helped expose the problems of the optical mouse so manufacturers had so do something to fix those problems. Mr. Dick Lyon, who seems to be an optical mouse designer, does not like the mousepad. As a matter of fact, he has taken an Anti-mousepad stand to such extent that he damages, removes and deletes entries which are helpful to the general public about the mousepad. He has also taken to give credit for the invention of the mousepad to the wrong people and seeking to deny, erase and delete any entry which supports Armando M. Fernandez as the original person who invented, named and documented the mousepad. He seeks to destroy the mousepad and its usefulness to society to such extent that he is passionatly Wikipedia-stalking Mr. Fernandez. Someone in Wikipedia administration ought to dis-empower Mr. Lyon from the organization so he stops his Wikipedia tyrant-bully and Wikipedia stalking activities. For sure, Mr. Fernandez is not the only person on whom he, Lyon, performs his Wikipedia stalking activities and the mousepad is not the only object which he, Lyon, seeks to destroy, inhibit and demean its value and contribution to the improvement and betterment of the human condition in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Armando M. Fernandez is surely a very notable person and due notariety as he has contributed extensively to the reduction of mental, eye, wrist, hand and finger stress in the use of computers through his invention of the mousepad. Mr. Armando M. Fernandez has helped make the use of computer apparatus using a display pointer much more comfortable to work with, to study with, to learn with and to surf the internet with. The mousepad invented named and documented by Mr. Armando M. Fernandez has done great good to the whole world and continues to do great good as it keeps challenging computer mouse designers to comeup with better mouse designs. Apparently Mr. Dick Lyon as an optical mouse designer is very upset at such great contributions which have been made to the world by Mr. Armando M. Fernandez through having invented, named and documented the mousepad.</p>
<p>Mr. Armando M. Fernadez is surely a very notable person to whom credit should be given for his invention of the mousepad. He ought to not be stalked by Mr. Lyon through misuse and abuse of Lyon's power within the Wikipedia organization. Lyon ought to be stripped of his power by his supervisors so he would be no more than a common contributor. He misuses and abuses his power, in Wikipedia stalking Mr. Fernandez, and Wikipedia tyrant-bully activities.

<dd>I am already no more than an ordinary contributor. Just trying to follow wikipedia policy. I don't have any different atttitude or power in this case than in the many others I have contributed to. And I do enjoy having and using mousepads, thanks. Armando, I recommend you leave these articles alone for a while, as they are too close to your personal interests; try learning to become a normal contributing editor of wikipedia, and then maybe come back and look at your baby and see how it is doing. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 14:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><strike>Keep - Nom in Bad Faith</strike> Speedy Keep</b> Even though I hate to do it, I have to accuse you of bad faith here... Perhaps because of the other two AfDs we've participated in.

<dd>Please keep your accusations of bad faith to yourself, as they are unfounded.

<dd>Which is why I also consulted LexisNexis, which catalogs newpapers, journals, magazines, and even some TV news broadcasts from all over the globe.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - AnimeIowa is one of the longest running and well known anime conventions in the United States.

<dd>In this case, some citations would help - just saying it's so doesn't cut the mustard. I've found references to the con on the *forums* at Animerica, and references to *listings* of con reports in <i>Protoculture Addicts</i> - this, however, does not actually confer notability on the convention, it just verifies that it happened. Were the con reports written by journalists or were they fan submissions? There is a difference here, one very important to the future of this article. If the "features" you mention are not online, do you have access to the magazine to offer a scan for review? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 04:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>Protoculture Addicts</i>, <i>Animerica</i>, and (I'm 99% sure) <i>Newtype USA</i> had actual articles written in their print editions (available "at fine newsstands everywhere") about the convention that were written by regular staff writers (not fans).

<li><b>Keep</b> Long running and well known anime convention; media citations would be easier to find through Google if there weren't discussions about the con on hundreds of forums, but I'm sure they exist somewhere.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have mixed feelings about this. This is one of the older anime conventions. But the question becomes, does age confer notability? Also, does the fact that this is the first and only convention in Iowa confer notability and can such a claim be <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributed</a> to a reliable source? As far as reliable sources, only the ANN article would be considered towards notable. AnimeCons.com is a directory listing and cannot confer notability. The problem with <i>A Fan's View</i>, which is more of a picture diary then an actual review, is that anyone can publish reviews on the web, but it is entirely different to get that review published in something with editorial control, like <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtype_USA_3854.html" title="Newtype USA">Newtype USA</a></i>.

<p>I don't think this is notable eough to warrant an article. It happened eight months ago, and there are no other articles linking to it.

<li><b>Keep</b>, an obviously notable event (imagine had this happened to US or UK diplomats). Needs more references and some cleanup.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The subject of multiple published incidences of nontrivial coverage by third parties - nom strongly relies upon the idea that Wikipedia is a finished product, which is completely untrue. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:15, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This meets notability, which points to a weakness in our notability guideline. Right now, notability sticks forever, but at some point no one is going to have any interest in the event except for a few specialists or historians. There needs to be some way of reviewing these event-based articles after they've aged because eventually too many of them will clutter up category pages and search results, making it harder for readers to search. I'll step down from my soap box now. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You seem to be dismissing this as "just another terrorist attack in Iraq" (my interpretation), but geographic coordinates aside, it seems to be in many ways another reasonably important event in the ongoing <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Chechen_War_66fe.html" title="Second Chechen War">Second Chechen War</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Normally, I am OK with articles on high schools being kept or merged with the school district, but I have serious reservations about this article, since <b>nonsense</b> and <b>vandalism</b> seems to infest it right from the first revision. First revision for instance makes the claim <i>"currently housing rouchly</i> [sic] <i>31,337 students"</i>. The author's second revision of the article was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_Bay_Southwest_High_School&amp;diff=105236809&amp;oldid=105236143" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_Bay_Southwest_High_School&amp;diff=105236809&amp;oldid=105236143" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>, turning the page into an attack article. Later nonsense consists of turning the foundation year into <a href="../../../1/3/3/1337.html" title="1337">1337</a>, as well as a load of other nonsense including 1337 derivatives (1337 students, 13:37 student/teacher ratio, etc.) All the revisions I can see here are either vandalism, or at best good faith reversions of vandalism to older versions which are <i>still</i> nonsense. Considering the outright rotten condition of this article, I will have to recommend deletion and restarting from scratch. There is <i>nothing</i> worth keeping in this article. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:28, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unless the article is vastly improved and multiple reliable sourcees with nontrivial coverage added by the end of the deletion debate. The article lacks independent sources to show notability and has never had a worthwhile version from the get-go, amongst the numerous vandalisms such as the swimming pool being radioactive. There is a problem with quantitive concepts in the article, such as "This school has a remarkably high student::teacher ratio, placing it amongst the best in the region." A quality school would have a LOW ratio. Poorly written unreferenced stub.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can you give a reason for deletion that is based on Wikipedia policy? The topic is covered non-trivially in reliable sources; your idea that it doesn't deserve its own article mainly seems to be your personal opinion. Nor does the existence of this article prevent you from improving <a href="../../../c/u/i/Cuisine_of_Hong_Kong_54ea.html" title="Cuisine of Hong Kong">Cuisine of Hong Kong</a> (which does not discuss any of this material). <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 06:19, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>This article is not written from the proper POV, period. It is written from the view that, if XYZ is available in a western country, and it is also available in HK. Then.... it must be a HK-style western cuisine. This article is based on a loose definition of 西餐, listing whatever it could from <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16440507/from/RS.1/" class="external text" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16440507/from/RS.1/" rel="nofollow">MSNBC</a> literally. Is like an article on donut. Someone in the east will reference what kind of donut can be purchased in the HK. And then claim donut as a representative of the entire western cuisine. Sure you can find donuts, but the approach is wrong. In <a href="../../../c/u/i/Cuisine_of_Hong_Kong_54ea.html" title="Cuisine of Hong Kong">Cuisine of Hong Kong</a>, I plan to separate some of the combinations that make western style cuisine. This article should be deleted, since it end up misleading and overlaping. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjwong_5487.html" title="User:Benjwong">Benjwong</a> 12:35, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Creating this page was just an attempt to let the people know my attempts for the under previllaged. I want more and more people to participate in rural youth education program that I run. I understand that it wasn't mentioned but the qualification and experience mentioned here was just so that people get attracted and get associated with me. Please accept my apologies as I now I know that the approach wasn't right, and I almost uploaded my resume here. However, I have changed it now. I would request you to please revisit and check and let me know what I can change. All the other things mentioned here are the things which I have been doing either as hobby or to earn money. so that I can support myself and the program. My apologies agaian, but my intentions were never "self promo and just aint notable. do we need to know is hight?"</p>

<p>Non-notable person. Allanfc is the creator of the somewhat notable browser game <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battrick.html" title="Battrick">Battrick</a>, a spinoff from the notable game <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hattrick.html" title="Hattrick">Hattrick</a>. I don't think this is sufficiently notable, and the links in the article do not seem to demonstrate widespread interest. The media interest claim surrounding selling his house to follow a cricket tour is not notable. I appreciate I could get some stick on this, as Allanfc is popular among Battrickers. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Battrick is only getting bigger, and this guy has been in the papers (The Sunday Mail in Brisbane, Australia) and I think that the wiki on him proves he is notable, at least to some people and it has information on him that may well be useful to people who want to know more about the creator of Battrick in the future. Another thing is, there are article on people which hardly anyone would know of yet they don't get listed for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rolande (<a href="../../../r/o/l/User_talk%7ERolande_a717.html" title="User talk:Rolande">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rolande_2f28.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rolande">contribs</a>) 11:09, 26 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. This is a very strange case, as most of the non-anonymous comments have remarked during the discussion. Other AfDs are frequently closed "with no prejudice against recreating a valid article", and in this case I'll take the opposite view.

I do not think there is a need to excessly emphasise his contributions by having such a long list of his work in a separate article.

Converse Peirce 2nd</a> article could be nominated for deletion on the basis of non-notability.

Converse Peirce 2nd</a> (which made a very long page), so I moved the publications into a sub-page rather than delete any. I wonder if an electronic publication list is available for Dr. Peirce (given many of the publications were before the advent of (practical) computers); this publication list may have required a significant amount of paper based research to compile. A significant amount of work has been put into the page; I <a href="../../../f/o/x/User_talk%7EFoxezandHedgehogs_e0dc.html" title="User talk:FoxezandHedgehogs">inquired</a> regarding a personal connection, with a positive (although ambiguous) reply. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User%7EDlodge_1452.html" title="User:Dlodge">Dlodge</a> 21:25, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge a few</b> but <b>delete most</b> and <b>consider deleting main article</b>. This list of pubs is way too long, especially in light of the subject's very weak claim to notability. His claim to fame appears to be playing an unspecified role in developing the "Peirce-General Electric Membrane Oxygenator", a term I can only find in papers authored by Dr. Peirce himself or by his colleagues at Mt. Sinai. I will post a notability tag on the Peirce page before nominating him for deletion. Google scholar shows no well-cited pubs but I'm not sure whether to trust the web, given that his arguably notable work was done in the 50s/60s. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 00:09, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have commented on the above puzzling statements on the article talk page. I will comment further as appropriate.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>delete</b> this particular subpage.--an above comment is correct that we do not keep such extensive lists. All the necessary material for the main article has been copied over, and there is nothing left here worth keeping- The external source which has them all in PubMed since the 60s, and the printed Index Medicus before that. I cannot imagine why this subpage was ever started--a separate subpage for publications is not WP style. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:35, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Well ...</b>. I don't think this article should exist; however, some of the content should be merged (or may have already been merged). Per GFDL, preservation of the edit history is required, so I don't know if outright deleting this page is appropriate. Then again, it <i>really</i> shouldn't exist as a redirect. Perhaps the edit histories can be merged and this article can be deleted? If this cannot be easily done, how about this:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><b>Move</b> this page to Edmund Converse Peirce (currently non-existing).</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this page as being an unnecessary subpage and having a trivial edit history.</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Edmund Converse Peirce into <a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._Converse_Peirce_2nd_354a.html" title="E. Converse Peirce 2nd">E.

</ol>
<dl>
<dd>That serves the three purposes of: (1) deleting this article, (2) conducting a partial merge, and (3) preserving the edit history as required per GFDL. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hi everyone, thanks for looking after the integrity of wikipedia in such a efficient manner. Following, Fisherqueen's advice I would like to clarify the reasons why I have added these entries. Far from being a "blatant advertising" or a "gross exercise of vanity", these are just my first wikipedia entries. I am a marketing student living in the UK and I was very surprised when the second biggest independent UK agency was not included in the index. As I am a beginner I am not totally aware of all the requirements. I do admit I should have read better the rules of the game before posting. I did run a search for other important advertising agencies like BBDO or Ogivly before I decided to add this one. They all have similar descriptions. My main mistake was taking a lot of information from their website rather than coming up with something totally original. I thought other people would edit it to improve it, rather than send it straight for deletion. The only edit I have seen so far is the deletion of most of the Engine Group entry. While I work in an improved version, I have edited the other two today (Peter Scott and Robin Wight) to try and make them more suitable. I will continue working on them if given the chance. FisherQueen pointed out the notability requirement and the need to offer sources. I do have quite a few articles from advertising magazines like Campaing, Brand Republic, New Media Age and others where these people and their work are mentioned. However, they are hard copies and it is not possible to find them online. I am not too sure how you deal with these sort of things. Also, I am not too sure who are the admins that are going to make the decission. I would hope this is the case but, if it is not, before you decide total and definitive deletion, please check with someone who knows about advertising in the UK/Europe. thanks in advance!

<li><b>Reply</b>: I think you may still be misunderstanding what Wikipedia is all about (see <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five pillars</a> for that), and also misunderstanding what needs to be done to save these articles, so I will try to clarify the main problems. First of all, in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> it states "<i>A topic is generally notable if it has been the subject of coverage that is independent of the subject, reliable, and attributable.</i>" If the subjects of your articles were notable, there would be numerous newspaper and independent magazine stories (like <i><a href="../../../b/u/s/BusinessWeek_6dfe.html" title="BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</a></i>, not solely ad agency mags) about them, but apparently there are none and so this company and its executives are not notable either. Secondly, you say "My main mistake was taking a lot of information from their website rather than coming up with something totally original", but Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not the place for original research</a> either. Please review the official policies (<a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), which state '"<i>Articles should contain only material that has been published by reliable sources.</i>" The articles completely fail to follow this policy. They are simply not notable enough for inclusion in WP, unless you are able to find reliable, independent secondary sources which discuss them and cite their notability. If you wish to temporarily save the content of these articles you have worked on, you need to go through the history of each one and save the most complete version to pages in your userspace (e.g. User:Markusse, along with subpages of it such as User:Markusse/Test), but do note that anyone can see and edit all pages in your userspace, and inappropriate content, blatant advertising, etc. will still be deleted from there. As it stands, all three articles appear certain to fail this AfD, and they will be deleted within days unless reliable, independent secondary sources are found.

<li>OK, I was going to give up yesterday after reading the comments. However, I have changed my mind. I still want to contribute and I am convinced we are missing out by not having entries for these three subjects. Consequently, I have been digging out some info from the newspaper library at uni. I have found mentions to the Engine Group, Peter Scott and Robin Wight in mainstream media such as: Financial Times, Daily Telegraph, The Times and others. Some of them talk about client gains, other talk about neuro science and its connections with advertising (Robin Wight body of work is quoted several time) other talk about advertising industry in the UK. I have scanned some of them and you can see them below. I hope this helps to prove my point about notability. Also, bear in mind that the guidelines don't say anything about the type or scope of the magazines that you can use. Both "mainstream newspapers and magazines" are accepted. Now, the guidelines say the author of the entry needs to attribute quotes or references and material that "is likely to be challenged". There are not quotes or references in the entry. My questions is: why are you challenging the entry in the first place? If it is because of the way it has been written, I agree it needs to be revised. I am working on it. If it is because you don't know who these people and therefore their "notability" is dubious for you... Then, may I ask you how well you know the European advertising industry? I think it is a bit risky to challenge something unless you have a good knowledge of that field. Please see below some of the scraps that I have scanned. There are more....

<li><b>Reply</b>: Markusse, please do not add photos in these discussions again. The proper way to refer to images is to put a ":" in the tag, like this [[:Image:Sky_The_Sunday_Times_3_Dec_06.jpg]], so that they display as inline links (I have now fixed them). Also, please do not use &lt;li&gt; tags here, it breaks the formatting; use * instead. When in doubt, please look around to see what others have done in this and other AfD discussions and either follow or copy their examples. Also, all of your scanned images constitute possible (certain?) copyright violations and will be deleted.

<li><b>Reply</b>: Thanks again for the good tips on how to use the system properly. As with any other new application there is a learning curve and other's people help is essential. Cheers for taking the time to do it with me. I am working on improved articles at the moment and will submit shortly. The only reasons why I uploaded the image files was because I just wanted to prove my point. I have now also learned that. There is no need to go on about <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> any more. I have now read, diggested and understood the policies and I am working in articles that meet those guidelines. There is only one more thing though. I am still under the impressiont that the only way you can dare to question the notability of an entry is because you know very well that field. Hence you know what is notable or not. For instance, I don't know anything about physics. Following your logic, I could see a new entry about some scientist somewhere. I could then run a google search and don't find relevant information (maybe because the guy shares his name with a celebrity or has only been published in specialised magazines that are not available online). He is still famous and his work may be revolutionary, certainly deserving a wikipedia entry. However, I have never heard about him. Would I be in the position of challenging that article? Certainly not. My knowledge of the field is null. Therefore I can't challenge notability. I can certainly challenge the infringement of other policies (as I said: fair enough, point taken, working to improve) but I could never challenge notability. Of course, if you think otherwise or this works in a differnt way, could you please explain it to me so I can understand it better? Thanks again!Markusse 16:51, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>: Markusse, thanks for taking the time to read and understand WP policies. Regarding your statement, "the only way you can dare to question the notability of an entry is because you know very well that field", that's not true in this context. The issue here on WP is that (obviously) not everyone can be an expert on every subject. So it is up to the <i>article's creator</i> to provide references that establish and confirm any article subject's notability, be it a scientist or band or school or whatever. Any article which fails to do so is likely to end up with either a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion notice</a> on it, or {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}, or be listed here at AfD (these are the 3 primary avenues for deletion). Many editors (though not me) patrol the list of new articles created, looking for just such articles which fail to meet policy and establish notability. So your hypothetical physicist's article, if it had no references, would probably end up with a deletion notice (or maybe even a hoax notice if someone thought it looked fishy). Then the article's creator (or anyone else, too) would need to provide references <i>and</i> make sure to assert the subject's notability in the text, preferably in the first paragraph. If the subject were truly notable, someone would easily find plenty of published references (some of us are physicists and have extensive online/print access to scientific journals, which would certainly have many papers written by any notable physicist). Even if the article got deleted initially, it's no big deal since it could be undeleted upon proper request or simply recreated in proper form. Subject's which are notable enough will eventually get a proper WP article, someone will write it. That's one of the basic principles of this entire project. The proper way to write a new article (and avoid deletion notices) is to make a small stub with basic info, save it, then add some solid references (which you've already collected beforehand), save again, and then expand the text with further relevant info and details. There you have it, a soild article started in less than an hour. I've created about 50 Wikipedia articles, always followed this plan, and never received a deletion notice. The <i>solid references</i> are the absolute key, I've never started a WP article without refs, and I go around adding refs to 100s of other articles which need them. See <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/t/WP%7EBETTER_1a15.html" title="WP:BETTER">WP:BETTER</a> for many tips and guidelines on writing a good article. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeattle_Skier_c9bc.html" title="User:Seattle Skier">Seattle Skier</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeattle_Skier_72b9.html" title="User talk:Seattle Skier">(talk)</a> 20:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

And also I don't think that having <i>some programs</i> merged with the main <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Live_4fdf.html" title="Windows Live">Windows Live</a> article and <i>some other programs</i> having their own page creates <i>"a sense of organisation"</i>.

<p>I have created the page Buddha Film which is a project that is entirely different from the other film Buddha (film). So a merge into the latter article is not appropriate. You have mentioned that you have merged the article to the former, which actually has not and does not require a merge too. Hence the deletion instruction is to be removed. I hope you have understood. Thanks.<a href="../../../y/u/g/User%7EYugeshp_7be0.html" title="User:Yugeshp">Yugeshp</a> 13:35, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am unable to understand how Ian Meissmart says that both the articles are about the new Buddha film, in essence they are, but please be informed there are several films named 'Buddha' and the ones in discussion are separate projects. Pls. read the article before you place deletion instructions. The one I created <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha_Film_d413.html" title="Buddha Film">Buddha Film</a> is written by D.K.Goel and is being directed by Sreedhar Allani and is scheduled for release during 2007, where the other one <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha_%28film%29.html" title="Buddha (film)">Buddha (film)</a> is by Thich Nhat Hanh (book) and written by David S. Ward and is scheduled for release in 2008. The view of other Wikipedians is the same as mine, which means the articles are not be merged as they talk about different projects, though the title of the film is the same. I am ending the discusssion here. You may go ahead with the deletion of the article if you wish. I am creating a new article Buddha (2007 film) as recommended by the user Tikiwont. I hope you will be more prudent while placing deletion instructions and will take a little more care by reading the articles in detail before taking such a step. <a href="../../../y/u/g/User%7EYugeshp_7be0.html" title="User:Yugeshp">Yugeshp</a> 14:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> <a href="../../../m/e/i/User%7EMeissmart_0267.html" title="User:Meissmart">Meissmart</a>, please be more careful in the future. If you aren't sufficiently interested in the article to read and notice all the names are different, then you aren't sufficiently interested to merge/delete/rename. I got here when I noticed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buddha&amp;oldid=117749524" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buddha&amp;oldid=117749524" rel="nofollow">dueling hatnotes</a> on the Buddha page. I soon found that <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha_%282007_film%29.html" title="Buddha (2007 film)">Buddha (2007 film)</a> was not listed at <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Buddha (disambiguation)">Buddha (disambiguation)</a>. I started fixing that, so I verified that the movies are different, and then I stumbled on a <i>third</i> page (<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha_Film_d413.html" title="Buddha Film">Buddha Film</a>). One sure thing I have learned editing Wikipedia: When something doesn't make sense, step back and try to make sense of it. It usually still doesn't make sense, but the experience is useful. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarticus88_0fa5.html" title="User:Barticus88">— Randall Bart</a> 18:37, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Vandalism isn't a reason for deletion. I'm not a big fan of "reality show star" articles, but this is arguably one of the best sourced articles of this type here.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Due to her stupidity when on Big Brother she received a lot of unfortunate attention from UK tabloid newspapers. She's been on the media frequently since, and was even included in the latest "Celebrity" (emphasis on quotation marks) Big Brother, and then promptly generated a row over racism. So, Keep on Wikipedia, preferably delete her from real life. SimonRK 14:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't watch television, so I have no knowledge of her from that medium, but I can't help but be confronted almost daily with images of her staring at me from the tabloids and magazines at my local corner store.

<dd>I'm not sure if this is a serious question but assuming good faith that it is, this is a highly notable person in the UK who has received numerous and ongoing media coverage, has been the endorsement face of a series of ventures, is a millionaire as a result of her celebrity exposure, and was the center of an international scandal. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 15:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Nominationg for <b>Deletion</b> Reason: Their is no proof or real evidence that al qaeda did theese attacks.

As such a top prospect, he's also definitely been covered by independent secondary sources, like <i><a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_Illustrated_9f1c.html" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a></i>.

It seems like originasl research for editors here to determine the project is cancelled because they have not seen news items in 2 years. A projected 40 million dollar picture with major talent such as Gellar signed to do it and major studio participation can be notable even if it never gets made, if it has the multiple independent sources with sunstantial coverage that this one has. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:20, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Very often, the content of articles of films that never get made is underwhelming. If this film never gets made, then there would be stagnant growth of content in its article. If no content will ever be added, then it's best to merge it to the source material. Try a more authoritative Google search, since Google hits will obviously spur discussion about the film on blogs and message boards. A <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22sarah+michelle+gellar%22+alice+mcgee&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22sarah+michelle+gellar%22+alice+mcgee&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1" rel="nofollow">Google News Archive Search</a> only records 27 actual hits, under the assumption that a proper headline would note that the film is based on American McGee's Alice. Additionally, IMDb is not a reliable source at all in terms of pre-release news. Even if you're citing it, you should notice that the film's status at IMDb is marked as "Unknown". Also, the listing at New York Times does not actually mention anything about the film's production. For all we know, it was added in 2005 and hasn't been removed since; there's no date attached to its inclusion to indicate its recency. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 16:53, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>No claim to notability (except blogs), blatant advertising, written pretty much by SPA. Prod deleted by article writer without comment.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - there are references to demonstrate multiple coverage in third-party sources, although not all of this coverage qualifies as non-trivial and reliable (as the nominator says, some of the sources are blogs). I'd give it the benefit of the doubt, but it needs to be substantially rewritten to remove the advertising tone. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 11:25, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Difficult one.

<dd>Had a closer look over the website and change my vote to <b>Delete - full stop</b>. I don't think this outfit is notable and specialist search engines are common. Therefore, on second thought I think it is more <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html" title="WP:Spam">WP:Spam</a> than useful information. <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagenUK_df58.html" title="User:HagenUK">HagenUK</a> 19:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>It is indeed difficult. Right now, I say <b>Weak delete,</b> as it is borderline spam. Notability coule be proved, though, and a rewrite may make this acceptable. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 21:15, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> to the above keep votes - The problem with this article isn't that it needs cleanup but that it is OR and lacks sourcing. The sources given in the article are not reliable sources, as they are all links to DKP calculators or different MMORPG guilds' websites explaining their DKP rules. None of these provide any independent sourcing on what DKP is. If the consensus here is that digging up a guild website that gives their spin on DKP rules constitutes valid sourcing I will gladly withdraw this nomination. I do agree that it is a highly notable concept and of value to gamers, but Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a game guide. Don't get me wrong - I <i>like</i> this article, but it's still completely original research and fails guidelines. Someone please come up with a valid reason to keep it other than "useful". <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 21:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - this AfD seems to be getting hit with a lot of IP users and accounts with very few edits. That's not a grounds for discounting&#160;!votes but I would like to point out that by their own admission, the article is unsourced and likely to remain unsourced due to the fact that this information is not to be found anywhere. While I agree that it is a valuable source of information, that is the very definition of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Wikipedia cannot be a primary source of information!

<dd><b>Comment</b> Wouldn't it be inconsistent to merge all the rides at <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alton_Towers_9e57.html" title="Alton Towers">Alton Towers</a> into a single article, yet allow the rides at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> <i>et al</i> to keep their own pages?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just to expand on my original proposal a little, other rides at Alton Towers are notable in that they are/were World Firsts and most of them had extensive media coverage when opened. Although I agree with the above comment that an Alton Towers merge would make the article too long, I proposed a few weeks ago on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Talk%7EAlton_Towers_038a.html" title="Talk:Alton Towers">Talk:Alton Towers</a> that a separate article e.g. Notable rides at alton towers be created and all ride articles be merged into. However this is not in keeping with other theme park article formats. <tt><a href="../../../m/c/l/User%7EMclowes_0cfa.html" title="User:Mclowes"><font color="green">camelworks</font></a></tt><sup><a href="../../../m/c/l/User_talk%7EMclowes_8895.html" title="User talk:Mclowes"><font color="purple">(Mclowes)</font></a></sup> 18:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply to comment</b>: An article being "too long" post-merger only says that the articles themselves needs to be pruned.

<li>After further review, I think I was mislead by AMG, who lists it under charted singles, but <i>not</i> under released singles in the discography section. In fact, there are apparently no singles released by this band, and the song charted as an album track, not as a single. Therefore, it is more appropriately covered in the album article (where its chart position is already mentioned). Thus I'm switching my&#160;!vote. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 23:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article fails <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, this article is unsourced and I can find no information anywhere regarding this film. Given the popularity of this series I would expect some talk, but all I could find was people talking about this Wikipedia article. The article was created by a very new editor, whose other edits were unsubstantiated speculation. Even IMDB does not have an article on this, and, given their very loose criteria for inclusion, I suspect this indicates that this film is not happening. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 17:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This film has been talked about for many, many years now with no sign of being made. The official site has not been updated in two years, and there has been no news in that time. We are an encyclopedia, <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">not a crystal ball</a>, we should not have an article on every book/game/comic that might conceivably be made into a film at some point in the future.

<li>Keep I pulled the prod because, IIRC, you said POSSIBLY nn and it POSSIBLY being nn isn't sufficient. Either it is or isn't notable and you make your argument. Since the article is a stub, and I will tag it as such, I would like to see it have a chance to improve. My hunch is, based on vague memories, that many important people attended this school. If I am wrong, then the issue of deleting it can be revisited.

<p>Not unlike all these "in popular culture" articles. List is potentially too long to be of any interest and is currently a dump of trivial and rather random information with no encyclopedic value.

<li><b>Delete</b> - indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture any appearance of "Death" or any character who in the opinion of an editor might represent Death with no regard to the importance of the character either within or outside the fiction. This is marginally better than the previously deleted list of personifications of evil since at least some of these characters are actually <i>called</i> "Death" but the POV/OR problems are too great. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Not me, that's for damn sure. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 00:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, weakly. Much of this material was spun off of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html" title="Death (personification)">Death (personification)</a>, where many similar entries stand that are presented with slightly more analysis. (I am one of the original creators of that article.) This stuff isn't very good, and the better of it is already duplicated there. There should be some kind of intermediate place we can send lists like this for future reference, in case someone wants to organize these lists into text. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 05:04, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Very general list with a weak common ground, since the personification of death is also very general. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirbelwind_a23d.html" title="User:Wirbelwind">Wirbelwind<small>ヴィルヴェルヴィント</small></a>&#160;(<a href="../../../w/i/r/User_talk%7EWirbelwind_25ad.html" title="User talk:Wirbelwind">talk</a>) 06:31, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I created the page to be a holding site for the list of personifications of Death in fiction, which was originally a part of Personifications of Death. Yes, it's very anti-WP, but I was afraid of the backlash that might result from deleting so much material. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 04:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The tide is overwhelmingly in favor of deletion here, so I'm not even going to fight it with a vote for "keep". A cursory glance at the article does show it's in complete disarray, yes. The article is linked to as a sub-section from <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html" title="Death (personification)">Death (personification)</a>, which is a legitimate sub-category for that legitimate article. However, a comprehensive guide to this would overwhelm the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html" title="Death (personification)">Death (personification)</a> article. So, the appropriate solution is to either compress the information down to the most notable examples and place it back into the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html" title="Death (personification)">Death (personification)</a> article as a non-comprehensive section, or vastly clean up the article, perhaps so that it is more than simply a list? Just some observations/suggestions. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElijya_4eeb.html" title="User:Elijya">Elijya</a> 05:36, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The problem with that suggestion is that if any of this stuff gets merged back to the main article it will serve as a license to any editor to add his or her favorite example to the list, which will cause the section to swell, which will lead someone to spin it off into a sub-article, and the cycle continues. 12:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I agree, that is a potential problem, but an article about the personification of Death is hardly complete without SOME mention of the hundreds of fictional examples of it. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElijya_4eeb.html" title="User:Elijya">Elijya</a> 13:59, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Multiple videos, multiple magazine appearances, a theatrical release. "Mariko Morikawa" is an icon in the Japanese big-bust genre. This AfD is ludicrous. Its deletion would not only be censorship, it would be a culturally biased assault against the coverage of the Japanese erotic cinema on English Wikipedia. As a sign of her notability in Japan, out of the hundreds, if not thousands of actresses who have made adult video debuts yearly in Japan since the early 1980s, editors of Japanese Wikipedia give this actress a <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A3%AE%E5%B7%9D%E3%81%BE%E3%82%8A%E3%81%93" class="external text" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A3%AE%E5%B7%9D%E3%81%BE%E3%82%8A%E3%81%93" rel="nofollow">lengthy article</a>. Pornography has long been, and continues to be a very significant part of Japanese popular culture, and English Wiki's coverage of the Japanese porn area is woefully lacking. Taking out two general articles and four articles on <i><a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_film.html" title="Pink film">pink film</a></i> actresses, the English Wikipedia, with going-on 2 million articles, currently has 57 articles in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Category%7EJapanese_porn_stars_34d6.html" title="Category:Japanese porn stars">Category:Japanese porn stars</a>. For comparison, Chinese Wikipedia, with <a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5" class="external text" title="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5" rel="nofollow">less than 118,000</a> articles, has <a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%ACAV%E5%A5%B3%E5%84%AA" class="external text" title="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%ACAV%E5%A5%B3%E5%84%AA" rel="nofollow">67 articles</a> on Japanese AV actresses. In 1994 it was reported that "approximately 14,000 "adult" videos were being made yearly in Japan compared with some 2500 in the U.S."<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_rape_jp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_rape_jp.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. Also, "In addition to the influence of pornography on mainstream cinema, the line between pornography and family entertainment, such as daytime television, is blurred. It is not uncommon in Japan for a waning female television star or singer to feature in pornographic videos. Similarly, there are women actors from pornographic videos who move into daytime television."<a href="http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/7.2/Iwamura.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/7.2/Iwamura.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> And further, "By the late 1970s the production of pink eiga together with Roman Porno amounted to more than 70% of annual Japanese film production."<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041118094603/http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20041118094603/http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> And finally, "The market for pornographic videos is worth Y400 billion annually, accounting for around 30 percent of [Japan]’s video rentals."<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> The article is a on major Japanese celebrity, and is not a vanity page. Use of "Notability" to delete articles on lesser-known celebrities is an abuse of the term. With pornography's high visibility in Japan, her status as an AV idol gives her much higher notability in her country than her U.S. counterparts have in their country. To further chip away at Wikipedia's already meagre coverage of Japanese erotic cinema would be to further cultural bias. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Further comment</b> I actually think the "exposes harmful information about students" is on to something, although I wouldn't put it nearly that strongly. There are extensive lists in the article of names of student government officers. I think that's (a) unlikely to be referenced; (b) I'm uncomfortable giving the world their names, even though it's high school, not elementary or middle school; (c) probably going to attract vandals; and (d) there's a slight possibility of libel. All in all it's a bad idea to have it, so I'm going to delete the list. I'll repost this on the talk page. If anyone has a good reason to keep the list, I'd of course welcome a comment there. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is clearly non-neutral in its point of view. It takes an advocacy tone toward its subject. The article contains considerable original research, is not encyclopedic in tone, is very lengthy, and frankly is likely beyond help from someone without a conflict of interest. The author maintains that "the world needs to know" about the process involved, but maintains a web site that is even more detailed; that web site is a more proper venue for this article than Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 20:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>weak delete</b> - presently still reads like an advertisement.

<li>This whole argument works the other way round. Notability has to be proven. As we have no set way to prove N for schools specifically, and no sign that we will ever agree on any, let us delete all the articles without a very firm basis according to the general rules, which would require two very solid RSs for all local institutions attesting to more than the existence. But this particular school ranks high enough to be Notable, so,</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The <i>Newsweek</i> article needs to be proved, but that may make it notable.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The school's consistent top rankings in Newsweek's annual survey, and their win in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Fed_Challenge_8abe.html" title="National Fed Challenge">National Fed Challenge</a> are strong claims of notability. These claims are all backed by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to clearly justify and support the claim of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. As usual, it took just a few minutes to find sources to back up the article and to add additional material, and this can be done without much effort for virtually any high school in the United States. It's amazing what you can do if your objective is to improve articles, not just to get rid of them. I must say that this was one of the easier articles to find sources to demonstrate notability. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is no consensus at Wikipedia that high schools are or are not inherently notable, as evidenced by the fact that high school AfDs are closed as "no consensus", "keep" or "delete" on a case by case basis.

<li>Number of films can contribute to a porn star's prolificness, and certainly more so than the Google test, which on its own is unquestionably invalid, but it does speak to both the size of an entertainer's fanbase/following (see WP:BIO) and the prolificness of their work and can be used in conjunction with more valid criteria of either WP:PORNBIO or WP:BIO to make a determination of whether they have a significant following and/or are prolific in any genre. This actress doesn't even seem to be prolific in porn in general, or anything else for that matter. I can't find anything about this actress other than her IMDB (and similar) profiles and some minor mentions/inclusions on spammish porn sites. She doesn't even have a website of her own. While even that is not an immediate grounds for inclusion/exclusion, again, it is a piece of evidence that needs to be looked at as a part of a whole. All of the sources in this article are IMDB (or similar) and while such sites may be used as sources in conjunction with other reliable sources, including the actress' own website, if she has one, as this is an article about a person and would be considered a primary source provided the information is neutral, and preferably at least one third-party reliable source, IMDB-ish sites alone are not acceptable as reliable sources. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 20:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What do you mean she doesn't have a website of her own? She does, it's right in the article. Not that that's sufficient, but as long as you are saying it, it may at least be true.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sources don't just automatically make things safe from being deleted. Sources don't fix the cruft issue. An answers.com link isn't helpful: it's explaining the game itself (no mini-games are mentioned except for the fact there is 60). Also people mentioning sources, clearly mean somewhere not from Nintendo or an official site (if I'm understanding this right). Answers.com would've worked: if it actually listed the mini-games, but it doesn't.

<li><b>Comment</b> I posted this in another AfD, and I will post it here, verbatim: It's looking pretty obvious that this is gonna be a "no consensus" ruling and, seeing as this is probably going to be nominated again, I feel we need to set up some sort of proposal, something along the lines of "if it can't be improved after a certain amount of time to a better quality, then delete," because this is going to be ridiculous. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit' me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 21:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I will write what I wrote on the other AFD: Strongly disagree. At worst, repeat AFDs are an annoyance. However, there is no need to set an arbitrary deadline for the improvement and/or completion of articles. I can understand the frustration (on both sides) of having AFD after AFD, but if there's no consensus, then there's no consensus.

<li>What I was suggesting is some way of preventing thousands of unnecessary AfDs. I'm sure, for such a case as this, that something along, but not constricted to, the lines of what I suggested. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit' me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 21:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The best way to stop unnecessary AFDs is to discourage frequent renominations that only repeat what had been noted in previous AFDs. Someone may think that a view s(he) holds fully justifies the deletion of an article, but if there is not consensus support for that view, s(he) should back off rather than repeatedly AFD the same article. A deadline is counter to the very nature of Wikipedia. On whom would we impose it ... editors who contribute to the project <i>voluntarily</i>? The best way to avoid thousands of unnecessary AFDs is simply to not renominate articles for deletion unless a significant amount of time has passed, valid arguments grounded in policy were overlooked in prior AFDs (<a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> may be the better option here), and/or one has gained support for a nomination on the article's talk page. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:51, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
