<li>First time I've seen that happen: I tagged it for deletion and someone beat me to the punch in creating its VfD page. Probably not quite a speedy as inventing 2 programming languages is something of a claim of notability. Still, if someone does choose to speedy it, well, so be it. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:04, 2 August 2005 (UTC) (Oh yeah, that's a <b>delete</b> vote, by the way, in case it wasn't obvious.)</li>
<li>R. fiend: I agree with you that learning 2 programming languages is notable but I disagree with you in the sense that this entry should be deleted. This young man deserves credit for his hard work. The same can be said with the Wikipedia entries of Bill Gates and Britney Spears. Why should our Dylan's hard work not be seen and admired? - <small>Unsigned comment by article's initial creator at 69.212.2.162</small>
<ul>
<li>Britney Spears is a nationally known celebrity. Why? Who knows. But she is. Dylan is not. Bill Gates. Can you honestly say you don't know why Bill Gates is more deserving of his own article than your Dylan? Compare apples to apples. When Dylan does something that is notable (not just interesting) then try the article again. Until that, chalk my vote as <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 21:38, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Bill gates did NOT write an OS all by himself in that proportion. I am the author and this is really starting to piss me off. Go ahead and delete it.
<ul>
<li>Bill Gates actually coded BASIC for the Altair pretty damn impressively. This Bluefeather sounds more like a Unix clone to me. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> 00:25, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, you can get pissed off if you want, but the fact is that a search for Bluefeather AND Dylan produce only 22 hits and not ONE of them refers to Dylan Rogers' Bluefeather. The rules for Wikipedia are that non-notable (in the eyes of the public) people do not deserve to take up server space. You can't change the fact that no one outside of his family and friends know who he is.--<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 22:29, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, vanity. For comparison, I can write somewhere between one and three dozen programming languages (depends on how you count language varients), and can understand several times that many. Creating programming languages is no big deal -- it's a common exercise for computer-science students. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 23:05, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>CONGRATULATIONS, FOLKS -- not only have you made fun of me, told me how useless my languages are (even though they developed an entire os -- that's their purpose, you twat) ... and i learned C when i was eleven. i never said how many languages i can understand. i can probably UNDERSTAND nearly about three dozen as well, because learning a programming language is similar to learning a spoken world/foreign language. I know 5 world languages. How many do you know? Stop making fun of me, just request deletion of the topic. You take this FAR too seriously. Here's a bright idea, stop talking about my family, because I have none. My dad died when I was five and my mom was killed in a car accident last week. And onto the topic of taking up server space? TALKING ABOUT DELETING MY ARTICLE IS EASILY TAKING UP MORE SPACE THAN WHAT I WROTE IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER TO JUST DELETE THE ARTICLE AND STOP MOCKING/BELITTLING A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD. I DID THIS TO IMPRESS MY COMPUTER TEACHER. I DID WRITE AN OS. I DONT SEE YOU WRITING AN OPERATING SYSTEM AT AGE FIFTEEN. And by the way, I don't care that I just composed that last couple sentences in all caps, because it doesnt matter! This will be deleted momentarily, hopefully. I don't deserve to be mocked, and my beautiful Bluefeather creation is NOT A UNIX CLONE. I BUILT THAT FROM SCRATCH.</li>
</ul>
<p>I may be vain, but you are critical. Stop doing this to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow up. If you can't take criticism you are doomed in life. Let's see...you learned 5 languages and 36 programing languages by age 15 and you are trying to impress your computer teacher by posting an inappropriate article on Wikipedia? Sounds fishy. Regardless, no one here attacked you, but only commented why your article wasn't appropriate. I think you're a troll, fishing for attention. I guess you got what you wanted. This will be the last time you get it from me. Good luck in life. With an attitude like yours, you'll need it. --<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 03:07, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well in that respect, thanks for the luck. Literally speaking, I'm far from a troll - six feet five inches tall to be exact. Sorry for taking up 10KB of server space...My attitude towards like is actually quite positive, I'm just having a hard time, seeing as I just lost my mother. It's not fishy, actually the primary purpose of the article was to get back at my evil computer applications teacher (which in reality is no more than a little bit of DOS and Word, Excel during class) who made fun of me now that I have no parents, and she bet me that I couldn't make Wikipedia if I tried. And so a wise man said "Negative attention is better than no attention at all." Good day and keep up the great work you guys here at Wikipedia have been doing! Looks like my computer teacher will have the best of me ... once again&#160;:( Good night. <b>PS</b> Just for the record, Bluefeather is not a UNIX clone. If you want the ISOs, email me: dylan [at] binaryopinion [dot] com</li>
</ul>
<p>Would it be better to simply create a Wikipedia account and have my personal page/info there? Also, I feel that personal attacks were included and are against deletion request policy -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks#Examples" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks#Examples" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks#Examples</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm good friends with Dylan. Just delete his post and move on with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: It exists. Your welcome. xa 07:02, 3 August 2005 (CST)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>I dont care</b>. Hey dude what's goin on? Anyways take the author (me) and delete it. xa, would you please tell these people that my OS <i>does exist</i>? Thanks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right. I've <b>abstained</b> from voting because I see a lot of what I used to be in you. And I'm only a few years older. I can understand all kinds of languages, but I never use that to make myself sound impressive. If you'd like some advice, you'll stop "not caring." Now, I apologise if Bluefeather is a genuine OS and of course I'll consider taking a look - you have to appreciate so many script kiddies think of Unix clones as new systems. Just take it gracefully, Dylan, and one day; someone'll be writing about you. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> 02:52, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thanks, Rob -- I appreciate the support and will take advantage of whatever constructive criticism you can give me.
<ul>
<li>My final piece of advice, for what it's worth, and you're entitled to not follow it, is to abstain, given the argument and the fact that you're the subject here. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> 22:15, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
