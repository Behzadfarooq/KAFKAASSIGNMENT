<p>A hoax. As per recent discussions at <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">the Australian Wikipedians' noticeboard</a>. It is not on <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=Davido&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=0" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=Davido&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=0" rel="nofollow">Geoscience Australia</a> which does have localities no longer extant such as <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=Homebush&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=VIC" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=Homebush&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=VIC" rel="nofollow">Homebush, Victoria</a> or <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazd01?rec=240925" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazd01?rec=240925" rel="nofollow">Dondangadale</a>, and thus is extremely unlikely that Davido was ever a recognised Australian place name. The original editor cited a book reference. An Australian wikipedian reviewed that book and others and found:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The book cited by the editor, <i>The Colonial Experience: the Port Phillip District 1834-1850</i> seems to be a school textbook, consisting mainly of diary entries of Victorian pioneers, covering the timespan 1834-1850 (obviously). The Davido article states that the town's active period was between 1867-1871 (beyond the timeframe of the textbook). There is no index in the book, and so I scanned the pages for mention of Davido - but there seemed to be nothing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I checked the indexes of numerous books on nineteenth century Victoria, particularly those covering the Hamilton area, and found no mention of the town. I also checked the index volumes of the <i>Victorian Historical Journal</i>, which dates back to 1911, and this also revealed no mention of Davido.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, in the genealogy room, I found Angus B. Watson's excellent and addictive book <i>Lost &amp; Almost Forgotten Towns of Colonial Victoria: A Comprehensive Analysis of Census Results for Victoria 1841-1901</i>. This book includes all towns and villages as defined by the Government Statist for collection of Victorian censuses from 1841 to 1901. This includes settlements of as few as 13 people, yet there was no mention of Davido, which the article claims had a population of 1,500.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My conclusion is that the article is most definitely a hoax. If anyone wants to put this up for AfD, feel free to use the information I've just supplied. -- <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 06:26, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tend to agree with Chuq. This guy sets up a page and wastes our time, then posts a message on <a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">user talk:ScottDavis</a> telling him that he just had to test the system and see how reliable wikipedia is, while on the Davido, Victoria talk page, asks us whether we have nothing better to do with our lives than investigate fraudulent articles, refers to himself on this page as 'the sucker who started the article' and wants it put up on BJAODN. If it were the case that he was a well meaning wikipedian who wanted to test the system and intended to make valuable contributiotions, I'd perhaps be inclined to let him while keeping a close eye on him, but under the circumstances, I can't see why we shouldn't block him for a long time. What are the policies about that? Do we have to warn him before we block him? (I refer to him as 'him' instead of 'him or her' because the person who started this article originally called himself David Foley - the same guy who wrote about a boy named David Foley living in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Victoria_3fab.html" title="Hamilton, Victoria">Hamilton, Victoria</a>.

<dd>We didn't have to prove it incorrect. We could have said, "prove it, or else we delete it". Boring and Effective.</dd>
<dd>I think Cnwb did the look up because it was fun, and educational, and I don't see it as a waste. IMHO, it was a stylish victory in a complicated game. OK, the world isn't a better place for it, but hey, no dumb animals harmed in the making and all that.</dd>
<dd>If we admire the play, we can BJAODN with full credit to Cnwb and no credit to the vandal.</dd>

<p>I think that it is good that people are taking this project and its verifiability as seriously as Cnwb. This is naturally an unreliable source and it is to Cnwb's full credit for looking this up in verifiable sources.
