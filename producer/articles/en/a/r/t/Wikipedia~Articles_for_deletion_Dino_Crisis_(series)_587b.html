<p>This is actually two (or three) requests in one. I'm requesting to delete this article, change the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_d1e4.html" title="Dino Crisis">Dino Crisis</a> disambiguation into a redirect and then move <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_%28video_game%29_5139.html" title="Dino Crisis (video game)">Dino Crisis (video game)</a> to Dino Crisis. Personally I find this article unneccesary since Dino Crisis isn't really that large of a game franchise to cover it as a whole. The two sequels and spinoff could easily be mentioned in the article about the original game itself. Jonny2x4 22:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. See <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Evil_9d23.html" title="Resident Evil">Resident Evil</a> - same thing. This page does no harm and makes navigation easier, and I see no reason to delete. -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 15:59, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's a <b>big difference</b> between the two. <i>Resident Evil</i> has grown into a multimedia franchise spanning at least 14 games (including spinoffs), as well as a series of novelizations and films, since the release of the original game. <i>Dino Crisis</i> only had two sequels and a spinoff, all which could be easily mentioned and linked in the original game's article. Jonny2x4 18:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, instead of doing that, you could leave things as they are and not having other unrelated articles linked within a page where they don't belong cluttering it up. I see no harm how it is now -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 20:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unrelated how? The sequels and spinoff are obviously linked closely to the first game and they could all be easily mentioned within the original game's article with no trouble at all. They wouldn't clutter the article in any way that it's already is and the <i><a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_%28video_game%29_5139.html" title="Dino Crisis (video game)">Dino Crisis (video game)</a></i> article is in need of a cleanup anyway. <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viewtiful_Joe_6476.html" title="Viewtiful Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil_May_Cry_0667.html" title="Devil May Cry">Devil May Cry</a> are more popular franchises than Dino Crisis, but they're not large enough to warrant having an overall series article (although DMC might get one soon, considering it's already up to its fourth game and a new anime series).Jonny2x4 21:29, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, because adding information about sequels and spinoffs onto the page isn't shoving useless information in. Oh wait, yes it is. It's a page about the game, <i>not</i> the series, <i>not</i> the sequels or spinoffs. Also, bear in mind the linked <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viewtiful_Joe_6476.html" title="Viewtiful Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> page is a mess and very difficult to navigate and cements this pages existence. -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 19:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Dino Crisis (series) article differs greatly as stated above. Unlike <i>Resident Evil</i>, <i>Dino Crisis</i> isn't a popular franchise and is not going to expand anytime in the near future. A series page that lists four games and is unlikely to grow is a rather useless page, and everything on the series page can be included in the original <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_%28video_game%29_5139.html" title="Dino Crisis (video game)">Dino Crisis (video game)</a> article. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 00:18, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Isn't popular? How <i>neutral</i>. Like I say, dumping all this content on the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_%28video_game%29_5139.html" title="Dino Crisis (video game)">Dino Crisis (video game)</a> is just cluttering it up, as that page is about that game NOT the series. -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 19:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nobody's saying <i>Dino Crisis</i> is unpopular, but when compared to other PlayStation-era franchises, it isn't exactly as praised or remembered either. In fact, the last game got really mediocre scores from GameSpot and IGN. But that's besides the point. The <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viewtiful_Joe_6476.html" title="Viewtiful Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> article isn't cluttered, it has a very brief section covering all of them. Doing the same for <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_d1e4.html" title="Dino Crisis">Dino Crisis</a> won't clutter it. Likewise popular film franchise that aren't really long like <a href="../../../l/e/t/Lethal_Weapon_e91d.html" title="Lethal Weapon">Lethal Weapon</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scream_%28film%29.html" title="Scream (film)">Scream</a> don't have series article dedicated to them. I don't see what's so special about Dino Crisis to warrant one.Jonny2x4 01:37, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nobody's saying that it isn't popular? Well, aside from <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a>, I think you mean. And I disagree with you - I think those pages would greatly gain from disambiguation pages with an overview of the series, it's developers, its history and short summaries similar to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> page. Unfortunately, anonymous page creation was removed some months back&#160;:( -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 12:19, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You do realise, anonymous user, that there's <i>nothing on the Dino Crisis (series)</i> to clutter anything up? We're not doing a merge. We're deleting an empty series page, putting a short summary in the main <i>Dino Crisis</i> page and removing the disambiguation page. Rather than have a rather pointless disambiguation page and an empty series page, keep the series information centralised into the article readers are most likely to visit. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 02:18, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm saying adding several Wikilinks that are barely related to the main game is cluttering it up. Rather than having a simple, short, disambiguation page, you're shoving a bunch of Wikilinks onto a page where they aren't really needed. There's nothing to gain from its deletion. -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 12:19, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're putting one or two sentences in the introduction. What's so bad about that? There's nothing to gain? We're saving readers the trouble of going through a disambiguation page and/or a mildly useful series page. If you're going to argue against it, at least explain your points instead of just saying "there's nothing to gain". --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 00:40, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There's no reason for the page to exist. Unlike other game franchises, Dino Crisis does not exist outside of the games produced for the series. It appears to have been abandoned by Capcom (as it has seen no updates since <b>2003</b>), which makes further games unlikely. More to the point, <i>no information exists on the page which isn't duplicated in the articles themselves</i>. I would suggest a navigation box at the bottom (ala <a href="../../../d/e/v/Template%7EDevil_May_Cry_series_94cf.html" title="Template:Devil May Cry series">Template:Devil May Cry series</a>) and leave it at that. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 20:02, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I fail to see how the articles require a seperate article about the series when the individiual game articles are mostly stub-class (or not much better). It's not that we're going to delete the Dino Crisis individual game pages, just the Dino Crisis (series) page. While I could see supporting the creation of a Series page for <b>certain</b> game series, the Dino Crisis series doesn't really fit the bill. There are four games in the series, and the only two with similar gameplay are Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2. The third is practically unrelated and the fourth game is a Gun Survivor spinoff. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:10, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Okay, so if there is enough material to expand the other articles, instead of having this one here (which is kinda just useless no offense), why not just use a template like Lankybugger above suggested instead? Much less mess, and it goes along with other articles (there is no "Splatterhouse (series)" page or "Final Fight (series)" page), and that'll still let you expand these articles as is. What do you guy's think? Then this article isn't necessary.--<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKung_Fu_Man_00fe.html" title="User:Kung Fu Man">Kung Fu Man</a> 07:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
