<dd>Good choise of words. Very, very subblte. Sorry, bubba, but you are not "defending" your possition. You are desimminating propaganda.

<li><b>Delete</b> - The article is obviously a extremely non-NPOV. Aside from that, it is a space waster that should simply redirect to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_creationism_db9a.html" title="Young Earth creationism">Young Earth creationism</a>. Read the article all you want, it is plaqued with a non-NPOV. Also, as stated, the name is not in accordance with <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_Conventions_3170.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming Conventions">Wikipedia:Naming Conventions</a>. It also has a slew of grammatical errors, and needs to be cleaned up generally. But I would not waste my time doing that. Simply put, it needs to be deleted. Also, the above post suggests the over-devotion of the creator and editor of this article, and this sort of attitude will only induce more NPOV's in the coming edits.</li>

<dd>Ok, here's your chance to defend your article. One rule: you're not allowed to use the words "God" and "bible" or any synonyms. And you have to give evidence. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProject2501a_7385.html" title="User:Project2501a">Project2501a</a> 02:25, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Furthermore, Wikipedia is not a place to defend or preach your beliefs, this is obviously your intent. There should be no competing here, and to create an article like this in response to what you believe to be an ongoing competition between creationists and evolutionists only encourages the problem.<a href="../../../r/_/l/User%7ER_Lee_E_e1df.html" title="User:R Lee E">R Lee E</a> 00:20, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If there is ANYTHING that is said in that Article that us False, then feel free to check it out and correct it. If however, it is all True, then why in the world would you want to keep that from the public???</p>

<li>Well, "Truthteller" clearly has no familiarity at all with Wikipedia rules and policy, and they are being rather obnoxious. I don't see how this falls under speedy-delete, though. Just because someone is being annoying or arrogant shouldn't mean you can speedy-delete their article that's on VFD... --Whimemsz 00:35, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Obviously NPOV. To the user defending the article, welcome to Wikipedia, however articles such as this which obviously present only one side of an issue are unwelcomed on Wikipedia regardless of which opinion they take, whether pro or anti creationism. The debate is not whether there is anything true or false within the article, the debate is over whether the article should exist in the first place in regards to Wikipedia's rules and policies on which pages should be kept and whcih deleted. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 00:52, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Challenged to delete false data I did. The article now reads</li>
</ul>
<p>Young Earth Creationists base their beliefs on the evidence from Scripture, such as described in Genesis Chapters 1-3, clarified in Exodus 20:9-11, and alluded to by Christ, Himself, in Matthew 19:4</p>
<p>They also pick and choose from many different Geophysical, Astronomical, Bioligical, and Historical evidences to justify their prior held beliefs.</p>
<p>For example, the oldest living tree is between 4,000 and 5,000 years old, and yet it is still living. Perhaps it will live for another 10,000 (or more years). Using this as one evidence that something happened about 4,500 years ago that wiped out virtually all life on Planet Earth, such as the Flood of Noah is an example of that picking and choosing. 4.250.201.207 12:10, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Regardless of content change, the name of the page itself does not lend itself for Wikipedia's purposes—it ends in a comma. And now that a lot of information has been removed, why should the page not be simply redirected to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_creationism_db9a.html" title="Young Earth creationism">Young Earth creationism</a>? That article's name is more pertinent to the topic, and even though it has its own POV issues to sort through, it does it more thoroughly than this article will. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Babcock_85fc.html" title="User:Ben Babcock">Ben Babcock</a> 13:10, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I vote <b>Delete</b> after considering this rewrite; don't redirect this title on which nobody will search. POV, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a soapbox or discussion forum, and all verifiable sourced content exists in same or better form at the young-earth creationism article referenced above, so there's nothing needing to be merged. Any kind of superstition that garners this much controversy is noteworthy, but it's been better-documented before, and WP doesn't need poorly-presented and poorly-titled pieces rehashing the old unscientific claims. The only part of the article I agreed with was "They also pick and choose from many different ... evidences to justify their prior held beliefs." <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:05, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
