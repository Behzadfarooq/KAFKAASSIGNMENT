<b>Comment</b> Dont just blindly vote "delete". This is not a vote, this is a dialog to reach a conclusion. that is why it no longer is named "Vote For Deletion". My claim is undiputable:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is <b>A</b> theory among theories.</li>
<li>This is contested by very notable people, in all spheres of society</li>
<li>This is the most accpeted theory</li>
<li>This is accpeted as factaul by a great many people</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not to present a theory this hotly disputed as factual, that is POV</li>
<li>Wikiepedia is to give more space to more accepted theories, but it is not to let it totaly dominate a article.</li>

<p>If it is POV to call it a "conspiracy theory", then why are all other theories labeled "conspiracy theory"? those being labeled as "conspiracy theory" clearly proves that it is NPOV to call it a "conspiracy theory".

<p>That is exactly what im talking about! Why is this theroy fully preseted in the main article, while all other theories are jamed in one single article?

<p><br />
My point is easy: It is POV to give this theory FULL coverage in the main aricle, while all others get a single article to inhabit. How is that NPOV?</p>
<p>This article IS the most widely accepted, but that does not give FULL access to the main article. That is pov. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:09, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because it is, by far, the most widely accepted and best proven account of the events of that shameful act of violence. Pretending otherwise and portraying it as just another conspiracy theory would be non-factual. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 15:15, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>yes, i agree that it is "by far, the most widely accepted". And i also are convinded that you belive it is the "best proven account". But i dont not agree that it is the "best proven account". And wikipedia claiming it is, is simly pov. Wikipedia claiming it is Factual is POV, your POV, the majority POV. But POV non the less.</p>
<p>And it was truly a shameful act of violence.</p>
<p>And yes, it IS a theory of a conpiracy. Are you claiming it is pov to call it a conspiracy theory?</p>
<p>I do NOT say it should be treated as the others, it needs to get proportionaly more space, but it does not have 100% support, and giving it 100% coverage in the main article is pov, your pov, and not my pov. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:20, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You ask if I think calling a <i>theory about a conspiracy</i> a <i>conspiracy theory</i> is POV. Yes, I think it is very much POV.

<p>Guys, look at yourself, just because i took the official theory and made it NPOV, that is, not claiming it to be factual, you became so uppset that without even bothering to read the article, you started lanbeling it as a "outlandish claim"!</p>

<dd>Please, dont give me that. If you ask me, there is no difference between a "conspiracy theory" and "theory about a conspiracy". Some people tried to claim that conspiracy theory" had a negative conotation, and thus should not be used in titles since it was pov, but the majority of wikipedians did not agree with him.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Striver, I read the article before I rendered my opinion and my reasoning stands as stated: You did not source your claims nor provide any evidence that this is a widely held theory, or in your words <i>"accepted as factual by many people in many parts of the world"</i>. I know this is the official account and like I said, it should be ridiculously easy to source your claims... but you have to source it. You can't just assume that everybody knows this is the mostly widely held belief of who was behind September 11th. Furthermore, I don't see any reason for this article to exist as a standalone. It is mentioned in the main September 11 article and if you have a concern that the concept that some people see this explanation as a "conspiracy theory" is not accurately portrayed there, then mention (along with sourcing that some people consider the Bin Laden connection a conspiracy theory) at <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>... and don't automatically assume bad faith just because I disagree with you.... and it's not a "vote" as you stated, this is a gathering of opinions.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:13, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Ok, sorry if i gave the impression of assuming bad faith. I apologise.</p>
<p>About sourcing, what do you expect me to source? That all western governments officialy belive in the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory? That the 9/11 commision belives in it? That every single major newspaper in the USA and Europ belive its factual? That anyone not beliving in the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory is considered a idiot? That i have on several occasions claimed to be a nut case for not beliving in the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory?</p>
<p>I dont get it. The <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> claims the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory to be factual, and therefore i have put a pov sign on it. I suspect we are not conecting....</p>
<p>Im sure you dont mean that the article should be deleted for not sourcing such an obvious statment?</p>
<p>My reason of it being a standalone is simply that it is POV to give a full account of it in the main article, while all other conspicacy theory COMBINED get this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Almost immediately after the attacks, conspiracy theories about possible U.S. Government involvement and other speculations were fostered by political opponents to the Bush administration, anti-American groups, those looking to make a quick profit, and some who had doubts about the mainstream media account.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That is POV. I didnt try to put it in <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, since i would probly get baned for it&#160;:P</p>
<p>Further, it is the most reqognized conspiracy theories, so if any, this one should get its own article. Optimaly, the main article should only state the non-contested facts, then have a section where it summs all conspiracy theories, including the bin laden one, giving the bin laden one most space, then linking to <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. The <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> should the START by summing the bin laden one, and linking to it, then going though all others on it self. OR just have all conspiracy theories on the same article.</p>
<p>It is simply POV to present the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory as the factual in the main article, and everyone else being sumed in two lines as shuved into a single article.</p>
<p>It is even pov to present Bin Ladin conspicacy theory as a theory, and only giving all others only two lines, and shuving them to a single article.</p>
<p>Just on a hunch, i belive this could be NPOV: Presesnting non-contested facts, then giving the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory some space, then giving all others theories COMBINED 30% of that space. If ONE or several theory is called a conspicacy theory, the ALL should. either all are called conspicacy theory, or none.</p>
<p>I repeat: It is simply POV to give ONE conspiracy theory FULL coverage in the main article, to the point of it not even needing any article, while shuving everything else into one single article.</p>
<p>It is also pov to label some, but not all, as a conspicacy theory.</p>
<p>It is also pov to present one conspicacy theory as factual.</p>
<p><br />
One more thing: You seem to assume that i belive "conspicacy theory" is a pejorative label. Some people do. I dont. I regard all theories about who and why the attacks where done as a conspicacy theories: a theory about a conspiracy.</p>
<p>In that view, i dont even see what this means: "along with sourcing that some people consider the Bin Laden connection a conspiracy theory"</p>
<p>That sentance seems to to say that you belive the "conspicacy theory" to be pejorative. During my whole argumentation, i have assumed it is not pejorative. The reason is that people tried to remove the "conspicacy theory" from titles, saying it was pejorative, but the majority did not agree with them.</p>
<p>Anyone beliving "conspicacy theory" is a pejorative term needs to support the removal of it from ALL article, since it is POV to have pejorative terms in titles.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:30, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Some people seem to belive that a "conspicacy theory" is not the same thing as a "theory about a conspiracy". How do you objectivly decide if one theory is a "conspicacy theory" or a "theory about a conspiracy"? I claim it is not possible to do it obectivly. If im wrong, please correct me.</p>

<dd>Striver, no problem... no offense taken. I may be riding my sourcing stick a little hard today. I'll see if I can find something that would satisfy me.</dd>
<dd>I don't think you would necessarily take alot of heat for adding this to the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> article if it was written correctly. "Conspiracy Theory" is sort of a loaded term because it suggests to some people that there is some doubt as to the validity of whatever is being claimed. Calling something a "Conspiracy Theory" <b>is</b> generally considered a pejoritive term (and indeed while it appears you did not intend it that way, I read it that way); at least in American English. It evokes UFOs, Alien Abductions, and a vast network of people who were dedicated to killing John. F. Kennedy. What I meant by "along with sourcing that some people consider the Bin Laden connection a conspiracy theory" was in the light of "Conspiracy Theory" as the possible pejorative: simply that while a majority of people believe Bin Ladin and Al'Qaeda were materially responsible for the September 11th attacks, ther are people out there that do not believe this to be the case and that his connection to 9/11 was manufactured. Perhaps I misinterpreted your intent with this article, but that also illustrates the connotation that is inherent in the term "Conspiracy Theory". I can see you disagree, but I imagine if you took a poll here, the majority would consider "Conspiracy Theory" to be a negative connotation term.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:59, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bro, if that is the case, and we are supposed to agree on that definition, then why is wikipedia claiming my view to be "doubt as to the validity" of its claim?</p>

<p>How is it not like renaming <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> to Jesus worshiping?</p>
<p>I was assuming there was no differnce, so i named it "9/11 Bin Laden conspiracy theory".

<p>I apologize if it is perceived as bad faith. Yes, it was in some way a rhetorical question. But i stil stand by the question: What is the difference, and how do we OBJECTIVLY claim one is "conspicacy theory" or a "theory about a conspiracy". I know that some people perceive "conspicacy theory" to be objective, while a "theory about a conspiracy" to be pejorative.</p>
<p>Tom harrison, Are you among them? Do you belive there is a difference between them, and that "conspicacy theory" is pejorative? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:42, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I personaly do not belive there is a difference, not more that SOME people belive "conspicacy theory" to be pejorative. The discution of wheter "conspicacy theory" should or should not be used in Wikipedia articles concluded that the word was NPOV, so im going with that standard. Both being NPOV means that none is pejorative, meaning that both "conspicacy theory" and "theory about a conspiracy" are synonymos. If not one of them being pejorative, what other difference are there? I can not see any other difference. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:45, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tom, you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Not at all. A conspiracy theory is an objectively identifiable thing. A theory involving a conspiracy is different objectively identifiable thing. There is no issue with using 'conspiracy theory' in article titles, as long as it's used correctly.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Please Tom, i urge you, spell out the difference, dont dance around it. Say:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"A "conspiracy theory" is X, while a "theory involving a conspiracy" Z, and Z and X are not equals since Q"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you do that, you will inevitibly come to one of the following conclusions:</p>
<p>A: There is no diffence between Z and X</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>B: There is a difference, being that one is less credible.</p>
<p><br />
If the answer is B, then it is pov to use it in Wikipedia titles. But earlier discution have concluded that it is NOT pov to use it in titles. Thus, the answer must be "There is no diffence between Z and X".</p>
<p>And it is with that reasoning i say its NPOV to say "9/11 Bin Laden conspiracy theory" --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:55, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

That is NPOV to say as a fact. But it is POV to say that Bin laden did it. The event is one issue, who and why is a totaly other. And there are many theories of who and why it was made. My problem is that ONE of this theories is singled out as factual, and thus merged with the factual parts of the event.

<p><b>Delete</b> There is no need for this article. The entire basis for its existence is fully covered in the 9/11 conspiracy article. Whether Striver likes it or not, the 9/11 commission account is the verified factual account until or unless proven otherwise. It does not have the status of theory, it has the status of historical fact so does not need to be presented as a theory. Other historical facts that are disputed do not lose their status as fact simply because there are conspiracy theories about them. The format that existed with the main article covering what is the established historical record and a separate section regarding conspiracy theories that dispute the historical record seems perfectly reasonable. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:57, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
