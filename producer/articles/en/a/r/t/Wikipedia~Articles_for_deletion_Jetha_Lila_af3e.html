<li><b>Acad Ronin</b>: I am the creator of the article/stub. I posted a longer reply to Folajimi on their talk page. My key point is that I can see no value to throwing away factual, documented information. This lead to the article cited could benefit someone researching Indians in East Africa, the impact of the Zanzibar Revolution on the ethnic make-up of Zanzibar, or its economy, and a variety of other topics. The source article is a chapter in an obscure book and I only found it after years of keeping an eye out for any info on Jetha Lila for some work I am doing on the history of foreign banks in East Africa. What makes Wikipedia valuable is not the articles on well-known topics. That information is readily available in many places. It is the information that specialists and hobbyists post on arcana that is Wikipedia's unique contribution. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcad_Ronin_ad22.html" title="User:Acad Ronin">Acad Ronin</a> (<a href="../../../a/c/a/User_talk%7EAcad_Ronin_ff27.html" title="User talk:Acad Ronin">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Acad_Ronin_d0c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Acad Ronin">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Acad Ronin</b>: If you are concerned about verifiability, read the source article. The author based it on field and archival research in Zanzibar. The reason I was looking for more info re Jetha Lila was because the name of the bank and the fact that it was a private bank of Indian origin had shown up in various directories of banks, and in a scholarly article of banking in East Asia. As for notability, I reiterate my point that almost by definition there is a surfeit of information on notable topics. One of the things I like about Wikipedia is that for instance I can look up almost any US Navy vessel by name or number, and find a capsule history, contributed by someone who is a ship geek, just as I am a bank geek. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcad_Ronin_ad22.html" title="User:Acad Ronin">Acad Ronin</a> (<a href="../../../a/c/a/User_talk%7EAcad_Ronin_ff27.html" title="User talk:Acad Ronin">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Acad_Ronin_d0c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Acad Ronin">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Point of Information</b>: For the sake of argument, let's say that the source qualifies. How can I obtain a copy of the source article for the purpose of verification? <i>(Rule of thumb is to have two independent sources, but that is a different matter...)</i> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolajimi_dee8.html" title="User:Folajimi">Folajimi</a> (<a href="../../../f/o/l/User_talk%7EFolajimi_931b.html" title="User talk:Folajimi">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Folajimi_230d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Folajimi">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>You could visit a library where it is available. As all necessary bibliographical information is in the reference, I don't understand exactly what your problem is here. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:21, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The only problem I have is with your tone. In case you haven't noticed, the author said that the information came from an obscure source. Hence the PoI. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolajimi_dee8.html" title="User:Folajimi">Folajimi</a> 13:26, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry for the tone, but my point is that now, <i>after</i> the author has located this article discussing the topic and used it to write this article, it will not be as difficult for you, me or anyone else to find it again, because we already have the reference. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 13:41, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia has rules regarding the <i><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a></i> of content which is submitted. As it stands, authenticating the cited reference is an issue, due to the inaccessibility of the current source. In other words, saying "Trust me, this reference is legit" is suspect, at best. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolajimi_dee8.html" title="User:Folajimi">Folajimi</a> 13:59, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article needs work, but I don't see any real argument for deletion here. This is an Indian trading house and bank in East Africa that was founded in the 1880s and closed in the 1960s. There is no reason to expect a large number of Google hits. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 13:03, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Uppland. The article doesn't seem particularly controversial, so if AR says they found a copy of the book, that's good enough. If it were controversial, we could ask for more sources. BTW, the Google hits that there are point to notability. For example, [<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/nf/abdulsf/Memoirs/zanzibar.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.angelfire.com/nf/abdulsf/Memoirs/zanzibar.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>] says they controlled Zanzibar's financial network.

The original author has provided a reference. It would seem to me that <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> would require that those bringing up <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> should provide an account of their failed attempts to verify the citation. For a book, the first step would be to see if the cited work actually exists. This can be done by checking the online catalog at a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_library.html#Legal_Deposit_and_Copyright" title="National library">depository library</a> such as the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> or the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Library_1c04.html" title="British Library">British Library</a>. Another step would be to check to see if the work is in <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldCat_6cab.html" title="WorldCat">WorldCat</a>. (Anyone in the United States who is affiliated with any College or University, or has a library card at a public library has either direct or indirect (via the librarian) access to WorldCat.) I have done this, and the work cited does exist. If I truly doubted the work actually covers the material, I could order it via inter-library loan, although that might take a few weeks. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 15:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have added a second source to the article. This source is what sent me off on the hunt for further information as it only mentions the bank's existence and its being an Indian private bank in Zanzibar. As for the main reference, the Tominaga article, I just went back to WorldCat and it is available from 39+ libraries, including more than thirty in the US. Anyone wanting to find the article could get it via Interlibrary Loan. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcad_Ronin_ad22.html" title="User:Acad Ronin">Acad Ronin</a> 16:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"<b>Jetha Lila</b> was a private bank founded in <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanzibar.html" title="Zanzibar">Zanzibar</a> in 1880 by the Bombay-born merchant Jetha Liladhar, later taking responsibility for control of Zanzibar's finances. The bank's initial operations were confined to banking commission activities, however in 1910 it began <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_exchange_market.html" title="Foreign exchange market">money-changing</a> and in 1920 represented the interests in Zanzibar of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Bank_20a6.html" title="Westminster Bank">Westminster Bank</a>. In 1933 it was issued a trading license by the Zanzibar government to operate as a bank, and became responsible for controlling Zanzibar's financial interests from the 1930's until the 1964 revolution in Zanzibar and the overthrow of its Sultan.

<dd>I'm not sure of all the facts on this subject, so the above will probably need to be rewritten somewhat. Given the sources you have, it should be possible to produce something like the above which I am sure everyone here would support. Much of the battle over the notability of subjects in Wikipedia article is won or lost in the first sentence of the article; that's why it's best to start with a sentence that clearly defines the subject, hence: <i>Jetha Lila was a private bank founded in Zanzibar in 1880.</i> --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 18:35, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>strong keep</b>, I think its quite absurd to have to debate this. Making this sort of information accessible is precisely what Wikipedia is for. Further, I'd like to make the point that the original referrer's objection is uninformed, and I will run through the correct procedure because I've seen this error more than once recently. The article came to AfD because he couldnt 'verify notability'. I can't verify the notability of a lot of things, but as long as I read the content of the article, I know the (unverified) subject of the article is notable. I then observe the references, and know that the content of the article is verifiable. I <i>dont</i> combine the two steps. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 07:17, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are strongly advised to act in a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civilised</a> manner; casting aspersions will get you nowhere. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolajimi_dee8.html" title="User:Folajimi">Folajimi</a> 09:58, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think you mean civil, not civilised. Nevertheless, if I have somehow offended you, I apologise. However, please note that my choice of words was not meant to offend, but to exactly describe the situation. Please familiarise yourself with - or, perhaps, read again - <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>; you will note that my points are borne out by the consensus on those policy pages. Once again, there are specific 'cutoffs' for notability for educational institutions and academics and bands and so on; but for something of this sort, where a strong argument for notability - namely, control over the finances of a sovereign state - are clearly set out in the article, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is satisfied and the problem reduces simply to one of verifiability. Given the provision of references that satisfy the reliable source test, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is met as well. The problem arises if you try to apply the two criteria simultaneously. That is not something you have to do. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a></li>
