<p>non notable monk, material unverifiable; I can't find any references to this person outside of the work of Richard Shaw Brown, who also seems to be the main author of this article. Could be notable, but who knows? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 21:15, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>---Dear Editors, I am surprised there is no other reference to Krishnadas Babaji. Among the 1000 disciples of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Takura he was the favorite, maybe because he never took disciples, even though he was highly realized. He was an "avadhuta" sadhu, or one who posseses nothing. In <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaishnava.html" title="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> philosophy such humility its treated with the highest respect known to man, in most all religions. The irony is that he is the MOST qualified to be included among notable persons, yet is desires it the least, He couldn't speak English so I was the rare Westerner who got to know him and see his life. But if he doesn't fit then please delete him as your policy. OTHERWISE: May I reduce his page to a short blurb? Thanks, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Shaw_Brown_310c.html" title="Richard Shaw Brown">Richard Shaw Brown</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This person is notable enough to receive an biographical article. Would recommend that sources be included in article to make it conform with <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Sources</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Though the article itself states several times "He is notable because...," none of the reasons given actually establish notability. Furthermore, there are no sources so verifiability has not been met either. He may be notable, some of the text hints at this... but without sources we can't keep it. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:17, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep for now</b> The article was tagged for notability less than two weeks ago, which may not have been enough time for its author to come up with reliable sources. The author seems to be confusing notability with notoriety; I've added a clarification on that article's talk page in the hopes of steering further edits in the right direction. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 02:07, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Technically, the author of an article is supposed to include all citations when the article is created. We are not required in any way to keep unsourced information and it's perfectly legitimate to delete information that isn't sourced without warning. An AfD lasts five days; there is still time left to add sources before the AfD is closed, sources that should have been included when the original information is added. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
</li>
<li>That is great! I don't know about laws in other countries, but If the VNN is a serialized newspaper that is printed at least four times a year, it qualifies as a bonafied periodical under US law and will definitely satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> for being non-trivial. Can you get us more information on VNN?

<li>The article in VNN appears to be about a different person with a similar name. The Krishnadas Babaji of the Wikipedia article died in 1980; the obit in VNN is about someone who died in 2003. I can't read the material in the pdf, so I have no idea whether it relates to the person that Richard S. Brown is writing about. Is "Krishnadas Babaji" even a "real" name? Or is it more of a name that someone might take on becoming a monk, like a Christian monk named "Brother Bartholomew"? There may be many monks with this name. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 23:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Clarification: the article listed as "VNN World" does not seem to be about 'our' Babaji. Of the three links added by RSB, 2 don't presently work, <s>and the third actually does seem to be about 'our' Babaji, although the names don't match completely. I think we are making a little progress. I am still a little concerned about how notable this person is, but at least we have some independent evidence that he existed.</s> --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 00:21, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Further comment: It is unclear how much value to put on articles on VNN; articles are not written by reporters but instead <a href="http://www.vnn.org/participate/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vnn.org/participate/index.html" rel="nofollow">solicited from viewers</a>, although they are supposed to meet <a href="http://www.vnn.org/about/publication.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vnn.org/about/publication.html" rel="nofollow">certain standards</a>. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 01:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The free participation model of VNN does raise questions of reliability as a source, but it does not discredit it totally. Yet, as Wikipedia itself suggests that we should not cite other articles on Wikipedia, any source shadier than Wikipedia itself should be considered not up to the standards of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Also, <a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">User:Rsbj66</a> has added his own website as an external link further diluting his own credibility against his claims of not promoting himself or his organizations. -- <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmana_7e3b.html" title="User:Emana">Emana</a> 03:39, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh. So, we are presently left with afaik <i>no</i> functional outside references to the subject of this afd. I am also coming to believe, having looked at these various articles and some of the VNN site, that the identifying names and titles in the article are so common that it is very easy to get confused between different Babajis, Krishnadases, Maharajes, and Srilas. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:25, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article in Italian seems very clearly to be about a different person - compare the photos, and also look at the fact that that person seems to have been still alive in the 1990s, while "our" Babaji died around 1980. And the list of "saints" is just a list, and I can't tell which name you believe matches - there are many similar names. As I have said above, that is one of the major problems here - it seems there are many monks with very similar names. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:06, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
