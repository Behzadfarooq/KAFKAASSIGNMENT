<p>I've added this sub-heading because I've attempted an overhaul of the article. As it was written, it only discussed found objects with relevance to art, yet they are equally relevant to music, so a simple redirect is not a good idea. However, as the article was previously there was no mention of music at all. The article is a perfectly valid subject for an article, though it needs to be strongly tied in with the related subject at found art, probably using {{<a href="../../../s/e/e/Template%7ESeemain_adeb.html" title="Template:Seemain">seemain</a>}} or similar, and needs to be moved to found object, singular, which is currently a redirect. It also needs, though, to be just as storngly tied in with music. If you've already voted, I'd like to ask you to reconsider your stance based on what the article looks like now. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reviewed the latest version, but again there's nothing in <a href="../../../f/o/u/Found_objects.html" title="Found objects">Found objects</a> that's not already in <a href="../../../f/o/u/Found_art.html" title="Found art">Found art</a> - the latter article includes a section on Found sounds in music.

None of these applies any more, and there are other considerations. a)should <a href="../../../f/o/u/Found_art.html" title="Found art">Found art</a> also cover the music info (I would say no—there should be some equivalent such as Found music or Found objects in music b)Should there be a <a href="../../../f/o/u/Found_object.html" title="Found object">Found object</a> article covering the range of uses: art, music, what else—theatre? architecture? interior design? etc. I think there is a strong case for this. I have left messages on the talk pages of both <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Arts_d4ad.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Arts">WikiProject Arts</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Visual_arts_ab0a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Visual arts">WikiProject Visual arts</a> and suggest the best solution now may be to hand the issue over to the project(s), so that any decision can be integrated in a wider arts approach, rather than assessed in isolation. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:19, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For found objects in music there are of course <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musique_concr%C3%A8te.html" title="Musique concrète">musique concrète</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampling_%28music%29.html" title="Sampling (music)">sampling (music)</a>... I agree that it would be a good idea to have a more general discussion on how to organize this subject, also because I don't like it that common terms like <a href="../../../r/e/a/Readymade.html" title="Readymade">readymade</a> and <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objet_trouv%C3%A9.html" title="Objet trouvé">objet trouvé</a> redirect to the far less common <a href="../../../f/o/u/Found_art.html" title="Found art">found art</a>. Personally I think it would be best to have an introduction at <a href="../../../f/o/u/Found_art.html" title="Found art">found art</a>, which links to articles on found objects in music (<a href="../../../m/u/s/Musique_concr%C3%A8te.html" title="Musique concrète">musique concrète</a>), in plastic arts (<a href="../../../r/e/a/Readymade.html" title="Readymade">readymade</a>) and film (<a href="../../../f/o/u/Found_footage.html" title="Found footage">found footage</a> - we don't even have that!).

<li><b>Withdraw nomination for delete</b> - Because of the rewrite and the other issues that have been brought up, it seemed like this should no longer be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>protect</b> against recreation. This group appears to be non-notable. It is a small group (111 members are claimed) of vandals that got two minor news mentions. They like to get attention, disrupt the activities of others and embarrass people. They get a fair amount of hits on their website, but not that many and just getting a lot of hits would not make them notable. If they reached the level of borderline notability, I would say delete it so that they don't get recognition, but they don't even get that close. Also, it is likely that members and opponents will continuously vandalize the article and since they are not important, Wikipedia loses more than it gains by having it. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:04, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <i>but do not block for later recreation</i>. I agree that Mr. Cho is certainly prolific, possibly even note<i>d</i> in his particular sphere of interest, I don't see that he is particularly <i>notable</i> as per Wikipedia policy. Most of his Google hits are articles by him, but none appear to be about him other than those which are autobiographical.

<li><b>Keep</b> Not vanity. I don't see this as a vanity page. He is a public figure and even is considered a celebrity in some circles that is well known in auto racing, racecar building, business, and is a nationally recognized expert on credit card fraud. The wikipedia page about vanity articles says, "There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia" and "Lack of fame is not the same as vanity." Just because someone is not famous outside of the auto racing industry or credit card fraud legislation advocacy doesn't mean that their page here is vanity. You can find articles about this man in the wall street journal, on the web pages of the CBS evening news, DIY network, IMDB, and Car &amp; Driver magazine just for starters. Looking back at the revisions of this wikipedia entry for Gary Howell, it does look like it was updated to include new info about him and also "vandalized" a few times. If he is famous enough to have his wikipedia entry vandalized, then he is famous enough for this not to be a vanity page. Christopher-B 17:10, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Swedish. "TheHabboWWE started as a little organisation(?) in the Internet hotel HabboHotel." It's clearly not about a person, but is something about wrestling: "Year III began with Backlash, where Eddie Guerrero became WHC for the first time (last four words are in English)."

<li>Well, the definition of cruft on Wikipedia is "a selection of content (that) is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question." <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 07:15, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>... only on the grounds that it is massively culled down. While the mod culture of BF1942 was very extensive, that fact does not justify listing each and every mod that was ever conceived. A large number of these mods were never released - they should not be listed - we dont list songs never recorded, or books never published, etc. An issue which probably has no democratic solution is that there is no hard and fast definition of a mod. I could edit a couple of textures, call it a mod, and release it. This mod would deserve absolutely no recognition in an encyclopedia. My suggestion is to find an agreement on the minimum number of verified downloads that a particular mod has had, and only include those above it in this article. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemy_B_eda6.html" title="User:Remy B">Remy B</a> 08:47, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's a good argument for creating an article about Riverside Theatre, Iowa City’s only resident professional non-profit theatre group, now celebrating its 25 year -- not for keeping this article. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckRose_0826.html" title="User:BuckRose">BuckRose</a> 14:36, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What's the difference between that theatre group and this one, Iowa City's only regularly performing improv group? Understandably, Paperback Rhino has not been around for 25 years, but everyone has to start somewhere. And the group has been around for 4 years, much longer than <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> predicted based on that 3 year old article he read. Paperback Rhino shows no signs of stopping either, as the group only continues to grow. --Asquiar03</li>
<li>Look at <a href="http://www.riversidetheatre.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.riversidetheatre.org/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and you may see a few differences. Permanent building, regular season, <b>paid</b> actors, Shakespeare theatre built in city park. I wish PB well, but it hasn't achieved significance yet.</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> I've argued for deleting this article for some time. First of all because Croatophobia is really only a term made up to deflect criticism, legitimate or not, of certain aspects of Croatian history and politics. By applying the phobia suffix it tries to imply that such criticism is irrational. Finally, it isn't a word in English and isn't used outside of Croatia. If it should be included, then the definition should be something like "term used by some media in Croatia to characterize criticism of Croatia, Croatian politics or aspects of Crotian history.<a href="../../../o/s/l/User%7EOsli73_41ba.html" title="User:Osli73">Osli73</a> 21:23, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: If this is a notable phenomenon, <i>the fact that no English word exists for it (yet) is not a deletion argument</i>, exactly because Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a> and does not write about words in the English language but about concepts and objects in the real world. If "Croatophobia" is real, or there are notable enough allegations that it is, the English Wikipedia should still be able to write about it using <i>some title</i>, even if the only sources are in Croatian or other languages, and the entry has to borrow a foreign word to describe it (we do that all the time with, for instance, obscure theological concepts in Hinduism or Islam, that can only be described through borrowing words in Sanskrit or Arabic unknown to the average educated English-speaker). (I am still skeptical about this article from the point of view of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy, and not really prepared to recommend to keep it, but I think some of the deletion arguments are faulty.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:30, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I respectfully disagree. I'm not saying that we should delete it because it's not an English word (otherwise, tons of entries would disappear from WP). I'm saying it should be deleted because you can't simply make up an English word and assume that it will eventually become the word to describe their topic, which is borderline <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">Not a crystal ball</a>. The word itself is also strong POV and OR, considering there were 22 hits on Yahoo! for this "Croatian" word and many of them were Wiki related <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Croatophobia&amp;sm=Yahoo%21+Search&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Croatophobia&amp;sm=Yahoo%21+Search&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.

<dd>I think that <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> has a point here. If the word is actually used in other languages then it should still be in the English encyclopedia, or at least shouldn't be automatically deleted because we in the English world are unaware of it. The English Wikipedia should not be only about English and/or American concepts and ideas, but rather an English translation of ALL ideas. And if Croatophobia is a real sentiment in other cultures or languages I think we should know about it. I'm not sure the support is there from the other languages, but I agree that it shouldn't be so readily deleted. It is not the same as TomCruiseaphobia because nobody actually uses that term in any language. <a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoeticsage_1b49.html" title="User:Noeticsage">Noetic Sage</a> 19:44, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The word is, according to article, not used even in Croatian, until some journalist coined it in 1999. It does not seem to be widely used word at all - croatian word gets about 10 hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=kroatofobija+&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=kroatofobija+&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. The article with similar title has been deleted from german wikipedia (<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroatophobie" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroatophobie" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroatophobie</a> - notice that the link exist in google hits, so it was recently deleted). The main concern is not about the word (the title could in principle be changed to something like anti-croatian sentiment), but that it is a OR construction, which bases the "evidence" of the existence of the subject of the article on some web formums etc. - clearly a violation of NOR policy. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, after all. Rockie21 20:05, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Linguistic quasi-arguments are, essentially-laughable. Any significant hostility towards a specific ethnic/national group or ideological/"racial" construct is expressed, generally, by a Greek (sometimes Latin) neologism combining the name of a particular nation &amp; the suffix -phobia. Hence well known Francophobia, Anglophobia, Russophopia, Europhobia,...and probably less known Sinophobia, ...You can add words I'm not certain one can find in a dictionary, but are meaningful anyway: Hibernophobia, Albanophobia, Polonophobia, Brazilophobia, Negrophobia, ....As I see, the existence of the article is disputed, mainly, along two following lines: a) there is no such a word in English dictionary. Remark: since this word has been used at least once in a news article, it certainly <b>is</b> an English word- the fact that dictionary writers were too lazy (or, more realistically, slower in updates) to inscribe it as a "dictionary word", means nothing. Hence, IMO, "language argument" is worthless 2) the second objection would be that such a thing does not exist. Well, while I can, to a degree, sympatzhize with the 1st objection &amp; find a value in it, the 2nd objection I find personally offensive. Examples like <a href="http://www.srpska-mreza.com/Croatia/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.srpska-mreza.com/Croatia/index.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, <a href="http://www.suc.org/culture/library/genocide/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suc.org/culture/library/genocide/index.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, speak for themselves-although, it would be even more visible if the Serbian academician Vasilije Krestić's <a href="http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.yu/sr-l/1998/10/article-17.html" class="external text" title="http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.yu/sr-l/1998/10/article-17.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> about "Croatian mustiness of the soul", or <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojislav_%C5%A0e%C5%A1elj_a9fd.html" title="Vojislav Šešelj">Vojislav Šešelj</a>'s magnum opus, downloadable in Serbian Cyrillic <a href="http://media.srpskinacionalisti.com/knjige/Ideologija%20srpskog%20nacionalizma.pdf?" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.srpskinacionalisti.com/knjige/Ideologija%20srpskog%20nacionalizma.pdf?" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> were translated in English: here we read whole chapters on "Thousand years of Croatian barbarism" (p.486), "Croatian savagery in folk songs" (p. 495), "Animalistic urges of Croatian national being" (p. 529), "The Croat savage mentality is repugnant to the Italians" (p. 537), "Croatian people is guilty of Ustaša crimes", (p. 617), "Crime-the spiritual food for Croatian national being" (p. 627) etc, etc. Now- Šešelj's Radical party is <b>the</b> strongest party in <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia_and_Montenegro_aebc.html" title="Serbia and Montenegro">Serbia and Montenegro</a> (ca. 40% of the popular vote) &amp; this is their leader and ideologue's masterwork.

As far as examples of Croatophobia on wikipedia, one need not go much further: just check the "contributions" like the following ones: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/SradkaW" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/SradkaW" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/SradkaW</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Petrinja" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Petrinja" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Petrinja</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Purger" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Purger" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Purger</a> etc. etc. What's the purpose of these "contribs"-save the defamation of Croats &amp; all things Croatian&#160;?

<li>As I have pointed out above, the fact that no English word is established for something is not a valid argument not to have an article on a particular topic, so I agree with you on that point. However, the problem remains that this looks like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> in Wikipedia terms. You are referring to what you consider <i>examples</i> of croatophobia (and so is the article), while what you should refer to is someone who has written <i>about</i> croatophobia or whatever name s/he would chose to use for it. Some random Serbian contributors' purportedly anti-Croatian edits on Wikipedia, for instance, are completely useless as sources for a Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't quite follow your way of reasoning. It's not just me, but, I guess any mentally sane person's perception that statements like "The thirst for blood is the X-nation's ethnic being", "The X-nation is filled wirth hatred towards Y-nation" are examples of "X-nationphobia". It's no original research, but a simple consensus on what mental (in)sanity looks like. As for Croatophobic wikipedinas, I've referred to them simply as illustration of this mentality-not as a "proof" wiki should accept or cite. But, gloves off, for a moment: how would any rational person characterize an imaginary wiki contributor whose edits or "contribs" would consist, 90%, of the following stuff: they write on, say, American Negroes (I'll skip a PC term "African-American") by insisting that: Negroes are 13% of the US population &amp; over 50% of "American crime"; they score lower than whites at IQ tests; they have extremely high percentage of out-of-wedlock births; they are overrepresented in the field of violent crime; they ...And this imaginary contributor doesn't say a word on Negro contribution to American music, sports, literature etc. So-how would you characterize user whose edits are profiled in such a way&#160;? Would they be rightly dubbed Negrophobes&#160;?

<li><b>Comment</b> Yesterday I was going to argue for keeping the article, because - I must admit - I'm not radically opposed to the "we think that" type of OR. After all, articles on <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Bosniak_sentiment_89e4.html" title="Anti-Bosniak sentiment">anti-Bosniak sentiment</a> do exist, and they are mostly OR, too. Furthermore, I had already been accused of Croatophobia several times by Croatian users, so I assumed that it was already an established concept in Croatian. However, I changed my mind when I found out that on the whole Internet (judging from Google hits), there are only 5 real occurrences of "kroatofobija", 2 real occurrences of "hrvatofobija" and 1 real occurrence of "croatofobija". This means that the concept isn't established even <i>in Croatian</i> yet, let alone in English - it has been used just a couple of times, and you just can't define Croatophobia as including opinions X, Y, and Z, when almost nobody actually uses the word. Using wiki as a vehicle to create and propagate a concept is, IMO, going just a bit too far. On the other hand, if things like <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia</a> and similar stuff are to stay, then I guess most of the current content of Croatophobia should be kept under a title like, say, <i>Perceived anti-Croatian prejudices and propaganda</i>. So I guess my vote would have to be something like "keep, but rename and change", or "delete, and create another article with partly similar content". Since the outcome of both would be the same, I am more or less:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmmm....it seems to me that at least a part of the "deletionist" activity here is a pretty obvious example of Croatophobia. I don't care much about personal contribs, but-isn't it suspicious that all I can see about a "speedy delete" contributor is this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rockie21" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rockie21" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rockie21</a> So-what can we deduce from this&#160;? What can we infer from the user's edits that are focused almost exclusively (ca. 10% of "other" edits are a tactical smokescreen) on Croatian-defamation activity&#160;? And other, essentially clueless users, only repeat the mantra on the google counts&#160;? So-what&#160;? Google is a god&#160;? Is this a joke&#160;? Is this kangaroo-voting (maybe I've invented a neologism, kinda) meant to reveal anything save the aggressiveness of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbian</a> propaganda &amp; rather low level of comprehension capacity of "other" wikipedians&#160;? Or, maybe it's something more at stake. I'd say that failure of the moral nerve hides itself, as usual, behind paragraphs. If someone is not convinced by explicit qotes reflecting a politically widespread opinion (for veracity of the translation, it's easy to employ Serbian wikipedians free of pan-Serbian disease)- then, I guess, you bureaucrats (and I mean it in an old-fashioned, ordinary way) are beyond remedy. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 19:16, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As for "irrational hostility"-is this a joke (I'm repeating myself, I know)? Do you think that quoted passages from Šešelj's magnum opus need a commission composed of specialists (social psychologists, psychiatrists,..) to determine whether the claims on criminal essence of Croatian national being etc. are examples of "irrational hostility" or not&#160;? I thought the good ole common sense from Locke &amp; the Declaration of Independence would unanimously decide that the irrational hostility is "self-evident" in the quoted passages. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 15:04, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a joke, in fact I think that it's very basic stuff. Nothing is self-evident if it's disputed (that's what NPOV is all about), and such situations are resolved by means of sources (that's what verifiability is all about). I'm sure that at least one person would disagree that Seselj's statements are irrationally hostile - namely, Seselj himself. Now, even if Seselj were the only sentient being on Earth espousing his own opinions, <i>we</i> aren't authorized to determine whether Seselj's POV or ours is the "correct" one and present that as the objective truth in an encyclopedia.</dd>

<p>How come it isn't used by other Croats online?

Croatophobia <b>would be</b> (bi bila) irrational fear of Croats and hostility towards Croatian culture". In other words, this is a neologism that is occasionally and independently coined and that people give their own definition (the author of the article actually makes it include many <i>Croats</i>). The truth is that the editors of the article are defining Croataophobia in the process of writing it (OR).</p>

<dd>OK, Croatophobia may exist officially as an (very uncommon) word in Croatian, but that doesn't mean it's an established <i>concept</i>, commonly associated with particular facts. In fact, there's strong evidence that it isn't (the article with "croatofobija bi bila .../definition/", etc.). Thus, you can't go anywhere beyond a dictionary-style definition (and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>) without doing original research and inventing your own picture of what <i>you</i> think deserves being called so. Of course, the situation with Serbophobia is fairly similar, except that it is already a common concept - which doesn't mean that describing it without sources isn't OR that should in principle be deleted.

<dd>Nice to hear such assertions from someone whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/FrontLine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/FrontLine" rel="nofollow">contributions</a> consist in Serb-bashing, and who created this article as one of the first edits, which was pretty recently. Probably a sockpupet of Ante Perkovic - who just voted below, that is two votes from the same person. Rockie21 15:45, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Serb bashing, give me a break. There is nothing inframatory, defamatory, racist, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobic.html" title="Serbophobic">serbophobic</a> in the artiles and edits i have done so far. They are all based on historical facts. I am no sockpupet, and how dare you accuse another user of being one without a single grain of proof. Probably you are a sockpupet, and attack is the best defense&#160;? Isn't it&#160;?? FrontLine 15:53, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And how dare YOU accuse other people? Sure, anti-serbian edits are fine, but anti-croatian edits are "inframatory (sic) defamatory, racist". Good to know where you stand. Rockie21 16:05, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Look a few lines above and see who started it. And all things go two way - the same way you say that your edits have nothing to do with <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">serbophobia</a>, can be applied other way around. Which brings us back to the topic, and that is that there is no proof / reference that anti-croatian sentiment from the article exists. You base your article on original research, which is, as you can see, flawed. This is no place for random speculations. What proof do you have that your alledged examples of "croatophobia" are not <i>All based on historical facts</i> (as you have put it yourself for your edits). Rockie21 16:21, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Take a deep breath, leave your mind open and you will see that croatophobia exists as much as serbophobia in the world around us, that is the sorry state of affairs. The references carry irrational hatred and fear, and croatophobia is a better term for it then anti-croatian sentiment. Well I have looked a few lines above, and from the evidence presented it looks like you have come to existance to push this debate. FrontLine 16:41, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it exists, why are there no google hits? And the two newspaper articles that mention it, cooked it up for the purpose of the article - in one it means one thing, in other quite anoter thing. Like non-nationalist Croats who were branded "Croatophobes" for their lack of patriotism. And that is given as a reference for "feeling of hostility or hatred towards Croats". Come on. Give us a reliable <b>source</b> that the thing exists. Pointing to the alleged examples is original research. Pointing to sources that describe this supposed sentiment is quite different thing. There is no proof or even any indication that this is an established phenomenon. If web-forums are best you can come up with, excellent. Tom-Cruisophobia has better references than this.

<p>You sure have some points there, but you should realize that the fact that you do look a lot like a Serbian sock puppet (I could be wrong, but I'd say it with 99.99% certainty) doesn't add to your credibility. No offence meant. I was happy to discover that there are some very decent Serbian wikipedians (<a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">user:Duja</a>, for instance), but it should be obvious to anyone that all this extensive sock puppetry causes damage to the reputation of your country, creating the depressing impression that there is a huge amount of Serbian cheaters (whereas I'm sure that it's actually just one or a couple of people who happen to have a lot of spare time and an inclination to cheat). --85.187.44.131 17:27, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>May I remind you (and other editors) that <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is a policy here. Also, it is strange that you have such concerns, as you edit anonimously. Balot stuffing and things like that can be considered cheating, and that is what Croatian editors here are doing, not me. Comment on the issue, not the contributors. Note that you being supposedly Bulgarian does not automatically make you neutral, as you also hold bias, possibly anti-Serbian.

You're right that the fact that you're probably a sock puppet doesn't mean you're wrong (since that is an ad hominem argument), but I'm sure many neutral editors are influenced by that fact nevertheless.

<dd>Eh...I'm not sure about the validity of this user's argument. The term "kroatofobija" is recorded in the most comprehensive one-volume contemporary Croatian dictionary<a href="http://www.sveznadar.com/knjiga.aspx?knjiga=58210" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sveznadar.com/knjiga.aspx?knjiga=58210" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, while I'm not sure about the term "srbofobija" (tho, I'm not conversant with current Serbian lexicography). So, as far as the recorded existence of the notion goes, "kroatofobija" is, to my knowledge, certainly more "established" than "srbofobija". As for Google-arguments, they've been dealt with. And, as for "the existence in the real world of Serbophobia"-this is a purely subjective opinion of this user, to put it mildly. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 07:56, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh...This is how Serbophobia is more established, and it's probably not in the way that you think I meant. I didn't think I'd be explaining this to a Croat, frankly. "Serbophobia" has been a Serbian bogey for forty years. Serbian intellectuals spent much of the 1980s and 1990s wallowing in their own belief that Croats, communists, Montenegrins, Slovenes et al. were Serbophobes. Entire books were written on the subject -- see the writings of Vuk Draskovic, Dobrica Cosic, etc.. I most definitely do NOT mean that any of those peoples truly and deeply hated Serbs. But the concept's existence is beyong dispute, even if it is not directly comparable to other phobias. For the rest, I don't deal in Google hits. Mir Harven seems to me to be a Croatian inventor -- the notion of Croatophobia does not exist in its pure form nor in the form I describe for Serbs. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfnjm_f2dc.html" title="User:Profnjm">Profnjm</a> 12:28, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> More of a waste of time, actually. Graphic Smash is an subscription-based site and all of its webcomics are there by invitation. They are high quality and tend to get nominated for awards (we're talking <a href="../../../e/i/s/Eisner_Award_31f2.html" title="Eisner Award">Eisners</a>, not just <a href="../../../w/c/c/WCCA_971f.html" title="WCCA">WCCA</a>), which always makes AfDing them contentious. Sure, the webcomic rubber stampers will vote delete, but when the dust has cleared, usually what you end up with is a "no consensus" or "keep". As far as this comic goes, though, I'm undecided. I don't think it was on Graphic Smash for very long, and now is on the free host, Comic Genesis. I'd have to do more research to decide one way or the other. I was hoping the authors of this article would let the prod go through so I could do that research and possibly bring it back with more background info.

<dd>Comment. I trust your work on this article is not indicative of the quality of students that come from this school. My AfD tag was in the interests of reversing the dumbing down of Wikipedia, and is not a <i>"a flaming/trool comment"</i>, whatever that is. If you want to avoid this ever happening again in the future, then write and fully tweak your article before you post it. Incidentally, do you not have a spellchecker?

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm no deletionist, but I must say that a 'keep' proposal so aggressively targeted at the editors who could aggregate to prevent deletion of this article doesn't seem the best way to proceed. By the way; I (and many other editors) am/are A Geek, Not A Nerd. Another point which is perhaps worthy of mention, without disparaging the creator's efforts; a redlink does not necessarily mean that <i>Wikipedia</i> per se wants an article; it could also suggest that <b>one</b> editor thinks that an article should be created, and that other editors who disagree have not yet removed the redlink. Having said that, fleshing out redlinks is a noble cause (see Sir Geoffrey of Redlink), and I salute you for this, if not for a considered and calmly argued approach. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 13:47, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, suggesting a vanity motive, would seem to be more of an assumption of bad faith. The above keep voter, is merely indicating that they find none of your arguements worth considering. They are not questioning your *motive* for making any arguement. There's a big difference. You did ascribe an improper motive to others: namely "vanity". Note: the guideline is worded "assume good faith" *not* "assume good reasoning". Also, it's hard for others to understand your reasoning when you make an *invalid* speedy vote. Please cite where in policy you can justify a speedy deletion of this school. You gave *no* legitimate reason for a *speedy* deletion. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:26, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not know why you assume that I voted for deletion solely based on vanity. I voted for deletion, as I state in my deletion vote above, because the article does not even attempt to cite sources thus leaving the information in the article unverifiable. The article relies purely on origional research. There are Wiki policies regarding citation, verifiability, and orgional research. The comment, whether or not it assumed bad faith, was still offensive in that it attempted to simply dismiss the points made by other editors who voted for deletion without giving any counter arguement for why the article should be kept. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 15:40, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I didn't say that was your sole reason. In fact, it may not have been a reason at all. I just said "<i>You did ascribe an improper motive</i>". My point was <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> means assuming good faith, not assuming good reasons. If you critiqued the *reasoning* of others, that would have been better then critiquing the motive (vanity) of others. Also, I didn't say you gave no reason for deleting per se. I was specifically saying you gave no basis in policy for *speedy* deletion. You had no speedy-specific reasoning. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:53, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose you haven't been through the trenches in the "schools debate." The reason people cite <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> is because all debates turn out the same – they default to keep.

<dd>The arguments in the section you reference are very broad. They don't all correspond to this AfD as the list references all possible arguments against having the page. Did you consider in your decision to vote this way whether the Keep arguments on the page are relevant, and as such whether they are stronger than the relevant Delete arguments. All of these things make for a more constructive debate than having people simply responding to someone referencing Keep and another referencing the corresponding Delete arguments.

<p>For notability, please note that this organization is of historical significance in that it is the first "Humanist Church" founded since 1935. It marks a revival in what used to be popular movement in early 20th century. I can see where you might object that a founder is creating the webpage but my main intent is to capture the history and the rationale for this unique organization. It might help people piece together the history in the future and for this reason alone I think it is worth the cost of the disk space to preserve it. Plus, its name was changed recently from "Humanist Church of North Texas". If you search on that term, you get more hits going back to the beginning. David Wallace Croft 2006-05-14</p>

<li>They have 3 links to local venues on their website. No mention of this "national" tour. Also, the article is a little dicey timewise...was their tour in 2003?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Important Belgian legislation. This law is indeed attempting to completely paralyze a major political party in Flanders. The idea is to get rid of a political opponent outside the regular electoral system. And this idea is vivid.

<dd>In Flanders this law is generally known as the “droogleggingswet”, see <a href="http://www.standaard.be/Archief/Zoek/index.aspx?trefwoord=droogleggingswet&amp;wanneer=5&amp;waar=1&amp;sektie=ALL&amp;intro=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.standaard.be/Archief/Zoek/index.aspx?trefwoord=droogleggingswet&amp;wanneer=5&amp;waar=1&amp;sektie=ALL&amp;intro=1" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> “Droog“ is translated into English as “dry”. And in the most prominent English /Dutch dictionary, the Van Dale, is written that “dry up” also applies to money. The “dry up law” thus is the best choice as a name for this article.</dd>

<p>All necessary information about the organization is not merged into The George Washington University. Info merged to GWU is only info regarding establishment and membership. That is all that is necessary on the University page. However, it does not define what the organization does. The Global Language Group page defines what the organization is and does, including, most importantly the languages it functions with. That would be like defining the UN without mentioning that there are members from all over the world. The organization is an important part of the University and we would like to have it added. Other such non-profit student organizations at GWU receive far more attention and do not receive deletion threats (see <a href="../../../a/i/e/AIESEC_3f49.html" title="AIESEC">AIESEC</a>). Please advise what must be cleaned up in order to leave The Global Language Group separate page..</p>

Let me first apologize for intervening in a conversation that has not, until recently, involved me. I am a Professor and knew nothing about this organization until I read an article in the news this week. Let me first say that whoever was the brainchild of this organization deserves commendation beyond belief.
<p>If I may, allow me to note that Wikipedia is not always highly regarded in the academic field as a credible source. Nevertheless, I encourage my students to reference it in order to gain a more profound knowledge of various subjects.</p>
<p>This organization deserves a page in Wikipedia just as much as any other. The author of the article on the Global Language page followed a more objective tone in writing the article and even wrote with an encyclopedia-like style.</p>
<p>For Wikipedia editors and administrators to attack the article and the organization is outright apalling. The relentless condescending tone taken by Wikipedia staff on this page is enough to turn all of its loyal readers away. One will notice on the homepage that in various languages, Wikipedia is called "The Free Encyclopedia."</p>
<p>The Wiktionary definition of "free" is "Unconstrained...Unobstructed, without blockages." With this in mind, the Wikipedia staff has clearly made it their goal to arbitrarily contradict their own words.</p>
<p>I recommend that this page not be deleted. I further recommend that Wikipedia cease from patronizing the Global Language Organization and concentrate their efforts on improving Wikipedia so that people like those who have clearly been insulted have less "obstruction and blockages" to their freedom.

<p>&lt;d&gt;</p>
<p><i>Hi sorry to butt in. I just saw Global Languages in the paper and I wanted to say thank you for all your incredible work. I agree with the professor about everything. I think you guys at Wikipedia should be ashamed for being so rude and unprofessional. I just read they have over 3,000 members now. Isn't that like the largest student organization in the country? Either way, if I were you I would not want to offend an organization that can get at least 3,000 loyal members to boycott you. Just food for thought.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>hey wouldn't it be cool if the "Free Encyclopedia" really were free? Dude, I can't believe how rediculous this is. The guy from the Global Language organization asked like 10 times for a reason to delete the article, and all you guys can say is that it's not notable enough. If you spent more time helping your users and less time attacking them, maybe <b>you</b> would be more notable. 128.164.213.231 17:11, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I trimmed space from the quotes since they're just pointers—I don't want to take up too much space when everyone who's voting here is reading the full articles anyway. I don't see how quoting most of them at length changes anything, though, or makes them NPOV. They're pretty slanted.

<li><b>Keep</b>, unless there is some doubt that these are real peerage titles.

<li>I don't believe WP:BIO is the appropriate criteria here. The subject of the article is the peerage itself, not the individuals who have held it.

All press releases relating to this author's supposed win were released by the author herself.

<li>Weak Keep - in spite of the controversy - if she IS the first American novelist to write about the concept of Jante's Law, that would seem to be not nothing. I agree with the rest, that most of the hype appears to have been generated by the author herself. I also agree with the first poster that it may seem to be a "remove without prejudice" thing - if she does ever accomplish anything independent Wiki writers would find noteworthy, then a nonbiased article can be created. I'm going to stick with the weak keep because if she has introduced Jante's Law to non-Scandinavian America, that is something to consider. If the issue is that it probably meets Wiki standards for autobiography/self-promotion but does not meet the standard for notability, then I sway to reluctant delete. My official vote stands, however.Littleshakespeare 21:59, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but give citations. I have read about these mantras, and they do exist in the Donyi-Polo religion.

These articles also stated the names of other Donyi-Polo "figures" in addition to Lowang, and their stories are purpotedly "found" by archaeologists (names stated in Mishyelha). To be fair, and not just draw a blind conclusion that this is a hoax, perhaps we can contact him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=164.107.196.204" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=164.107.196.204" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> (or the contact particulars) provided by you all, before deleting them? We need to gather sufficient evidence that they are all hoaxes. But for now, I can't forsee sufficient shown evidence, just by saying that we can't find the details on the rest of the internet and seeing that the nam Tiberius Lowang coincides with characters found in games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiberius_Lowang&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiberius_Lowang&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, the two annoyomous users contributed the Tibetan name. In the west, like we people, only a few individuals can contribute in Tibetan. This piece of contribution makes me inclined to believe that this might be genuine.</p>
<p>The main aim, is to gather someone who is familiar about the Donyi-Polo mantras, and speak out with strong and sufficient evidence that these figures are real in Donyi-Polo. Otherwise, we can interrogate the suspect. What do you all think? <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 11:35, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I speedily deleted this a while back (Flybe Destinations), but was criticized for doing it out-of-process: after all, there are articles listing the destinations for <i>many</i> airlines - <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryanair_destinations.html" title="Ryanair destinations">Ryanair destinations</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/EasyJet_destinations_0d2c.html" title="EasyJet destinations">EasyJet destinations</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_destinations_2abc.html" title="American Airlines destinations">American Airlines destinations</a>, etc etc etc. My point is that <i>none</i> of the 103 (!) articles in the category "Airline destinations" should exist - Wikipedia is not a collection of miscellaneous information. If <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Airlines_destinations_226f.html" title="Czech Airlines destinations">Czech Airlines destinations</a> include <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, does that tell us <i>anything</i> about Cairo?

Analogy - it's perfectly reasonable to have an article on the bus company of a major city, and it's equally reasonable to have an article on the major streets of that city, but we don't need an article on the 9.15 bus going from 4th street along McDonald to 12th avenue.</p>

<dd>No, edit wars are not a valid reason to delete per se, but this is a situation where the pettiness demonstrate by both pro-St. Clair and anti-St. Clair editors show just how non-notable he is -- neither side is able to come up with anything that actually show any more notability than being good at a card game of limited popularity. Effectively, the edit war was at the level of "Bob pulled off Mark's pants!" "No, he didn't!" "Yes, he did!" And, in my opinion, this strongly shows a lack of notability. If the subject is notable, then there will be more notable things to edit war about. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 15:54, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Here we have a guy who's placed fourth in a fairly large tournament for a fairly notable card game franchise. The game warrants an article. The tournaments, even, in a large article, Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments, or somesuch, warrant an article. The top participants and notable attendees of said tournaments should be mentioned in aforementioned tournament article. However, they do not warrant articles on their own if the sole claim to significance is placing fourth in one of these tournaments. Has had no significance or influence beyond the closely-devoted Yu-Gi-Oh! community, and therefore does not warrant an encyclopedia entry <i>of his own</i>. He does, however, warrant mention in a larger article on these tournaments, which would be encyclopedic, and to me, at least, quite interesting, <i>especially</i> if it contains the sort of details like the bribery and cheating scandals included here. So, essentially, we have encyclopedic information not being presented in an encyclopedic way—It's spread too thin, is all. If no one is willing to create said article, however, this will have to be deleted.-<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> 04:25, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You don't really need that big bolded "delete" there, you know. As nominator, your job is to write a <i>convincing nomination</i>, not to start things off with a pseudo-vote. I can't help but think you wouldn't have forgotten to include your whole nomination in one go if you hadn't been so intent on "voting". <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 05:19, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your point might be valid if a nominator <i>always</i> votes delete. That's not always the case; I've nominated articles before that had been speedy deleted and recreated and voted neutral, for example, and a fair number of nominators do the same. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 06:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i><b>AfD is not a vote!</b></i> You should know that by now. If you want an article deleted, you give your reasoning why — bolded text or no bolded text, that's irrelevant. If you <i>don't</i> want an article deleted, then that's a different issue: but even then, there's no problem with using prose ("I have no dog in this race", say). Sometimes people actually care about the articles we nominate for deletion; we owe it to them to give good reasoning for our decisions. Nominators pseudo-voting leads to poor nominations, and increases the misconception that voting has any place on AfD. This is not something an admin should be doing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 16:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AfD may be a discussion and not a vote, but it's not a round-table discussion - it's a discussion where people express opinions which usually come down to one of two sides (occasionally three in the case of merges). That includes the nominator - and as Nlu says, nominators aren't always expressing the same opinion. I personally find the bolded summaries very useful to indicate who's come down on which side. As for writing nominations, frequently 'this is unverifiable' or words to that effect suffices. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 17:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe that this article should be deleted but some of its content should be included in the article on terrorism. Terrorism is practiced in very similar manners regardless of whether it is considered 'left-wing' or 'right-wing,' though the the goals may be different (hence, the only real difference I see is teleological, and this does not require two separate articles). Furthermore, due to the nature of terrorism as both an ambiguous term and as a decentralized means of waging war, it is often the case that it is nearly impossible to ascertain whether a particular terrorist/terrorist movement is explicitly left or right-wing, it certainly possible to combine the two (radical socialism and religious fundamentalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive). Having this as a separate article seems too NPOV and relies too heavily on arbitrary and overgeneralized political terms. If placed in the terrorism article, there could be a section discussing how terrorism tends to originate from groups operating on the 'far-left' and 'far-right' and emphasize that it is more due to the radical overall nature of the ideology behind it than whether those engaging in the practice are liberals or conservatives. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:24, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The terms "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">Right-wing</a>" and "<a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing.html" title="Left-wing">Left-wing</a>" are definable, and so is "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>." Why is it impossible to write an NPOV article about terrorists whose aims are either right-wing or left-wing? <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> will inherently have POV issues, <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> will in herently have POV issues, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> will inherently have NPOV issues. That's not a reason to ax them. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 20:37, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Interestingly, the article at <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">Right-wing</a> makes no mention of race, which is central to a number of the groups cited here. That article also says identifying fascism as right-wing is disputed, while this one lists groups who fall under that label. That's the problem when you try to use broad labels. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:43, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Right-wing" and "Left-wing" are more often defined basically to disparage opposite groups. They are anachronic and almost useless labels in modern political science and only serve ideological agendas. Using this kind of pseudoscientific junk will just stuff unwanted <a href="../../../g/i/g/GIGO_d656.html" title="GIGO">GIGO</a> into a subject as serious as terrorism.<a href="../../../x/e/m/User%7EXemoi_180e.html" title="User:Xemoi">Xemoi</a> 20:53, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The difference is that the <b>only</b> purpose of articles titled <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_terrorism.html" title="Left-wing terrorism">left-wing terrorism</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_terrorism.html" title="Right-wing terrorism">right-wing terrorism</a> is to partion groups according to the labels "<a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing.html" title="Left-wing">left-wing</a> and "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">right-wing</a>"; all of the material in these articles is already covered in articles on the groups in question. Contrast this with articles like <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> which will probably always be contraversial, but not have their <i>raison d'etre</i> be hinged on a single POV question. The same argument could be made about hypothetical articles such as Left-wing US administrations, List of spicy foods, and so on. --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 16:32, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> This term is in common use in the conspiracy community.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Needs a lot of work, but defintely without doubt keep. Needs to include both seeing every real problem (not just manufactured problems) as an excuse to implement actually irrelevent measures (that may or may not be <i>believed</i> relevant) as well as seeing the problems that are created by irrelevant measures as <i>further</i> problems to be solved with even more extreme or comprehensive irrelevant measures of the <i>same</i> type. (As an example, suppose this were true: Homelessness means we need drug laws. Drug laws create more homelessness. Means we need stronger drug laws. OR Terorists attack. Means we need to increase our military presense in islamic countries. More terrorists attack. Means even more military presense is needed. ) <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 14:06, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Or move into a discussion of group dynamics. I'm not sure the ghetto of conspiracy thinking will encourage quality here. This is a well understood tool in some management circles.

<li><b>Keep</b> As references (and Slashdot attention) show, what began as a neologism by David Icke (not Alex Jones) has spread into the mainstream media and mainstream consciousness, to the point where someone might want to look this up.
