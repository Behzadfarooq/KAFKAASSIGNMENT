<li><b>Delete</b>Not notable, posted by Alan Shefman’s son (pm_shef) with an attempt to use as a political tool, use to pursue his political agenda and to use as advertising for his so called company. Does not meet the criteria to be an article, most high-power or high-profile position he held was/is as city councillor in a small city which I understand does not meet the criteria, in addition he was only a city councilor for a very short period of time (less than a year). Position as a “director” within government is even a lower-power or lower-profile than the city councilors position as at any given time there are over 200 people with a directors title. Appears to have false information posted. No other councillor posted from such a small city. User:eyeonvaughan 5 November 2005 (<i>Note: User's second contribution ever under this username.</i>)

<li>If the TV appearances and whatnot are real and significant, I could change my mind. I just notice that the alleged shows he appeared on don't even have articles. If the show isn't significant, surely one particular guy who appeared on it isn't significant either? If he's been one of many participants in events that got media coverage, that's pretty different from him getting significant media coverage himself. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 04:28, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Per G1 as patent nonsense, as it is clearly "so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make sense of it." The Dallas Tariff was indeed a <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/813/000049666/" class="external text" title="http://www.nndb.com/people/813/000049666/" rel="nofollow">real historical event</a> in 1816, involving <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clay_7415.html" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a>. It was basically a <a href="http://webroots.org/library/usahist/fotu0005.html" class="external text" title="http://webroots.org/library/usahist/fotu0005.html" rel="nofollow">protectionist tariff</a>, but it had nothing whatsoever to do with dead babies.</li>
<li>Per A6 as disparagement, as this article seems to have been created in bad faith to insult a historical event. Someone created a wikilink to the Tariff in the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clay_7415.html#Protectionism" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a> article, which has been the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Clay&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Clay&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">target of a heck of a lot of vandalism recently</a>. Why do I have a feeling that someone failed their history test because of the Dallas Tariff and is lashing out at their teacher?</li>

<li><s><b>Weak delete/merge with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a></b>.</s> To the extent that Brandt is notable it seems to be largely because of Google Watch, which I don't think is notable enough in itself to justify an entry on its (co)founder. Nor does the rest of his bio or activities seems all that notable. Much of the GoogleWatch-related material will have to be merged into <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a> anyway, which will lead to substantial duplication. Brandt's antagonism with Wikipedia over this article should not substantially affect our judgement on whether he is notable; but the fact that Brandt does not wish to have a Wikipedia entry should not either lead to the perverse judgement that that opposition in itself is enough to justify keeping it. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 23:59, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

Kudos to Brandt for finally trying to work within the system, though, rather than simply going straight to Jimbo and throwing legal threats around.

<li><b>Delete</b> ...... the Wikipedia page about Brandt focuses mainly on draft dodging, Google-Watch, and Brandt's enemies. Because of this, a good case could be made in court that, unlike a magazine article, something like Wikipedia that carries the gravitas of a REAL encyclopedia (at least in some naive readers' minds) can perform a spin-doctoring sort of character assassination by focusing almost entirely on these negative things. I don't think he is going to EVER going to let go of this, so it might behoove Wikipedia to honor his request to delete the page, and save everyone involved a lot of B.S. down the road. This "he's a public figure and so we should be able to print whatever we want about him" line makes it sound like you people think you're reporting for a muckracking newspaper, not editing an encyclopedia. (Of course, an encyclopedia is supposed to be a definitive reference work, and how can you have a definitive reference work whose pages get completely rewritten twenty times a day, by anyone and everyone, from preteens to the mentally ill?) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.78.217.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.78.217.117_5892.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.78.217.117">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not understand why people keep saying that Daniel Jennings is not notable. He has preached in three countries and is currently working to organize a crusade in Torreon, Mexico with the Protestant Allianza. In three weeks his newest book will be advertised in Charisma Magazine which has an estimated readership of over 500,000. What does it take to be notable? I believe that there are some ulterior motives at work here. Locke Cole for some reason seems to be on a personal crusade against this wikipedia entry. So, let’s look at Locke Cole. Locke Cole takes his name from a Final Fantasy VI video game character. Anyone who has studied Final Fantasy knows that it is all based upon witchcraft and magic and very anti-Christian. That’s just the truth of the matter. Could it be that Locke Cole has targeted this website simply because its subject was a born-again Christian? The website hadn’t been up for five hours before Locke Cole began his attack. He didn’t even give me time to finish it to where I was satisfied with it before he was trying to have it deleted. I would like to know why he was so quick to try and stop this website from going up. And secondly, I would also like to know why a 25 year old man (Locke Cole according to a link from his user page) would put so much energy into this. He even went to the extent of setting up a special section at his user page against this entry. Why so much trouble? It’s just a dictionary entry. It’s not the end of the world if an international lecturer and author gets his name in wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevdanj_86bd.html" title="User:Revdanj">Revdanj</a> 20:00, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all, I didn't have anything to do with the vandalism and I am disappointed that someone would jump to the conclusion that I did that and even go to the point of saying that I was not a true Christian. I don't know who 164.106.51.174 is but it is not me. At any rate I have lost all respect for Wikipedia. The whole concept of Wikipedia turns it into nothing more than a site that allows gossip to be published as fact and popularity to be the determining factor in what is important and what is not. It is a sad commentary when a video game character is given more value than a human being who has achieved something that most have not. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevdanj_86bd.html" title="User:Revdanj">Revdanj</a> 16:48, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't appreciate being accused of being the same person that this article is about or of being a vandal from Danville, VA. I am not in Danville so that proves that I didn't do it but since the person the article is about comes from Danville it would only make sense that he has supporters there. Secondly, it now seems obvious to me that you have been trying to get this article deleted without even reading it because the article clearly states <b>IN THE FIRST LINE</b> that this person is living in Oklahoma City.

As for the Oklahoma bit, the article says his <i>business</i> is in Oklahoma, it doesn't say <i>he</i> is in Oklahoma. The article ends with him returning to Danville, VA. I shouldn't even be feeding this obvious <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">troll</a>, but it gets tiring watching you talk about yourself in the third person (like we're all a bunch of clueless noobs who can't figure out you're writing about yourself).

<li><b>Comment</b> What people don't seem to understand is that Locke Cole or any of the other users who voted to delete this article doesn't have a personal vendetta against Daniel R. Jennings.

If you want to have this article be part of Wikipedia, you must follow the guidelines for notability of the Wikipedia community. If the article does not meet these guidelines, then it can't be part of Wikipedia. Feel free to post it on a site that provides free websites: there are many of these.

We are debating whether or not he is notable enough by <i>Wikipedia's</i> standards (and no other standards, including personal merit) to have his own article.

<p>A hoax. As per recent discussions at <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">the Australian Wikipedians' noticeboard</a>. It is not on <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=Davido&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=0" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=Davido&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=0" rel="nofollow">Geoscience Australia</a> which does have localities no longer extant such as <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=Homebush&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=VIC" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=Homebush&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=VIC" rel="nofollow">Homebush, Victoria</a> or <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazd01?rec=240925" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazd01?rec=240925" rel="nofollow">Dondangadale</a>, and thus is extremely unlikely that Davido was ever a recognised Australian place name. The original editor cited a book reference. An Australian wikipedian reviewed that book and others and found:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The book cited by the editor, <i>The Colonial Experience: the Port Phillip District 1834-1850</i> seems to be a school textbook, consisting mainly of diary entries of Victorian pioneers, covering the timespan 1834-1850 (obviously). The Davido article states that the town's active period was between 1867-1871 (beyond the timeframe of the textbook). There is no index in the book, and so I scanned the pages for mention of Davido - but there seemed to be nothing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I checked the indexes of numerous books on nineteenth century Victoria, particularly those covering the Hamilton area, and found no mention of the town. I also checked the index volumes of the <i>Victorian Historical Journal</i>, which dates back to 1911, and this also revealed no mention of Davido.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, in the genealogy room, I found Angus B. Watson's excellent and addictive book <i>Lost &amp; Almost Forgotten Towns of Colonial Victoria: A Comprehensive Analysis of Census Results for Victoria 1841-1901</i>. This book includes all towns and villages as defined by the Government Statist for collection of Victorian censuses from 1841 to 1901. This includes settlements of as few as 13 people, yet there was no mention of Davido, which the article claims had a population of 1,500.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My conclusion is that the article is most definitely a hoax. If anyone wants to put this up for AfD, feel free to use the information I've just supplied. -- <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 06:26, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I tend to agree with Chuq. This guy sets up a page and wastes our time, then posts a message on <a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">user talk:ScottDavis</a> telling him that he just had to test the system and see how reliable wikipedia is, while on the Davido, Victoria talk page, asks us whether we have nothing better to do with our lives than investigate fraudulent articles, refers to himself on this page as 'the sucker who started the article' and wants it put up on BJAODN. If it were the case that he was a well meaning wikipedian who wanted to test the system and intended to make valuable contributiotions, I'd perhaps be inclined to let him while keeping a close eye on him, but under the circumstances, I can't see why we shouldn't block him for a long time. What are the policies about that? Do we have to warn him before we block him? (I refer to him as 'him' instead of 'him or her' because the person who started this article originally called himself David Foley - the same guy who wrote about a boy named David Foley living in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Victoria_3fab.html" title="Hamilton, Victoria">Hamilton, Victoria</a>.

<p>Link to "list of eAthena servers" put eAthena 23rd on the list of Ragnarok servers, most of which make no mention of eAthena, which does not sound notable to me. I am not an expert (and I would delete all games articles on sight anyway) but this does not, from a couple of searches, appear to be half as notable as it purports to be.

<p><b>Keep, perhaps with edits to make some things clearer.</b> You make a good point about the server list-I added the list, I've removed it. Sorry about a poorly-thought-out edit. As far as the "not notable" issue goes, even if eAthena isn't notable, doesn't it make sense to have it anyway, if for no other reason then to make Wikipedia as comprehensive as possible? That being said, a google search for eAthena comes up with over 45,000 sites, which seems pretty notable to me... - <a href="../../../z/k/i/User%7EZkion_de2f.html" title="User:Zkion">Zkion</a> 03:24, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nah, I didn't write the article... I just added the server list. And I've signed both comments now, sorry.

<p>Why delete? What wrong is it doing? This is a professional emulator for a MMORPG, this is not advertising, the developers spend months of their time to create this/ update this on a continual basis, and they want to share it with the world. And 'InShaneee' wants to deleate it as advertising... And yes it is in wide use, about 80% of all servers listed in that site will use the eAthena emulator. It is a highly advanced piece of C coding and I, and I speak on behalf of all our 100,000+ registerd members that you should not remove this. Micksta, eA member.</p>

<p>The Game Revolution gamepost is a forum for many people and it discusses many important topics. Not only does it keep up to date on everything videogame, but it has made strong friendships and even brought lovers together. The site is very important in the lives of many, and this page will give a history to ease the burden of retelling the story over and over. It will become more insightful as the history is written and will be very useful to hundreds of people. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.62.15.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.62.15.170_4a4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.62.15.170">contribs</a>) UTC 16:00, 30 October 2005.</small></p>

<li>I understand where you're coming from, and please understand that this is not a slight on your community. If you want to document the history of your community, that's entirely understandable and even commendable. Go for it. However, Wikipedia is not the place to do it; it's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host_or_webspace_provider" title="WP:NOT">not a free webhost provider</a>. Generally speaking, "useful to hundreds of people" is not really enough to warrant inclusion to Wikipedia, unless it's a particularly obscure, yet notable topic. Gamepost, in the end, simply yet another web forum, and while I don't mean to belittle its significance to you, I must say that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, it's simply not big and influential enough to merit mention, any more than my personal blog or the various online forums I've been known to hang out at are; just because they're important to me, that doesn't mean that the rest of the world cares. That may sound cold, but please understand that I'm not trying to offend. We're building an encyclopedia, not a place where relatively small communities can showcase themselves. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:46, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>What about other forums that get mention such as Neowin? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Don Gero (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Don_Gero_b45b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Don Gero">contribs</a>) UTC 03:08, 31 October 2005.</small>
<ul>
<li>Please sign your comments. You can do that by typing out four tildes, like this: ~~~~. That'll leave your username (or IP address) and the time when you left the comment -- that way everyone knows who said what. And to answer your actual question, I'm not actually all that familiar with Neowin, but judging by its article, it is a far more notable forum than Gamepost is. Honestly, it should be fairly obvious why this is the case, but since you ask, I'm going to quote a couple of relevant bits from the article: <i>"Powered by Invision Power Board forum software, Neowin has an active technology forum consisting of 118,979 registered users (October 26, 2005) and more than 5 million posts."</i> That's a lot of users right there. Compared to Gamepost's 10,000+ users, that's a whole different order of magnitude. Size does matter. One of their articles has also been the <i>"most viewed story on Slashdot ever"</i> -- not a <i>huge</i> claim to fame, but that's not easily pulled off, either. Apparently, theirs is a fairly influential webforum, and a very, very significant number of people go there for their Windows-related news. (Note that as 118,979 is just the number of <i>registered</i> users, it's likely that far more people actively follow it.) Gamepost, on the other hand, is not readily distinguishable from numerous other game forums. Also, please note that Neowin's <i>forums</i> do not have an article of their own. In fact, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game-Revolution_0fbd.html" title="Game-Revolution">Game-Revolution</a> already has an article on Wikipedia, and that's not going anywhere (though it could certainly use some work). The current consensus to merge the articles means that the (relevant and notable) information on the current Gamepost article is preserved and moved to Game-Revolution, so it's not like Gamepost is getting treated any different from Neowin. (Of course, if the forums themselves <i>are</i> somehow notable enough to deserve an article all their own, please tell us why this is so; if you can do that, I'm sure that we're more than willing to revise our votes. It's not an uncommon thing to happen during the AfD process, though I should probably point out that generally we favor hard facts over emotional pleas.) Hope this helps. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 03:53, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>infochannel science software (earlier name: CORAN - A coputer program to convert energy dispersive X-Ray spectra for rietveld analysis). It is not for rietveld analysis but is a pre-processing software to convert high pressure (up to 1.5 Mbars) obtained (in diamond anvil cells) powder energy dispersive synchrotron sprectra into normal pressure angle-dispersive powder x-ray spectra as entry values for RV-Analysis (topics: synchrotron radiation, high pressure physics). Expert is needed. It's not a fake it's really used at some Synchrotron sources (DESY, Germany, ESRF, Grenoble France, SRS, Daresbury, Warrigton, UK, Chess, Ithaca, NY., USA). See Keywords: e.g. Prof. Holzapfel, University Paderborn, Germany. You can't find it under rietveld analysis! Maybe need an expert!</p>

<dd>Well, three reasons to keep it -- this is a non-controversial series of novels, insofar as young people have posted these topics, I'd like to encourage them to use Wikipedia, and also if books like <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_on_the_Couch_5b8a.html" title="Bush on the Couch">Bush on the Couch</a> can survive AfD merely because they are controversial, maybe we should allow the non-controversial to take root? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaquin_Murietta_3d07.html" title="User:Joaquin Murietta">Joaquin Murietta</a> 10:29, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, band members are musicians -- the point is that the policies don't differentiate between "solo musicians" and "musicians who were in bands". If the band meets the stated criteria, then by definition she meets the stated criteria by virtue of having been in a band that meets the stated criteria. Neither policy suggests any viable way to subdivide notable bands into "notable enough to have separate entries for each individual member in addition to the band article" from "only notable enough to have an article on the band itself". <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Parry_%28musician%29_039f.html" title="Richard Parry (musician)">Richard Parry</a>, for example, survived a VfD in June <i>specifically</i> on the grounds that if <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Arcade_Fire_cea4.html" title="The Arcade Fire">The Arcade Fire</a> was notable enough for an article, then that band's members were notable enough for articles by virtue of being in a notable band -- so that's the precedent I'm working from here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:22, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parry's nom page shows other reasons. I'm sorry Bearcat; are you comparing Richard Parry to Kim Urhahn? Parry's article demonstrates notability for reasons other than being in TAF -- a media interview, for example. Yes, policies don't differentiate, yes, neither policies suggest ways to subdivide bands — so I'm looking at Urhahn as a <i>musician</i> — as per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">WP:NMG</a>, is she notable as one? --&#160;<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfecto_bf9a.html" title="User:Perfecto">Perfecto</a>&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title="Canada"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="Canada" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 00:26, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>If she was in a band that met the NMG criteria, then she meets the MNG criteria by virtue of having been in a band that met the NMG criteria.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE!</b> By deleting this article you will cause a massive blow to a large portion of our society. In doing so you will leave members of the 'bus' unguided and homeless.</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> As a representative of Anheuser-Busch, I cannot allow you to delete this article. There is NO proof that the members of the 'bus' are underage consumers of alcoholic beverages. By deleting this article, the Party Bus will be destroyed and Anheuser-Busch, along with many other producers of alcoholic beverages, will suffer catastrophic financial damages. Shareholders and employees around the world will be devastated by your selfish and crude actions. PLEASE CONSIDER OTHERS' LIVES BEFORE YOU DESTROY THEM!</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> This is a great reference which I believe one could use on almost a daily basis. By deleting this article, you would be restricting the knowledge of houndreds of thousands of Americans. This article is vital to the growth of our society and it MUST NOT BE DELETED.</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE IT</b> I believe this article is a binding reference for the people who are part of the 'bus'... by destroying this article, you would be destroying a part of them...</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE:</b> whats wrong with people having fun!?</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> This 'bus' has a serious significantly meaning/role upon our country and world in its entirety. Due to the surrounding circumstances and open housings/beautiful resources of high schooling, the bus is able to roll with its system bumping hard. Yet a deletion will truly leave the nation in question of 'who truly rocks the bus harder than 08 itself?' stay classy, peace out kids,...poke smot</li>

<li>Well, in the interest of reducing sycophancy slightly, perhaps I should point out that as far as I can see, it was my suggestion that this page should be merged, and my postings on three talk pages inviting comment. The only response so far was Hermione's proposal for deletion. While I do not disagree, that is not exactly a considered consensus and I suspect the absence of disagreement might have at least as much to do with no one noticing as anything else. However, i made the suggestion because while I thought one article discussing the prophecy was sensible, two was merely a confusion. If no one had commented after a while, I intended to turn it into a redirect and see what happened. I do doubt that the particular title is likely to be typed in, but someone searching for information on the prophecy (an important plot point, for anyone unfamiliar), might find it as a search result. <b>Redirect</b>, but support any consensus other than keep <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 01:30, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for pointing out a couple of reasons that the redirect is useful. Anyone that sees the value of such redirects may be interested in an idea that would let any deletion (or undeletion) be handled this way: the "Pure wiki deletion system".

<li>If it's already at <a href="../../../s/y/b/Sybill_Trelawney_82df.html" title="Sybill Trelawney">Sybill Trelawney</a> a <b>redirect</b> is probably the best idea, to show context.

<li>I quite agree with Hermione that this is a particularly poor redirect. I'd vote to delete. <i><b>If</b></i> there is an attempt to recreate a new page, it can be judged then on its merits; there is nothing to stop us from making it a redirect then, should such a need arise. I don't see that there is anything in the history logs worth preserving that is not already in Trelawney, so it seems to me that deleting the page is the wisest option.

<li>Well I wrote the majority of content on this page. It was really just to edit the content it used to have as it wasn't really that great. As already said the content's already somewhere else, and the title of the page is poor, so frankly I don't really care if it gets deleted. -Dullaware 23:57, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just another bursar (there are thousands of them; they're minor financial functionaries). He had a little run in with Employment law over racial discrimination, and it was settled out of court.

<p>"Mel Etitis"'s statement above does not provide adequate grounds for deletion. This story (and Boden's name) was reported in the national and international press - it is of significance in light of the current UK government's attempts to promote university education for all. Racial discrimination is an important topic and was brought to the fore by Boden's actions. Nobody is suggesting that this is the biggest story in the world, but it is well recognised by thousands of Keble and Oxford alumni. It is belittling, misleading, and offensive to describe Boden's actions as "a little run in" with the law - thereby not warranting publication. I strongly contest the above user's case for deletion. -- 18:45, 5 November 2005</p>

<li>Thank you for the explanation user Sensor. I have been looking into the claim made by user Zoe above. When I type "Roger Boden" in quotation marks into google.co.uk, a good number of results refer to Boden of Keble College. There is no question that there may be other people called Roger Boden, but this is not grounds for deletion. In addition to the Guardian online newspaper column reporting Boden's actions already posted on the disputed article, google.co.uk also shows me an article on a Race Rights website: <a href="http://www.blink.org.uk/pdescription.asp?key=8117&amp;mid=&amp;grp=7&amp;cat=31" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blink.org.uk/pdescription.asp?key=8117&amp;mid=&amp;grp=7&amp;cat=31" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>.

<li><b>Objection</b>: "Just zis Guy, you know?" has already just censored the Roger Boden article by deleting half the contents, and is now requesting to have the article speedied. Although he may never have read about Roger Boden in the Oxford Mail, those of all who are involved with Equal Opportunities up and down the country are very aware of Boden and the associated discrimination case. I am dismayed that in this day and age (and moreover on a forum such as Wikipedia), other users choose to be so dismissive about such events and personnages.

<dd>I don't agree with your interpretation. There's no exactly threshold for the "Google test," but I get only 169 hits on exact phrase Robert Boden on google.co.uk returning only "pages from the UK:" <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22roger+boden%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22roger+boden%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> Many of them do not seem to be the same Roger Boden who is the the subject of this article.

<dd>As for newsworthiness, a search for "Roger Boden" on Google News returns only a single hit.

<li><b>Final post</b>: I disagree with your implied definitions of the words "impressive" and "newsworthiness". I no longer wish to spend my time on this earth defending the legitimacy of the article. Boden is significant - and those who fail to recognise this I can only describe as unfortunate souls. Whoever finally removes the Boden article should take a good hard look at themselves in the mirror and ask the question "Is this the right thing to do?", for I fear that you will have blood on your hands. I will never contribute to Wikipedia again in my life, as - with respect - it seems to be the domain of pedantic beings who lack spirit and vision. I bid you all good night. -- 84.64.91.128 18:19 6th November 2005 (GMT)</li>

<dd>I suggest that you lack a sense of proportion. You will note that as "censored" no text was actually deleted. You will note that per Talk:Roger Boden I have told you why it was done.

<p>I don't believe that this article should be deleted first and foremost. I have seen alot of people with questions unanswered about hopes of a third film. People who, unlike me, are too lazy to go out and search for the information themselves. I see this stub as a means of answering peoples' thoughts about a third film. This stub can possibly minimize one less "OMG SAW?!?!" and/or "Saw 3: S3W" type forum posts. It will also help debunk false information, such as the rumor of Saw 3 being titled "S3W".</p>
<p>A sidenote: all information posted about Saw 3 has some sort of proof/evidence linked to it. ie. Gregg Hoffman's statement of Saw 3 not being titled "S3W", Shawnee Smith's interview of not being actually confirmed for Saw 3, etc. <i>(Unsigned, page-blanking comment by User:71.116.97.44 now inserted under nomination <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 06:54, 5 November 2005 (UTC))</i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem with this article is that at the moment, it is nothing more than "Saw III <i>is not</i>..." and "Saw III <i>may be</i>...". That is the only kind of information we have regarding the movie at this point in time. Now if the article had a few "Saw III <i>is</i>..." statements in it, I would not hesitate to keep it, but until we get the 'positive' information we need, we should either delete this and recreate when that information becomes available, or tuck it out of the way somewhere until, again, that information is available. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 07:34, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>#Scripture2 Undernet Channel, and its remarkable wikipedia links, are a critical tool in this "Information Age's" Christian evangelical history. Few religious environments truly accept those of any religious faith, to include accepting people with no religious faith whatsoever. The history of much of this world is predicated on a belief system where God is the Creator. I recommend that this Wikipedia article stay, as Christianity, God the Creator, in an integral part of the world's history, and Internet Chat is one of the most revolutionary, worldwide phenomenon's in this present "Information Age." #Scripture2 is the marriage of both. <small>Unsigned comment by 70.161.170.109 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.161.170.109_f302.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.161.170.109">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li>It breaks my heart that the serious and repetative vandalism perpetrated by (71.80.132.153), seems to have hurled this "Scripture2" Wikipedia article in question, into a status of 'worthy of deletion.' Afterall, it was nothing akin to other vulgar or joke Wikipedia articles I saw listed on your 'to be deleted list.' I plead with you to please, reconsider keeping this Scripture2 Wikipedia article alive, if not for all time, perhaps for a month or so, interim period of time, so that we may move the webpage elsewhere, should you ultimately decide to pull it down altogether.

<p><b>Excellent Point! I can see the problem now, and appreciate your specific feedback. I guess I got so wrapped up in the hard work and pride I have about #Scripture2 that I wasnt seeing the big picture.</b></p>
<p><b>BTW. I really appreciate the hard work you all have put into Wikipedia, and even your attention to this process for this #Scripture2 channel. More and more we chatters are drawn to Wikipedia to authenicate opinions, and even learn more about certain subjects. Wikipedia is a novel idea, opening it up to the input of the masses, and overseeing the integrity as you all do. Keep up the good work, and I apologize for being so "thick headed" about my beloved Christian Undernet channel. Take good care. God bless.</b></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This Undernet channel is a minor spin-off channel started by a group of disgruntled guests of #Scripture, another much bigger Undernet channel. They couldn't even come up with an original name for their channel &amp; they are constantly spamming ads for it on #Scripture and elsewhere (including this encyclopedia). It would be ludicrous to include this IRC channel, which has only a handful of regular attendees, on any online encyclopedia.</li>

<p>Items under dispute here:</p>
<ol>
<li>This article is not an advertisement (it is a simple statement of facts on a rather large, high rate of growth team within the Quixtar business)</li>
<li>Team of Destiny is not Amway or Quixtar, nor is it Burger King, nor is it... Similarly, the Indianapolis Colts are not the Houston Texans, nor are the Colts the NFL. They are completely separate entities, although Team of Destiny agrees to work within the confines of Quixtar's rules.</li>
<li>Amway is not Quixtar, they are two wholly separate business models.</li>
<li>Team of Destiny is hardly "non-notable". The results Team of Destiny has achieved within the Quixtar business speak for themselves.</li>

<dd>This raises a good philosophical question for wikipedia. It is granted that there are many Quixtar/Amway IBOs, and most of them are people, like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_3332.html" title="John Smith">John Smith</a> of Farmville, Kansas, who has four <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downline.html" title="Downline">downlines</a> and has an annual business of $100,000 and specializes in selling <a href="../../../s/a/8/SA8_9d05.html" title="SA8">SA8</a> and wrote a book called Leadership and the Revolution of the Internet. No, that would be non-notable. On the other hand, these people have a whole network of supposedly independent buyers and sellers that speak at conferences around the US and promote themselves as super duper successes who add kajillions to the US economy. My question is how should wikipedia <b>document</b> the notable elements of quixtar's business structure without documenting the army of non-notable <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_3332.html" title="John Smith">John Smiths</a> that form IBOs that comprise their workforce? <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 20:38, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> You would be entirely surprised how many people do a web search for Team of Destiny, or the people who started it. It's an extremely high number. An unbiased opinion from a reputable source would be in order. The only sources for information on the Team of Destiny are pages that are created by people in the organization, or people who bitterly hate all things related to Quixtar for some reason or another. Many pages try to appear unbiased but are not. A simple, short Wikipedia entry would clear up confusion. Barwick 04:10, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the Skeptic's dictionary entry for Amway addresses Amway, Quixtar, and one IBO: Team of Destiny <a href="http://skepdic.com/amway.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://skepdic.com/amway.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. So I think that if there's one notable IBO, it's basically them.

<li>I agree with Ze miguel; that link established TOD's notability within A/Q for me. I googled <b>quixter "team"</b> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=++quixtar+%22team%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=++quixtar+%22team%22" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> and the fifth link is this one <a href="http://mlmlaw.blogspot.com/2004/09/what-quixtars-team-of-destiny-doesnt.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mlmlaw.blogspot.com/2004/09/what-quixtars-team-of-destiny-doesnt.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> which is a blog article about how a guy named Scott Larsen put up a site that provides detailed analysis of TOD's practices and was was sued by TOD for copyright infringement. Larson says in his site, <i>Why did I select the Team of Destiny ®&#160;? Of all the Quixtar Lines-of-Sponsorship I've studied, Team of Destiny ® is the most prolific of any LOS at publishing material, which can be easily criticized to conflict with pyramiding regulations. TOD was the only Quixtar group I know to publicly promote, and justify the money available from their system. That page has since been removed from public view, potentially at Quixtar's request. TOD distributes the profits from their Business Support Materials sales to participants as its own Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) opportunity6.</i> He is saying that TOD puts out a lot of source material compared with other Lines of Sponsorship. This means to me that it should be easier to source/verify an article on TOD than it will for other Quixtar related entities. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 16:28, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the creator of the page and co-founder of the council, I wish that this article remain here on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> This group is a manifestation of the anti-consumerism subculture rising in the American youth. They have found a way to escape the bounds created by the excessive branding of entertainment in the world today; it's a way to escape the commercialization of fun. This article should be treated as a summarization of the unrest in the youth of white suburbia and their struggle to define themselves. In regards to its academic value, it serves as a case study of the aforementioned socio-economical group. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanders_c8b4.html" title="User:Yanders">Yanders</a> 18:19, 7 November 2005</li>
