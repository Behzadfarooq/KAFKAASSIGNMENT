<p>These sorts of pages sugarcoat the issue and make it unnecessarily hard to navigate. This information, at its core, involves one man, really. Mel Gibson. None of the officers are notable, nor did they do notable things. The article involves only one notable person. All of it should be at Mel Gibson.

<li><b>Point.</b> In order to point out how wrongheaded articles such as the "Mel Gibson DUI incident" and the "Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident" are, consider whether there should now be a Wikipedia article on the "<a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Nowak_b29a.html" title="Lisa Nowak">Lisa Nowak</a> attempted kidnapping incident." Of course there should <b>not</b> be any such article. But her incident is receiving a lot of news coverage. Her relation to her incident is in many ways the same as Michael Richards' and Mel Gibson's relationships to their incidents. She too has celebrity status. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 16:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, there <b>should</b> be such an article on the Nowak incident. There is an article, for instance, on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_North_Korean_nuclear_test_f512.html" title="2006 North Korean nuclear test">2006 North Korean nuclear test</a>. Lots of other major news events are given their own article. So why not this one? If it were merged to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, that article would become ridiculously long, or else a lot of verified content and detail would be lost. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 19:03, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The nuclear test would be notable for <b>any</b> non-nuclear country. Would a guy blowing up during an arrest be notable if he were not a celebrity? this incident is notable solely for Gibson himself, and belongs at his article. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a></li>

You haven't cited any reasons why you think there should be a separate article on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Nowak_b29a.html" title="Lisa Nowak">Lisa Nowak</a> incident. What do you see in common between the North Korean nuclear test and Mel Gibson's arrest for drunken driving and his antisemitic comments? Mel Gibson is one individual. He is not a country.

There is way too much negative material devoted to a minor incident in an otherwise productive and positive life. The reason he is notable enough to be in Wikipedia in the first place is that he has accomplished a lot and, of course, those accomplishments are well documented in verifiable, responsibly published material. You point out the quantity of material in this article -- but that is a big part of the problem. Wikipedia's guidelines for biographies of living people clearly say that we don't go overboard heaping negative implications on the subject of an article. This is a thoroughly negative article. It is about drunk driving and antisemitism. This can and probably should be noted in a general article about <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>. But it is entirely improper (according to Wikipedia guidelines on biographies of living people) to focus on negativity to the exclusion of all other ingredients of a positive nature in a person's life. The content of this article may not be acceptable in the main, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, article.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is not wikinews or wikitrivia or wikipeoplemagazine. The event is and can be more than amply covered in the main <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> article, and I see no need for every celebrity run-in with the law. Borrowing what <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">User:Barno</a> said in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Michael_Richards_Laugh_Factory_incident_7d62.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident">Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident AfD</a>, the parent article can more than amply accommodate what will likely be a matter of little lasting significance. If “incidents” associated with <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenny_Bruce_8f14.html" title="Lenny Bruce">Lenny Bruce</a> or <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a> are covered well enough in the article on those individuals, the same goes for Mel Gibson or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Stephen_Colbert_Day_f041.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stephen Colbert Day">Stephen Colbert</a>. Like the Michael Richards article, most of “well-sourced and verified” “comprehensive” material in this article is mostly just a pile-on of media reports. A judicious copy-edit when merging whatever is savageable can deal with the fact there is "too much material". <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 10:29, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Well-sourced" (or "well-referenced") is not an argument to keep this article; it can and should be just as well-sourced in one article under Mel Gibson. "Too much" information is too much information whether in this article or in the Mel Gibson article; judicious trimming back would serve either article well. Mel Gibson was driving drunk. Mel Gibson muttered antisemitic statements. That is not the subject for a stand alone encyclopedia article. The correct perspective is to see the "Mel Gibson DUI incident" in the context of the life of Mel Gibson. The incorrect perspective is to see the life of Mel Gibson as an appendage to the "Mel Gibson DUI incident." <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 13:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Point.</b> I think the primary questions involve context and perspective. Those are the things that shift whether the article receives it's own heading or whether the article is seen under the heading of an article on Mel Gibson. The incident written in this article does not stand alone, apart from Mel Gibson. It is firmly attached to the life of Mel Gibson. That is the proper heading. We should see this incident from the perspective of the life of Mel Gibson. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 21:27, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mel Gibson is the central character in the event, but that does <i>not</i> mean that the event isn't notable enough on its own to warrant its own article. As an analogy, the article <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_755d.html" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">John F. Kennedy assassination</a> is clearly an article that is squarely centered on John F. Kennedy (or, if you prefer, Lee Harvey Oswald). However clearly that doesn't necessarilly imply that the article about the <i>event</i> needs to be merged with the articles about the people associated with the event. I doubt anyone is seriously looking to merge that article into the JFK main article, for example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As another example, consider this from a reader's perspective. It certainly seems possible, I think, that a reader will be interested in searching for information about this incident without having much interest in reading about Mel Gibson himself or even caring much about Mel Gibson's career or biography. Since the amount of information about this <i>event</i> is large enough that it can fill its own article page, by splitting it off into a subarticle you are allowing readers to focus on reading about <i>just</i> the event without having to sift through everything else associated with Mel Gibson in his main article.</dd>
<dd>Thus I disagree with the assertion that an otherwise well sourced and sufficiently large article about an event that received extended international media coverage needs to be deleted, nor do I find any part of policy or in the guidelines that suggests it. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Point.</b> Dugwiki -- The reader would not have to "sift through everything else" to find information about the DUI incident in the main article because it would all be found in one area. For what reason would the facts of that incident not be in contiguous paragraphs within the main article on Mel Gibson? The assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald does not compare with Mel Gibson's drunken driving incident, even with the utterances of antisemitic sentiments. It is an incident of a totally different order. One is the president of the United States. The other is not. One is still alive. The other's life is not over. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 00:12, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Counterpoint</b> Bus Stop - I was not implying DUI = Assassination. I was saying that by your prior reasoning we shouldn't have the JFK assassination article either. I see no problem, though, either in policy or guidelines, with seperating a large verified section regarding a notable event of a main article into a subarticle when the subarticle contains sufficient verifiable references. In the case when there is enough seperate published verifiable information about an event that it can fill its own article in length, and the incident appears to have received multiple notable coverage, then it makes sense to split that incident off as a subarticle from the person's main article. So unless you're claiming that this article would comfortably fit in the Mel Gibson article, I remain unconvinced there is a non-<a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> reason to delete. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:03, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> specifically discourages the creation of articles on current events which may eventually become obsolete. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a supplement to the National Enquirer. Thousands of people are arrested for DUI every year, and I would suspect that many of them get upset and say inappropriate things to the arresting officers. There is nothing NOTABLE about this type of incident. The only thing which is notable in this event is <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>. By giving this incident its own seperate article, Wikipedia is giving an undue amount of WEIGHT to a negative incident in this living person's life, which runs contrary to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Unlike other celebrity bios on Wikipedia which frequently contain ONE "Controversy" section; Gibson's bio is over run with sections which seem to push the POV that he is a homophobe, a racist, anti-semetic,a drug addict and an alcoholic. As IF that isn't bad enough - there is ALSO this free-standing article, which has provided an additional platform for editors to label him an anti-semite. The excessive amount of space that Wikipedia has dedicated to this type of material about this LIVING PERSON constitutes attempted defamation of character in my opinion. Clearly, more than 75% of Wikipedia's editorial "space" dedicated to Mel Gibson paints him in a very negative light and, therefore, cannot be considered NUETRAL and OBJECTIVE.

<li>To reply, WP:NOT only talks about not writing <i>opinions</i> on current affiars that might quickly become obsolete. The policy, however, does <i>not</i> talk about the actual information and facts of a news event becoming obsolete. So while you shouldn't write an opinion piece about whether or not Mel Gibson behaved badly, for example, you <i>can</i> write an article about a news event involving Mel Gibson provided it has sufficient sourcing and is large enough and has enough detail to warrant being split from the main article. I also do not agree with the assertion that the article's existence in principle somehow "gives undue weight" to a possible negative aspect of Mel Gibson's character. So long as the article refers to the actual facts of the event, as reported by verifiable published sources, and doesn't delve into personal editorial opinion, there is no issue here in regards to undue negative impact. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:15, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you are missing my point. The article should not have been created in the first place and it has become a platform for opinions, including those of a blogger for goodness sake! Of course, the article is detailed and well-sourced, I'm sure there has been considerable edit warring in its creation. I think Wikipedia should be steering clear of this type of article in general. It is not encyclopedic material. Thousands of people are arrested for DUI each year, why not write articles about them? Surely, there are reliable sources to be found in local newspapers. Just because there are sources to be found, it doesn't make the incident worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia. Is this <i>current event</i> continuing to receive media attention? No, it isn't, because it doesn't have lasting significance. Why doesn't Wikipedia have a Zsa Zsa Gabor slap incident article? Or a Brandy car accident incident? By singling out this one celebrity in particular Wikipedia is demonstrating an editorial BIAS against him. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 23:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Point.</b> I think that just judging by two articles of this sort, namely the Michael Richards article and the Mel Gibson article, it seems to me that the reason for both of those articles as separate, "breakaway" articles, to focus on one negative incident, is to heap a special dose of shame on these people. I feel that articles of this sort are motivated, perhaps unconsciously, by deeply held sentiments concerning what is right and what is wrong. I can't prove that. But I am cynical of alternate explanations. Many people are outraged by the things said by Michael Richards and Mel Gibson about certain groups within the larger society. It is not too far fetched a hypothesis that people are motivated to set things right by highlighting such shameful speech in a separate article. But Wikipedia should resist this. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 00:35, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

To answer this question is to be completely honest about what motivated the creation of this stand alone article in the first place. My question hits at the very core of this matter. The article is not <i>about</i> someone being arrested for DUI, it is an excuse for editors to elaborate on the theme that Gibson is a racist. By giving undue weight to such material, Wikipedia is not only defaming Gibson's character but aggrevating race relations by serving as a forum for debate among editors whereby individuals can be labelled racists. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 02:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It was a serious one and it has gone unanswered until now. But please, the reason that it was left unanswered is probably more that people went to sleep rather than that they could not give an honest article. No, the content of his remarks is not significant. It's the fact that it gathered so much news coverage (multiple, non-trivial, over an extended period of time)! It doesn't matter if he called for the destruction of the UN or expressed a desire to be sent into space upon his death.

We should not be setting up billboards of shame. In most instances, what happens in a person's life should be seen in the context of that person's life, in my opinion. The assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald is an example of an <i>exception</i> to this. The difference (among others) is that John F. Kennedy is a figure of far greater prominence than Mel Gibson. We don't set up freestanding articles to showcase an incident despite the fact that we feel that the behavior depicted is deserving of condemnation. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 16:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for your reasoned and specific arguments (I am a bit frustrated over the many "delete - awful article" and "keep - perfect article" comments that should up on AfD). In response to your comment: this is a billboard of shame <i>only</i> if it is NPOV (making claims without sourcing or making unbalanced claims). You are making a value-judgment (which I share) that anti-Semitism is a bad thing, but such value-judgments are not relevant to whether content is encyclopedic (which means passing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>). Although I agree that JFK is a more prominent figure than Gibson, that is still a value-judgment which others may or may not share. I personally like Mel Gibson as an actor and director (I can't say as a person, because I don't know him as a person). You say that "we feel that the behavior depicted is deserving of condemnation", but it is quite likely that someone who is an anti-Semite contributed to this article and/or thinks it should be kept. It shouldn't matter what we feel (although I'm realist enough to admit that it does) as long as the subject passes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>.

<li><b>Point.</b> <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> It is not just <i>"their business."</i> Wikipedia is highlighting a "racist" incident. It is Wikipedia's responsibility to be balanced in reporting this. Having an unnecessary article to highlight this is tantamount to erecting a billboard for this purpose. It's purpose is to heap more shame on the individual than the single article could accomplish. The reasoning that there is too much material on the DUI incident to fit into the main article is roundabout thinking. Such reasoning justifies not only putting unnecessary information into an article but also providing that unnecessary material with a special showcase in the form of a freestanding article about one unfortunate and shameful incident. That is vindictive. In my opinion it is a test of whether such material is worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia if it can fit logically into a general biography. Exceptions can be found for reasons such as prominence. But Mel Gibson is not as prominent as I would feel a person would need to be to warrant an article solely about a drunk driving incident. Indeed the editors should be wrestling with how to include this DUI incident into a generalized Mel Gibson article. They should not be affording themselves the luxury of going on endlessly, as they are prone to do in an article such as this one. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 13:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I actually agree that it's unfortunate that a shameful event in someone's life is highlighted, but again, that would be a WP:IDONTLIKEIT arguement to delete. As <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> states "...the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether 'the world' has judged a topic to be notable." When there are multiple published works primarily about a topic, "the world" deemed that topic notable whether we think its sad or not.

<li><b>Counterpoint</b> I am going to disagree and say that this is not a deliberate attempt at shaming. It is, rather, a deliberate attempt to organize a large amount of information about a noteworthy event into a single article. The article's purpose is not to defame or shame Mel Gibson, but to report the facts of the event in an encyclopedic form.

<li>GassyGuy is correct. You are confusing news worthiness with notability. This event has no lasting significance. Although there will be more biographies published about Gibson, I sincerely doubt that any books will be written on the DUI incident. Regardless, no author would dedicate 75% of a biography on Gibson to the incident. Why should Wikipedia? The incident has no lasting notability or impact on anyone other than Gibson, possibly, and does not belong as a seperate article in any legitimate encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 07:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you're really reaching. If I were to follow your logic, we should create a seperate article on the Paris Exposed.com story or any other news item that receives global news coverage, based upon your interpretation of notability. I appreciate your honesty in saying that you see it as a case of modern anti-semitism. I think, however, that you defeat your own argument with your candor. Wikipedia reports facts. It is not a repository for cataloging the racial opinions of the well known. It is a misuse of Wikipedia, for ethnic groups to use it as a tool to label and catalogue racists and anti- semites. Potential damage and defamation to the character of living people outweighs any legitimate "need" for this sort of article. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 08:32, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure what sort of "damage" you're talking about here. If the article is objectively stating the verifiable published facts, then it is not a tool for slander or libel. <i>If</i> there is a specific part of the article that you feel is original research or original editorial opinion, then feel free to dispute or remove that part of the article.

When an article is very well sourced following strict <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> guidelines such as this one is, there is nothing slanderous.

This incident is very important in the life of Mel Gibson, and perhaps in the life of people especially liking or resenting him.

This would be plain wrong, of course.

But Mel Gibson already has a page devoted to his life. He is not so prominent, nor is this incident so prominent, to warrant a separate article devoted to it. <b>His DUI incident is properly seen in the context of his life, where his accomplishments can balance his missteps.</b> That, in my opinion, is consistent with our intention of maintaining a neutral point of view -- not by providing a less than flattering incident with it's own freestanding article. Editors need to debate what is worthy of inclusion and what should be discarded, on the page that is the article about Mel Gibson. In my opinion this freestanding article gives editors the green light to include too much. Wikipedia editors should be disciplined enough to write a concise article about Mel Gibson that covers the DUI incident with the inclusion of appropriate information. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 17:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To say that "the current proposal is intended to specifically address unencyclopedic news items such as this one" seems like trying to create a guideline based on a prior personal (subjective) conception of what is and is not "encyclopedic". <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> already establish which articles are and are not encyclopedic, allowing <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> to make a final decision in controversial cases. If this article is "<i>not</i> covered by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>", as you note, then that means it <i>is</i> by default encyclopedic. I support the idea of creating a specific notability guideline for news items, but I do not favor one that automatically assumes exclusion to be the default--I think this is an elitist notion that goes against the principles on which WP operates (my suggestion for an additional criterion is in the "Please consider the following (changes)" section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28news%29_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (news)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (news)</a>--if you are willing to read it, as it is a bit lengthy, I would appreciate your comments). If an article passes the 5 policies and guidelines listed above, the burden of proof is on those who want to eliminate the article. If it does not, the burden of proof is on those who wish to keep the article. Noting that, a merger is still an acceptable solution for me as long as significant (in quality, not quantity) is not lost--of course, in this case I think it would be prudent to discuss it on the talk page. Also, a merger does not have to be full-content, it can be selective (if a full-content merge was performed, the DUI incident would overwhelm Gibson's biography).

<li><b>Point.</b> It is improper to lift one incident from Mel Gibson's life and display it for the world to see. This is an abuse of Wikipedia. The facts in the "Mel Gibson DUI incident" article may be notable, but the article is not notable. It is not the province of Wikipedia to hold people up for special shame; that is the opposite of neutral point of view, and it is an abuse of the power vested in the hands of the editors of Wikipedia. The incident is far too inconsequential to deserve an article of it's own. If the editors lack the discipline to hack the facts down to a form that reflects the DUI incident's proportional relationship to the entire lifetime of Mel Gibson, that is a separate and different problem. But the article is primarily improper. The Mel Gibson article already covers the DUI incident. Therefore this article is redundant, and should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 08:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

They are fully frowned upon by most people. With qualifications, these behaviors are unlawful. You say that the article "does not condemn Gibson." But that is not necessary, since the focus of the article is 1) drunk driving and 2) antisemitism. Those behaviors, in and of themselves, are normally associated with condemnation. The DUI incident was already covered in the Mel Gibson article before this article was created. This article was created by a cut and paste from the Mel Gibson article. There are presently four paragraphs on the DUI incident in the Mel Gibson article. No article on Wikipedia is ever "finished." Whether this article is deleted or not the editors of the Mel Gibson article will continue modifying that article, including their coverage of the DUI incident. I see little reason to propose a merger of this article to the Mel Gibson article. I find this article offensive and I'm not inclined to start a process that will take longer than the delete process that is presently underway.

<li><b>Reply</b>. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a>, actually, any judgment that something is or is not shameful <i>is</i> subjective (even if most people consider them as such). Legality has no bearing on the shamefulness of an act (remember, slavery, apartheid, witch trials were all legal at some time in some place). You write that it is not necessary for the article to explicitly condemn Gibson as drunk driving and anti-Semitism are already condemnable. Notwithstanding my point above, I believe the murder of over 800,000 persons is a condemnable act, but <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> is and should be a separate article from <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Rwanda_b944.html" title="History of Rwanda">History of Rwanda</a>.

The fact that there was so much media coverage means this passes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>--and thus, so long as the information is reported in an NOR and NPOV manner, it is encyclopedic.

A neo-Nazi might find the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> article offensive, but that is no reason to delete (and please don't interpret this as me accusing you of neo-Nazism).

As for the question you pose, I will answer somewhat long-windedly. The DWI incident certainly <i>can</i> be a separate article as it passes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>.

I might support a merge if valid reasons (including stylistic ones such as user-friendliness, compactness, etc.) were given on the article's talk page.

<li><b>Reply</b> - It does serve a purpose, but that is not to disparage Gibson. Rather, it is to document an incident which has generated a great amount of media coverage. The reason why I think the DWI incident article can stand on its own is this: the <i>incident</i> has received extended non-trivial coverage from multiple reliable sources. The news reports sourced in the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_DWI_incident_151f.html" title="Mel Gibson DWI incident">Mel Gibson DWI incident</a> article are primarily about the incident itself and not Mel Gibson himself (i.e., his life, family, history, etc.). Thus, the incident is by itself the <i>primary subject</i> of the news coverage. If Gibson was not a celebrity, then of course this would not have gotten this much coverage. That, however, is irrelevant as Gibson <i>is</i> a celebrity and the incident <i>has</i> received a great amount of news coverage. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:55, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

What matters, as you have been pointing out, is notability. Notability qualifies the material to be on Wikipedia. It would be acceptable to extract certain facets of Mel Gibson's life for separate articles, but such extraction can not be indiscriminate. The discrimination called for, I think, concerns whether or not we find wider influence. The question one has to ask oneself is: Does this aspect of Mel Gibson's life have influence beyond his life? Mel Gibson's movies take on a life of their own. His acting role in a movie can be propounded upon because it takes on a life of it's own. It becomes a part of the popular culture. But drunk driving and the particular form of antisemitism displayed by Mel Gibson in the July 2006 incident, are core issues in his life. When one expounds upon those issues one runs the risk of distorting Mel Gibson's life. This is because these issues do not have wider influence beyond the core identity of Mel Gibson. And what I am of course further saying is that a separate article devoted to issues that do not have influence extending beyond the person's life certainly would have the tendency to place undue emphasis on those issues. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 20:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

As you have noted, one criterion (and in my opinion the superior criterion) is whether an event has influence beyond that person's life. Another criterion (inferior to the first but still valid) is whether it receives non-trivial coverage from multiple sources over an extended period of time, where such coverage discusses the individual primarily <i>in context of the event</i> (as opposed to in context of the person's life overall). As I have noted previously, I am not opposed to a selective merge if someone is willing to do it (whether through consensus or by being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>--although, in the latter case, I suspect the merge might be quickly reverted).

<li><b>Reply</b> Bus stop - I'm going to partially agree with you and say that, yes, the treatment of news event related articles is one of those "up for debate" areas that hasn't yet received strong consensus one way or another. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a>, for example, is a current attempt at a proposed guideline to help editors deal with exactly this sort of debate on a broader level. Unfortunately, in the meantime, that still means we can't simply refer to WP:NOT#IINFO and say "well, I think it <i>should</i> apply to news events too, so it does." That's not how the policies work. The policy says "here are the areas where we have strong consensus", and intentionally leave open the question of whether other things should be added down the road. Perhaps this type of article should be discriminated against? Maybe, maybe not, but at the moment WP:NOT doesn't handle it. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

There already exists the Mel Gibson article. The question is not whether the material is sufficiently notable to deserve an article of it's own. The question is whether there should be an additional article covering similar material, but with a different emphasis. I say there is not. I find that the July 28, 2006 DWI incident, and the antisemitic comments, are all a part of Mel Gibson's life. To separate out that negative incident is to highlight it. The more recent article provides a showcase for that one incident. My argument is that it fits in with the entire life of Mel Gibson. To set up an article to focus on a negative incident is to give undue emphasis. I find that the recent DWI incident, including the utterances of antisemitic comments, has no further implications beyond those things which pertain only to Mel Gibson's life. Therefore I see no reason to project that incident out into the additional literary space of a separate article. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 18:18, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Bus stop is responding to every "keep" vote with the same point (not to mention adding the readability-distorting boldface to the word "Point" every time). --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 05:15, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Point.</b> <a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> -- I don't think the boldfaced word "Point" does any damage to "readability." Do you confuse the word "Point" with either the word "Delete" or the word "Keep?" How does the boldfaced word "Point" cause a deterioration in "readability, in your opinion? I'm surprised that you are getting so petty, but I guess there may be validity to your criticism, and I will try to keep an open mind. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 05:45, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is news and belongs in his article where there is already an entire <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html#Drug_and_alcohol_abuse" title="Mel Gibson">section</a> devoted to this topic. We should also not lose sight of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. What happens the next time he gets arrested? Do we have a second article? If the decision here is to keep, one must assume that anyone who has an article on this wiki and gets arrested for a similar charge should also get their own article. This is simply not someplace we want to go. If the article needs to be split, then a whole section. or two, should be split out and not just one incident. In the end, we really need to look at this from the position of editors writing an encyclopedia. Does an article of this size, or detailed coverage of a single incident really need to be here? I think not. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 03:12, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
