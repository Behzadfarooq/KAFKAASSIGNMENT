</ol>
<p>Request removal from Articles for deletion at this time as precedence has already been established within the wikipedia arena.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No. This is Wikipedia not a court room. Precedence for these types of things simply means that we've missed the others; they'll be nominated for deletion eventually. If you are going to be all "smart" about it then at least give yourself some credibility with a signature. --<a href="../../../j/c/i/User%7EJCipriani_4ece.html" title="User:JCipriani">JCipriani</a> 02:17, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Amended Coding</b> Indiana Political Stub has been added</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Further Discussion</b> Category:Indiana_politician_stubs is large and well established. It would appear precedence is already set and all that is needed is a redirect link from stated page. Not only are candidates listed but campaign links exist all over.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Catagory Question</b> As you two know far more than I on Wikipedia creation: Do I create the catagory under Indina Elections or does someone else? Just an old DOS pascalian. - Ancasta</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Notability Defense</b> In the State of Indiana Secretary of State race. Gaining 2% of the public vote maintains ballot access for all candidates of that party (last election Mike Kole took 6% of the Vote). Which makes him notable for being the first Libertarian in the State of Indiana to maintain ballot access. Coming in second place per county makes that party one of the two major parties of that county and places that party on all County Boards (non-partisan rules). Displacing either the Republican or Democratic party. Indiana Code Title 3. Ancasta</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> Which counties has Mr. Kole come in second in? Has he actually displaced either the Democrats or Republicans in any county?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Search Engine Defense</b> In the Month of June, 2006 'Kole' was searched 3003 times. Determined by Keyword tool by overture.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> How many of them were for Mike Kole? There is also a DC Comic book character "Kole" and some other misc. hits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> To add to my nomination, this entire article is a cut &amp; paste from www.mikekole.com, which would also violate Wikipedia's copyvio policy. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 18:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have vocal authortity from Mr.Kole to bio him. If you wish to verfiy that I can give you his cell phone number. Ancasta...
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not to be used as a campaign platform. There have been numerous other articles removed for the same reason. If he was to win the election, then by all means he would be worthy.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 18:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I humbly appologize for the candidate inclusion. All references have been removed and no links to web sites suggesting such is in the article. That said: I would think that anyone on a ballot of the 3rd largest political party in the U.S.A and subject to many newspaper articles in regard to his life and comments would be notable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> He's not even a candidate. He is the local party chair. As a staunch Libertarian myself, I know that usually means that you took a potty break when they nominated and voted on the chair. Not notable. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 18:29, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> He is a candidate if you look up Indiana SOS candidates. He is very notible in Hamilton County, IN and and important person to the public in Central Indiana. Candidate references have been removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ancasta (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ancasta_b22b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ancasta">contribs</a>) 18:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Everyone has to have a <i>Day One</i> begining.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I stand (actually sit) corrected. I think that the best solution here would be a redirect to the as-yet-unwritten article on the S.O.S. election in Indiana. As per <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, elections first, then candidates. And, while I know nothing about this specific election and am a Libertarian myself, I strongly suspect that Mr. Kole will poll in the low-to-mid single digits. Not notable enough for an article but a good candidate for a redirect. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 19:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> So would 'Indiana Secretary of State Election' be more acceptable? - Ancasta
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> In my opinion, that would be a good way to handle this. Then all the candidates could be listed on that page and possibly redirects under their names to that page. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 20:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Article authorized to express not a FAKE! With 1000's of other notable people that are currently and have been on ballots - to single one out is prejudice.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Prejudice? Speaking only for myself, I didn't prejudge anything. I knew nothing about this person before I read the article in question. It may seem random or arbitrary but prejudice has nothing to do with it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Candidacy alone does not warrant inclusion. The other accomplishments listed also do not warrant inclusion. Wikipedia is run by guidelines, not by precedent. There may be numerous articles for other candidates, but most of them are <i>also</i> up for deletion for failing to meet guidelines. The article reads like a campaign ad, which would violate <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> as well. Wikipedia is not free ad space. It does not exist to be used as a campaign tool. The 'Article Authorized by Mike Kole' is the clincher. It is strong evidence that the article is being vetted by the campaign, which would fail <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 02:23, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
