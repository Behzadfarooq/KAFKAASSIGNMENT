<li><b>Article is notable and must be expended in its depth</b>. There have been published papers providing empirical evidence that the flow of peoples and vehicles in the citiy of Portland in USA, citiy of Marion in Australia and Bejing city in China have Power Law Scale free Characteristics. Mojarrabi et al used a superstatistical model to explain the results. I believe these findings must be addedd to refrence list as well.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also User RasPutinAXp says he is a adviser in alpha Chi Rho chapel in university of Rowan. I think in life everybody has an outward expression of his/her inner beauty. I became very surprised he believe to universal brotherhood and his outward expression is against instruments of world unity. Creating a global integrated transportaion system is a noble concept and is becoming popular among urban planners.</dd>
<dd>The reason I write this wiki article to let every person a chance to fulfill his/her spiritual obligation under principle of ever advancing civilisation. We all must carry forward an ever advancing civilisation.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is indeed such a concept. His creater was truly a giantic spiritual being dreaming to create new basis of happiness by inviting all the pepole of the world a chance to contribute to a global integrated knowldge for the benifit of all.</dd>
<dd>Our technical paper will publish in physics and transport engineering journals. Those Journals are our academic standards. Our dream is for humanity to create a paradise in earth as a gift to our lord and show our true love to our creator. This is a journey of love and you can join us. The field is indeed so immense, the period is so critical and the case of world uniffication is so great. But the workers are so few and the time is so short. No true followers of the path of lord of love can efford a moment of hesitation. The time has come for the emergence of a new race of men. In the world we dream, the pain of one is the pain of all and the joy of one is the joy of all. This is the meaning of Paradise. the human race is becoming one and worship the lord as one. Good luck my friends. Catt Eastsscaft 11:07, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia articles must be about notable subjects, but they also have to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">varifiable</a>. We can only cite papers once they have appeared in journals, not before. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventyThree_f926.html" title="User:SeventyThree">SeventyThree</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESeventyThree_51bb.html" title="User talk:SeventyThree">Talk</a>)</sup> 15:48, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Hmm</b> SeventyThree is right, the correct criteria for non-OR is: has the paper actually appeared in the journal, etc.? Its obviously a notable topic, but it needs wikilinks to &amp; from related articles on traffic &amp; networks, thus informing editors there of its existance. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 11:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>SeventyThree and jeffBurdges Position is fine</b> I agree, it is a notable topic . The issue of consensus in matter of verifiably remains that I will address below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, of course, There have been a number of published papers in Physics and Transport Enginerring journal in the last two years, in particular arXiv:physics , European Journal of Physics, Physical review E, Journal of Eastern Asian Society for Transportaion Studies and nature. The list is rather long . Here some notable examples from NASA and Los Almos&#160;: N. Alexandrove (2004) " Transportaion Network Topologies" NASA technical report no Tm-2004-213259. Toroczkai work from Los Almos has been appered in nature (2004) under title " Traffic Jamming is limited in Scale free network". G. Chowell et al from Los Almos have published an important paper in physical reveiew E and arXivphysics (2005) under the title "Scaling laws for the movement of pepole between locations in a large cities". Queensland University and catt systems have also published papers (2005) showing traffic in city of Marion, Adelaide has scale free characteristics. Also in the list are University of bejing, Tsukuba university, .... . So there have been significant progress in this topic. I guess we can reach to consensus that the article has fulfiled the three required condition for inclusion in wikipedia. Please let me. Catt Eastsscaft 14:27, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite. The topic is both <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. However the article as it stands is almost incomprehensible. It needs another editor to come in and overhaul it. I'll volunteer if there is no better qualified candidate (and assuming the result of this discussion is keep). <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gw</a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">rnol</a> 22:11, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and rewrite per Gwernol. A quick google shows that this is a genuine approach to the study of human movement, but the current article is not appropriate. (Frankly, it looks to me like it was copied and pasted from the middle of something else, and so may be a copyvio.) <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_Esperanza_9f0d.html" title="User:Bucketsofg/Esperanza"><b><font color="green">ets</font></b></a><font color="grey"><a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBucketsofg_e5d0.html" title="User talk:Bucketsofg"><b>ofg</b>✐</a> 22:40, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</font></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There's nothing comprehensible there to merge into a real article on the subject except possibly the definition. (Alternative vote — <b>Blank</b> and rewrite.) — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 23:47, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Article need to be expanded as it is an important and genuine article.</b> We need to find out why this type of format was chosen?</li>
</ul>
<p>Gwernol has volunteer himself to rewrite it. Please do so, as this is what realy wikipedia is about.</p>
<p>The article content including traffic light optimisation has been already published with proper refrences so no worry about copy rights.</p>
<p>The issue of expansion and comprehansion need to explored further. There has been radical scientific shift in the last few years in physics and social communities. The shift is away from social construction sense making theories toward more adaptive principle based theories as evident in South africa and Easts urban plannaing professionals. Many of these principled based theories and in fact nearly all published physics papers use agent based complex adaptive systems in one way or another. There has been alternative principle based complex adaptive approach also which the article suggest. It seems the article suggests this is the way to the global integrated transportaion/urban system. It is basically religion based complex adaptive system reinvoking intelligent design theories based on certain superstatistical model.Catt Eastsscaft 12:14, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
