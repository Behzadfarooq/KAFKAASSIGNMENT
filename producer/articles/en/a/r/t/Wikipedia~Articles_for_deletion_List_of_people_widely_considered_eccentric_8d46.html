Lists based on arbitrary criteria, particularly criteria determined by Wikipedia contributors, need to go.

<li>My preference is <b>Delete.</b> If kept, move all the unsourced entries to the article's Talk page—which at this point is all of them, effectively blanking the article. State at the top of the article that entries are to be inserted only if accompanied by source citations, meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines, which describe the person as "eccentric," using that word. The list then becomes a list of people who have been called eccentric, with source citations showing who called them that. Ideally enough of the source should be quoted so the reader can judge whether the person meets the reader's own criterion for eccentricity. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:57, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This either shows a disdain for religion or a lack of understanding of history. Either way the people you name are not self-described eccentrics nor did they get famous because they're eccentric. Koresh got famous as a cult leader, Manson for crimes, and Jesus as a religious leader/thinker. I know that <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_A._Norton_8e48.html" title="Joshua A. Norton">Joshua A. Norton</a> is seen as some kind of religious something to Discordians, but he did not see himself as any kind of religious anything as far as I know. Also it's unclear if Discordianism is an actual religion.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 03:58, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is this a list of self-described eccentrics we're debating? I don't think so. These aren't people who got famous for being eccentric either. That's not what's going on here. History is in the eye of the beholder, too, when such soft labels as "eccentric" are thrown around. Some guy who calls himself the son of God and runs around in the desert with 12 men, eschews sex, but hangs out with prostitutes, seems eccentric by most standards (and if you disagree, that just proves the point that there is no subjective criteria for inclusion). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 19:43, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm saying this list could be made into a list of self-described eccentrics and people who got famous for eccentricity. It'd take radical culling, but it's not impossible.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 03:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>On second thought after doing a bit of work I realized fixing this list is way too difficult as it has too much dross.
