<p>Listed for CSD under the reasoning, "defammatory", thus claiming CSD A6 as a personal attack. But then, it's true, they all do fit a certain mass-related criterion (they're pretty fat, and pretty famous), so we'll open it up for debate. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro</a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 06:40, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>. 'Overweight' and 'famous' are too subjective when combined. If there were a criterion by mass or weight or BMI for 'overweight,' and 'famous' was the same as our 'notable,' then it could be debated or considered, but as it stands, there's just too much room for opinion. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson">CorbinSimpson</a> 06:48, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The list was already growing in the heavily trafficked and frequently vandalized <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a> article and making a separate article is the best way to get it out of there. You know that we have a class of editors whose idea of contributing to human knowledge is to point out that "John Doe is fat". Let's give them a separate place to play so they don't interfere with a real article. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 07:01, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Serving as a lightning rod for vandalism is a very poor reason to keep an article. Does it have independent merits? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 08:30, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course it has no merits other than keeping people who think it's worthwhile away from the obesity article. I don't personally care whether it lives or dies by itself but I thought it was a useless distraction and a lightning rod for trouble in the obesity article. As long as it is understood that no one re-creates it as part of the obesity article, we can delete it as far as I am concerned. Will you back me on keeping it from being re-started there?<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 01:26, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: we do have other lists of this type that are sourced, defined and maintained such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_tall_women.html" title="List of famous tall women">List of famous tall women</a>, List of short actors or our list of Notable anorectics found at <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorexia_nervosa.html" title="Anorexia nervosa">Anorexia nervosa</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 07:24, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Those lists are much more narrow. A "list of obese actors" could be manageable; even "list of people famous for their weight" could too - but a "famous overweight" list is too much. This list is like having a "list of tall people" and "list of short people" instead of the ones you posted. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 08:13, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm really unsure about that; and also, honestly, how much worth is to this list? Who's going to look at it and go "oh wow, I had no idea Chris Farley was fat! you learn something every day!" A person's weight is immediatley apparent, and this kind of list would mostly be based on public perception, not fact. As such, what's its value, if all the contents are already in the public's mind? Finally, why the hell does this even matter? Save for a handful of comedians, these people's weight is of absolutely no consequence to their notability. Also, what do we do about people like, say, Kristie Allie? <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 08:51, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Look, I'm not saying that I have all the answers, but while we know that Farley was fat without the list, isn't the same true for height, race and many other criteria listed at Wikipedia? Yet, editors find these lists very useful and appealing. From the intellectual standpoint, the list is achievable within wikipedia policy guidelines. Therefore, I can't vote against it. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 09:07, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Overweight" is an insanely broad term. Somebody like Brad Pitt is technically overweight, at 6' and 203 lbs <a href="http://eslbee.com/cobaq/quizzes/ID/brad_pitt.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://eslbee.com/cobaq/quizzes/ID/brad_pitt.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (I just randomly looked it up, not that I know Brad Pitt's weight by heart). Anyway, this list is completely unmaintanable, and even if the inclusion criteria is modified to be obese-only, it can still quickly grow to be the biggest fattest article ever on wikipedia, as soon as we dip into history past Santa Claus. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 08:09, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Many professional athletes would qualify by the BMI index. It only compares height to weight, not body fat or muscle mass. I'd love to go on a "tall" diet but my height has been constant for years. The analogy is problematic. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 08:34, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, rename and constrict inclusion criteria</b> then clean it up.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have no problem with the term "overweight" which is not necessarily defamatory. However, I think that it should be careful of inclusion. For example, it should only include people who recognise that they are overweight - some people might take offence at being called "overweight" if they personally don't think that they are. However, the likes of Roseanne and <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah.html" title="Oprah">Oprah</a>, who have documented their weight problems, probably wouldn't mind (note: both of those have lost weight since stating that they had weight problems) <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 14:29, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> — overweight is too inclusive. It can even include actors and actresses who bulked up for a particular role. This should be moved to something along the lines of "list of famous obese people", which is a <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obesity.html" title="Obesity">well defined</a> criteria and more restrictive. Perhaps even narrow it down further to morbidly obese if necessary?&#160;:) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 15:42, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
