<p>This article, written by an editor with the same name as the contact given for the WIF, makes extraordinary claims -- the planned construction of a global science city being the most remarkable, with the huge number of claimed Nobelist members not being far behind. (The same editor has also linked large numbers of scientists' Wikipedia articles to this article, and also to the WIF website; so many that I blocked them for linkspamming.)</p>
<p>Yet, apart from a number of distinguished academics having accepted fellowships and other awards offered in letters from the WIF, there seems to be remarkably little evidence to back up its claims that does not come, directly or indirectly, from the WIF itself. See <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#World_Innovation_Foundation" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#World Innovation Foundation</a> for more discussion about this, and details of some of the concerns about verifying the WIF's claims.</p>
<p>I propose that we <b>delete</b> this article unless verifiable evidence can be provided for the assertions in this article. If the WIF is an organization of the size and significance asserted by the article, it should have no difficulty doing so. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 13:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete -- The WIF website contains very little verifiable data, and looks like a front.

<li>Judging by the the comments on the WIF site's letters page <a href="http://www.thewif.org.uk/letters.php?xy=1920" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thewif.org.uk/letters.php?xy=1920" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>: the WIF appears to send out large numbers of letters to academics, offering them honorary fellowships, and academics write back to say thank you, they'd be honoured to accept. As one commenter on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> notes, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a> is well known for this kind of activity. Now, if these academics have done more than just reply politely to letters offering them an honour, and perhaps release a press release that they were being recognized by such an honour -- for example, if they had attended committee meetings or conferences held by the WIF -- I'd be much more inclined to accept at least some of the WIF's claims. However, I think the burden of proof lies with the WIF to demonstrate this. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 15:41, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Personally I never suspected the organization of being an outright hoax; as others have pointed out, there is evidence it's real. But merely existing isn't enough. I've yet to see any verifiable evidence that the organization is notable, and I think it's telling that the only person who has added information about the organization seems to be trying to promote it. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 17:09, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to be clear, the original criterion identified for the deletion of the article was that it was not verified information.

<ul>
<li>The issues aren't completely separate: I think the claim that the organization <i>exists</i> is verifiable, but the claims that it's <i>notable</i> aren't (for example, there's no source for "it can count on the individual and collective support of...87 Nobel Laureates"). What criteria others use is up to them. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 17:24, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree. If it exists <i>as claimed in the article</i>, complete with its Swiss foundation and planned global research city on its way, then it is certainly notable, and the article should be kept. If it turns out to be one man with a letterhead and big dreams, then it probably isn't. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 17:29, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm a little unclear as to how the WIF is supposed to come up with proof of its existence, when the primary editor of this article has been blocked from contributing because of the linkspam issue noted above. The person who is in the best position to provide the evidence is not able to contribute. Messages were left on his talk page about link spamming (not verifiability), and there are no comments to the article's talk page expressing concerns about verifiability. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 15:53, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this is actually false, the burden of proof is not on the organizations as most do not post here. To say they are not notable after apparently information saying they are, means the burden of proof is on the accuser. You can do a google search some people list it as their highest honor and there are speeches WIF members gave, though I am sure they are known for more then that. Also our lack of ability to google their conferences, does not mean they do not take place. While I personally do not believe they exist, the "proof" says otherwise. As I stated on AN/I perhaps its best to contact some of the prestigious members and find out if this is a hoax, but I do think that more info needs to be rounded up before Wikipedia denounces it a hoax. What a black eye it would be if they are real and Wikipedia called such a group fake. Perhaps Arbcom or some legal aspect of Wikipedia should investigate this. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:33, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not about proving them fake; rather, it is about proving their assertions to be real. The burden of proof for a <i>positive</i> assertion is always on the person making the assertion, in this case, the original writer of the article, who, at least on the face of it, appears to be a representative of the WIF. Otherwise, editors are put in the position of having to prove a negative. This is implicit in the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 16:37, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Proving something is ahoax isnt proving a negative, proving lots of sceintists are fooled is not proving a negative. I have given numerous links showing people belong to this group, their website speaks for itself as well. Its membership speaks for itself as well. If it exists, I think this AfD is not proper way to handle this and Arbcom or someone should put in some research time, or a phone call to them. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:43, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

It may fall short of a 'hoax', per say, as the organization does exist, but in the same sense that a diploma mill is not a real institute of higher learning, this is not "multi-billion dollar global centre for scientific research." Public relations releases from universities mean nothing, as those PR departments at universities are vicious at taking whatever they can. As it stands currently, its a joke. Why are their offices and registrations in the UK, if they're based out of Sweden? Where's the past information and coverage about this organization? As Uncle G puts it, each of the pieces of 'news' have the same PR-style wording. Not only do I belive the subject is not notable, but in the end nearly all the claims are unverifiable and dubious. Plus, there's vanity involved. Last, where's these research centers that are supposedly all around the world? Burn it. It can be recreated when they finish laying the concrete foundations for most of the buildings in their $22b research city. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 18:05, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG Delete</b> This is an entirely non-notable organization. If the organization sounds on the level and it doe not cost them anything - Academics will go "sure" to anything that they can put on a letterhead. Not sure what the endgame is but it's a paper organization. An international organization like that run out of that address in Hudderfield? That should have set the alarm bells ringing to start with. EDIT - the homemade website should have been another clue. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 19:34, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But our analysis that leads to the conclusion of hoax/crank/scam institute is original research in itself. The only purpose for it is that we identify it for what it is in order to delete it. Without reliable sources for denoting it as a hoax, it'd be original research to have it as an article about a hoax. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 00:30, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Several sources carry press releases with next to no editorial review. It is not enough to establish claims of notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The WIF seems to be a real entity on some level, and if there is <i>independent</i> evidence about its membership and activities, I'd support recreation. Even if it's a hoax, if it has indeed attracted so many Nobel prizewinners (most of them well into their twilight years, by the look of it), it would be a notable hoax. As it is, there is a vanishingly small amount of evidence about the organisation which does not come from its own website and "executive chairman". --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 12:46, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
