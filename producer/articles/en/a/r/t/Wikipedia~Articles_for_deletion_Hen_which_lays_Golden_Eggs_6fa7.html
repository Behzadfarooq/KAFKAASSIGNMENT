<li><b>Comment</b> I find the above comment to be invalid in itself. I do not see how it is wrong to vote for an article whether I am a registered member or not, regardless as to which articles I have edited either anonymously or as a registered person throughout my time here. And I think the rules speak for themselves: <i>Anyone can contribute to the discussion and vote, anonymous users as well as pseudonymous users.</i> A direct quote from the Guide to Votes for deletion. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 02:09, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I didn't say your vote <i>was</i> invalid; I said it <i>may be</i> invalid; the decision is not mine. It's usually granted that the author, even if anonymous, has the right to a vote on an article he created. However, in your case, you do not appear to be the author and some might consider you a sock puppet. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 01:43, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see what you mean now, however I was merely pointing out in my initial comment that the author's article <i>is</i> valid because I myself know for a fact that it is based on actual literature regarding a Hen that lays golden eggs - which has been considered a phenomenon in medieval folklore across Europe as well as a running theme in many fairy tales and stories. Also the Hen or <i>Black Pullet</i> is of considerable importance in the occult as a powerful image. Anyway, I still move to keep this article but perhaps rename it or even combine it with the The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg. which could therefore be expanded as well with this article included. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 03:52, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: It is a goose - so who's going to search for a hen? What use is a redirect? Should we also have unsystematicly-named articles on Partriges that lay golden eggs, Ptarmigan which lay golden eggs, the Albatross that did lay an egg that was golden?</li>
<li>Comment: So let's see according to your statement above we count the number of times that the Gooose appears in folklore (Aesop's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Goose_That_Laid_the_Golden_Eggs_14ac.html" title="The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs">The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs</a> which has been sometimes considered a Hen as you can see by <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hen+that+laid+the+golden+egg&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hen+that+laid+the+golden+egg&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Googling it</a>, and The Brothers Grimm's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Goose_e9a7.html" title="The Golden Goose">The Golden Goose</a>). Now how many times does the Hen feature in folklore <b>and</b> other affiliated themes? (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Black_Pullet_5ccd.html" title="The Black Pullet">The Black Pullet</a>, the Russian fairy tale Kurochka Ryaba as stated below <b>and</b> <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk_0562.html" title="Jack and the Beanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a>, and that's not even mentioning the fact that it is also used as an Alchemical term.) So I guess it's 3-2 for the Hen so far. Also this Hen comes up in other fairy tales as well. However as stated before I feel it should perhaps be placed, moved into a category where the Goose, Hen and other fowls that lay golden eggs can be located etc.. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 20:56, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Goose" is more common in English, which is what matters. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 22:42, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>How do you figure that? I think I've provided more than enough evidence to prove against your belief that "Goose" is more common than "Hen". What you are forgetting is I'm not contesting against the fact of it being a Goose or not, but the fact remains there is still a considerable difference between both creatures, one is a Goose the other is a Hen - and in both respects we have seen that they are described as such in their respective folklore. I'll leave it at that. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 23:01, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there exist a notable Russian fairy tale as stated below on this subject, it should be dealt with at Kurochka Ryaba, and not in this article. This article contains nothing about any Russian folk tale, and my vote remains to delete it - if you or anyone else should decide to create a better article about this story in the future, there will be nothing to stop you. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 23:10, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've checked it; there is a Dutch fairy tale about a hen with golden eggs. This may well be the same as the Russian tale, or it may be the same as the English one about the goose with a centuries-old mistranslation either way. So this should redirect some place, I'll let the experts figure out where. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 09:39, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
