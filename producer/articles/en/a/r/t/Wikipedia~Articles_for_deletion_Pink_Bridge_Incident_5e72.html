<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: "per nom"? You listed no valid reason. It is a notable incident within <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntington%2C_West_Virginia_30f0.html" title="Huntington, West Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a> with appropriate citations and an extensive body of text - more than many other articles which are kept on Wikipedia that lack sources. It has also been featured on CBS, ABC, CNN and FOX news, making it quite notable outside of the KYOVA region. If that wasn't the case, it would still fit the bill as would articles concerning the city itself - or else we'd be left with very few articles as most city-related articles do not fall into a broad region but are specific. Would you propose deleting <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parks_of_Huntington%2C_West_Virginia_70e8.html" title="Parks of Huntington, West Virginia">Parks of Huntington, West Virginia</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/Cityscape_of_Huntington%2C_West_Virginia_4652.html" title="Cityscape of Huntington, West Virginia">Cityscape of Huntington, West Virginia</a> since it isn't notable outside the local area?

<li><b>Keep</b> for now anyway. Well-referenced artilce on an event that is causing alot of controversy and getting national exposure. People will likely be googling this topic for some time, and this article seems to be a good source for now. If the event dies down in the future, I may be open to a merge into <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntington%2C_West_Virginia_30f0.html" title="Huntington, West Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a>, <s><a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreation_in_Huntington%2C_West_Virginia_d5af.html" title="Recreation in Huntington, West Virginia">Recreation in Huntington, West Virginia</a></s>, or a future spin-off article on the city. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">ahoy hoy</a>)</small> 16:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

The page length could become lengthy and the incident isn't wholly related to recreation within the city either. This is considered a 'spin-off' article for the city at current, but it could be directed towards Government as much as Recreation at this point. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 16:05, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was going to reccomend merging it into <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritter_Park_8536.html" title="Ritter Park">Ritter Park</a> at some point in the future, but I see you had that deleted, a move with which I mildly disagree.

<li>So you are suggesting watering down the article, leaving out the requests for the red/yellow bridges, the Mayor abusing city ordinances and the law, and dumbing it down to a short paragraph onto a page that is already lengthy and will only grow? Let's go ahead and water down thousands of Wikipedia articles because they may be too lengthy or of local interest.</li>
<li>Should we be going and deleting <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreation_in_Huntington%2C_West_Virginia_d5af.html" title="Recreation in Huntington, West Virginia">Recreation in Huntington, West Virginia</a> since it is local? Or what about all the notable people from Huntington that have entries? <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterans_Memorial_Fieldhouse_6b02.html" title="Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse">Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Albee_ad45.html" title="Keith Albee">Keith Albee</a> would also fit the bill, along with <a href="../../../b/u/i/Buildings_at_the_University_of_Kentucky_2757.html" title="Buildings at the University of Kentucky">Buildings at the University of Kentucky</a>, etc. You haven't defined a line and it is vague and insignificant at best. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 19:12, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>When you leave out pertant information regarding potential lawsuits, potential action against the mayor for violating the law, copycat issues, and a wealth of other information (since it is being maintained into 2007), you are leaving the reader with a potentially biased and unsubstantial view on an event.</li>
<li>As a suggestion in order to not come off as arrogant and selfish, I would use only terminology that others can understand. i.e. Leave the foreign language out. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 22:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just because you've heard of something doesn't make it notable: I've heard of numerous minor pop stars having affairs with Z-list actors, but they aren't notable in the sense that you hope your children will have heard of them. The <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> aircraft flights and crashes are notable because they are part of something that shapes the world, but random disasters are not. In the same way, this is just some current news, and as such belongs in Wikinews, not in Wikipedia. If someday there is a worldwide "painting things pink" movement, then we will resurrect this article, as it will be notable as the first significant pink bridge. But we're not here to predict the future, so right now it's just a pink bridge: mildly interesting, but not notable. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:37, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Per comment left above, it is an exhaustible resource to Huntington. If we removed all localised information for the city based that it is "not notable outside of the locals," we would be removing much of the interesting information that makes a city unique. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 02:39, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is also articles like this that makes a city article not only more complete and fulfilling, but interesting. How many cities can claim that they have a pink bridge that has caused controversy for over a month? What if we were to delete every interesting or notable (localised) incident that were to occur? Wikipedia's city pages would be very dull and boring indeed. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 02:39, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
