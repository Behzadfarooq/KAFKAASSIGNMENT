The problem with the first AfD being closed as <i>keep</i> was that none of the editors who opined <i>keep</i> offered a valid rationale per WP policy or guidelines.

<li><b>Weak delete, but I'm not sure.</b> The vast majority of chess clubs are not notable. I would say that a chess club is notable if a historic chess event took place there, or if a world-class grandmaster played there for several years. On these criteria the Marshall Chess Club in New York City would qualify, but all we have about it in Wikipedia is this line in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Marshall_f918.html" title="Frank Marshall">Frank Marshall</a>: "In 1915 he opened the Marshall Chess Club in New York." Look at the pages in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChess_clubs_f756.html" title="Category:Chess clubs">Category:Chess clubs</a>, and you will see that the notability of most of them is highly questionable. A particular offender is SKSamobor. So I think the article under discussion should be deleted, and the other chess club articles should be reviewed, perhaps in CfD. 129.98.212.143 02:35, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but clean up. This Club is old and has been involved with various notable chess people and events. Comment on above - we do not decide whether to delete articles or even review articles by discussing whether to delete the category they are in.

<dd>Which reasoning? The main keep recommendation or the comment? The problem with this article is that it needs cleanup. I came across it by chance. I am not a chess player and I am not from Canada. "the oldest traceable recorded Canadian correspondence chess game" seems to meet notability guidelines, except I can not find the reference on the URL given. Outside verification is likely for much of this article, but has not been found. Much of the article should be trimmed out. Instead of trying to delete interesting but unverified material, we should at this stage be trying to find verified sources. Maybe in the end this will have to go, but I do not see it has to go now. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 04:08, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I'm not sure where it is but something that goes back with a continuous history of 160 years is very frequently considered notable. Age for schools for example is used as a criteria. Both the Club and presumably corrspondence chess have such a continuous history. Stuff in my country that goes back to the 1840s is certainly considered notable. Remember we are using guidelines. If something is interested and can be verified we should ignore guidelines if we have to and keep. However I grant you that this article needs work, and I guess it will not happen over the Christmas holiday period. I'm going to leave to others now and sort out my holiday period. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 06:34, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Notability guidelines are <i>guidelines</i>. There is no need to cite one when recommending keep or delete. You are even free to say that you think the article should be kept, despite the guidelines. Your opinion is still valid. The guidelines are simply a refection on what the community tends to view as notable etc.: they are <i>descriptive not proscriptive</i>. Some of us think notability is pretty useless as a criterion anyway.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 09:03, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> per plenty of precedents of student societies being <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">not notable</a> by definition, or per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. Quite frankly, this is not one of those exceptions which proves the rule. Don't be fooled by the <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_and_mirrors.html" title="Smoke and mirrors">smoke and mirrors</a>, the article tries to give the impression of things which were not the case, by including some verbose POV text, tenuous links and assertions. It seems to be written in a specific attempt to avoid deletion, with too much padding not of direct relevance to the club. Some examples, the QUCC's origins within the Kingston Chess club are tenuous at best; QUCC was founded in the 1950s, not 1841!; Larry Melvyn Evans was already American champ when he played at the tournament at QU, and was not a member of the QUCC. A complete re-write will show this up clearly, but I don't see it worth the effort unless it's the only way to convince the community of the <b>delete</b> conclusion which is staring me in the face. I was equally surprised at the keep verdict, for the reasons given by the nom. In addition, this poorly written, excessively linked up article is a real turn-off. But then, I suspect that's also part of the smoke and mirrors. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:14, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. As the nominator of the first AfD, I based the original nomination on the precedent that university clubs are generally non-notable, with few exceptions. After re-reading the article based on <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a>'s statements, I must agree with his sentiments. The article reads to imply that the club was founded at the same time as the university; however, I'm about 99.44% certain that this is not the case. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 13:14, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Reference to student clubs as an overall category is misleading. This is a club with international connections, mentioned in the article, and clearly a definite, if closely defined, notability. If it is thought that the clear and uncontested notability of some players who belong to the club does not confer notability to the club, then so be it; but in chess, the players ARE the club. Arguing admittedly by analogy and not by official policy, in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> a band is notable if it contains a notable member. Why should a chess club be different?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 19:45, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> True, a band is notable if it contains a notable member. But this argument by analogy turns, I think, on two different senses of the word "member." A "member" of a club is merely someone who has joined the club, whearas a band is <i>defined</i> as that particular group of musicians. To put it another way, if the most famous member of a chess club left it, the club would still continue. The same may not be true of the most famous member of a band. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 20:40, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems like Wikipedia's AfD system is badly flawed. If an AfD fails it comes here. If it fails here it way goes back and gets re-nominated, usually many times over until finally a minority get the verdict they want (delete).

<li><b>Keep</b> plus a good cleanup. 03:04, 22 December 2006 (UTC) Without going into too much detail, I support the notion of keeping this article per the reasoning of the first AfD debate. However, the article needs improvement in terms of style, organization, citations, etc. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 19:03, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>General question</b> for the people commenting "keep and clean up": what would a cleaned-up article would look like? It would just be a shorter version of the current article: a disconnected list of tournaments and matches. This is because the club itself has not been the subject of multiple, independent reliable sources, which would enable us to write a good article on it. Also, does anybody dispute Ohconfucius's analysis of the true age of this club? "It's old" was a reason offered for keep in both AfDs. Also, <a href="../../../i/n/t/WP%7EINTERESTING_6e23.html" title="WP:INTERESTING">WP:INTERESTING</a> is not a valid rationale for keep, nor is the connection to something else (Queen's University) that is (definitely) notable. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 19:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>don't need to, find a comparable chess club in wikipedia. the history in the article, if cited and verified makes this club notable. how so you ask? if i were on a high school chess team and looking to go to a college with a chess club, this is the sort of chess club that would strike me as having accomplished some things in the chess world.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 13:41, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Buridan, the point we're trying to make here is that the history of the club as presented in the article is incredibly misleading to a reader. It needs to explicitly say when the club was founded, and provide a source saying that the club was founded in that year. Right now, it makes a misleading claim that implies that the club was founded in the same year as Queen's University itself, which I'm pretty sure is false. This goes nothing to say that the precedent set by other discussions around here that says that "student clubs are generally NOT notable", and I don't particularly see any internationally famous grandmasters that played chess at this club. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 15:34, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Buridan, you may not need verifiable, reliable sources (not to mention straightforward claims) in order to believe this club is the greatest chess club ever, but Wikipedia does <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:40, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That means it needs <b>cleanup</b> not deletion, if they do not have sources, which I bet they easily do given the documentation of chess history, that is a different story, but to me they meet the notable test, they just need cleanup to be verifiable.

And there's no club website on the university domain<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=KJR&amp;q=+site%3Awww.queensu.ca+chess&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=KJR&amp;q=+site%3Awww.queensu.ca+chess&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. And very few google hits generally<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=BKR&amp;q=%22Queen%27s+University+Chess+Club%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=BKR&amp;q=%22Queen%27s+University+Chess+Club%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Of course google is not everything, but where do you think you will find your reliable, verifiable sources? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 09:32, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>History if more often found in books, and no, i'm not going to cleanup the article. what i suggest is that you tag it with cleanup, describe what needs to be cleaned up, and if no one cleans it up in a year, you put it up for afd after a year. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 22:03, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Dubious, unreferenced notability at best, which still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The smoke and mirrors count against the article e.g. a lot of the names dropped seem to have no direct relationship with the club at all e.g. a player's father was professor at the university but it is not asserted that the player was a member of the club; some players were contestants at a tournament held at the university, which may have been their only contact with the university ever. There also seems to be an unspoken and unsubstantiated assumption that if a chess player attended the university, they <i>must</i> have been part of this club - but for all we know, there may be more than one chess club on campus and they preferred the other one or perhaps they preferred attending an off-campus chess club or perhaps they preferred playing outside of a chess club <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:04, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
