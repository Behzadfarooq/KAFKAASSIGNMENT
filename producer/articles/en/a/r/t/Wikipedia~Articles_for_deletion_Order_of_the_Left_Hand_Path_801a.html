<dd>Answer: I said, quoting you originally "not 'mainstream research <i>publications'</i> ". But OK, let's read the opening sentences from the Australian Ass. for the Study of Religion (a 1998 press release by the way): "<i>I am editing</i> a handbook of information on new religious groups and associations in Australia. The greater part of the information included in the handbook is <i>provided by the groups themselves</i>."

<dd><b>Comment</b>, They would be, if they in fact proved more than the bear bones of existence. I'd note that only two sources (the first and third) in fact mention the group <i>at all</i>, with the second being a paper on the general phenomenon which <i>doesn't</i> mention it. Of those two sources mentioning it, the first merely includes it as part of a list of satanic groups, which proves that the author has heard of it and very little else. The third does pretty much likewise, but adds that the group has "less than fifty members", which seems to suggest that it's not a particularly serious concern. Therefore, <b>delete</b> based on the sources provided. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:38, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Second source mentions it under the name Ordo Sinistra Vivendi (multiple mentions by academic sources proves cults notability). And earlier mentioned website of AASR gives more detailed overview on this cult. There is also lengthy article on this cult in the website of Russian Orthodox church <a href="http://www.nevskiy.orthodoxy.ru/center/spravochnik/satanism/Order_of_Left.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nevskiy.orthodoxy.ru/center/spravochnik/satanism/Order_of_Left.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 09:17, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the tip on the second source. That said, we're still left with three sources there which mention this group in passing as part of a list of similar groups, which doesn't establish notability at all. Quoting from <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">this guideline</a>, we see that something must be "described by multiple independent reliable sources", with <i>described</i> the operative word - I don't see a description in any of those sources beyond the barest mention of the name (and, occasionally) the alternative name in either Latin or English. It's generally accepted that a mention which only says that something exists proves nothing beyond the fact that it exists. The AASR website has quite rightly been called into question by another user for containing information provided from the group itself, which renders it somewhat less than "independent" and may well render it unreliable to boot. I don't have any Russian, so I can't pass any judgement on exactly what's being said there, or indeed anything else regarding the independence or reliability of the site. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:44, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is standart procedure regarding New Religious Movements to ask them to provide information on their beliefs, this is how research is done. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 11:53, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's perfectly entitled to be standard procedure, but it renders the information less than impartial. Don't just take my word for it - it's in that quote I cited earlier, "described by multiple independent reliable sources". Simply reprinting information provided by a group or a person isn't being independent. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:29, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Never the less this information was processed by Dr. Rowan Ireland which makes it perfectly independent and reliable source, unless of course you have a proof that he enjoys worshiping Satan in his spare time, then he's not busy reading lectures at uni. That is the only thing, I'm afraid, that will make this source not independent. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 08:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you and I might be defining "independent" in different ways. I'm not saying that Dr Ireland <i>himself</i> isn't independent, he certainly has the capability to be. What I'm saying is that the <i>information</i> contained in that source isn't independent. Dr Ireland can be a Satanist, a Zoroastrian or a Raelian for all it matters, what matters is where he gets his information from. If Dr Ireland wrote a book in which he described this group in reasonable detail, that would be a description by an independent and reliable source. What we have here is a press release saying that Dr Ireland was intending to write a book (which doesn't appear to have been released, incidentally). The information he tells us he will use is sourced directly from the group itself (i.e. it isn't independent - unless you take the view that the group would really provide impartial information). Such information as is in the press release is very scanty indeed (i.e. very probably not a description of the group). Having multiple sources telling us that the group exists is a good start, but it isn't the end of the deal - there are multiple sources stating that I exist, I know this because I applied for a passport today, but it doesn't make me notable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"What I'm saying is that the information contained in that source isn't independent". If we'll follow that logic, it could be said, that Bibliologist shouldn't use Bible, because Bible is not independent source on Bible, but rather he should use, let's say - Quran? -- <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 10:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>PS. And it was published as CD-ROM "Australia's Religious Communities: A Multimedia Exploration", and it's professional edition of included information on Ordo Sinistra Vivendi as can be clearly seen from this review <a href="http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000065.cgi" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000065.cgi" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 10:48, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, there's a considerable difference there. A Biblical scholar won't <i>just</i> use the Bible - he or she will also use other material from other scholars, as well as the critical faculties of his or her own mind. There's no evidence in that press release that Dr Ireland had done either (in fact there's considerable evidence that he hadn't used material from other scholars). Had he written this book, it could well be a different story. Additionally, if the only evidence we had on the existence of the Bible came in the form of some people saying "Other examples of religious books are the Bible, the Talmud, the Bhagavad Gita..." and nothing more (as remains the case in this review of the CD=ROM database - it's still just proof of existence rather than anything else), then I doubt it would be worthwhile to include an article on the Bible. Of course, that isn't the case here, which rather causes problems for our friendly neighbourhood strawman. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:52, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
