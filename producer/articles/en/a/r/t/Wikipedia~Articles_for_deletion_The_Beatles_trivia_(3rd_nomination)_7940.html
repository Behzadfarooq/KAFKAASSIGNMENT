<li><b>Keep but rename</b> - as I said in the last debate, it would be very unfair to describe much of this article as "trivia" - "miscellany" might be better as most of this is of genuine interest, some may even deserve their own article. Again, to repeat what I said last time,the comparison was with an article about <a href="../../../k/e/a/Keane.html" title="Keane">Keane</a> that included such glorious nuggets as "they love food" and this article is of a totally different nature. There isn't an obvious merge target for all of it and it makes sense to have it separate from the main Beatles article. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 12:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but rename</b> - keep for all the reasons per the previous AfD's; the major articles are already very large and info here may be difficult to insert within article context - <i>That is not to say it isn't notable</i> just difficult to find an appropriate place.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The content passes all wikipedia policies. It is referenced and relates to the Beatles career and impact. There is nothing trivial about information - at the end of the day, this is an encyclopedia. The problem is that the Beatles' article is quite long. Hence, multiple articles are required. And no rename is required--<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I can't honestly see how it is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and that is specifically proscribed by WP:NOT. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 18:26, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>WP: Not (indiscriminate collection of information) is specific not elastic. It does not encompass anything or everything that is difficult to categorize/poorly organized/I don't like/has trivia in the title/I don't understand/I think is pointless,useless,stupid etc. It specifically proscribes: (i)FAQs; (ii) travel guides; (iii) memorials; (iv) instruction manuals; (v) internet guides; (vi) textbooks; (vii) plot summaries; (viii) lyrics databases; (ix) things made up in school. It only proscribes these when the article in question is "simply" one of these nine categories- i.e. it does not go beyond the parameters of the archetype. This article does not fit into any of those catgeoriies and is in no way proscribed by the policy you cite. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:55, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This article gives direct links to many people, artists and places that The Beatles were connected with. It is a stepping stone to many other pages on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. For subject matter as widely known as the Beatles, even miscellany is notable as long as its sourced, verifiable, yadda yadda.. In addition, it has survived two previous AFDs in less than a year. I agree with Andreasegde that the article can always be renamed if it offends the anti-trivia bias shown by some editors. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 21:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Close Nomination</b>. I have now noticed that the previous AfD concluded with a <b>keep</b>. The nominee has failed to provide examples in how this article has deteriorated from the last time, and has offered no new compelling reasons for the AfD. Therefore the nomination is pointless. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC) ps.

<li><b>Keep</b> Some people above incorrectly assert that "trivia" is prohibited under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a>. In fact, words like "trivia" and "cruft" appear nowhere in that section of policy, and there is not even broad consensus on how to define trivia or when it should or shouldn't be allowed on Wikipedia. Thus I discount the argument that refer to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a>. Moreover, it doesn't appear that the article or policy has changed since the previous afd discussions, so on that basis alone I would recommend <i>keep</i> for consistency. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:05, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> again. Rename to get rid of the word "trivia" that seems to be the deletion magnet here. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 03:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> Apart from issues of labeling, I can't believe this unfocused pastiche of an article is on wikipedia and somehow managed to survive a previous AFD (and to the extent WP has formal deletion criteria, this article violates it and thus the fact it was previously up for deletion shouldn't matter). It has no subject but merely presents various bits of information that relate to the Beatles, with the loose theme of presenting "trivia" (or however you wish to say "random bits of information") about the Beatles. The loose format permits a lot of POV material to slide through. Why can't this material be merged into the main Beatles article, or articles about Billy Preston, James Taylor, etc.? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 09:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. Some very useful data amongst the chaff. Agree that the non-trivial parts should be merged into their respective articles. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArakunem_454b.html" title="User:Arakunem">Arakunem</a> 17:46, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I must state that this article is definitely not "random bits of information". 1. Every section has a <i>definite connection</i> with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>—every single section. 2. It would be impossible to merge the various pieces of information into The Beatles' articles without making them too confusing to read. 3. The Beatles' articles (and especially this one) are a stepping-stone to many other articles about artists/politicians/places, and institutions. 4. Have you ever tried to navigate your way around a city without a map? 5. Change the name of this article to something else, please... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 19:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Of course there's a connection to the Beatles - that's the only logic behind the article. Apart from that, there is simply no logic at all behind it. It's random, you could reassemble it in any way you like and it wouldn't make it any more or less coherent. And the point that you keep making about navigation makes no sense - we use categories to provide a navigation framework, not extra articles of random information. Finally, the problem with this article is not the title, it's the style and content. Whether you call it Beatles miscellany, Beatles stuff that no-one has bothered to edit properly, A stream of consciousness written by Beatles fans or whatever, the point is an encyclopaedia article does not just assemble random bits of information in a haphazard order. It's about <i>synthesising</i> the information, <i>editing out</i> extraneous details, <i>describing</i> the subject of an article in a logical way, <i>informing</i> the reader. This article does none of those things. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 19:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>1. You say that the article is logical, but, "apart from that", you say that it is not logical at all. 2. It is not random—the sections are grouped under their respective headers (in alphabetical order, BTW.) 3. You say I <i>keep making the same points</i>, but you have nominated this article for deletion twice in six months. 4. Style and content is something that seems to fluctuate every month on Wikipedia, I'm sorry to say. 5. Editing: Look at the history page, and you will find there have been one or two changes made. 6. "A stream of consciousness" does not apply, and I find that wildly inaccurate. 7. "Haphazard"? (I refer you to point #2) 8. I find the article extremely logical, although it does refer to subjects that have no connection with each other (like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cher.html" title="Cher">Cher</a>, for example) but they do have a connection with The Beatles. 9. This article definitely informs the reader, and that is why it is still here (hopefully...) 10. Last point (thankfully&#160;:) Would you object to an article detailing the "Seven highest mountains in the world" because they are on different continents? I wish you well. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 20:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no logic to the article; its structure is completely haphazard. If you chopped the first section out and put it at the end, it would make no difference at all to the overall sense of it. You couldn't do that with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, because that's an encyclopaedia article. This one is just an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a> about the Beatles.</li>
<li>However many times I've nominated this for deletion is not relevant to whether your argument about navigation makes sense. It doesn't, honestly. What do you think all the links in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> are for, and all the categories? How is this article supposed to be of any use when only three other actual articles link to it?</li>
<li>What is in this article, if it is important to the story of the Beatles, should go in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>. If it's important to the story of someone or something else, it should go in their article. If it's not important enough to be mentioned in either <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> or another proper encyclopaedia article, then it's not definitely not important enough to be mentioned in an article that's not about anything.</li>
<li>I've got no idea what you're on about with the mountains. Sorry. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 00:01, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> any useful and referenced information into the relevant articles, much like what happens when the content of trivia sections in articles is trimmed and merged into other sections. (See <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles</a>.) Delete the real trivia as, well, trivia. In their current state these articles resemble (as any trivia section in an article would) "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collections of information</a>". Now, I'm not saying none of the information is useful - it's the format in which the information is currently presented that's the problem. The Beatles trivia page is essentially just a list of distantly related facts, some of which hardly have anything to do with the Beatles. For example, the mention that the video for Supergrass's "Alright" was filmed in Portmeirion - what is the relevance of this? I agree with the editor above who it an "unfocused pastiche of an article". There appears to be some serious <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> problems with the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_trivia_3cc7.html" title="Pink Floyd trivia">Pink Floyd trivia</a> article as well. I disagree with the notion implied by some of the above comments that anything Beatles-related is inherently notable. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 21:44, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
