<li><b>conditional keep</b>: In <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">Vaccine controversy</a>, John added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vaccine_controversy&amp;diff=33470675&amp;oldid=33470399" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vaccine_controversy&amp;diff=33470675&amp;oldid=33470399" rel="nofollow">a list</a> of ten vaccination critics, with no balancing information. This is a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">violation of policy</a>, and <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a> has repeatedly asserted that NPOV is non-negotiable. My goals are not suppression, but rather maintaining proportions that conform with policy. I think it would be more useful and maintainable to include a single list to <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination_critics.html" title="Vaccination critics">Vaccination critics</a> instead. So if John intends to use this new page <b>instead</b> of including long lists of individual critics, I think this page is valuable. But if he intends to use it <b>in addition</b>, then I wouldn't support it. So before I commit to a vote, I'd want to know more about John's intentions for the page. Who knows -- maybe we can use this page to help forge a sustainable compromise. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 14:01, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think it's necessary to make deals with John on this. It doesn't make sense to include a long list of vaccine critics within several articles when we have a serviceable list. Put a link to this list on {{<a href="../../../v/a/c/Template%7EVaccines_3937.html" title="Template:Vaccines">vaccines</a>}} and we're done here. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 14:36, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ten, I think that is a productive solution, but because John isn't the only person affected, I'd rather get consensus before changing the template. At <a href="../../../t/h/i/Talk%7EThimerosal_5128.html#Summary_of_See_also_disagreement_for_RfC" title="Talk:Thimerosal">Talk:Thimerosal#Summary_of_See_also_disagreement_for_RfC</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">User:InvictaHOG</a> stated that "I'll take it as is, but would understand if <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> et. al would prefer to replace <a href="../../../p/o/x/Pox_party.html" title="Pox party">pox party</a> with something else more to their liking." Perhaps it would make sense to replace pox party with <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination_critics.html" title="Vaccination critics">Vaccination critics</a>. If nobody objects, then if this page survives VfD, then I'll make that substitution. I think Ombudsman supports the direction we're headed (he left a kind note on my talk page about it) but let's give him some time to respond. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 16:00, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd prefer a page like this that doesn't get shafted by allopaths, and a link from <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">Vaccine controversy</a> (which is an allopath page when I looked at it) and a page with a foot in both camps which doesn't appeal to me much, so I'd prefer a link here and to keep off that page, myself. Are you suggesting I limit my pages to individual vaccine critics? I think a page like this with all the books listed along with the organisations is valuable to offset the bias on all of the vaccine pages, and vaccine disease pages. I may try and add 'the alternative view' to those pages but it will be a battle to get one or two lines in, let alone a header. I could put the alternative view (naturopathy, nutritional med, and homeopathy) for mumps and measles, for example, here and save all those edit wars on those pages. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 19:48, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The critics page would serve well as a hub for the template. As it stands, there is nothing else resembling a centralized nexus where a clear account of vaccine criticism is available. Surely, this article will eventually cover epidemiological vs clinical perspectives, data manipulation, pathologies related to <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_injury.html" title="Vaccine injury">vaccine injury</a> (e.g., <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_enterocolitis.html" title="Autistic enterocolitis">autistic enterocolitis</a>). Maybe, when the Age of Autism has receded into the rear view mirror, hopefully by the dawn of the next century, this page will no longer be so necessary, except as an historical footnote. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 02:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You would say that, you are the main hub for allopath/medical butchering of vaccine/allopathy criticism. The vaccine controversy page is a half way house controlled by vaccinators, so a link to a proper page on vaccination criticism is a good solution, but I don't expect them to give in without a fight, as vaccine criticism has been well suppressed for 150 years or so, which begs the question---what are they afraid of if vaccination is safe and effective????? Surely they would like everything to be out in the open to show vaccination is above reproach? <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 10:24, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you look at all the medical vaccine pages AND the vaccine disease pages they have all been written by vaccinators/allopaths, so if that isn't POV I don't know what is. If you would like to arrange a section on each of those pages for me to offer my balancing comments then I can do without any pages outlining the anti-vaccination viewpoint, but vaccinators like Hog can't take any criticism which is why he deletes all of my work. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 09:45, 9 January 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 09:20, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - encyclopedias have articles, and this is not an article. I honestly think the champions of vaccine criticism would better serve their cause by writing one or more clear, NPOV articles rather than trying to insert these long lists into every vaccine article. There's lots of debate on the talk pages, but it doesn't carry over to the article(s) at all - instead, there are lists upon lists, trying to make up in sheer volume what they lack in content. Give me well-reasoned arguments instead of hysterics.
