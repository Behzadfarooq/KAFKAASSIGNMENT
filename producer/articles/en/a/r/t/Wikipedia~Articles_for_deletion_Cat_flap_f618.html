<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Doggie door exists separately as the Cat flap community is keen on the article remaining under the name 'cat flap'. Cat flap is majoritively well sourced, and doggie door can be easily sourced. These exist in the real world and are rather common, hence appropriate to have in wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:34, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

Is there no generally accepted inclusive term? <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_door.html" title="Pet door">Pet door</a>, perhaps, which currently serves as a disambiguation page linking to the two articles at hand?

<li>It seems not. Pet door appears to be an Americanism. This has been discussed at length on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Talk%7ECat_flap_0fb5.html" title="Talk:Cat flap">Talk:Cat flap</a>.

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> there were five redlinks for <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_flap.html" title="Cat flap">cat flap</a> before I created the article a year ago and there are many more links in today. There were <i>no</i> links for 'Pet door' nor 'Doggie door' when doggie door was created as a one line stub last October and put up for delete/merge in November. However, merging doggie door with cat flap has caused no end of trouble. There have been four page move requests, all rejected, and several page moves against concensus. Cat flap is the correct, original term, despite what American authors and dog owners think (see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Talk%7ECat_flap_0fb5.html" title="Talk:Cat flap">Talk:Cat flap</a> for arguments ad nauseum). Nevertheless we might as well keep the two articles demerged to avoid further bickering.

Splitting out <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_door.html" title="Dog door">dog door</a> from <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_flap.html" title="Cat flap">cat flap</a> looks very much like another manoevre along these lines, rather than a good faith topic split, as the many attempts to rename <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_flap.html" title="Cat flap">cat flap</a> to an Americanism have otherwise failed. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">â€” Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 07:50, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Â§</b>Yikes! I wasn't aware at all of what I was walking into before reading that Talk history. Nevertheless, this POV fork (and that is what it is) has been opposed and defended by tendentious editing on both sides. Fundamentally, it is a dialect debate, with <i>cat flap</i> the admittedly UK-dominant term and <i>doggie door</i> the more familiar for US audiences. Based on the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="WP:MOS">Wikipedia Manual of Style</a>, the burden is to produce a single article under some name. The manual prefers a single, neutral article title where that is possible, such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevedore.html" title="Stevedore">stevedore</a> for the docker/longshoreman issue or <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a> to end the aeroplane/airplane debate. Where it is not possible, the first non-stub entry is to take precedence (and the alternative reduced to a redirect), such as the petrol redirect to <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>.<br />
There is no debate that the cat flap article is the first authored. The question is, or should be, whether that is the appropriate final location. I have lingering concerns from reading the talk page that the repeated consensus regarding the pagemoves has been flawed. Why do I make the bold assumption that the topic has been argued in bad faith? Because the talk pages admit as much. All of the following are from the discussion regarding the original move request, which quickly brought up the suggestion to move to <i>pet door</i> per the manual of style (each from a different author, to avoid overly selecting one person's viewpoint):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Which could well be the nub of the problem. If it is a British English / American English thing, it should stay at the British English naming â€” a) for the priority choice of English, and b) since Cat flaps were more than likely invented in England."</dd>
<dd>"So another page using a British term was lost through American intransigence to seeing "foreign" terms. We ( the non-USians) have to put up with literally thousands of them on the Encyclopaedia."</dd>
<dd>"I also think removing the American systemic bias is a very important task within wikipedia. There may be other issues than the purely English-American differences in this case that should also be considered but I would describe voting on the basis of removing that particular systemic bias from wikipedia as being responsible voting."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Are there actual cultural differences? Yes, apparently due to large differences in pet culture -- Americans are more likely to have fenced yards and allow dogs easy egress, while British cats are far more likely to be "outdoor cats" with their own access independant access. But, just as the example <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevedore.html" title="Stevedore">stevedore</a> article explains the differences in use in the two dialects, a single article under a neutral name could do that here. Way back in that first move debate, User:Waterguy provided at least some evidence that UK companies manufacturing these devices are cognizant of <i>pet door</i> and use it in at least some of their advertising material. The presence or absence of dictionary entries has been the primary sourced justification for preferring <i>cat flap</i> (with the talk on its page grudgingly allowing the parallel construction of <i>dog door</i> after it was resurrected by deletion review), but Wikipedia does not consider dictionaries to be the sole determiners of term validity. After all, <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia's not one of those</a>. Other arguments (on both sides) have been based on frequency of use, but neutral, technically-inclusive terms would seem to take precedent -- both for encyclopediac value and in observation of precedent (such as the fixed-wing aircraft issue).<br />
Clearly, this AfD is specious, bad-faith, and out of process ... but the purpose of AfD is to produce better articles. Surely there is a way to resolve this that won't fan the fires of national language furor? In its current state, I can see no future for this bifurcated article that does not involve a path to RfC or mediation... <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
