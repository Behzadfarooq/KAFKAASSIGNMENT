<p>I couldn't find any significant evidence that this site is important enough to justify our consideration. The redirect at IceKeyHunter is also within the purview of this VfD, but since it's a redirect I'm not going to list it in the VfD itself. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 02:27, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>But all other webcomics have some sort of page. You may delete Kris Montello, but keep Doghouse Comics up. The only reason I see for it to be deleted is that it gives information on something that isn't yet popular. However, it gives much more information than some webcomic-related articles I've seen, popular or not. Forgive me if this is not how these things are debated, I am new. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKeyHunter_579c.html" title="User:IceKeyHunter">IceKeyHunter</a> 02:31, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's nothing to forgive. Your discussion style is fine. If you can explain how your web comic currently satisfies the criteria at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines</a>, you can make a good argument for keeping an article on it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:04, 2005 Jun 20 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not a problem - it's fairly common to think that blanking a page will delete it, but that's not actually what happens. It takes an administrator to actually delete a page (that is, I can't delete it either).

<li>You must also keep in mind, if you deleted Doghouse Comics, we wouldn't be able to recreate the page if DHC ever became 'popular' enough to be on the same level as all the other webcomics that have articles. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKeyHunter_579c.html" title="User:IceKeyHunter">IceKeyHunter</a> 15:52, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Doghouse Comics, but get rid of the rest. They aren't necessary and contain little information. However, like previously stated, many other comics have a page such as this, and the information provided could be useful, if not now, at least in future times. It seems somewhat unfair to say that just because it isn't as well known as other comics, doesn't mean it can't be. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackoutofthebox_908a.html" title="User:Jackoutofthebox">Jackoutofthebox</a> 17:19, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>In the specific case of Kris Montello: Since the user has made other contributions to Wikipedia, <b>Userfy</b> to <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKeyHunter_579c.html" title="User:IceKeyHunter">User:IceKeyHunter</a> (and <b>Delete</b> the redirect at IceKeyHunter).

<li>In fact, given that (from the above discussion) <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKeyHunter_579c.html" title="User:IceKeyHunter">User:IceKeyHunter</a> xyrself doesn't want this page in the main namespace, I've taken the liberty of speedily userfying it. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKeyHunter_579c.html" title="User:IceKeyHunter">User:IceKeyHunter</a>, it's your choice whether to retain your article about yourself as your user page. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloud109_d790.html" title="User:Cloud109">User:Cloud109</a> has, in contrast, made no contributions to Wikipedia. Other Wikipedians may differ, but I don't support userfication in such circumstances. My vote is thus revised:

<li>Allow <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKeyHunter_579c.html" title="User:IceKeyHunter">User:IceKeyHunter</a> to decide about <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKeyHunter_579c.html" title="User:IceKeyHunter">User:IceKeyHunter</a></li>

<ul>
<li>Ah, but, the Doghouse Comics article is much more in-depth and has more information than many other webcomic pages. And you must also take into consdieration that it is actually a collection of many webcomics, and contains cartoons and games, one of which won an award on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If popularity and the overall need of the article, and not the information that is presented itself, is what matters, what happens if DHC becomes very popular? It's entirely possible for it to happen in the very near future.</p>
<p>If you <i>must</i> delete it, allow me to recreate it in the future when and if it meets your criteria. But, for now, I think <b>keeping</b> benefits me, as I won't have to recreate it in the future, and I can explain what DHC is simply by linking them to the article (I've had trouble with this in the past, as it is an unusual webcomic) and it's just easier in general.</p>
<p>You really have me beat with those Guidelines, I had no idea they existed. But I really hope you consider the work that was put in. You can't deny that Doghouse Comics has more information than some other webcomic pages, and that the site itself has potential.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while I don't think there is need to delete it, if you HAVE TO, allow me to create it again in the future when it meets your criteria. Keep in mind, if that's the case, why delete it in the first place? If the whole thing fails, I'll ask you to delete it now. For now, <b>keep it</b>.</p>
