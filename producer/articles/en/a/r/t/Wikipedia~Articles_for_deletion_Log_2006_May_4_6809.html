<li><b>Delete</b> Maybe merging it would be a good idea. In my opinion, articles about TV skits this short shouldn't be written unless the skit has had a lasting impact on television. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveo2_3b92.html" title="User:Steveo2">Jared W</a> 11:01, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories are the skits for which Chappelle's Show is mostly known for. Seeing as the show is extremely successful and is also an extremely high selling DVD, and also the fact that you will see people uttering the phrase "I'm Rick James bitch!" in many different contexts, its value as cultural phenomena is well ingrained, I say keep it, but maybe add more to it. For example there should be some more information about the skit when Charlie Murphy plays basketball with Prince. Besides, the great thing about Wikipedia is that it can function as more than just a basic general encyclopedia, but also a pop cultural encyclopedia. IrishGuy's articles on magicians have no more credit than this one for example, this article has far more relevance to a larger amount of people. Haggis101 9:17, 4 May 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm trying not to be bias since I wrote the article, so I mostly agree. This may just be my relative unfamiliarity with WP politics and procedure, but why not propose to merge this article with <i><a href="../../../m/a/l/Mallrats.html" title="Mallrats">Mallrats</a></i>, rather than delete it? I also believe there is a relatively strong precedent for fictional characters having their own articles on WP, especially if there are some interesting things to be said about them that depart from simply rehashing events in the movie. And yes, I will go dig up sources for talking about Brodie as a sage and anti-hero. Again, why not flag the article as not citing sources, instead of deleting it? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 02:53, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's not the quality of the article -- even with sources, I would have been inclined to nominate. I'm just not persuaded that the character has a strong enough presence outside the film to warrant his own article. Are we expecting people will do searches for this character without first going to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mallrats.html" title="Mallrats">Mallrats</a>? If not, then it's a little too close to fancruft for my tastes. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterwindupbird_8b5e.html" title="User:Misterwindupbird">Mr Wind-Up Bird</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMisterwindupbird_d298.html" title="User talk:Misterwindupbird">✈</a> 03:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, given that he's in two movies, not one, and that the actor has recieved more prominence as of late for his role on that TV show, I think it's a reasonable expectation. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 03:53, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, the article seems to assert that he does, so it might have made sense to request verification first. And in any event, don't you think a merge &amp; redirect would be better than just outright deletion? --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 04:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough, I withdraw the nomination. I'm still not convinced this character should have its own page. However, I'm fairly new to the whole delete/merger thing and in my inexperience, I acted hastily, and failed to follow the correct procedure. Clearly, this isn't the proper forum. Aguerriero, if you still strongly feel that the character deserves its own page, I'll let you work on backing that up and properly propose a merger should I still disagree. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterwindupbird_8b5e.html" title="User:Misterwindupbird">Mr Wind-Up Bird</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMisterwindupbird_d298.html" title="User talk:Misterwindupbird">✈</a> 05:40, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> We simply do not need articles on every single movie character for which some claim of notability can be made. I think a compelling argument needs to be made why this should be separated from the movie's main article page, which is not the case here. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 17:57, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I've been thinking about this question of whether fictional characters need their own articles, and I offer this thought - in most of the "universe" phenomena in the entertainment world, characters have their own articles on WP. A "universe" is defined as an entire body of work in which the films (or shows), comics, books, and characters are packaged and embraced as whole. For example, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> universe, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a>, and of course, the <a href="../../../v/i/e/View_Askewniverse_0618.html" title="View Askewniverse">View Askewniverse</a>, from which Brodie and <i>Mallrats</i> are derived. In all of the examples cited above, individual major (sometimes even minor) characters have their own articles, simple becase a large and enduring fanbase is interested in reading them. Does there need to be another reason than that people want to read it? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 18:51, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Despite being a Kevin Smith fan (at least, a fan of his first four films), I was on the fence on this one- I love the movies, but I wasn't sure if Brodie merited an article. But Aguerriero just convinced me. If minor <i>Star Wars</i> characters have their own articles, then major View Askew characters certainly should. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 20:49, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prodded (by me) as "Non-notable coffee shop." Prod tag removed with the edit summary comment of "It has been proposed that this article be deleted because, according to some, Gimme Coffee is a "non-notable coffeeshop". Merriam Webster defines notable as "worthy of note" and in NY, Gimme is." The initial reason I prodded this page is that there is no real notability stated in the article. However, looking at the press page on their Web site, they do list a few publications in which they are mentioned <a href="http://www.gimmecoffee.com/press.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gimmecoffee.com/press.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I'm not 100% certain this meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> though. In any case, I thought it's worth an AfD discussion.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm a native New Yorker who hangs out with coffee-holics, and I've never heard of it. I'd have to go through the list of sources to figure it out- the NYT mention doesn't count, as it's just a very passing reference, but I'm not sure about the others.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 04:34, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>After a second look on their press page they do have a reasonable amount of media coverage. Unfortunately, "non-trivial" is quite subjective, so it's hard to know where to draw the line. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin1243_1326.html" title="User:Kevin1243">Kevin</a> 12:49, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, this is where my uncertainty lies. There are certainly several substantial articles in the local media, however, my local newspaper eventually will do a few articles on every restaurant/cafe in town--most of them not-notable. The most notable articles in the global media section are mostly brief mentions. Do these constitute non-trivial works? I would have a lot less trouble keeping this article if it had any sort of encyclopedic content or substantial edits. As it stands at the moment, I'm not sure this article could be made encyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 13:17, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a student of said Paul Vollans, I can confirm that he is not a hoax, and nor is this article. The "University" is a mistake, he actually teaches currently at Brighouse Sixth Form, where I see the liklihood of him retiring, atleast from the teaching profession. His past credits include being a top ranking police officer, involved in cases such as the Moors murders (but I wouldn't put it past half of you to believe that that itself is a "hoax" or "conspiracy", wanting to put the "man" down). Either way, Mr. V is a real person. This article is legit (except for the mistake of University instead of Sixth Form College.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The above link is located on the school intranet and will not work from the outside. However I've supplied a screenshot that shows Mr. Vollans notes on part of the law used to teach first year sixth formers. The picture is not faked or doctored in any way (because I'm not that bothered about the whole thing to take the time), and I would include the whole article at request, <i>however</i> I'm not going to due to the fact the notes should stay within respected students possession. <a href="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a46/iamstewart/LOLOLOLOLOL.jpg" class="external free" title="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a46/iamstewart/LOLOLOLOLOL.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a46/iamstewart/LOLOLOLOLOL.jpg</a></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The context of this debate started out with suspicion of a hoax based on fictitions university names and unverified assertions of fame which would lead one to think that the professor, if as noted as stated in the article, would at least have one mention on the billions of pages indexed by google. I now think this person may very well be a real person. However, this does little to address the underlying verifiability and notability issues. Even if he is a real professor, is he really "considered to be one of Britain's finest law theorists" who often consults with the House of Lords? Who and how many consider him to be so and how does this translate to wider fame? Does he have any publications? Newpaper/magazine write ups. Yes we started with the question of whether this was a hoax, but the same problems that led to that conclusion, still lead me, at least, to believe this person is not notable enough for <i>inclusion in an encyclopedia</i>. Please address the underlying <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> of the claims and substantiation of his <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">fame</a>. The hoax issue is not the relevant inquiry to meet wikipedia's <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">inclusion criteria</a>.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 12:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>May I remind you that Google does not provide the answer to everything. However, I do appreciate your concern in relation to the professor's academic success.

<dl>
<dd>You are missing the point. I am not implying google "answer's everything." It was a tool used to attempt to substantiate an article with no sources. Now that you have added some substantiation that he is a real person, you or anyone else who wants the article to remain must substantiate the assertions contained therein. The burden is not on us to find those for you. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 15:30, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I personally found it informative, there's no reason this information shouldn't be here. Yes, it is tied to a fictional universe, however this fictional universe is arguably the largest one ever created, which necessitates the division of information into different articles.

<li><b>Listify?</b> This article contains mostly a bunch of separate lists of companies, people, groups, etc., basically, all things in the marvel universe that are mundane. I think most of the content here should be in one or more lists... but what lists? List of notable non-mutants in Marvel Universe could be one, et cetera. The first couple of paragraphs are interesting, but could easily be merged into <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a>. In theory, I could see an article about how everyday life is portrayed in the Marvel Universe, and I could see it being interesting, but this is just a big list of ordinary things and not informative. If I must pick a vote, I would say "keep and tag for attention", because there's too much splitting to be done by someone closing an AfD; I think editors will have to actually get involved here. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:22, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - As the article's creator and contributor of 99 percent of the content, I find myself in agreement with the nominator. I have contributed more and more to Wikipedia, and I have come to think this list really does not belong on this site. It's fan service stuff; something I have enjoyed compiling, but even some of the lists that it is being suggested as being split into seem inconsequential and non-noteworthy. I'd rather it bedeleted from the site; I have kept a copy for myself so perhaps I can continue this for my own private use or share it with others elsewhere. Either way, it doesn't follow the rules of Wikipedia, because it's a different kind of project. Just think of it as a pet project that got put in the wrong place. Please delete.

<li>Anyone searching for an opera built on violent conflict more recent than the Trojan Wars need look no farther than Tufts University, where plans are in progress for a spring production of <i>Nancy and Tonya: The Opera,</i> based on the rivalry between the ice skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding that led to an attack on Ms. Kerrigan before the 1994 Winter Olympics. PlaybillArts.com reported that the opera, with a libretto by the novelist Elizabeth Searle and music by Abigail Al-Doory, a Tufts graduate student, features an aria based on Ms. Kerrigan's lament: <i>Why?

<dd><b>Comment</b> I fully trust Lexis-Nexis, and as I noted above, the article appeared in Sports Illustrated online and other AP articles. However, is this opera noteable yet? Right now, it's just human interest news, considering it only premiered a few days ago as a college production and is receiving attention primarily for the novelty of a Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan singing. Having reviewed <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enot_aa34.html" title="WP:not">WP:not</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, I don't think the article is noteable or any different than any other student production by graduate students at other colleges -- the only difference is that the subject matter made a nice human interest story for a day. Now, if the play expands to a major venue, wins an award, or makes tons of money, then I'd argue for keeping the article. But right now, it's not yet noteable and is simply a college production which had a good press release going for it. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 20:06, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I can see your point and where you're coming from. My stance is that it is notable <i>because</i> it is a college production that has garnered national (international disputed) attention. It is extremely rare for that sort of attention to happen, and is the main reason I'd say keep. I definitely appreciate the additional reasoning you've offered, though. --24.50.144.90 20:25, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> Trust me, I was torn with this, which is why I voted "Weak Keep" originally before changing my vote to "Delete". To use a recent example, there was a cat named Molly that was trapped in a NY wall recently which received a great deal of attention for a week across the globe. It made a nice human interest piece, but then the story disappeared a month ago when the cat was rescued. An article was attempted for Molly the cat, but was deleted as non noteable. My belief is that it's too early to evaluate T&amp;N, as its importance might disappear by next week never to be heard of again. Now, should it follow the path of operas like the Jerry Springer one and become even a small scale success -- i.e., we're still hearing of this opera a year from now -- then I'd fully support keeping this in Wiki. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 20:42, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This program is carried by about 118 radio stations, so at this point I think it's fair to say that this production, regardless of who is producing it, has garnered significant national attention.</p>

<li><b>Um, okay, shalom, people do NOT delete!</b> What does per nom mean anyway? The Socratic Club is absolutely of public - nay, infinite public - interest. And in any case, you and I and everyone all know that the NN rule is not official. The Socratic Club hosts magnificent, well-known scholars from around the world, such as Stephen Darwall, Fritz Warfield, Craig Fansler, Yaron Eliav and others. More than that, it fosters public discussion about issues of public interest. I'm told that a homeless man even showed up once, taking part in the humanitarian branch of the Socratic Club, namely, free food. And let's keep in mind that an elite University links to the society's <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/undergrads/activities/socratic_club/" class="external text" title="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/undergrads/activities/socratic_club/" rel="nofollow">site</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshblan_a451.html" title="User:Joshblan">joshblan</a></li>

<dd>I'm a little confused here. I'm trying to <i>properly</i> contest the proposal that this article be deleted, but I'm new at this and not sure I've got the procedure right. Here's what I said on the discussion page of the Ralf Hotchkiss article itself --</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This page is absolutely NOT an advertisement. Therefore, I am removing the request for deletion (as I understand the policies and procedures say I can/should). I added this page because I believe what Hotchkiss and his company are doing is important, is part of a contemporary movement to promote sustainable development, and is admirable and should be known about. You'll also notice that Whirlwind has its own entry in Wikipedia. I'm new to Wikipedia, too, and am kind of shocked to have my first entry attacked so quickly. By the way, I have no connection to Hotchkiss or Whirlwind except as a college classmate who admires him and his work. Mildredofbeulah 05:18, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I am the author of the most recent version of this article. The first article was deleted because it was not sufficiently verifiable and because of suspected sockpuppetry during the original AfD debate. I have added a number of reliable sources to confirm that this is not simply a "neologism" and hope that this debate will avoid another descent into sockpuppetry, which I think really distracted people from the merit of the article the first time around. Even the person who nominated the last T14 article agrees that this version merits inclusion.

<li><b>Response</b>: I've just tried to fix the links; they should be working now. No, I don't know when the term was created, but the US News rankings date back to (I believe) 1987. The point isn't that the rankings don't change, but that the top 14 have been the same schools in every edition of the rankings. The reality is that the rankings do change quite a bit, which is why the fact that the same 14 schools have remained on top each time has struck so many people as noteworthy. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 18:22, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, really no substantial change from old version. The sources don't convince me that this is not a neologism -- every neologism is used <i>somewhere</i> -- that doesn't mean they are notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think you can really call this "slang" so much as a colloquialism. A related term that has been deemed notable enough for inclusion is <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Little Ivies</a>, which is actually much less well-documented, widely used or clear as to what schools it includes. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 18:22, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I really dont see much point in getting into a debate over the meaning of the word "slang" .... Wikipedia is also not a colloquialism dictionary. Moreover, the fact that one potentially non notable topic has not been deleted is not a justification for keeping articles on other non notable topics -- that kind of reasoning could quickly become a slippery slope to a wikipedia littered with non-notable content. <a href="../../../x/o/x/User%7EXoxohthblaster_a00a.html" title="User:Xoxohthblaster">Xoxohthblaster</a> 19:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: Well, putting aside the semantic debate over what kind of word you want to call it, there's no question that that numerous similar terms have been found notable. It is absolutely proper to use past AfD debates and uncontroversially included articles as precedent in determining whether or not to keep an article. The fact that <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Little Ivies</a>, which again, has a much weaker case, has been kept weighs strongly in favor of keeping this. It's much more dangerous for the deletions to be made arbitrarily and inconsistently than to use precedent to determine community views. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 22:43, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It has been pointed out before that in the entire existence of US News &amp; World Report, there has never been another school to crack the top 14 then these ones. That at least gives credibility to it as at least a creation of snobbery and arrogance. Although I disagree with the principle of placing 14 schools into a certain group on the grounds of prestige, they no doubt have been, and a section titled <b>Controversy</b> should likewise be included in this article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 168.159.213.36 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.159.213.36.html" title="User talk:168.159.213.36">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.159.213.36_47ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.159.213.36">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: People seem keen on the argument that those voting delete are simply unfamiliar with this term. I, for one, am quite familiar with it. But my familiarity with it does not equal notability...and I agree with the argument that this is a non-notable neologism. Also, note that the last two keep votes should be heavily discounted, as one was from an unregistered user and the second was unsigned and from an unregistered user. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 02:11, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b>: I think it's far to widely-noted to be considered a neologism. Even purely on its incredibly widespread use on discussion boards, it would probably qualify as an internet meme. But of course it doesn't have to rely on this argument. And I don't think it's consistent with the idea of "not biting the newcomers" to categorically disregard reasoned opinions that come from unregistered users (it's not a vote, anyway). For one thing, I wouldn't be entirely opposed to the idea of a merge &amp; redirect to <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_School_Rankings_f16b.html" title="Law School Rankings">Law School Rankings</a> as an alternative to keeping the current article. Of course, I think keeping it would be better, because I think the sources make it clear that the term is widely-used and understood by nearly everyone involved with law school admissions, even the people who don't think it should be as important as it is. -<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 03:10, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

No, it seems pretty self explanitory that all tennured Harvard, etc. faculty are notable. PROFTEST even says so. Julliard seem to also have this property for permenent faculty.

Although <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Pumas_31c6.html" title="Los Pumas">Los Pumas</a>, the Argentina national rugby union team, is the strongest team in America (having won all but one of the american rugby tournaments since their creation, if I recall correctly), local clubs that play in the argentinian "premiere" are amateur, thus they may not be considered as notable for some. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:43, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - User has contributed to Wikipedia previously without an account and only recently decided to actually create an account. Number of user edits should additionally not have bearing on this specific article.<br />
The Myspace link was not meant as the sole evidence of notability, but rather an example. New Reno is a member of the RPG Ring (<a href="http://rpgbanner.eniasni.com/" class="external free" title="http://rpgbanner.eniasni.com/" rel="nofollow">http://rpgbanner.eniasni.com/</a>), which is a group of other RPG's in a banner and player exchange. Several online communities have contacted the game within the past several days stating that we should advertise in their forums as well, as there would certainly be interest. The Myspace link was placed to show that in an online community outside of New Reno, there would be extensive interest within mere days of the initial advertisement. Advertisement and interest is not solely limited to MySpace.user:CelticDragonlord</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Now, if it is still insisted that the article be deleted for now until we can demonstrate to you that we are a notable game and community and that the game does deserve an article, is it possible to put a hold on the article (keep it hidden/restricted) until the time that we can edit it to meet the notability criteria?<br />
And, apart from a growing player base of about 150 and interested others of around the same number, consisting of stable players stemming from a game that started 9 years ago, including international interest and representation in at least four outside gaming and Fallout communities, what might the community here suggest as additional measures to demonstrate our notability? -- CelticDragonlord 10:32, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Anyway, It's funny how people love to stuff things are irrelavent and "fancruft". "It's only of interests to trhe fans!~ neee!" Yeah...that's the thing. Last time I checked, Wikipedia isn't about that sort of distrimination. It actually tries to avoid such things. If we only list iconic and "attractive" fiction, stuff the <i>average joe</i> or <i>jane</i> wants to know about, I think we'd be left with..."<i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a></i>, <b><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiderman.html" title="Spiderman">Spiderman</a></b> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>".

<li><b>Edit, but Keep</b> One thing that I've noticed about Wiki is that there are certain groups that seem to create articles about every little thing in their universe from the most important characters with the longest history to the most minor of minor characters. Even though there are websites that go even further, some people want to make the Wiki the be-all and end-all of the information. And while there are many who would say otherwise, I do believe that it is important to have a list of the Mamono in ZB. Each of these characters, some of whom have merely a couple chapters devoted to them, is important to the series one way or another. While I'm not the one that can figure out how to edit this list down (since a lot can be edited instantly based on the author), maybe the key would be to at least have a list of Mamono, a little on each (whether or not it includes the spells), and then direct them to a better source such as the link at the bottom. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by StrangerAtaru (<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerAtaru_0956.html" title="User talk:StrangerAtaru">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_StrangerAtaru_19c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/StrangerAtaru">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> the article is still young &amp; should be allowed to mature into an article which is beyond dispute like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jean-Michel_Jarre_concerts_2dea.html" title="List of Jean-Michel Jarre concerts">List of Jean-Michel Jarre concerts</a>. The nomination on the talk page claims that this list is <i>unlimited/unmaintainable</i>, this is patently incorrect. At some point the Chemical Brothers will either split or die &amp; the list will finish meanwhile new performances can easily be added quicker than they are likely to be performed. As for whether one would expect to find this info in an encyclopedia, perhaps you would not expect to find it in other <i>smaller</i> encyclopedias but I'm surprised how few similar lists are in existance. Much of the information is widely considered to be encyclopeidic when arranged in other forms e.g. <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_and_Leeds_Festivals_e016.html#List_of_Headliners" title="Reading and Leeds Festivals">Reading and Leeds Festivals#List of Headliners</a> The parent article <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chemical_Brothers_5f38.html" title="The Chemical Brothers">The Chemical Brothers</a> is already longer than 30kb so merging would impractical. <a href="../../../m/g/s/User%7EMGSpiller_fd07.html" title="User:MGSpiller">MGSpiller</a> 18:31, 5 May 2006 (UTC) (The Residents, who they?&#160;;-)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per MGSpiller. The article needs more people working on it, but I am willing to give them an opportunity.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - the comparison to Jean-Michel Jarre is misleading but then, so is this article in its current form. Jarre is known for irregular, spectacular live shows in unusual locations. The Chemicals Brothers are not. The current version of the article includes only festival appearances and their 2005 UK trek, giving the suggestion that The Chemical Brothers may fall into a similar catagory to Jarre. They don't. They are just another touring band who play the usual venues in the usual cities whenever they release an album. An improved, comprehensive version of this article would only go to prove its <b>lack</b> of notability.

<li>It would appear from my reading of the table that his two races came in different seasons. Row 1 is season 1963, where he raced for Brabham in the last race of the season, South Africa.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I think the need to not start removing once notable people when they die overrides the need to consider people in entirely different ways depending on the regularity of their breathing, so I'm calling this a flaw in the guidelines and sticking with the view that all top-level sportspeople are notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm of course not implying that the second he dies, he is transferred from notable to non-notable. However, he has been dead for 25 years (<i>well</i> before the creation of Wikipedia, and not too long after the creation of <i>me</i>), and the most recent of his <i>two</i> minor contributions to F1 racing was in 1965. I think the idea behind having stricter rules for deceased persons may have been that if they hadn't made a significant contribution in their field during their lifetime, the opportunity has passed (whereas someone still alive could still make a greater contribution). Of course, that's all speculation, as I have absolutely no idea what the intent was behind the guidelines. Whatever, it looks like the consensus will be a keep anyway.

So, I have fewer than 300 listings on Google. How many mentions are required to be considered "notable" by your standards? John H. Johnson published the leading black magazines in the United States for more than 50 years and he merits no mention in The World Book encyclopedia. You all need to stop taking your perpetual creative license with our heritage. That I don't have a search engine hit for each and every article I've written over the past 25 years is not news.

<p>Tagged a couple of times for speedy but notability is asserted and speedy deletion has been contested previously. Rodger Parsons is a voice actor with two credits on IMDB, it says he does some voices in a Pokemon special but that's not supported by the linked source and even if it was the number of entries on the IMDB article indicates that this is not in any way a notable voice actor. There are notable voice actors, but this really does not sound like one of them. Since the sole performance named is one Pokemon anime, I'd say it's probably Pokemoncruft. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:18, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aaron Donahue is apparently a "remote viewer" who posts his predictions to his website (alexa rank ~300,000). Guess which is the top website linking in to his site? You got it: Wikipedia. There are 982 Google hits for Aaron Donahue, and even combining all plausible mis-spellings still gets very few hits (around a third the number of hits I get). Occasional radio appearance is also no big deal since I've been interviewed on national radio as well. It is uncritical in the extreme, though has been worse in the past (see Talk:Aaron Donahue).</p>
<p>Previous AfD: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aaron_Donahue_2646.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aaron Donahue">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aaron Donahue</a>, kept on the basis of three "votes", but that did include MgM and Andrew Lenahan. Nonetheless, and notwithstanding my usual practice of agreeing with MgM in particular, I still say this is a hagiography of a person of no apparent notability - a reasonably skilled self-promoter at best. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:36, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>I do not understand why the article about Aaron Donahue is a problem and a insult to your policies.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>He has been on TV several times, including on TV Asahi´s S.O.S, and the in search of... Paranormal investigation programme.</li>
<li>He has been in the movie Suspect Zero</li>
<li>He has been on Coast to Coast several times, where he talked about his idea´s and those of others.</li>
<li>He has been on many other radio shows including The Bull in Canada and a esoteric radios how in South-Africa</li>
<li>He has hit the news with his auction of the pope´s soul, which got him banned from E-bay.</li>
<li>He is the ´´leader `` of a small ideology, which has several web sites, a message board and the ability to host a independant, good quality radio show.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find it rather insulting that some local TV minister, or university professor would be able to to get on this web site without any serious problem. But someone who is out of the mainstream is being haunted by Christian or otherwise anti-esoteric individuals. This has nothing to do with the article being used by the luciferian order to spread there word, if you are unsatisfied about the article you could post a message too improve it.</p>
<p>This article was for the most part written by me, and a individual of Christian denomination. This is NOT fandom written by just luciferians, but it is a way to spread our world view as much as the article on Christianity or Islam is.</p>
<p>RGTraynor: using wikipedia as advertisement has nothing to do with the validation of the article Deizio: same for this gentlemen here, not to mention you don't have to have been on opera to qualify as a remote viewer or a person of special important. JerryOrr: writes and i quote him ´´Don't let this get through`` sadly this sounds more like someone who lets his emotional side rule rather then his logic. The above mentioned facts are more then enough to grant Aaron a article. RPIRED: Sock puppets? How childish and that for someone who calls himself a Bachelor of Science.</p>
<p>Nor does it mean the other luciferians who want to keep the article make very good points, either. It does mean that most of those people are unlike me. Not intellectuals. We are people who sense the world via experiences and emotion.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Keep. We have Wikipedia articles on the various social themes in the Buffy The Vampire Slayer, along with specific LGBT Wikipedia articles for the Simpsons, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not quite sure what to make of this one. It seems to be a comprehensive list of every single time anything even remotely related to homosexuality appears on the series. There's significant original research dispersed throughout the article, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"In the first part of the two-part episode, Welcome to the Hellmouth, there is a scene when Buffy first visits the Bronze, and is excited to see a handsome young man waving to her in the crowd, only to find out that he is in fact meeting another young man." doesnt explain how this means that either of the men are gay.</li>
<li>"Xander remarks that one of his worst fears involves Nazis, and Nazi symbols are seen in the background of his nightmare with a clown. Some fans speculated that this was a sign of Xander's possible homosexuality as being gay would explain his fear of Nazis." doesn't really make any sense at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd vote to listify but for two reasons. Firstly, there doesnt actually appear to be <i>enough</i> characters in the series to justify such a list, and secondly it'd set a rather disturbing precedent. The same logic behind the creation of this article would naturally lead to List of ethnic minorities in the BTVS Universe, List of teachers in the BTVS Universe, List of times a coffee cup appears in the BTVS Universe, etc. Overall I'd vote to <b>delete</b> on grounds of original research and non-notability of the topic. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeJo_c589.html" title="User:GeeJo"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #809EF5; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #99B3FF">GeeJo</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/e/e/User_talk%7EGeeJo_5052.html" title="User talk:GeeJo">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeeJo_9c2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeeJo">(c)</a></sub> <small>•&#160;15:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

The contents of the article are not POV. The article sites Biblical scripture which is noted all over Wikipedia. The article also describes the history of this particular piece of art associated with the topic. Your petition to delete seems more POV than the article now revised (which was originally taken from a website so PARDON the Preacher). I read that you are accustomed to editting and petitioning for deletion in Wikipedia for a personal response; in order to have things "answered" to you. This is not neutral as Wikipedia Policy sets forth. Now articles need be neutral TO THEIR TOPIC but not neutral to the societal debates that some folks create over the topics. At this point there is no violation of Wikipedia Policy in the article as written by the original author, however if you care to cite specifically what elements you feel are POV they will be considered as Wikipedia gices the author th option of editing to get article under Policy before deletion occurs. If you cannot cite specifics than you are pursuing deletion without cause.</p>

<p>Tony: You state your arguements but they are based on your interpretation of the facts posted in this article. So again your submissions are POV, not the article. You debate seeking to learn more as your PROFILE states so you inquire about things that aren't elements of the article so as to get a response for them.</p>
<p>You state that "Firstly, content included in wikipedia must be factual, verifiable and notable. A poem you have written is not factual. If the organisation "Custodians of Time" is notable, you have to show how and why (or preferably, if you are involved in that organisation, let someone else do it).</p>
<p>Secondly, there is already a factual article on the historical "coat of arms of God" at Shield of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Thirdly, everything posted on Wikipedia must be released under an open licence; this means anyone can use it, for any non-commercial purpose. If you are claiming copyright to your poem and drawing, then you can't submit them to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Wikipedia is not the place for original research (WP:OR). Even if you think you can make an argument from scripture, don't. On the other hand, if someone else has made an argument from scripture, and that argument has been published in a notable publication, then you can report that they have made that argument."</p>
<p>I respond: Firstly, the article's contents do provide this, yet you seek more but there isn't more... it is all right there factual, verifiable and notable. Secondly, the Shield of the Trinity has a different purpose for Christians. The Coat of Arms in the article you disrupt and vandalize this page for is cited from the Bible. Thirdly, there is no violation copyright. There are no commercial rights released and that is allowed. Fourthly, If you suggest I make an arguement than you are trying to engage in a debate and that is not the proper use of this page. In addition, the scripture containing the Full Armor of God has been published in a notable publication; the Bible. The writer of it has established that "arguement" as you call it. Since I did not WRITE the Bible then this is not personal research as you propose it is. I am reporting no other argument except from you. The article is not an arguement nor is it a debate forum it is a factual, verifiable, and notable element from History. It's too bad it bothers you but there is nothing I can do to make these facts untrue. They have all already happened and are just reported to Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.33.215.131 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.33.215.131_a7f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.33.215.131">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>It's better, but you're still making claims (<i>This depiction of the "Full Armor of God", has become accepted by a large group as the Official Christian Coat of Arms or Coat of Arms of God's Family.</i>) that you're not supporting. <i>IF</i> you can provide evidence that there <i>are</i> a large number of people who recognise this coat of arms as a Christian symbol, then you might have the beginnings of a vaild article.

<p>As I click on each user who wants this article deleted I see some reference to anti-Christian perspective. Now, I don't care what your POV is. But it seems there is some "ganging up here" in relation to that tangent which is not appropriate for the Wikipedia Community. Granted this article may have started with some "preachiness", HOWEVER, it has since been edited down and cleaned up and is in line with Wikipedia Policies. AS IT IS NOW, it is a good addition to this legitimate encyclopedia, but somehow I think arguing that point to most of the opposition here will be falling on deaf ears. Might I remind you that this page is a discussion for the article AS IT IS CURRENTLY and as to whether it ought to be deleted for violation of Wikipedia Policy or Standards, this is not a forum to debate Christian/Anti-Christian POVs. Please take note of this and Please assume good faith when dealing with other editors. See <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> for the guidelines on this..

<dd><i>Please</i> don't start on the "poor little persecuted Christians" line. Yes, I'll agree that the article is now less preachy. However, all it is now is a description of a passage from Ephesians; it doesn't describe a coat of arms, much less demonstrate why that coat of arms is notable. <strike>It <i>still</i> fails the notability and verifiability tests, and is still obviously just an advertisement for your website.

<p>From the "poor little..." statement, you seem to assume that the <i>author</i> is Christian?!... and THAT would be a personal comment toward them... not allowed. The fact is that the article references Christian belief or culture and it seems that those who oppose anything Christian might also oppose this article for personal reasons, so that isn't the Wikipedia Community's purpose or problem for that matter. Thank you "ALBA" I like it!! 68.33.215.131 19:01, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

John Scudamore and vaccination gets ~275 ghits (about 10% of what I get), posting prolifically to Usenet does not constitute notability and that is pretty much the sole claim to notability. John apparently doesn't want this article on Wikipedia, but that is not a reason for keeping it.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> We probably should. The first time that article was listed for AfD, several other lists of famous people based on ethnicity were listed as precedents to keep. Since then, many of those lists have been deleted. I'm not going to relist it, but it's probably something worthy of note here. Also, it's a bit silly to say something is notable because it's named in an article. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 04:00, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The best rationale to delete this would be its possible redundancy with the "Manga and anime characters" category. However, lists can be annotated while categories can't, and we have plenty of list/category pairs anyway. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 21:37, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak keep</b> I don't think verifiability is an issue, nor size as Wikipedia isn't paper.<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> 22:52, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There's precedent to delete lists based on size. A list of music with song titles not in the lyrics was deleted a week or so ago based on inordinate size. This list has the potential to be as big. This should be nipped in the bud; there's no reason for a list like this to be here. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 04:03, 5 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Because of size? Just because one list was deleted doesn't mean this one should be either. I say that its not too big and that its verifiable. I think there are better reasons to delete this article, such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate information</a>. Hence the weak in the weak keep. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> 14:15, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While a list <i>could</i> be annotated, one as big as this definitely shouldn't - if the character's important enough for information it belongs either in an article on the character, or the series, or a "Minor characters from <i>series</i>" article. Hence in this case it's redundant with the existence of the categories for Manga and anime characters and Manga and anime series. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 01:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's a huge number of such characters and a list serves no function except perhaps to stimulate obsessives to write yet more superfluous articles. WP is not toilet paper.

<li>The author has contacted me and claims notability. He's a novice and would like time and help getting it together. Given that he's a novice, the article is only two days old, and he didn't understand about the "prod" tag, I think we should give him a chance. Remember, you can't swing a dead cat in that part of the country without hitting something historic or a Kennedy.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I like the idea of making it into a category, but most of the people on the list do not have their own pages. So keep it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's nothing unencyclopedic about a list, per se, nor about fictional characters, nor in fact about a list of fictional characters that meet some criterion.

<dd>I don't quite follow your argument. I agree that people may create articles on individual pranks, but if they're cited/notable that's good and they can stay, and if not of course they can be deleted!

<li><b>Keep and revise</b> - A problem with this article is that it has grown way <i>too long</i>, as users continually add new items that they think should be added onto the list, creating an extremely long page and it is quite tedious to read. I recommend deleting all but a few common ones, or organize the article in a better format. Of course these pranks are wrong, but the article does serve a purpose in describing some of these very common occurences. I don't agree with the opinion that it is not an encyclopaedic article in terms of the content, but I do agree with the opinion that it is not encyclopaedic with regards to the formatting. –- <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><b><font color="#0000FF">kungming·2</font></b></a> | <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk</sup></font></a>·<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Kungming2_0eb5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>Contact)</sup></font></a> 02:21, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and move to "school prank"</b>: perhaps regrettably! But the school prank is a verifiable cultural phenomenon, and there are a number of particularly well-established types. I don't see why an encyclopedic article on school pranks is impossible (although I can see that on an "open" encyclopedia, it may well be difficult to maintain, with the risk of rapid degeneration). And this isn't just a "popular culture" thing either - there are possibilities of referencing from both biographical and other factual literature, and also fictional literature. What can't be referenced can and should be stripped out. The fact that some are referencable is a sign that the list itself should be kept - <i>many votes seem to be misunderstanding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></i>. If we had an individual article on an individual or phenomenon that was impossible to verify, it needs to be got rid of. Now, many individual claims in this list <i>are</i> impossible to verify. But the fact that "school pranks" exist is not, and many of the core claims in this article are verified and should be kept, along with the list itself. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 00:12, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seems like advertising of a nonnotable business (to me and at least 1 other editor who also gave it a prod}. Page creator disagrees - let's discuss. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 20:52, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is absolutely no basis for the assertion that this is advertising. Did you read new addition of content on efficient frontier? Further, no contact information of any kind. No website info, no email, no phone, no fax, no address. Nothing. Did you read where the founders of the firm hold doctorates, master, cpa? This is a serious noteworthy business in its region of the country. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jurisdoctor (<a href="../../../j/u/r/User_talk%7EJurisdoctor_e910.html" title="User talk:Jurisdoctor">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jurisdoctor_973a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jurisdoctor">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This article was listed for speedy deletion as nonsense. I don't think it qualifies but I believe the subject is not notable enought for inclusion.

<li><b>Keep (rewrite)</b> - I tagged it as nonsense because it is (was) an obvious dupe of Fair City Mainstay and Ruadhri Conroy, all created/contributed to by the same editor, <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERoryRules2_1850.html" title="User:RoryRules2">RoryRules2</a>. Moreover, it was a recreation of Rory Conroy. The previous AfD is here. (Result was DELETE.) <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rory_Conroy_adba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rory Conroy">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rory Conroy</a>. I have also tagged the page for copyvio for lifting some of the bio verbatim from IMDb. This probably won't be another WP:HEY effort, but I've emailed both IMDb and Ruaidrhi's management company requesting clarification. -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocoder_9b81.html" title="User:Robocoder">Robocoder</a> 00:54, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I've done a lot of web searching, and can find references for Rory Conroy (Fair city) and for Ruaidhri Conroy (<a href="../../../i/n/t/Into_the_West_%28film%29_93db.html" title="Into the West (film)">Into the West</a>/Six Shooter/Oscar flight problem) but cannot find <b>any</b> reference that shows that the two people are the same person, the only connection is the similar name and same year of birth on IMDB (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175860/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175860/" rel="nofollow">IMBD for Ruaudhri</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2004511/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2004511/" rel="nofollow">IMBD for Rory</a>) If kept, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> will need to be rigorously enforced to not only ensure that the facts are correct, but that they are verifably about the correct person. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 15:13, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> In the idea of {{sofixit}} I have created (without predjudice) a temporary sub page (linked from the copyvio template on the main page). which I hope is a stub enough for the time being.

<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite from scratch. I'm pretty sure Rory Conroy of Fair City and Ruaidhri Conroy of Six Shooter are not the same person, but I can't be certain. The latter is certainly notable, there was a full-page interview with him in a national newspaper just this weekend (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Tribune_22a0.html" title="The Sunday Tribune">The Sunday Tribune</a> I think) however this article doesn't seem to cover any of the notable aspects of his career. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 15:25, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd have to agree that these are different people. Markham Froggatt does not list "Fair City" among Ruaidhri's credits (though a single episode of Kavanagh QC does merit a mention). Similarly, no connection is made on RTÉ in these articles: <a href="http://www.rte.ie/tv/ttv/thecafe/video20060309.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rte.ie/tv/ttv/thecafe/video20060309.html" rel="nofollow">[32]</a><a href="http://www.rte.ie/tv/ttv/thecafe/kerrywilliams.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rte.ie/tv/ttv/thecafe/kerrywilliams.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>-- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocoder_9b81.html" title="User:Robocoder">Robocoder</a> 21:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> I see the temporary page for the film star Ruaidhri Conroy, but what about his namesake, Rory Conroy from Fair City etc. Can we create another temp file to build on for Rory Conroy (Fair City)? -- <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Boogins_7e98.html" title="User:Dr.Boogins">Dr.Boogins</a> 21:12, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> If you can write a neutral, well sourced article on Rory Conroy with verified claims to notibilty, then it's possible the currently protected article would be unprotected to allow it to go there. However, it may be better to simply add him as a section under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_City_3aed.html" title="Fair City">Fair City</a> for the moment. The requirements of being neutral, well sourced and verifable, still apply, but slightly less claim of notibility is required than for a stand alone article.

The author has laid out a decent case against the AfD, I wish him best of luck in his project and look forward to a time when Wikipedia has a featured article on his project that won't be listed on AfD because it will have become very notable by then. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 00:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am the founder of Majestic-12 Distributed Search Engine project. It appears to be that desire to delete this legit article is totally wrong: if you bothered to check out website you'd see that we have achieved a LOT in a very short time, for example our index available for searching is 1 bln pages. How many search engines in the world have achieved that and how many of them based on principles of distributed computing that allow normal people to join the project?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that Alexa's (rather questionable) rank is over 40,000 or any other value should have no effect on decision to delete this article that is factural and can be verified easily. If this is a requirement of Wikipedia to only have articles about pages that are ranked more than 40,000 by Alexa, then please show me that rule.&#160;:-/</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why remove the entry of an fully operation growing project? Maybe the text can use some improvements but with the reason mentioned above we could prolly put up for deletion all articles about new ideas.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article is not listed on AfD because it is new. The article is listed on AfD because its notability is in serious question. If we find a historical article whose notability is also similarly dubious, it will go to AfD also. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 18:08, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: There are similar articles on Wikipedia for projects that have had less visibility than ours, does it mean they should be deleted? Please refer me to Wikipedia rule which explicitly states what Alexa rank should a webpage have in order to qualify for Wikipedia entry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The fact that this article is marked for deletion is madness. Maybe I could go and mark some articles for deletion just because I feel like it.. because thats basically what has happened. Wikipedia is for learning, this article is informative anbd should not be deleted. [Evil-Dragon]</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As for your assertion on '"aims to", not much "has"' then please be specific on what _exactly_ is untrue on the Wikipedia article. Of course we have far reaching aims, which have not being fully achieved yet, however, if you going to delete all articles that declare some aims then I suggest start from here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista</a> and if you don't like name "alpha version", then please lets delete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News</a> - after all its beta, though it may have high Alexa rank.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I am naturally biased, it seems to be that desire to delete this article is totally unjustifiable and in my view not supported by Wikipedia policies: specifically your reference to Alexa's rank is totally irrelevant as it comes from Windows only toolbar from a very niche segment of people who chose to install it, and if you use it as indicator of worthiness for Wikipedia then consider deleting Linux related entries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So to sum up, please refer me to either wrong facts in the article or relevant policy of the Wikipedia that requires deletion of article on the basis of Alexa's rank. If you can't do neither, then IMO you should withdraw proposal for deletion, apology is optional though would be welcomed.</dd>

<dd>Nobody claims that the article is untrue. The article has been placed on AfD on the basis of its non-notability. All untrue articles are (or should be) deleted from Wikipedia, but not all articles deleted from Wikipedia are deleted because they are untrue. In fact, most deleted articles are 100% accurate, but also 100% non-notable. I'm not the one who brought up Alexa rank, but it is but one way -- in my opinion, not a very good one, and as I said, I'm not the one who brought it up -- to point out an subject's notability, or lack thereof. Also, the fact that Wikipedia is the top site linking in casts considerable doubt on the notability of the article subject. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 18:08, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notability is subjective matter: we are the leading distributed computing project of this type (building search engine) and if you care to read relevant sites you will that, for example here: <a href="http://distributedcomputing.info/news.html" class="external free" title="http://distributedcomputing.info/news.html" rel="nofollow">http://distributedcomputing.info/news.html</a> and <a href="http://distributedcomputing.info/ap-internet.html#majestic12" class="external free" title="http://distributedcomputing.info/ap-internet.html#majestic12" rel="nofollow">http://distributedcomputing.info/ap-internet.html#majestic12</a> we are also in DMOZ.org directory.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that Alexa says something about Wikipedia is irrelevant - Alexa has very flawed stats that are biased and using them to justify your actions is just laughable to me as I've spend some good time in web analytics. Don't believe me? Check Alexa's traffic report for distributedcomputing.info - the best site on distributed computing efforts: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=distributedcomputing.info&amp;url=distributedcomputing.info" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=distributedcomputing.info&amp;url=distributedcomputing.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=distributedcomputing.info&amp;url=distributedcomputing.info</a> Its very notable to those in the area of distributed computing, but Alexa says it has rank of more than 231,000!!! Though I am certain that they are more known than us!</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I mean for Christ's sake, you saying that building alternative search engine is not notable? You mean that achiving 10 bln crawled pages and building index of 1 bln pages is not worth noting? What's worth noting then, anything that Alexa says is Top 40,000 site visited by fraction of users who happan to use Alexas toolbar?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We are certainly noteable enough to have more than 100 people join the effort, and have UK national press write about us as well as get invited for New Media awards in the UK, how could that be not noteable? If you are not interested in distributed computing then you are highly unlikely to be able to judge what's worth noting and what's not, in which case it would be better if you directed your efforts in deleting articles in other areas.</dd>

<dd>And by the way, the article in the Guardian certainly refers to future plans, what's your problem with that? Of course there are things that are planned, it would be stupid not to have plans, and its perfectly legitimate to voice those plans especially since you can check what we have achieved by now, and if you looked at historical promises you'd see that what we have achieved now was planned before, so if you see problem with that then its really your personal point of view to believe them or not. As far as I am concerned article about us on here is factually correct and without doubt we are the most noteable project of that kind in the whole world.</dd>

<dd>I have provided list of articles from independent sources, I also demonstrated that Wikipedia's own words say against usage of Alexa to determine notability, thus your arguement of this article being not-notable does not hold because you rely on flawed Alexa's stats and totally disregard information published by well respected independent sources like The Guardian. If you do not like something in their article then its your problem, however you can't credibly claim that the project is not notable because this is completely false.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you don't believe that our project is important then don't join it, but don't vandalise valid articles by deleting them: try CREATING something rather than deleting. And with all due respect - the choice of name is not really up to you and the fact that it may or may not change in the future should not concern you in the least: if you don't like that then delete Microsoft Vista's page because its name was changed from Longhorn. -alexc</dd>

<dd>Your original deletion words are these: "A distributed web crawler project with an Alexa rank of &gt;40,000 - and guess what?", I posted link on Wikipedia which clearly states that Alexas data should NOT be used for purposes of notability because of known flaws, yet you based your deletion arguement on this flawed approach and refuse to withdraw it, instead making up further accusations as you go. For starters I'd like you to withdraw Alexa's arguement (low rank) completely before we move to other alleged issues with the article: if the article violates specific points of policy then please post those points, dont send away to pages and pages of text, it is YOU who should provide exact points that the article allegedly violates. So, do you withdraw your Alexa's arguement, yes or no?</dd>

<dd>And look what we have here in your own reference: <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> I qoute: Software is considered to be notable enough for inclusion if it meets _ANY_ of the following criteria:" &lt;-- see word ANY?

Demanding an apology is not going to help you at all. Alexa ranking isn't everything, obviously, but it isn't nothing, either, and JzG didn't use Alexa ranking as everything, as you seem to make him out to be doing. He also pointed out that the top site linking in is WP, a legitimate concern which hasn't been addressed at all. As for telling JzG to post policies that the article violates, he just posted them. I might add that the article violates <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, too. About the only thing I would give it notability for is the press coverage, but, as has already been mentioned, that happens to have a lot of future goals and not a lot of accomplishments to date. (And lest you point out Vista again, Vista is a continuation of an already notable OS series, and also a subject which is notable simply for the fact that it is being anticipated by so many.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Let me put it this way: if an average user, not connected with the project, finds Majestic-12 notable enough that they feel there should be an article about it, then the project probably meets notability requirements. An article about someone should not be created by someone who has something to do with the article subject. If it has already been created (as it is in this case), the question then becomes: if we deleted it, could we reasonably expect the article to be re-created by an average user not associated with the subject? If not, then the project is clearly non-notable outside of the project itself. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 20:49, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you're talking about my "average user" comment, that's a paraphrase of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, an official guideline, which states: "The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. <i>If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them.</i>" (emphasis mine) Secondly, as I've stated already, Alexa ranks may not be almighty, but they are not completely irrelevant, either.</dd>

Furthermore, new reasons for deletion can be added to an existing AfD. Nothing says that we have to judge this AfD based on merits of Alexa ranking, wait for this AfD to terminate, then start another AfD based on the fact that it violates all of the other policies that JzG has pointed out.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: No - I would not nominate them because those entries there are legitimate articles. It is _you_ who wishes to delete this article and I am pointing out that not only you providing no valid Wiki rules, but even if what you proposed was correct, then it would require deletion of most of Search Engines listed there, so, I am challenging you to apply _same_ standard of scrutiny to all articles in Search Engine category rather than pick on someone. In fact I just noticed you did nominate some other search engine too: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eliteweb&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eliteweb&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eliteweb&amp;action=history</a> so why did you nominate tham and us, but not (for example) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneLook" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneLook" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneLook</a>&#160;? Why is it you not deleting almost all of the search engines listed there since many of them are less notable (and certainly less unique) than us?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>And I still dont understand what's your problem with independent links I quoted - with all due respect the Guardian is more independent than you and they certainly have very high standards that they apply virogously, if you believe that they lied in the article then why won't you sue them? If you can prove that then you will certainly contribute something rather than deleting genuine article without good reason. alexc</li>

<li>I found majestics search engine through the norwegian news article about it. I just would like to say that normally I would not be very interested in joining such programs, and probably wouldn't have stayed long with it if it wasn't for the developer of it. If you can find anyone that is more active than Alex here when it comes to listening to problems or communicating with the people that is helping this project I would be impressed. Usually get an answer within 5 minutes(just check out my posts on his forum, username: Dagger). This project I am pretty sure will grow rapidly, and as it's index grows, more and more newssources will grab a hold on it. Would't be surprised if it will air on televised news somewhere in not too long a time. You may delete this article, but my guess it would appear again at some point, and with much stronger foundations against deletion(although I feel it deserves a place here). I have full faith in Alex and the progression of this project.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Well, this is my last post on this topic: I am grateful to supporters of the project who not only take part in very Wiki-like project, but also created Wiki page in the first place, sad to see that actions of few people on here throw shadow on good Wikipedia image, shame, but time will judge who was right - I certainly hope you will still be admin(s) by then, the only worry I have is that other legit pages will fall prey to your unjust actions. One thing I will tell you though - at Majestic-12 Distributed Search Engine power will not be held in hands of few individuals and no deletions of sites from index will be possible just because few men have got big egos and apply double standards. Shame on you - you besmirch Wikipedia's name. That's my last post on the topic - hope other articles about search engines will be spared deletion. alexc 23:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for change of mind, but I really think that "2) please refrain from bringing in users for the sake of voting in an RfA" is yet another unjust thing: you can't seriously be expecting people to check article every day, I noticed it was marked for deletion today by pure chance: last time I checked it was many weeks ago, so if I were to follow your logic then it would work like this: Admin A marks article for deletion, if its not the most well known piece of info that is edited by many editors then its all probability nobody will actually object to it and article gets deleted, and you automatically disqualify relevant parties in effect allowing only those who are totally unrelated to the thing to voice their opinion that in their view the project is not notable (of course for YOU it is not because you may have never heard of it and don't take independent views as well as those who participate in it in consideration!), if that's not flawed process then I don't know what is. And you mention that you knew OneLook - so what, does it make it better article and more deserving one? Does it mean just because something new appears it should not be listed on Wiki simply because you have not heard of that before? The whole situation is really a farce - if this is how decision making is working here then its clearly very flawed: rules should be rules for everyone, if article about Majestic-12 is not deserving despite having recent major newspapers talking about us, then you should delete many many Wikipedia articles like yesterday. Anyway I am abtaining from posting any further and reserve the right to follow appeal processes that are available on Wikipedia: its about time to check first hand if Wikipedia critisisms are justified. alexc 00:15, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, policy on bringing in users for AfD is something I can't change, and it is almost indistinguishable from sockpuppetry. AfDs have always traditionally counted votes by more established users (which I, by the way, do NOT claim to be, in any way, shape, or form) as more weighty as those of less established users. As for Wikipedia having all these other articles, as has been mentioned here already, the fact that these articles exist is not a good reason for this AfD not to exist. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 01:40, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Are you actually going to proceed deleting them or just ignore them as the "job" here is done? Did it not occur to you that if there is a rule effectively outlawing most entries in that category, then such rule ought to be wrong? This whole conversation makes me feel like I am back in USSR: no matter what you say, no matter how genuine the situation is (what more notability you want apart from dedicated article in UK national newspaper, a Super Ball TV ad maybe is needed to change your mind?), the people with power have their own way despite common sense. This is really not about this article - I can assure you that I won't lose sleep over removal of the article, however this injustice seems to expose a serious flaw in Wikipedia that really can't be left unopposed. What would you say if I checked automatically all articles with external urls and marked all of them for deletion that have Alexa's rank below 40,000 would that be acceptable? alexc 01:55, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The sheer fact that Majestic12 impacts so many people (volunteers, web masters, users) and that it is an incredible achievement surely makes the article notable. There is national coverage (Guardian Newspaper) of the project and the Wikipedia article provides a way for ordinary people to understand more on how it works and what the long term goals are. I find it amazing that an article such as this be considered for deletion. 82.11.44.91 15:58, 6 May 2006 (UTC)Mike Challis</li>

<li>Hmm.... i see no reason why to remove the article. The project website seems active and the article info seems correct. I can discus if the project itself apeals to me or not but that is not the point. Wikipedia is a source of information and this article contains usefull information. The removal of articles should be kept to a minimum in my opinion. Only to remove false information or submission made while intentionaly breaking rules (spam etc). So to state it simple: i recommend to <b>keep</b> this article. 213.219.190.222 20:18, 6 May 2006 (CET)</li>

<li>Just found this search engine in my server log after I'd seen it a couple of weeks back in a major German news outlet (www.sueddeutsche.de) and came to wikipedia to check for information on it. If people think it's rogue and evil and should not even be talked about, then you might want to delete it. Don't know. Some say Microsoft is rogue and evil. I, in any case, found useful information in the article, and with regard to the fact that there's of course some intentions stated, and perhaps even bragging, I would believe that that's hard to be entirely avoided if you're talking about some innovative project. Don't know, but my vote for "Potentially useful information which <b>shouldn't be deleted</b>, but made compliant with standards if it's found wanting on that count."

<li><b>Comment</b>. Good job adding the links; improving an article up for AfD is accepted and even encouraged. My main concern is that a small group of people seem to have vested personal interests in having their article listed on Wikipedia, and that's really not what Wikipedia is all about. The perception of meatpuppetry doesn't help either. Until I'm comfortable that the subject is well-known enough that people unaffiliated with the project can contribute to improving the article, I'm inclined to stay with weak delete.

Like distributed search engines, that because of it nature is one the few alternative that threaten Google's strong position.

<p><br />
Hello, I followed the link to this article from the list of search engines. I had not known about Mj12 before today. I may never have discovered this page without wikipedia and cannot understand why this article deserves deletion because of it's "un-notable-ness". Fair enough if this article was false it would deserve deletion, but notability is a hugely subjective concept, the GDP of Botswana is not notable for me in any way but someone out there needs to know it. Concentrate on clearing out the factual errors, mis-spellings, puctuation and grammar mistakes plaguing wikipedia before worrying about how important a topic is. My friends and I use wikipedia for information on things ranging from chocolate bars to the Carolingian empire. All things great and small, it's what wikipedia is USED for.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Who decides how notable an article/subject matter is on Wikipedia? I thought Wikipedia users decide what’s notable and not moderators? If this is so then the above comments speak for themselves. I find it very sad that people are picking over an article because of notability, especially after being challenged they decide then to nitpick over any other rules that might be breaking. Police do a similar thing when they want to put someone away... even if it means breaking their own rules. I do have a suggestion though, why don't you just make all articles on Wikipedia created and editable by mods... would soon put an end to all these lengthy discussions and get back to having control over everything. Oh wait, that’s already happening, silly me.</li>
</ul>
<p>So remember folks, if you happen to find a rare new bird or insect and want to tell the world about it then don't post it on Wikipedia... they'll only go delete it for being non-notable. Sorry for the rant, but hey someone's got to tell it as it is. --User:Evil-Dragon</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Administrators don't have control over everything. For the record, I am not an administrator, although I hope to be one in the future. If you feel Wikipedia is run by an elite group of users with no input from the general public (the <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">cabal</a>, as it is referred to sometimes), nobody's forcing you to stay. Oh, and "if you happen to find a rare new bird or insect and want to tell the world about it", publish it a notable, refereed, journal. That'll make it verifiable and notable, and it'll be on Wikipedia in no time. (Well, soon enough, at least.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 21:43, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>do NOT delete</b> First of all, Alexa is by no means a way to measure notability. It's collection of information relies on proprietary software. In certain sites, the percentage of userbase having the toolbar is much less than others. You can expect that the userbase and visitors of MJ12 has very few instances of this software installed. Mainly because the computer-oriented people in this project know how to keep their browsers clean of extra toolbars. Secondly, every serious project "aims to" something. When that goal is reached (1bln urls) and before it's reached, the project picks a new milestone and "aims to" it. MJ12 "has" over 1 billion pages indexed, which is much more than just the 1bln urls aforementioned, closer to hundred active nodes crawling 24/7, it complies to pretty much every robots.txt standard and "has" done what the GRUB project failed in (which by the way is still listed in Wikipedia). This is a very active project which "has" reached a lot of milestones before the schedule and "aims to" do it in the future too.</li>
