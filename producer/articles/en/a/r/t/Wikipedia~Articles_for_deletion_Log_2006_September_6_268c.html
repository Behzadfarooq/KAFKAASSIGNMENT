<li>Regardless of how it seems, lists and categories are not redundant with each other, they serve different purposes.

<li>Note, Buckner 1986, that a list can include citations.

<li><b>Keep</b> per T-Anthony. I agree that there is some encyclopedic merit to the list, namely with focusing only on the self-identified anarchistic. The list actually has a good source with a number of references. (Though a few are non-RS). Remove the "regarded by other" part (which removes the attack-page element) and either purge all the non-reference name or add a source tag them. If you tag and the article's editors don't come back to add sources in a week or two's time, then purge the remaining names. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 08:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> although it obviously needs a lot of work, mainly trimming it of red links and unsourced additions. The benefits of the list form over the category is that sources are clearer and more identifiable (when actually present), and there can be clarification concerning what type of anarchist the person is, a short description of who the person is (eg. American politician, French artist), why they are included, whether it is disputed, etc. A lot of lists have similar problems, but the solution is ruthless editing, trimming and monitoring to ensure it meets Wikipedia standards and policies, not deletion (even though I agree this list is in pretty rough shape). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TM</a> 16:29, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I was almost persuaded by TruthBringerToronto's argument, which is a good one, but in the end this is a private company founded in 2005 and turning over under a million dollars, in fact less than the dollar value of my house, plus the article was created by the company's founder, so <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">WP:VSCA</a> and lack of evidence of meeting <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> (multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable sources) makes the article on <i>this company</i> a delete for me.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It started as a vanity page, but even so it was relatively neutral. The article has since been edited by at least one other editor and now appears to be NPOV.

<li><b>Delete</b> If this company would dissapear in an hour, the sector in which they compete wouldn't even burp. That is a good definition of not-notable for a company.

<dd>Homophobophobia is a legitimate issue, as can be verified below and therefore this topic has reason for receiving a voice. The primary objective of this article is to expose colloquial refferences made by the general public, not those in blogs or forums.</dd>
<dd>An example of homophobophobia is deleting this thoroughly thought out and thoroughly researched article without discussion or attempts to improve it. The author made a tenacious attempt to purge all traces of attacks, vanity, spam, and nonsense from this piece. If ones political or otherwise biased views cause this article to appear to be “utter nonsense,” one is encouraged to make the necessary changes to improve said piece in this regard.</dd>
<dd>Please feel free to edit for the purposes of improving non-biased accuracy, as well as removing bias itself. Current information as contained is not based on original research.</dd>
<dd>For those who have doubts as to the usefulness of this article and the definitions and disambiguation therein, may freely consult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Paraphilia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Paraphilia" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, in which you will discover an entire page of “philias.” If, therefore, the English language is capable of producing such a great many forms of sexual expression, love, and risk-taking, then one must equally acknowledge an equally numerous set of phobias, if not in greater quantity, regardless of their relation to sexuality, the evidence of which can be seen bellow.</dd>
<dd>One may also be referred to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> for further guidance. You are advised to refrain from vandalizing this wikipedia article.</dd>
<dd>(homophobophobia is related, but not identical, as the definition suggests)</dd>
<dd>Changes have been made to comply with quality standards. Please note the purpose being to expose a possibly decade old word, or perhaps one coined shortly after the word "heterophobia", or before. Clearly more research can be done to correct this problem, and it will easily be done pending contributions by the many Wikipedia editors available.</dd>

<li>It's hard to defend this entry on one level, as indeed the word seems to be having a hard time settling into one of two "obvious" meanings. On the other hand, <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechron_4e31.html" title="User:Techron">Techron's</a> criticism of the uncritical acceptance of other sexual pseudo-terminological entries is not unfounded. For instance, out of pure dumb chance I lit upon <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agonophilia.html" title="Agonophilia">agonophilia</a>. Here we see the wikipedia internet power dynamic at work, because the word would seem to have two somewhat conflicting definitions. And furthermore, most references to one of those meanings trace back to Wikipedia itself. Thus it appears that one of the reasons to delete this entry is to prevent it from establishing the word with a specific meaning.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Fezzik appears to be vaguely notable in the world of Las Vegas sports betting.

<li><b>Comment</b> Looking over the article's history, and considering the fact that the article was AFDed by a single-edit user, I suspect that what is going on here is that Fezzik has decided to nominate his own article for deletion because he doesn't want a public link to his real name, Steve Fenic, which someone keeps putting into the article. (Well - <i>probable</i> real name - there isn't a direct connection, but it does seem likely.) Probably a statement saying his real name is "Steve Fenic" <i>should</i> be in the article if kept, if nothing else because he seems to want to keep it a big secret. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 03:33, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's a powerful set of multiple server farms, constantly expanding, and able to hold far more than the editors can create. Deus Ex is a real-world game, one of the most popular in the genre, one of the cult cyberpunk games, one which elements are frequently referred to in speech among computer games players. To avoid bloating the Deus Ex article, information about bots was put into a separate page. It is not a one-user page; significant interest from multiple editors keeps it improving. It has a log way to go yet, including only robots in one game, but it does improves and expands, and today is only a fraction of what it will be in the future. And, despite that, even today that article is not a stub, but a good overview of representation of robotics in Deus Ex. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 19:56, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is not paper, but neither is it a project to abridge every single piece of text ever. This article isn't about Deus Ex in the real world, but instead <i>extremely minor</i> elements of the fictional world that appears in those two games. This is nothing more than plot summary (fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), is additionally trivial plot summary of zero interest to anyone but hard-core Deus Ex fans <i>who will already know where to get the info anyway</i> (fails <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>), and cannot be written from anything but an in-universe perspective due to the total lack of commentary outside of the source work (fails <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> and cannot be cleaned up to work with that).

<dd>Sure.

<dd>Admitting? Nope. I'm just quoting the policy - it confirms that this article is OK. No speculations, just a separated section for Deus Ex with pure facts. It's not just source material, it's well condensed and concentrated info. Do you suggest to merge it back into <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deus_Ex_80b2.html" title="Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a>?

<dd>Whatever you want it to be, it is what it is. It is information about robots in a game, which is far more that a story. Furthermore, in a quite influental in CRPG world game. So it's interesting, verifiable information, and the number of editors confirms that it serves many. There's no need to remind that you suggest to delete it; have you ever suggested <i>not</i> to delete something? Your userpage clearly states that you are an extremist deletionist, aimed at fiction-related information, and specifically that you hate whatever you define as cruft.

<dd>It is not famous, but, as a part of well-known game, has significance to warrant interest. We could debate over this for a year or two, or maybe for 30 or 50 years if we stand on the positions. However, I'll raise another question.</dd>
<dd>What purpose would deletion of this article serve?</dd>
<dd>Deletion of non-neutral articles saves WP from bias. Deletion of non-verifiable or pure OR articles saves it from being false. Deletion of vanity pages saves it from becoming an advertising site or a soapbox. Stop here. It doesn't mean we should delete everything. Deletion of FAs would do only harm. Deletion of GA as well. Deletion of articles which do not harm Wikipedia would also serve no purpose for us and harm WP.</dd>
<dd>So, respond to the question above, or, repeating, what purpose would this deletion serve? It's not like a typical deletion candidate. It isn't a biased, non-verifiable, vanity or original research article. It is an article like many others, fitting well into schemes adopted long ago by most editors. So? <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 23:58, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is typical behavior from A Man in Black. As some one has already mentioned, he is just trying to set a precedent with this deletion with his ultimate intention being the removal of all <i>Deus Ex</i> related pages aside from the main game page. Even with his specious and illogical arguments this is obviously his one and only intent (he has already deleted the 'Sihouette' page without so much as a vote).<br />
<br />
As has already been said, the robots of <i>Deus Ex</i> are much more important to its gameplay and story than most other videogames. They are an interesting combination of traditional first-person shooter enemy and game weapon, and as such deserve mention just as much space as other character and weapons pages do. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandpafootsoldier_a9c6.html" title="User:Grandpafootsoldier">Grandpafootsoldier</a> 01:33, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Silhouette page was deleted after being prodded for five days. As for the rest, the fact that Deus Ex is interesting or important or whatever is reason for there to be an article on the game itself, not every single object, character, and concept appearing in that game. Currently, we are up above two <i>dozen</i> articles devoted to two games, and this ridiculously high level of detail is not appropriate for this project. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and it seems very likely to me that you didn't waste a moment after the time ran out on the prod to delete the offending article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Google hits are not a very accurate gauge of notability; check print sources instead. A Nexis search of all available dates for newspaper articles mentioning this phrase comes up with a grand total of 13, 4 of them letters to the editor. Of the other nine, only one is actually an article about the "syndrome," but it is actually an excerpt of Krauthammer's joke article. Two of the other 8 articles are the same article. So we're down to 8 unique articles in newspapers that even mention the term, one of them being Krauthammer's joke piece and the other 7 all seem to be using the term to poke fun. I just don't see how this joke is notable at all.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 20:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're clearly a fan of selective reading. This is what else is on that page: "it is generally agreed that topics in most areas must exceed a certain threshhold of notability in order to have an article in Wikipedia. Several guidelines (see table on the right) have been created, or are under discussion, to define more precisely what these thresholds should be. Articles on non-notable subjects are frequently nominated for Proposed Deletion and Articles for Deletion, and are frequently deleted via those processes, as can be seen through precedents." So, yes, there is no specific official policy, but articles considered non-notable should be deleted. And if you really think the argument here is about "grinding axes" or inserting "PWN3D" tags, I would suggest that you may be participating here for the wrong reasons.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 19:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Of all the neologisms on Wikipedia, this one is one of the better sourced. I don't understand the assumption that there are only seven articles mentioning this term, when there are several more than that actually cited in the article. While I believe this was nominated in good faith, since it was nominated by a disinterested third party, the editor who asked them to nominate it may have an axe to grind. This term is indeed widely in use among certain political persuasions, and if you don't believe that the syndrome exists, take a quick spin through Democratic Underground's General Discussions forum for confirmation through observation. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 21:02, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - it can easily be established. Read Krauthammer's article. He may have psychiatric credentials, but this article is clearly tongue in cheek. Do you think he really believes, as he writes, that "A plague is abroad in the land"? Or read this passage - "Until now, Bush Derangement Syndrome (BDS) had generally struck people with previously compromised intellectual immune systems. Hence its prevalence in Hollywood." Or this: "That's what has researchers so alarmed about Dean. He had none of the usual risk factors: Dean has never opined for a living, and has no detectable sense of humor. Even worse is the fact that he is now exhibiting symptoms of a related illness, Murdoch Derangement Syndrome (MDS), in which otherwise normal people believe that their minds are being controlled by a single, very clever Australian." Shall we start the Murdoch Derangement Syndrome article now too? Or let's use the closing lines as the clincher: "The sad news is that there is no cure. But there is hope. There are many fine researchers seeking that cure. Your donation to the BDS Foundation, no matter how small, can help. Mailing address: Republican National Committee, Washington DC, Attention: Psychiatric department. Just make sure your amount does not exceed $2,000 ($4,000 for a married couple)." Does anyone seriously believe the RNC has a "Psychiatric Department" with a "BDS Foundation"?

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The only real "source" for this seems to be Krauthammer himself. The two "expansions" on the term are hardly what I would call expansions - they just both make aside references to the fact that the term exists; they don't really add anything to Krauthammer's definition. The same goes for the non-Krauthammer external link. 642 unique Google hits doesn't really impress me, and I think it would be a pretty significant stretch to say this term is in common use. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 19:47, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Ive read through the article and seen Charles Krauthammer speak about BDS in several different forums, on Fox News and CSPAN. He appears quite serious to me. I think the part you mistake for a joke is his light hearted attempt to instruct Republicans, Independents and perhaps disaffected Democrats into "curing" BDS by donating to the GOP. That part, I would agree, was delivered in a half joking manner (Although I think he's quite serious about donating to Republicans). <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 00:39, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Half joking? So you're saying there is a GOP Psychiatric Department with a BDS Foundation? And you're saying that his other comments I quoted above are entirely serious? I'm sorry, no offense, but that seems nonsensical to me. Krauthammer may seriously believe that liberals are delusional - and some of them certainly are - but that entire article is tongue in cheek. He may seriously want people to think liberals are "crazy," and he may want people to donate to the GOP, but to suggest this is a serious medical diagnosis makes Krauthammer look far more ridiculous than he is.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 04:08, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Besides, notability of a term isn't limited to usage in mainstream media sources. There are countless words and phrases with Wiki entries that aren't used by the mainstream media at all. Should they be deleted, too? There are several very notable, very popular websites that aren't mainstream media sources that use the term regulary.

<dd><b>Comment</b> had you tried your search in october you would have found a different result.

Sorry you don't find my reasoning convincing, but you certainly haven't identified any "faults" in it. In any case, I don't see the point of having a page for a snide joke made by a pundit. Shall we have a page for every joke made by Byron York or David Corn too?

<dd>It's not an insult if it's true Sloat, you follow me around from article to article like a lost puppy dog. Please stop.

<dd>TDC, you are full of shit. I am getting sick of responding to this charge from you on every page I edit. As I have said over and over again, it is false. I have <b>NEVER</b> stalked you, and your crap about puppy dogs is ludicrous. If anything, you have stalked me; you frequently edited pages that you clearly know nothing about just to revert edits I have made to those pages. But I'm not the one who keeps bringing up the phony stalking charge. Wikipedia policy on stalking specifically backs me up here. You may be better educated than me, but you skipped basic reading comprehension in your studies if you think I am "stalking" you or if you think "Bush Derangement Syndrome" is an actual psychological condition. I'm not sure I would consider Wikipedia edits to be refereed publications, but I'm not sure why it would be relevant at all to this discussion how widely published you are, unless perhaps you have been publishing about Bush Derangement Syndrome.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 20:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is devolving rapidly, and now you are the one who is attacking.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I do not normally like neologisms for an encyclopedia and this is one. Don't such things really have a better place in wikidictionaries? I did not do any outside research so I could be convinced to change my view, but based upon the article it is the unique expression used by one person and referred to by one other person. Plus it is sort of an insulting joke thing. Is that really encyclopedic? I also do not think faddish blogosphere stuff is good for an encyclopedia. I know that I am out of step, but I do not think fads like <a href="../../../f/o/27/Fo%27_shizzle_my_nizzle.html" title="Fo' shizzle my nizzle">fo' shizzle my nizzle</a> are encyclopedic.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have used this article for reference more than 5 times since I discovered it. The value to the readers is what merits keeping it. The accusation that this is a 'neologism' is weak in that new words always need to be created when a new concept needs discussion. This is a very viable concept. Deleting the words used to name it from an encyclopedia will not make the concept go away, it will just remove a name for it. <a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyStroke_24be.html" title="User:KeyStroke">KeyStroke</a> 15:11, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would like to state that I am the author of this article, have no stake whatsoever in GT Enterprises, and feel this article should be retained in view of the role played by this firm in promoting FLOSS in this part of the globe.
<p>Because I found Taranath newsworthy, I have written about him in the past, including here -- <a href="http://www.maailma.kaapeli.fi/asia.html" class="external free" title="http://www.maailma.kaapeli.fi/asia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.maailma.kaapeli.fi/asia.html</a>&#160;: "Other firms like GTCdRom, run by former navy officer Taranath in Bangalore, attract huge crowds at IT events such as IT.Com held annually in that city which some consider the 'Silicon Valley of India'."</p>
<p>When you call it a "possible vanity article" your assumption is that the author of this article is part of the firm itself, or in some way related to it. I would like to emphatically add that the only reason I write this is because I find the matter to be worthy of an entry in here, and feel that concerns of relevance to South Asia should also adequately reflect in the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>, game fansites aren't automatically notable. Granted, it's the second google hit for "Animal Crossing", and thus might get some interesting traffic, and I've visited the site a couple of times, but as far as I can tell, the site doesn't really have much in it that would warrant an article of its own. "It's a giant honking fansite. It has stuff related to the game." Umm, yeah, what makes it so special that tells it apart from other sites? Did Kazumi Totaka compose them a love ballad or something? The whole purpose of the site can be summed into an external link on <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Crossing_%28GameCube_game%29_45d2.html" title="Animal Crossing (GameCube game)">Animal Crossing (GameCube game)</a> article, though: "A big fansite where people can trade patterns, town tunes, and other related material."

<p>"<i>Dii Familiaris</i>" seems to be a neologism. Besides that, this article asserts that Limentinus and Forculus were an actual part of Roman mythology, which may not be true. The only ancient sources describing these two Gods are clearly biased - Tertullian (200AD), Cyprian(200AD), and later Augustine(400AD). Cyprian and Augustine, at least, use the gods to deride Roman religion, and Tertullian uses them to illustrate a point. These are not reliable sources.</p>

<li><b><s>Keep and move</s></b> to fix the spelling mistake. Expand with JayW's research as a starting place. In my mind the <i>dii familiares</i> (where this should move to) are distinct from the <i>lares</i>; the <i>lares</i> were familial, these gods were public, though had little by way of public cultus. The Romans were fond of deifying abstractions, and seeing presiding <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius_%28mythology%29.html" title="Genius (mythology)">genii</a> over all homely pursuits; these minor gods are not much different in inspiration from Vesta or Nike/Victory. As to the unreliability of Tertullian and Augustine as attesting to their existence, I am inclined to accept them as far as they go; unlikely they could get away with making up deities. With ancient sources, you sometimes have to go with what you're given; see <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amafanius.html" title="Amafanius">Amafanius</a>. The article surely ought to point out that the only source of these gods' existence is in hostile accounts of Roman religion. To their number ought to be mentioned <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crepitus_%28mythology%29.html" title="Crepitus (mythology)">Crepitus (mythology)</a> - I really need to expand that, he figures in an important passage of Flaubert - and Stercutius, who has an article on <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stercutius" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stercutius" rel="nofollow">the French side</a> at least. Crepitus may be Voltaire's invention though; Voltaire's <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_Dictionary_22d9.html" title="Philosophical Dictionary">Philosophical Dictionary</a></i> tended to mock the idea of gods in general. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:20, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The current article at <i>di indigetes</i> is little more than a list pointing to a whole bunch of stubs. All of these minor gods probably don't really need separate articles, and merging them might offer the possibility of categorizing them by function or domain. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:11, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I can't speak for what they released as singles in AU, but in the States they only released the first three album tracks as singles ("From Out Of Nowhere", "Epic", &amp; "Falling to Pieces"); the first had no real impact, but the other two were hits. I've heard their cover of "War Pigs" as well as "Zombie Eaters" on a local radio station that used to play album tracks by request after midnight... but IMO non-single album tracks don't need an article unless there is something substantial to say about them.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:23, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not at all. This is an artist that has been performing and releasing records for over twelve years. She has a loyal nationwide following, as testified by her London performance in July, which I attended, and at which she received a rapturous reception. The Amazon review can be accessed by entering the album title in at the amazon.co.uk website (perhaps you're using amazon.<b>com</b>, which does not include the same review?). Her wider nationwide popularity is also attested to by her BBC showcase and also the following she has at her MySpace site). Also, I'm not sure whether chart success is a very accurate indicator of an artist's artistic merit or even popularity.</p>

<li>Beg to differ, web2.0 promotes new business models which are quite different from conventional practices. If we use above explanation then there shouldn't be any category called web2.0 and one might as well club all that into bigger category of Internet. Granted its a minor concept but it may or may not be a traditional tm issue when applied in the context of user generated content site destinations.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sociallabs (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sociallabs_8c16.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sociallabs">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There seems to be quite a lot of argumentation along the lines that "what harm is there in a list?". I contend that unless they are short and "closed" in nature, lists more often than not indiscriminate. However, the reason why categories exist in the first place is to enable better organisation and cross referencing. Including artists within the appropriate category is efficient; indexing is automatic: a category can be browsed much more easily than scrolling down a long list, which has to be updated; The mergers of labels and artists switching labels would make this list problematic. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 12:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

References to the artist himself are slim as well; the one interview in the article goes to a web-based magazine that refers to the artist playing a lot of high schools. WP:MUSIC suggests two major-label (or at least reasonably well-known label) albums, a national tour, awards, etc.; I see none of the above.

<dd>Okay, with the results that folks have turned up - and believe me, I did work on this one for a while and didn't manage to turn those up - I'd be happy to <b>Withdraw</b> this nomination at this point (or just let it go to the keep that it's likely to get).

<li><b>Keep</b> Tacitus seems to confirm she was L.

She was the <s>mother</s> sister-in-law of the future emperor Aulus Vitellius. Also behaved in a rather unfeminine fashion at the sack of Tarracina, however Boccaccio praised her for her courage. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 11:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> if Dlyons is kind enough to put his Tacitus and Boccaccio attestations into the article. Everything that's in Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</i> should be Wikipediable too - ideally, Wikipedia ought to be a superset of specialist encyclopedias of that kind.

<li><b>Keep.</b> As a Bulgarian I can confirm his notability. He's one of the most famous rebel leaders from the period (the Ottoman rule was <i>not</i> in the Middle Ages). Googling may not help that much since his name may also be spelled in English as Indje, Inje, Indze, etc. The article does need a cleanup and more work, but it should be kept. Also, the Bulgarian Wikipedia for some reason doesn't have an article on the man, but that place is named in honour of the guy. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 19:59, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> 287000 Google hits, yes, which it manages to distill down to "useful" 59 hits (a significant proportion of the duplication coming from iusethis.com itself).

<dd>What do you call 286000 indexable links from a site back to itself, if not link farming? Even if it's a (very conservative 80% of the total links on Google - judging by the proportion of links from the site back to itself if you ask Google to list them without suppression) that's nearly a quarter million links from the site back to itself. A site that's a mere 2 months old. By comparison, the BBC News site, which has been around for about 10 years, only has 6 and a half million links, and its one of the busiest news sites there is. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 22:17, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm. I think you all should do well to remember that google's page count's are just estimates, and sometimes wildly inaccurate. For instance:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aosx.iusethis.com&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aosx.iusethis.com&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aosx.iusethis.com&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official</a></p>
<pre>
Shows that google has indexed 22 000 pages for osx.iusethis.com.
</pre>
<p>however <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=sHI&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=osx.iusethis.com+-site%3Aosx.iusethis.com&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=sHI&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=osx.iusethis.com+-site%3Aosx.iusethis.com&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hs=sHI&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=osx.iusethis.com+-site%3Aosx.iusethis.com&amp;btnG=Search</a> shows that there are 31 300 hits for osx.iusethis.com when you exclude the site itself.</p>
<p>which indicates that the 286 000 hits number from google above has to be incorrect.</p>
<p>Marcusramberg 08:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC) -- (I wasn't going to get involved in this, but I'm offended at being accused of black hat SEO practices). If you want to claim that I'm doing something like that, I'd like to see an example of a page on the site that's only there to game the search engines rather than benefit the user.</p>

<li>You've come across a great problem on Wikipedia: with over a million articles and more being added every day, we can never be completely consistent. The best place to start understanding is, as they say above, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. If you find other articles that don't match our criteria, you should feel free to call the articles into question, first with <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> and then with this process, <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. Please don't take this personally; nobody feels that your software isn't good or interesting, only that others haven't noticed that to a degree sufficient to warrant an article in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 04:24, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As Fan-1967 says below, I asumed WP:CORP meant more than two (multiple rather than couple). However, I guess that's personal choice. Seeing as I can read neither french nor german, I can not comment wheather the newpaper articles are about wikipedia, or about MyWikiBiz (although it certainly was mentioned quite a few times in those articles, esp the german one). In my book though, this one is still <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">non notable</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">ε</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b>Θ</b></a></sup> 16:28, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Go up to a mother who just gave birth to twins ("only" two babies), and ask, "Hi, did you just have <b>multiple</b> births?" I think you know what she'll answer. Might even curse at you! Anyway, just wanted to add that bit of levity and perspective on a word. "Multiple", according to most dictionaries, means "more than one". I really don't mind if this article gets deleted at this time. The business really isn't notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> MyWikiBiz.com has barely met WP:CORP; and I talked myself out of a "Neutral" rating while writing my explanation, since I was doing what I oppose - changing how I evaluated the company against the standard because of their interactions on wikipedia. While I do not feel comfortable taking a postiion because it seems that anything having to do with MyWikiBiz is unnecessarily polemic, the openly hostile approach of some to a company that has openly stated their intentions, invited community review, made some bad jokes &amp; mistakes, but overall acted responsibly is bad policy. One of the reasons I like wikipedia over all other internet areas is because there is generally mutual respect and concern even amongst those who take drastically different positions. MyWikiBiz deserves at least that much from us. The sources, while not in English, push me over to keep, as we should apply the standards equally. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 19:17, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for the extra info. I was trying to be very conservative with the articles because a lot of what I found were re-prints of their own press releases. These guys are one of only two comapanies I could find that are using the REIT as a foundation to grow another business (self storage). The other company is a direct competitor Shurgard.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Though I think references and POV can be easily fixed, and related pages shouldn't be deleted. the notability is questionable.

<li><b>Keep</b> fine to redirect to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Sonnon_0d35.html" title="Scott Sonnon">Scott Sonnon</a> as a workable solution as well. However, initial comments of this being spam are just unfounded, as are claims of "neologisms" and "crytpo-scientific" terms. Herostratus has made his way to everything regarding this guy, and it's starting to sound like a personal agenda. Sonnon's a Ph.D. in Health and Physical Education, a former USA national martial arts team coach in <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sambo.html" title="Sambo">Sambo</a> who has been featured even on the cover of World of Martial Arts Magazine (May 1999), is a frequent presenter for the National Strength Coaches Association, and noted author in his field. Perhaps he ain't recognized by the masses like burlesque shows like Tony Little and Richard Simmons, but he is recognized in the professional sports field and has signed testimonials on his website <a href="http://www.rmaxi.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rmaxi.com" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>] from notable athletes like Egan Inoue 2x world raquetball champion, Holly Rustick, Ms. Fitness Hawaii, Andrei Arlovski, UFC Heavyweight Champion, SSG. Matthew Larsen, USA ARMY Combatives School, and so on. I think that qualifies the guy to use scientific terms, or even contribute new jargon to his field. --B-ham 21:39, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. First, you already "voted" above; it has already be pointed out to you elsewhere that this is considered bad AfD etiquette.

In any case, the entry for Dragon Door Publications that has "never been contested" has only existed for seven hours, so it's a bit misleading to make that statement. However, it is now also listed in AfD, since it's a recreation of a previously deleted entry under a new name. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 03:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He's definitely not "Tony Little", but for professional athletes in many sports (such as Egan Inoue, 2X World Racquetball Champion, Andrei Arlovski, UFC Heavweight Champion, Holly Rustick, Ms. Fitness Hawaii, and Todd Milhoan, USA Olympic Greco-Roman Team), he's the go to guy.

<dd>Can you source your claim? I looked around a bit - and was unable to find much related to the US National Team at all. I also tried to verify the 1995 Pan American win, but individual Pan American results don't seem to be webified. If you could provide sources for some of the results mentioned in the first paragraph, as well as the world record in the 4th paragraph, then I would probably vote to keep. To show you why good sources are invaluable - this page <a href="http://www.usadojo.com/biographies/scott-sonnon.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usadojo.com/biographies/scott-sonnon.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> says Sonnon won the Pan American games in 1994. We can prove thats a typo, since <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_Sports_Games_43c9.html" title="Pan American Sports Games">the games were in 1995</a>. My point is, without sources, we cannot be sure which of the statements are accurate and which are not.</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I dont think "cover artist for well known band" meets WP:BIO.

<li><b>keep</b> normally, I would have gone for delete: 29 unique out of 65 Ghits for "Lance Montoya", some of which relate to Primus, car racing, and some to Chaffey College, none of which are of any interest for establishing notability. There is apparently also a baseball player of the same name. However, his having drawn 4 covers of albums for the same band which have been certified gold or platinum, if verifiable, would seem to make him notable enough.<a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do not understand, when there are two reasonably large organized/organizing fan clubs (for a team that will not play for another 8 months), that they should not have their entries.

<li>It should be noted at the owners of the team, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment have been keeping up communication with the two supporter's groups.

<li><b>Keep</b> Merging would only return a mass of information back to the article it was moved out of because that article is already too long. This article was primarily created as a place to put information on the subject of Liverpool F.C. which was considered notable/important (i.e. the list of the Reserve Squad, the trophies that the reserve team has won, where the reserve team plays and so on). However, it has to be recognised that the main Liverpool article is too long, and we simply can't cram everything on there. That is why seperate articles as in e.g. the history article have been created. It may or may not be said that the players in question are not notable; this is a seperate debate, but should affect only individual articles on those players.
<ul>
<li>This article allows for the retention of useful, verifiable and encyclopedic information, whilst not making the main Liverpool article so long that nobody can get to the end. We have been told to remove such information in previous FA reviews.</li>
<li>I would also like to make a point purely based upon the notability of a given team; Liverpool reserves participate in the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_Senior_Cup_1e4f.html" title="Liverpool Senior Cup">Liverpool Senior Cup</a>. This trophy is competed for entirely by teams within Level 1-10 of the English league system (the levels at which teams are deemed inherantly notable), with the 3 exceptions of the Liverpool, Everton and Tranmere Rovers reserves. I therefore would argue that there is a case for notability as a many time winner of this competition, which may well be deemed of minor importance to some people, but does still involve notable teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would honestly like to ask what will be gained from this removal of useful information, citing the old cliche that wikipedia is not paper, and pointing out that the Reserves system is an important part of any successful team. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 18:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's most certainly not my only point of reasoning, as you can see. I do believe this information is useful, verifiable and notable. You could still make the case that it should be moved back into the Liverpool F.C. article- but as that article is being drastically reduced <i>under advice</i>, I don't think that all of the pertinent information from this article would remain were it to be merged. And what would wikipedia gain from the loss of information about an important element of Liverpool F.C.? This is a useful place to go from the main article for further information, just as the History of Liverpool F.C. and the article on Anfield are. They are places to put useful information that won't bloat the article out of all control. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 19:03, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I recently worked on getting <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everton_F.C._db0c.html" title="Everton F.C.">Everton F.C.</a> featured and it had a reserves team list. More than one person told me to remove this list as the players were not notable according to WP:BIO. They didn't say start a new article for them and they won't have specifically said that for Liverpool reserves either. If reserves players don't qualify for notability by playing for a reserves team, then their team isn't notable either. I think it deserves a section in the article but when peer reviewed people who know what they are talking about say it doesn't so I accepted it.<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenorKristobbal_a2de.html" title="User:SenorKristobbal">SenorKristobbal</a> 22:52, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is useful information in the article, and only judging by the size of it, I'd call out keep, but reading through it more carefully, much of the information is superfluous, for example the last paragraph in the intro talking about famous players, however most famous players of today has played in a reserve team somewhere, most likely in the club where they became famous. The third paragraph of the intro should be merged with a culture or supporter section of the main article. The honours and the two first paragraphs of the intro can easily be merged into a section in the main article. So my vote is <b>merge</b>. – <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Elisson</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">•</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Talk</font></a> 20:24, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whilst taking your points on board, this article has showed a steady rate of growth since its creation, and I would say has the potential for further additions, e.g. on the history of the reserve team (as I see has been suggested by others in the talk in wikiproject football). I would hope that rather than seperate out the information about this important aspect of Liverpool F.C., it could be left together, and allowed to develop more. Right now it might be considered a stub, but from stubs, extensive articles grow. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 20:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Liverpool F.C. Reserves are obviously no-where near the notability of any Premiership team, however that in itself does not make the team non-notable.

<li>Two of the above articles exceed article size. The Arsenal one is well over. So whats your point&#160;? No offense but maybe if your school won as many trophies as Liverpool Reserves someone would write about them. By your own admission they only won one. Comparing Liverpool Reserves to a school team is ridiculous. I would favour articles on all Premiership reserve teams, even Evertons. PS Removing tally not very democratic. It was useful as quick reference to see how discussion was going. <a href="../../../d/j/l/User%7EDjln_4f4c.html" title="User:Djln">Djln</a> --<a href="../../../d/j/l/User%7EDjln_4f4c.html" title="User:Djln">Djln</a> 23:23, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Djln - you aren't helping I'm afraid.</li>
<li>SenorKristobbal - various of the players quite obviously pass WP:BIO, but anyway that is irrelevent for judging whether or not a team is notable. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Football_9335.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football">WikiProject Football decided</a> that any team down to Level-10 of the English league system is inherently notable. No player below level-5 or so will pass WP:BIO however, as the lower levels are not professional. This is exactly the kind of dumb circular arguing that we should have settled before this nomination for deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 23:46, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll apologise here there does seem to be as you say a lot of "dumb circular arguing" and it has caused me to word things wrongly in that instance. The vast majority of the players fail WP:Bio like Stephen Wynne of Everton reserves looks set to be deleted. One suggestion I would make would be a category of reserves players that pass WP:Bio and a category of Liverpool players past and present that have been in the reserves. You probably know you can put text at the top of category pages and a watered down version of the article could work. <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racecourse_Ground_2473.html" title="Racecourse Ground">Racecourse Ground</a> wikilinked effectively gives ground location and capacity. Link to Liverpool main page gives chairman and as you have a staff list there also gives the manager. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenorKristobbal_a2de.html" title="User:SenorKristobbal">SenorKristobbal</a> 00:00, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>OK, good, some constructive suggestions. The idea for a category of former reserves is an interesting one, and perhaps worth pursuing. A category for current reserves makes little sense as my reading of the squad gives only five notable players, and therefore perhaps only five articles will remain of the current twenty-two. Even if they don't deserve articles, which they probably don't, then I still don't see why their names cannot be listed.</li>
<li>The point that the information could be written more succintly is also true, but so is the point that it could be expanded. While categories can be useful, I personally would favour prose if possible. Categories always seem so regimented and dry to me. They aren't fun to read and it can be tough to pick out the highlights and important figures. At least we are moving forward&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 00:52, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Our Evertonian friend is avoiding argument about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">article size</a>. For me the notablity point is a non-starter. There are numerous articles on football clubs in Wikipedia who have been less successful then <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._Reserves_2fca.html" title="Liverpool F.C. Reserves">Liverpool F.C. Reserves</a>. The fact that people have written the article and that others chose to expand it is proof that it is worth keeping. The main <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> article is just too long and this article serves a purpose in helping reduce article size. I can understand your reservations to a point regarding <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._Reserves_bbe4.html" title="Manchester United F.C. Reserves">Manchester United F.C. Reserves</a> as it is just a few lines. However people have actually spent time working on this one.

<dd><b>Reasons this article should be kept</b>:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>It allows the main <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> article to be more streamlined in the same was as for example <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Liverpool_Football_Club_f095.html" title="History of Liverpool Football Club">History of Liverpool Football Club</a>. It allows this secondary list of players to be kept somewhere more suitable.</li>
<li>The players <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salif_Diao_08fc.html" title="Salif Diao">Salif Diao</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Martin_%28footballer%29_1166.html" title="David Martin (footballer)">David Martin</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/s/Besian_Idrizaj_53eb.html" title="Besian Idrizaj">Besian Idrizaj</a> pass the notability criteria on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but are not members of the main Liverpool squad. Deleting this page causes unnecessary orphaning of these articles.</li>
<li>"Merge" arguments only make sense if there is a minimal amount of information about the subject. This article is a stub, but much more could and given time would be written about it. There are many famous people in football that have been associated with Liverpool Reserves, but never made it to the full team, for example <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Jewell_79ce.html" title="Paul Jewell">Paul Jewell</a>.</li>
<li>The Reserve team commands regular press attention. <a href="http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/0400matchreport/tm_objectid=17649698%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26headline=liverpool%2dres%2d0%2d%2dman%2dcity%2dres%2d1-name_page.html" class="external text" title="http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/0400matchreport/tm_objectid=17649698%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26headline=liverpool%2dres%2d0%2d%2dman%2dcity%2dres%2d1-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">Example</a>.</li>

<li>My reading of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> would indicate that this article is about a notable subject.</li>
<li>There are <b>no good reasons to delete</b> it.</li>
</ol>

<dd><b>Arguments for deletion</b> seem to amount to only:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The players are not noteworthy.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/l/Salif_Diao_08fc.html" title="Salif Diao">Salif Diao</a> has played in the <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_World_Cup_e470.html" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li>The information can be readily summised in two or three paragraphs.
<ul>
<li>Being a stub should not make something liable for deletion. There is plenty more information about the subject, but as yet no-one has written it down. The article as it stands has more detail than was deemed appropriate for the main <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> article, so merging it back doesn't solve the original problem, unless information is culled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Liverpool FC Reserves" are not a different club to "Liverpool FC".
<ul>
<li>No-one ever claimed that they were, and this is not a reason to delete the article. They are however a seperate <b>team</b>, that play at a seperate ground, in seperate competitions, with a seperate manager and a seperate Honours list etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that this vote was instigated in bad faith, and it will be a very sad indictment of Wikipedia if it allowed to pass unchallenged by a majority of neutral observers, rather than me being out-voted by the very people that I was engaged in discussion with. This vote did not need to happen so soon.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - more notable than a lot of the things on wikipedia, reserves teams are coupled with their clubs and therefore in some respects shae some of the notability, we have to keep this standardized, and in some countries they compete as seperate clubs, and it would be wrong to merge these teams.

<li>The Liverpool F.C. Reserves regularly get attendances in the thousands, they receive a signifcant amount of reportage in the local and national press (certainly enough to meet any WP:CORP requirements). A google search also reveals a large and loyal following who put up match reports, etc. They compete in (and win) competitions in their own right, and in some of these competitions play against the first teams of clubs that we have deemed notable. Add to this that they are mentioned in various articles. Add to this that Liverpool reserves are referenced in other articles as a notable entity having a significant effect on that article. (e.g. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Bucks_Head_01b0.html" title="New Bucks Head">New Bucks Head</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Helens_Town_FC_d1d2.html" title="St Helens Town FC">St Helens Town FC</a> (a 'notable team' according to WP guidelines who suffered their biggest ever loss against Liverpool Reserves, 8-1)). In short, if any other team met these requirements, people would not be pushing for deletion. I strongly believe that Liverpool F.C. Reserves, while obviously a part of Liverpool F.C., are an important part in their own right, and have their own history of success and own story to tell. If that was just merged into a couple of sentences in the main article, the potential of having that information on wikipedia would be lost. In short, Liverpool Reserves are notable, and I have not yet heard any convincing argument otherwise. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 10:15, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and expand.

I disagree. While it is owned by LFC and the intake is purely on the basis of hand-picked sports scholarships, it is a school in the normal educational sense as well as a top-class sports training facility, <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/academy/" class="external text" title="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/academy/" rel="nofollow">see here</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 21:46, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's possible that they think that it should be deleted because the article is sourced from a single web page, that is not from a source that is independent of the subject; is non-neutral because its sole source is highly promotional (One example: The article parrots the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Wikipedia%7EPeacock_term_c90d.html" title="Wikipedia:Peacock term">peacock terms</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a> that the web page uses, such as "legend" and "very high-tech", verbatim.); and with the inclusion of things such as the address, post code, and telephone number of the school, reads like a cross between a marketing brochure for parents of prospective students and a business directory listing, in violation of our <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a business directory nor an advertising billboard</a> policy.
<p>There is a reason that the primary criterion of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> requires sources <i>that are independent of the subject</i>. It is to avoid ending up with exactly such bad articles as this. I suggest finding and citing some sources that satisfy the primary criterion, i.e. that are not from the school and football club themselves, in order to demonstrate that there's actually the possibility that a neutral article can be written on this subject. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:46, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - sorry folks but 'delete and merge' is not an allowed action. The only choices are Delete or Keep. After either a delete or a keep an editor can, of course, add the content to the main article but it is an editorial action not an AfD decision. This has been advised on here several times. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_John_Prescott%27s_involvement_with_specific_events_a61d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John Prescott's involvement with specific events">here</a>, for example. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 20:20, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm a bit confused here, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">The top of the AfD page</a> says <i>The page is then either kept, <b>merged</b> and/or redirected, transwikied (moved to another Wikimedia project, such as Wikibooks, Wikisource, Wikiquote, Wiktionary, or another language's Wikipedia—please note that it cannot be transwikied to WikiTravel [1] or Wikinews), renamed/moved to another title, userfied to the creator's user page or user subpage, or deleted per the deletion policy.</i> Are you telling us that those instructions are not valid anymore?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The article as it stands is the tiniest of stubs. The subject of the article is probably notable (there is a dedicated Manchester United TV channel that shows all of the reserves games live, and they do get local media coverage), but if no-one is willing to invest the time to expand it then the article is quite useless. If Keep, then the article needs to be expanded. I would not strongly oppose the deletion of the current article however. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 23:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Filled with original research and completely devoid of sources or references.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This article is deeply confused, comprises almost entirely of original research and is basically unsalvagable. Requests have been issued on the talk page for clarification and improvement for some time - to no avail. I can't see a way out of this other than to delete. Just to reiterate one of the main problems - objecting to a certain policy or act by the US government does not make it "anti-Americanism". The expression itself is greatly disputed and this isn't explained on the article at all, certain objections to policy are just assumed to be "anti-Americanism". See this page: <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_Fidel_Castro_f149.html" title="Opposition to Fidel Castro">Opposition to Fidel Castro</a>, Note that it isn't "Anti-Cubanism". Anyway, see this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Americanism_in_various_countries#AfD_time.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Americanism_in_various_countries#AfD_time.3F" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> for further discussion on the deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>: first of all, Bernard-Henri Lecy does not own the rights to the phrase "anti-Americanism", he only thinks he does. Secondly, I think that nominating an article which is poorly written and sourced in spite of the fact that you believe that the subject is notable and that it is not inherently POV is <i>not</i> what AfD is for. It may be the case that many articles are cleaned up when they come to AfD, but if people start AfDing things just to clean them up, we will have an even worse case of AfD-bloat than we already do. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>You've made that point clear there, but it's false on the face of it. There are stacks of great articles that are way harder to write than this. To be frank, writing this article and doing a half-decent job of it should be easier than pissing in the shower. It'd be foolish to bet it's unworkable even if you were offered dollars to dimes.

<ul>
<li>You'd find it harder than you think to write this article. The title would need to change for a start. To label an act "anti-American" is almost invariably a POV accusation unproved and likely disputed by the subject. So it would need to be "allegations of anti-Americanism" for starters. It is an inherently subjective and POV term see:<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/bush/story/0,7369,748891,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/bush/story/0,7369,748891,00.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> which states "it only demeans things further to pre-stigmatise all debate with the mark of "anti-American". I think Chomsky had it right when he said "A term like “anti-American” is “a pretty standard propaganda triumph, actually. Like, go to Italy and try using the word ‘anti-Italianism,’ call somebody there ‘anti-Italian’ and just see what happens—they’d crack up in ridicule. But here [in the US] those totalitarian values really do mean something to people….” Note that he's talking about the terms use in the US. There is scant evidence of the term having any currency outside the US. The occasional quote here and there in the UK, our Bernard Henri Levy quote and so on. That's about it. Beyond that nothing. To use sources in the US labelling sentiments of other nations "anti-American" as fact is inherently POV, unencyclopedic and potentially offensive. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 08:12, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This simply isn't true. Anti-American may be a POV-accusation (although in many cases, I'm sure it's undisputed) - but as long as its sourced, the article isn't POV. This kind of thing is already well debated in a thousand other articles that have the same difficulties. Renaming to <i>allegations</i> is unneeded - see <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> for instance, one how to name articles.

<ul>
<li>You say that as long as its sourced, the article isn't POV. Sourced to what? Give examples. And you say that "potentially offensive" is irrelevant. How about an article that states an allegation as fact and uses original research to assert this. That <i>is</i> potentially offensive <i>and</i> very relevant. I certainly know about <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>, I've named enough articles in my time, and been involved in enough articles of this nature to know how to deal with this kind of issue.

<li>If this article survives, what'll happen is this. I'll strip the article down to the one verifiable source - Bernard Henri Levy, and his allegation of "anti-Americanism" in France. And then, in time, other users will come along with their original research again, Spain is "anti-American" because of 2+2, Brazil is "anti-American" because of 2+2 etc. Without any reference to the term itself. It's an invite to engage in original research. And the article will be back where it is now. I challenge anyone to create a NPOV page on "Anti-Americanism in various countries" given that the title itself implies it is a fact.

<dd>(sorry about the lengthy response) OK, so that is the Washington Post, obviously a US source, describing a protest as "anti-American". That's an individual interpretation of another groups actions. If you were to ask the protesting Koreans about their protest I imagine they wouldn't tell you it was "anti-American", they'd tell you about foreign occupation and the symbolism of the hill. If they did claim that yes, "We are doing this because we are anti-American", then fair enough. But they're not.</dd>
<dd>Let me give you a hypothetical example of the problem here. We have a page called <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">Evil</a> on wikipedia, some Christians believe that abortion is evil. Do we have a page called Evil in various countries listing the various countries where abortion is practiced? No. Because evil is an inherently subjective and disputed term and to do so would be to assume that abortion <i>was</i> "evil". We could source our hypothetical page with endless sources from Christian groups, but it still wouldn't help. "Anti-Americanism" is exactly the same thing, it is an inherently subjective observation made by outsiders.</dd>
<dd>There is no evidence that the protest in Korea was "anti-American" - but the Washington Post applies that term to it. <i>We're not the Washington Post - we're neutral</i>, simply reporting uses of the term. Therefore we can't place it on this page stating "the base is a frequent site of anti-American protests" and stay within NPOV. We'd have to say something along the lines of "the protests at Yongsan have been cited by the Washington Post as evidence of anti-Americanism". Essentially an allegation against the protestors. That is why the title of this page is wrong from the start, because it already assumes that such actions are "anti-American" and adopts the voice of outlets such as the Washington Post, not the voices of the subjects themselves (in this case the protestors).</dd>

<dd>The term is overloaded; meaning both "against the policies of the US" and "against the US itself". That is one issue with the title. Many US administrations, including (especially!) the current one, eagerly promote this little bit of obfuscation--this enables them to label domestic critics as disloyal (if not outright traitorous) and foreign critics as hostile (if not outright enemies). If the article is to be kept and retain "Anti-American" in the title, it ought to discuss--at the top--the different meanings of the term, and who uses them and why.

<dd>The idea in this case is to portray the protests are part of some kind of irrational "anti-American" phenomenon.

<dd>You are making yourself quite clear, but you seem to deny that the Washington Post (the one resource I found in 2 minutes) is a reliable source—which "sources from Christian groups" would probably be not, by the way. You, as an editor, are not in a position to question reliable sources. It would be perfectly acceptable to write "the base is a frequent site of anti-American protests" and reference the article. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 20:32, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Washington Post doesn't own the term. As the Guardian, Noam Chomsky and even our own article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-American_cbca.html" title="Anti-American">Anti-American</a> argues. It's a subjective label, and the definition is not universally agreed. It is actually POV for us to write "the base is a frequent site of anti-American protests", because it is an allegation by the Washington Post, not a universally agreed truism.

Should we should add the sentence "Iran is the senior partner of an axis of evil" to various pages and reference the article? Based on your reliable source criteria?

Likewise the word "terrorist" cannot be used without attributing who is making the claim - see the <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_Bin_Laden_e170.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a> page which at no point describes him as "a terrorist" though he is described in that fashion in every newspaper without fail. Our article follows that policy for a reason, we are not parroting newspapers, we're an encylopedia. So likewise we can't call our Korean's "anti-American" without attributing who has made the allegation.

<dd>I'd be careful there with that example.

While Krauthammer is entitled to his views, it would be incorrect to attribute them to the <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> simply because they ran an editorial he wrote; it is common practice for newspapers (at least in the US) to publish outside editorials representing a wide variety of viewpoints. If the passage were in an unsigned editorial penned by the Post's editorial staff, or in a news item published by the paper, that would be a different matter. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 03:48, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: if it's not nonsense (and the article when I tagged it for speedy delete sure read like nonsense to me), then it is deletable for the reasons the nominator already said. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 18:55, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you could read it, it wasn't <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a>. Patent nonsense is content that is irredemably incomprehensible, <i>not</i> content that is a fabrication. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:09, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not true: the second reason in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">Wikipedia:Patent nonsense</a> is "Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make any sense of it whatsoever.". I could read it, but I couldn't grasp what it was supposed to be about. An article that uses the word "mawsomity" and sentences like "Oofos are highly depreciative of pie, muffins, cheese, and other excessively clichéd soidisantly entitled "random" edible materials that are usually the subject of an unnatural and untrue obsession." fits the second definition of patent nonsense quite nicely. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:32, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I moved it here because I understood it. This is about the use of things like "O_O" or "O_o" to make little ascii art for eyes. See <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emoticon.html" title="Emoticon">Emoticon</a>. Actually, it's somewhat covered there already. I would propose a redirect, but I couldn't even verify the term "oofo" refers to this. The last section IS patent nonsense, but the article is pretty comprehensible, if written way out of encyclopedic style. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:20, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I understood it, too, and immediately thought of <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emoticon.html" title="Emoticon">emoticon</a> when I read the article. I echo all of what <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> has just written. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:00, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed, I don't think "nonsense" is the issue here... unverified (and unverifiable at least by my investigation) original research is the real problem with a strong indication this is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">protologism</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The articles have been good faith creations. However, i agree <i>skeleton garlands</i> was a weak article, not expandable. Certainly you edit in good faith as it looks. It does not belong here, however, because of your repeated quests to read the <i>On notability</i> essay, i have created one myself called <i>on deletion</i>. Link from my user page. I still hope the halloween articles to be expandable, and the external site is, well, somehow noteable. <i>Squeaky rats</i> are questionable too, but same thing other toy articles: not really <i>that</i> exapandable.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It is not an advert site. The site contains some merchandizing. The removal makes me believe to see a little over-enthusiasm to keep wikipedia itself non-commercial.

<li><b>Delete</b>, if something is (a) not important enough to deserve its own article, and (b) not important enough to something important to deserve a mention in the article on that subject, then it's simply too trivial to belong in an encyclopedia.<br />
Some of the entries in this list are frankly ludicrous: "United States Federal Police Department - In Resident Evil 2, this government agency responds to a communicade by Chris Redfield detailing Police Chief Brian Irons criminal past" -- this is trivia of the most trivial kind. Then there are entries like "Umbrella, Inc", which is a genuinely notable fictional organisation... except it's a genuinely notable fictional organisation which already has an extensive article of its own, so why does it have a whole paragraph here too?<br />
If we removed all the useless and trivial entries, we'd actually end up with something relatively sane resembling a List of Resident Evil places, which would be a reasonable thing to include that actually <i>does</i> have a lot of precedent on Wikipedia. I would have no objection to having that done instead of deleting the article. As it stands, however, this is not something that fits in here and not something we should keep in its current state. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 11:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This "genre" is a made up neologism, with only one band being described as post metal. All the other bands listed as post metal are better categorized as other legitimate genres. Also the article isn't sourced (most of the sources are band websites and wikipedia itself) and it has a few self references. The genre is basically the same thing as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_metal.html" title="Progressive metal">progressive metal</a>. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinosaur_puppy_8f46.html" title="User:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:yellow" face="Fantasy" color="darkgreen">T REX</font></a><sub><a href="../../../d/i/n/User_talk%7EDinosaur_puppy_fe12.html" title="User talk:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:darkgreen" face="Tahoma" color="yellow"><b>speak</b></font></a></sub> 20:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Btw <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_metal.html" title="Progressive metal">progressive metal</a> has almost absolutely nothing to do with <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-metal.html" title="Post-metal">post-metal</a>. I think that just a glance at the names of the bands mentioned in each article is enough to determine there is very little musical connection between these 2 genres.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThedaydreamer1_7a3e.html" title="User:Thedaydreamer1">daydreamer</a> 19:16, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Why remove it because it's niche? As for sourcing, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> is pretty reputable. It's being sourced more and more as I spend more time on it, and is better sourced than <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_metal.html" title="Progressive metal">progressive metal</a>. There are a lot of genres out there, what makes any one more legitimate than another? At the moment, 13 albums are in a post-metal category, by more than one artist, contributed by more than one editor. I don't see how removing it improves the encyclopaedic nature of Wikipedia. For evidence of the term's growing use in the music press, see <a href="http://www.eqmag.com/story.asp?storyCode=14416" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eqmag.com/story.asp?storyCode=14416" rel="nofollow">[55]</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> One of those was a forum, and the user said "Post metal, did you coin that yourself?", post metal was created by Isis the band, and is used to to describe their music, but thats it. No other bands consider themselves post metal. 1 genre for a very small number of bands(about 3 or 4) isn't enough to warrant an article. Besides the sources are from lyrics and interviews from isis, and wikipedia itself. I would rather have an article that is unsourced than one with questionable sources or self references. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinosaur_puppy_8f46.html" title="User:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:yellow" face="Fantasy" color="darkgreen">T REX</font></a><sub><a href="../../../d/i/n/User_talk%7EDinosaur_puppy_fe12.html" title="User talk:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:darkgreen" face="Tahoma" color="yellow"><b>speak</b></font></a></sub> 18:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> And all the bands that are extremely similar to Isis...? <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_deathguts_b1f5.html" title="User:Commander deathguts">Commander deathguts</a> 18:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Really Weak Keep</b>. Weak because I can't find anything to suggest that ANY of the bands listed use the term to describe their own music. But bands very rarely describe themselves in such narrow brackets and there are a lot of GHits for the term, many to bands whom I would regard as stylistically similar to those listed. It's a tricky one because these genre neologisms can either take and become totally embedded or they can disappear within a couple of months. Could be a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit-pop.html" title="Brit-pop">Brit-pop</a> or a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-rock.html" title="Post-rock">Post-rock</a>, could be irrelevent by Xmas....<a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 13:23, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I personally use the term post-metal and have witnessed a popularization of the term in music forums or real life conversations with other music fans. I also believe more and more acts are producing works that can easily be categorised as post-metal. It might be too early for it to be included in wikipedia, as I think that Ac@osr suggests, but since it is included and in fact as a well-written article that includes the criticism suggesting its non-existance, it should stay and maybe its deletion could be reconsidered in a couple of years from now. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThedaydreamer1_7a3e.html" title="User:Thedaydreamer1">daydreamer</a> 15:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as neologism. The term might be in (incorrect) use due to success of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-rock.html" title="Post-rock">post-rock</a>, but it's not Wikipedia-notable. No band is best categorized as "post-metal", and belong to more verifiable genres. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 09:33, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. On the one hand it describes a fairly precise sound - on the other, this is not a <i>tiny</i> niche but, along with the whole drone-doom thing, one of the two really hotly tipped extreme music genres to break out of the Terrorizer ghetto. It's far more precise than <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-rock.html" title="Post-rock">post-rock</a>, and is broader based than, say, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackened_thrash_metal.html" title="Blackened thrash metal">blackened thrash metal</a> - and if you can have separate pages for <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimal_house.html" title="Minimal house">minimal house</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microhouse.html" title="Microhouse">microhouse</a>, then you need a division between post and prog metal. I can think of no reason to delete it but to satisfy some folks' ignorant egos. There might be a case for a renaming if a more common term can be found, but it looks as though this is the one. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_deathguts_b1f5.html" title="User:Commander deathguts">Commander deathguts</a> 18:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Why o why remove it? When I was looking for more bands like Isis and Cult of Luna and this article felt like a gift from above. It's well-written and an interesting read, please do NOT remove this page!</li>

<li>This is getting into a very immature junior high, bicker-fest. I realize that Facebook seems like an invalid "source" but it is easily one of the fastest ways to spread information and gain support. As a college student, being involved in Facebook, I realize it's potential as a tool and I am exploiting it as such. Life is lived day-to-day and there are countless desicions made therein. Good examples of this exist throughout Wikipedia, <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Speak_Like_a_Pirate_Day_d005.html" title="International Speak Like a Pirate Day">International Speak Like a Pirate Day</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_1c99.html" title="The Flying Spaghetti Monster">The Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>? These and many other articles were born out of a whim made by someone, one day. The GHSM has legitimacy now because the guy, after being spurred on my collegues wrote a book and such. And Pirate Day? that was just another joke among friends that caught on. The only difference in this situation is that I am being proactive and utilizing the tools available to me in my situation. So, please, just let it be and let it grow; it will happen. And if it doesn't, if people just forget about it by December or sometime that the Wikicommunity sets, I'll delete the article myself. Please. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastapd_8f00.html" title="User:Mastapd">Mastapd</a> 22:10 6 Sept. 2006</li>

<li>Wikipedia documents topics after they become notable. It is not a publicist's tool. Plus, "One Last 'Crikey!' for Steve Irwin" has way more members anyway. Okay, that's not really germaine to the discussion, but, what I'm saying is, if it catches on like that wretchedly idiotic spaghetti monster, then I'm sure people will support the article, but for now, this isn't the place for it.

<li>You're right Gassy, that group does have way more articles, and I apologize for making it seem as though Wikipedia was being misused as a publicist tool, I understand where that comes from. But you can see that there is different support throughout many communities involving this subject; so why isn't this still the place for the article, if I combine membership with the 'one last Crikey' group and all the other steve irwin group within the next week, I'll have, conservatively, 2500 members. That growth may happen without said merge anyways. When's the cutoff? And when Aussy Day rolls around next year and I have 10000 people saying 'crikey', should I go through all this again, only to be rejected again? (Though i'm not saying i have the power to compell 10000 people, it's just a figure of speech) Wikipedia is supposed to be 'Open Source' info, at least that's the way it was described in... Time Magazine? when it was featured, but who is it open to? My group of 75 supporters? 200? 10000? what are the qualifications to be included in the open source? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastapd_8f00.html" title="User:Mastapd">Mastapd</a></li>

<p>A short article on what appears to be a minor neologism, judging from the references and extremely low Google count (237 unique, a goodly number of which are simply references or spam links back to the same paper by Kenji Yoshino).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm unfamiliar with the <i>term</i>, but recognise the <i>concept</i>. I think the article needs some editing/adding to to recognise that the term is an attempt to give a name to a event/situation. It's possible that in the long run a different term will be the one that gains widespread currency, but if <b>bisexual erasure</b> is recognised and has been used in published media, then start with that, but with recognition that the term is not yet in widespread use and may be an Americanism. Certainly "bisexual erasure" <i>happens</i> - both lesbian/gay and straight communities do it, which makes it somewhat different from the phenomenon of "recloseting" (is there a wiki entry for that?) - pretending that people for whom there is sound evidence are LGB were straight. "Recloseting" is a form of <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexism.html" title="Heterosexism">heterosexism</a>, but "bisexual erasure" can be <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexism.html" title="Heterosexism">heterosexism</a> or can be the conviction that people <i>ought</i> to fit into exactly two categories - gay/lesbian or straight, no half measures. This is a known and documented phenomenon, and worth having an entry for on wikipedia.

<li><b>DelMerge</b> — Taking 5'10" and 5'5" for average height (men/women) and applying a 3" avg. distr. we get: the 10 tallest men = 9th perc., the 13 shortest men = 9th perc., the 10 tallest women = 6th perc. [6 tallest = 9th perc.] and the 5 shortest women are only at the 5th percetile. The current cutoffs are only 2nd perctile which statistically means ~5% of the population. At least 6th percentile is equal to 1 in 500 million, or ~13 total on Earth. Thus, perhaps the four lists (Tall men/women + Short men/women) could individually deleted and then the information merged into one article - maybe something like "Human Height Extremes" - and then have the top 10 for each category in tabular format.Moridin 01:12, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agreed. Most NBA players aren't notable enought to fit. The rule of lists, from what I read back when, is also that the person contributed to the topic or is known for their connection to it. An NBA player of average height for the NBA I think could already be excluded using that rule. Likewise other things are up for deletion here. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_short_men.html" title="List of famous short men">List of famous short men</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_short_women.html" title="List of famous short women">List of famous short women</a> is not affected by this comment.

<li>I looked at the discussion page, and could not find an objective rule. This leads me to question the maintainability of this list. There has already been lots of edit confilcts centered on the "importance" of players.

<li>The rule is the one that applies to all stand-alone lists. Their being tall has to be part of their fame or significance. According to one site[<a href="http://www.eurobasket.com/over210.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.eurobasket.com/over210.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurobasket.com/over210.asp</a> he top Take <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lock_Martin_49de.html" title="Lock Martin">Lock Martin</a>, who I recently added, he'd likely just be a doorman if a director hadn't noticed he was very tall.

<li><b>Delete unless completely restructured</b> The extremes on each list are almost worthy of the lists themselves - they are people who are notable for being tall or short. However, as you get down the list (e.g., tall men) you start getting to people who are notable for things other than their height and just happen to be tall. That crosses over into triviality. I agree with Moridin's proposal as to how this topic might be saved, but as it stands, it's fairly arbitrary and worthless. GassyGuy 03:55, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I still find this article encyclopedic, important (as a collection of one kind of trivia info and famous people that can belong to it) and, as mentioned above, interesting.

They simply show them poeple they can relate to.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I have a problem with this guy. He has been in the news very recently because 1) he partcipated in Novaya Volna this year (<a href="http://www.newwavestars.com/ru/news_27_07_2006_776.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newwavestars.com/ru/news_27_07_2006_776.html" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> and <a href="http://www.newwavestars.com/ru/news_28_07_2006_777.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newwavestars.com/ru/news_28_07_2006_777.html" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> - only his "Christian" name and his country are mentioned). 2) he is rumoured to be the boy friend of Isabekova (could be a way out if it turns out to be true, we can merge it into her article). He has 244 Cyrillic googles from 49 sites (that last number is higher than some of the other Pop Idles who got 1,000 googles). So, I do not know how this will turn out. Too soon to delete, I am tempted to think.

<dd>Thanks for responding so fast, Brian. Most pages on musicians, whether they are non-notable or famous, often inflate the credentials of the person. It also happens with articles about movies and video games (even books!). What you listed sounds like some non-notable BS that a person excitedly wrote in order to make the band sound better. I don't want you to assume bad faith with <i>every</i> band you come across, but bear in mind that this stuff happens a lot. Anyway, you can always check the article against a notability guideline (in this case, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>).

<dd>This lady is notable in Kazakhstan, Russia and among Russian speakers elsewhere in the former Soviet Union (Novaya Volna which means "new wave" actually takes place every year in a Baltic state). This means that most of what is written about her will be in the Cyrillic alphabet. If you google on "Макпал Исабекова" (that is the Russian Cyrillic version of her name) you get 37,800 as I wrote below. Unfortunately, the version in the article is Kazakh Cyrillic, with a diacritic sign on the "k" in her "christian" name. That is one of the things that will have to be changed too, I guess, since the Kazakh Cyrillic version of her name only gets 90 google hits. Note that <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> made an allusion to that - unfortunately for him, most Cyrillic googles in these Pop Idle articles do NOT get above 1,000. That makes Isabekova a bit special.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Let's keep only nr 1, and 3. The others will be forgotten next year.</s> Change to <b>Keep</b> This lady later performed at "Novaya Volna" and did not do too badly. So she is known a bit. The google hits for the Cyrillic version seem correct and not artificially driven up by a fan website. However, this article will have to be cleaned up with more than a mop and a broom stick. It does not state when this Pop Idol contest took place (2004?), I found a site which mentioned her as seventh and not as sixth, the plural of "khit" in Russian is "khity" (I think -someone living in Russia please confirm this) so the translation "hits" is wrong, the first link is to stars KZ and not to Isabekova (creating the suspicion that this is primarily promotion for Pop Idol and KZ and not an article on Isabekova) and finally the red link to <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaak_Dunayevsky_9ea9.html" title="Isaak Dunayevsky">Dunayevsky</a> (the composer of so many well-known Russian songs such as "<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serdtse.html" title="Serdtse">serdtse</a>" is a DISGRACE.

<li><i>Do Not Delete</i> Although it is debatable whether Youtube videos are notable, some are quite popular and reach the status of pop-culture references. I think it's important to include pop culture references, no matter how mainstream or subculture they may be in reference. Also the entry mentions that this video has been circulated via email, which means it's only reference is not it's recent posting on Youtube. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.107.224.34 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.107.224.34_d342.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.107.224.34">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>Searching for arguments to keep some more in, I had a look at those googles and found many were in fact connected to this year's edition of a singing competition in Pavlodar for very young singers. They mention the winners in the past. Zhaketaeva is one of them. So nothing new, unfortunately. Note that if Google gives more hits for the Latin than for the Cyrillic version of the name, that is usually because many Latin googles are from mirror sites.

<dd>Kappa, do you really believe Wikipedia should be a spam ground? Many of these articles are in a mess (Isabekova's is a prime example) and look like a vehicle for promoting "Pop Idol". Let's concentrate on the ones who finished 1st, 2nd and 3rd, not forgetting that "one that got away" (Isabekova). By the way, some people in the West CAN check by way of Google, (it's just copy and paste) but when you do not put the Russian version, but (only) the Kazakh one with diacritics, 1) you ensure that they are going to find fewer hits (the Russian versions still dominate from 1:100 to 1:1000 2) if the Westerner knows about this problem, he will have to install Russian keyboard software to overtype the special letter.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 11:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. However, I am following the list as it was published at the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Russia/Russia-related_Wikipedia_notice_board" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Russia/Russia-related_Wikipedia_notice_board" rel="nofollow">Russian portal</a>] and only one of these people until now breaks the pattern with a lot of Cyrillic googles while only few Latin googles and only finished sixth: <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makpal_Isabekova_dede.html" title="Makpal Isabekova">Makpal Isabekova</a>. However, both with that name and this one there is a slight problem. If <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64">User:Nishkid64</a> takes you up on this, he will copy-paste the Cyrillic version into Google and ... find only 90 Isabekovas and ... 1 Sadvakasova. The reason is that the version in Wikipedia is often in Kazakh Cyrillic and these diacritics are not used so much even by Kazakh-speaking Kazakhs.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 23:05, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I forgot: not everyone can just install Russian keyboard software to overtype that Cyrillic diacritic k that they paste from the Wikipedia page. So many people in the West will simply not be able to tell how popular these artists are in Russia or among Russian speakers. If that is not an argument to (also) put the Russian language version in the article, I do not know what is. Actually, today Dinara has 87 Cyrillic googles, fewer than the Latin ones. I suspect that, even though she finished fourth, she went back to school.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 11:18, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but the link you provided does not say anything about a descriptive list of items from a game not being allowed. A "Game guide" would be providing information to the user to help them play the game <i>better</i> (i.e. "This gun is best in this situation, while this works best against this enemy"). If you're going to ban this sort of thing then should we remove all gun/enemy/level lists from <i>all</i> game pages?

<dd>I admit some of those examples you cited are getting into "guide" territory, but that still doesn't justify axing the whole article. There is often a fine line between describing an object in game and giving advice on how it should best be used.

The nation's producers of election-year political apparel pounced on this immortalizable phrase, and before you could say "Kerry for President of France" there were innumerable varieties of "You forgot Poland!"

<li><b>Delete</b> his uniqueness (of being a black jew who raps in aramaic) is asserted, but not notability. No sign of hits, tours, reviews.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact that you guys haven't heard of him doesn't mean he isn't notable, and he is most certainly so in Jewish/Israeli rap circles. He does have a website (<a href="http://thisisbabylon.net/" class="external free" title="http://thisisbabylon.net/" rel="nofollow">http://thisisbabylon.net/</a>), but I think some folks here are falling into the trap of "web=world", which is especially problematic in the realm of Orthodox Jews, a significant section of whom won't even go on the web. Clean up the POV-ness of the entry, and then keep it. 64.236.128.14 11:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> He is a notable person. He is a nominee for a Jewish hiphop award for this year. **:<b>Comment</b> Matisyahu didn't start out as a known entity. He has done shows in Israel, been on covers of magazines, articles have been written on him, (Baltimore Jewish times), he a headliner for this years Jewlapalooza.

<li><b>Comment</b> According to the guidelines, it does NOT require an award. He has been interviewd on air, has been the subject of articles by reputable media sources. Check him om beliefnet, and here - <a href="http://www.jewishtimes.com/scripts/edition.pl?now=05/21/2006&amp;stay=1&amp;SubSectionID=48&amp;ID=2847" class="external free" title="http://www.jewishtimes.com/scripts/edition.pl?now=05/21/2006&amp;stay=1&amp;SubSectionID=48&amp;ID=2847" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishtimes.com/scripts/edition.pl?now=05/21/2006&amp;stay=1&amp;SubSectionID=48&amp;ID=2847</a> .

<dd><b>Comment</b> It was appearing to me that <i>to have won an award</i> is a meaningful criteria for notability in terms of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. It is not always required literally, if a consensus about notability can be obtained otherwise. If you add links (unverified, i just wrote a comments), this helps to make a descision. However, wikipedia is not a complete music artists guide... <a href="../../../y/y/-/User%7EYy-bo_c77b.html" title="User:Yy-bo">User:Yy-bo</a> 19:03, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
