<p>A non-notable wiki with 600 article. There is not even a single reliable source discussing it. The only thing they have is being <i>linked</i> by a couple of Iranian directory sites.</p>
<p>It claims that "Articles by WikIran continue to be mirrored, referenced, and copied by various other sources such as factbites.com." But factbites.com is a search engine! Being indexed by a search engine also does not make one notable.</p>
<p>This article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WikIran_c68a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WikIran">nominated before</a>, but it was kept only because the Iranian crowd voted en-masse keep, disregarding the policy on "reliable sources". <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 23:21, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html" title="WP:GOOGLE">Google hits</a> aren't really a notable gauge of notability or verifiability. Doing a more complex search eliminates web boards, wikipedia itself, a few pollution-spam sites, and mirror sites, and while it's still around 1500, again, ghits aren't necessarily notable. But, you do mention the other news sources. It's worth a shot, but it may run afoul of <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> As stated in many AfDs, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not policy and notability criteria are subjective at best.

<li>Don't you guys ever get tired of the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith assumptions</a>? The discussion you referenced so far isn't much of a discussion, but a series of allegations made by Hessam, and some inquiries from others. From what I can see of wikIran, there is nothing to suggest that it's a "POV fork" similar to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>. Many of the articles there look original to the site, and I see no evidence of "POV-warrior" edits there. I suggest that you and others tone it down big time. Like I told another editor on a different AfD, this is a dicussion, not a <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicious_circle.html" title="Vicious circle">vicious circle</a>, and your attitude, and the attitude of others displayed here which would frighten away the casual reader, is not conducive to the spirit of Wikipedia. metaspheres 12:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There is a double-standard here. By some peoples standards here, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikispecies.html" title="Wikispecies">Wikispecies</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiversity.html" title="Wikiversity">Wikiversity</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Wikipedia_c844.html" title="Persian Wikipedia">Persian Wikipedia</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_Wikipedia_d191.html" title="Kurdish Wikipedia">Kurdish Wikipedia</a> cannot have articles here, but since they are <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> sites, I guess the rules don't apply, yes? But like another editor says here those rules are not "rules" but guidelines and they are viewed in a different ways by different editors. From what I see, it is notable and significant project as others have shown especially as it is the only Iranian wiki. On the Admin Noticeboard it is interesting to note that someone suggests that WP and WikIran have "interwiki" and then when he finds out that WikIran is not Wikimedia, says that since it is not an "official wiki" (whatever that means) that any links to WikIran are "wiki-spam" and should be "nuked". That's very nice, but is a hostile attitude and I agree with others who say that this is against the spirit of Wikipedia. I am 100% sure that most people on WP do not agree with attacking other wikis or editors because they are involved with other wikis or add links to other wikis. If an article on a wiki is sourced and has references, there should be no problem. A site like WP is no more or less reliable than a site like WikIran. I have looked at articles on WikIran and they have just as many sources as WP articles and alot of them use the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Iranica_91ff.html" title="Encyclopedia Iranica">Encyclopedia Iranica</a> as a source. I see good arguments for and against but the people against look more concerned with attacking the project and its editors and mocking them than anything else. I have been on WP awhile and I don't care how anyone wants to justify it, but those are <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> and just because its against another wiki or off-wiki editors doesn't make it right. Also the nominator is <i>incorrect</i> in saying that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is a policy - <i>it is a guideline</i>.
