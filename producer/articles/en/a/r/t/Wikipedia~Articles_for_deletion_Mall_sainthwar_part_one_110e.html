<dd>Dear Moderators of Wikipedia.org</dd>
<dd>The details mentioned about the ‘Mall Sainthwar’ community are based upon the facts and is a genuine one and in my humble opinion should not be deleted at all. This is evidenced by a strong community presence of over ‘1.2 million’ people residing in the Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and they originally belongs to the Rajput clan of Kshatryia's. ‘Mall Sainthwar’ community is prominently recorded in well known history books like Aaeene Akabari, Tujjak Jahangiri etc. which, if needed, we can supply for your verification too.</dd>
<dd>I would like to kindly request the Wikipedia.org moderators to first verify the facts with good resources before arriving to a conclusion to delete this article.</dd>

<dd>Dear Sirs,</dd>
<dd>History of Mall and Sainthwars which is written here is based on many books written by Historians on 'Type of Rajputs/Kshtriyas' in India and mainly in Purvanchal comprising of Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Western Bihar. Existence of Mall kingdom can be seen in ancient India. Mall are Visen rajputs while Sainthwars (or sihatwars) are basically migrants from western part of India. Detailed can be seen in AINE-AKBARI which gives name of villages where they settled, their original place alongwith their sect. Population of both rajput sect is around 8-9 lakh as per census of India and they are found in 6-7 districts of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Bihar in India.</dd>
<dd>Literatures are available on these rajput clans wriiten in Moghul period like Aine -Akbari and British records which shows the existence of this great rajput clan.</dd>
<dd>So please verify before deletion.</dd>

<dd>Dear Moderator of Wikipedia</dd>
<dd>The details mentioned at the wikipendia about the <b>MALL SAITHWAR community</b> is a genuine one and should not be deleted at all. This is strong community of more than <b>12 lakh</b> people residing in the Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and belong to the Rajput clan of Kshatryia's. It has strong hold in cities of Uttar Pradesh namely <b>GORAKHPUR, DEORIA, BASTI, SIDDHARTANAGAR, PADRAUNA, KUSHINAGAR, MAU, AZAMGARH, VARANSI, ALLAHABAD, KANPUR, EASTERN AND WESTERN BIHAR</b>. The authencity of this community as a caste can be verified in Gazzeters of Government of India and also from the land records Uttar Pradesh Government. Kindly look into the matter and as a matter of expectation it would be unwise on the part of wikipendia team to move ahead for deletion without any prior verification as such.</dd>
<dd>For any clarificatins and details for historical accounts, kindly get in touch with me as well.</dd>

<dd><b>Marriage</b> this is the best thing to answer about the proof of this article as well as this community.Now it is easy to marry in other community ..may be easy. But in older time do you believe that a person belongs to <b>Saithwar Mall community</b> can marry in other community???[In normal way to any community in India was it easy to marry in any other community?].</dd>
<dd>This is what i wanted to explain that from olden time there are "n" number of marriages which can answer itself as a proof.</dd>

<dd>This is one of the purest races of Rajputs. In ancient past, there were many powerful kingdoms having rulers from this community e.g. "Mall Rashtra",etc. In medival period also, there were many reputed and strong princely states like Padrauna, Dughara, Pali, etc.</dd>
<dd>It is a very good written article about "Mall Sainthwar Rajputs". Great Work!!</dd>

<dd>To , the wikipedia.org&#160;: from Shalendra Singh, Gorakhpur, U.P., India</dd>
<dd><b>Eye Opening Facts About Sainthwar And Mall Rajputs</b></dd>
<dd>Some representatives of Sainthwar community gave many applications in the court of Collector, Gorakhpur in the year 1942. The copy of that application is as follows</dd>
<dd>In the Court of Collector Gorakhpur, District Gorakhpur, U.P. India</dd>
<dd>Subject: Correction of papers in matters of caste</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sir,</dd>
<dd>H’onably and respectfully the petitioners beg to bring following few lines for your kind consideration and favorable orders&#160;:</dd>
<dd>(1). That the Gorakhpur district beside the adjoining districts is widely inhabited by the people generaly known as Sahatwars or Sainthwars. They are also written as such in caste column in Government papers.</dd>
<dd>(2). That the said Sainthwar Rajputs are the descendents of grand Rajputs whose original capital was Sahat in Gonda District. The mention of Sahtwar rajputs is to be found in Aine Akabari* on pages 93, 151, 314 etc. The Sahat rajputs have also been mentioned in Tod’s Rajsthan.<b>( * “Aine Akbari” is famous book written Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Vizier of Mughal Emperor Akbar the great * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar</a> and the author of “Akbarnama” refer your own site <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm</a></b></dd>
<dd>(3). That among the people generally known as Sahatwars there are other sections of Rajputs who are incorrectly termed as such. They are Khagis, Thakurais, Mohits, Karkotaks, Dovis, Bishenmall, Gaharwars, Mohatas, Soharas, Mangras, Pushkars, Bellas, Bhathis, Uskas, Barhajas, Bais, Sahajs, Rawals, Kotharies, Rajpali, Khutahania, Barwas, Pundaris, Darwa, bhakhars etc. who are scattered over whole of the district. Thus the word Sahatwar though really comprising a part is by misnomer used for various independent deferent sects of Rajputs mentioned above. The mention of these various sub caste of Rajasthan is to be found in Tod’s Rajasthan and Aine Akbari* as well.</dd>
<dd>(4). That the said Saithwars and other Rajputs mentioned above being <b>Kshatriyas</b>*, it is also necessary and befitting to their position and status that they should be entered as Kshatriya in caste column in Govt. papers for the want of which they have to suffer many difficulties.</dd>
<dd>(5). That the paper of whole Gorakhpur Tehsil has been corrected. On the above grounds in the matter of the caste by the order of SDO sadar dated )*/1942 through which the caste of Sainthwar has been substituted by Kshatriyas instead of Sainthwar in the caste column. The copy of which is attached here with.</dd>
<dd>(6). That the petitioners have been authorized to move this application on the behalf of the whole community in Gorakhpur district by a special resolution, the copy of which is attached here with. SO, it is humbly requested that your honor may be pleased to order the correct papers in Khesaras and Khataunies in matter of caste so that in the column of caste the word Kshatriya may be substituted in place of Sainthwar, with the title of “Singh” in all the villages of the Gorakhpur district except tehsil Gorakhpur for the correction of the letter has already been made by the order above referred.</dd>

<li>Please note that Indian History is not found in the net in the same magnitude as European or American History.</li>
<li>Also most of the Indian magazines (dailies, weeklies) do not have a online version.</li>
<li>Another factor is that the vernacular (Hindi, Tamil etc) magazines use different fonts and is not searchable by Google</li>
<li>Another problem is the use of different spelling for the same name. For example, my town is referred to as Tuticorin, Thoothukudi, Thoothukkudi, தூத்துக்குடி etc. You can get the complete picture only if you search all these. Even then since most of the matter is not online, you may not even get one hit</li>
