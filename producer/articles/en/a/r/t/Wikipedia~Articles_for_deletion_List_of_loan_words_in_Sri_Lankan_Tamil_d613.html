<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is not about "slang and idioms". I don't think the policy means what you think it means. Take a look at the articles in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_English_words_of_foreign_origin_42c3.html" title="Category:Lists of English words of foreign origin">Category:Lists of English words of foreign origin</a>, for example, all of which are identical in scope and intent to this article. By your interpretation of the policy, all forty-two of them should be deleted. And as far as the prohibition against slang, idioms and usage go, does that mean that we should be deleting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Chicano_Cal%C3%B3_words_and_expressions_5504.html" title="List of Chicano Caló words and expressions">List of Chicano Caló words and expressions</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Puerto_Rican_phrases%2C_words_and_slangs_ac0a.html" title="List of Puerto Rican phrases, words and slangs">List of Puerto Rican phrases, words and slangs</a>, and, for that matter, about two-thirds of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_phrases_44dc.html" title="Category:Lists of phrases">Category:Lists of phrases</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Category%7ELinguistics_lists_8b55.html" title="Category:Linguistics lists">Category:Linguistics lists</a>? -- <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadakkan_8a7e.html" title="User:Vadakkan">Arvind</a> 22:40, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. (vote changed after article changes) The above argument is for "keeping" moot. For example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Etruscan_origin_896a.html" title="List of English words of Etruscan origin">List of English words of Etruscan origin</a> is a regular list of wikipedia articles, i.e., words with encyclopedic content, not just a piece of dictionary. Also, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_phrases_44dc.html" title="Category:Lists of phrases">Category:Lists of phrases</a> contins <b>encyclopedic</b> articles, not dicdefs. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 23:33, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, maybe I'm just a little dense today, but could you please explain what makes articles such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_borrowed_words_in_Indonesian_e61f.html" title="List of borrowed words in Indonesian">List of borrowed words in Indonesian</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_words_with_English_derivatives_52f7.html" title="List of Latin words with English derivatives">List of Latin words with English derivatives</a>, and List of common phrases in constructed languages amongst others, more encyclopaedic than the article under consideration here? This is not a rhetorical question, I would genuinely like to understand what you see the difference as being. -- <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadakkan_8a7e.html" title="User:Vadakkan">Arvind</a> 00:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> has grown beyond simple collection of translations and becomes more organized, "encyclopedish". See e.g., <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Swadesh_lists" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Swadesh_lists">wikt:Category:Swadesh lists</a> and take a look into Template talk:Swadesh lists. Here people are reasonable about moving a big number of lists where they belong. See also <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:insane" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wikisaurus:insane">wikt:Wikisaurus:insane</a> for other interesting developments in wikitionary. So IMO it is time to move most of such lists there. For example there was a move to convert artices like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Russian_origin_dd85.html" title="List of English words of Russian origin">List of English words of Russian origin</a> into wiktionary categories, like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Russian_derivations" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Russian_derivations">wikt:Category:Russian derivations</a>. (And I only now noticed that this approach <b>exactly</b> fits the discussed Sri Lankan article.) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:14, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see your argument, but I think the sheer number of articles involved means that a centralised discussion is warranted, rather than an ad hoc article-by-article deletion debate, because the latter <i>will</i> lead to inconsistent decisions being taken in relation to different articles. I'll stick to voting keep for now, but without prejudice to deleting or transwikiing as part of a process that applies to all similar articles. -- <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadakkan_8a7e.html" title="User:Vadakkan">Arvind</a> 23:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You could move it to the Tamil WP, but it most certainly should be kept in the English Wikipedia as well because if anyone who doesn't know Tamil (like me) is doing any research into the language, it'll be impossible to read this article if it's only in Tamil. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4">snowolfd4</a> 19:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - It's ridiculous to suggest that this page is a "<i>List of such dictionary definitions</i>" or a "<i>A usage guide or slang and idiom guide</i>". It's very clearly valid encyclopedic entry. And are any of you guys who suggested this for deletion also willing to suggest the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_English_words_of_international_origin_4134.html" title="Lists of English words of international origin">Lists of English words of international origin</a> and every other page derived from it for deletion as well? I bet there are similar pages for most languages on the planet. You want to delete them too? Here's another one - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Spanish_words_of_French_origin_e0a2.html" title="List of Spanish words of French origin">List of Spanish words of French origin</a>. Go ahead, nominate them all for deletion. It's just beyond comprehension for me really.
