<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. There does seem to be a case here of soapboxing fairly stridently and I think the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a> suggestions are close to the mark, having also read <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Boyd_Haley_93d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Boyd Haley">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Boyd Haley</a> and its associated article. It is possible that a former chief scientific officer to the Dept. of Health would survive an AfD (though not certain, perhaps, since it's non-ministerial, non-elected, and non-political) but this article as is is absolutely without a doubt being used for advocacy, no matter the attempts made at advocacy-by-quote. It is full of irrelevant attacks on other scientists (it almost gets to speedy territory: <i>"The UK medical establishment including the Department of Health regard Wakefield’s claims as junk science lacking substance"</i>, without any citation). Those editing this debate who do not seem to have some serious vested interests (including both Ombudsman and the nominator) seem to lean clearly towards deletion (including, notably, Capitalistroadster). I don't give the "two more will pop up" argument any weight in determining what to do with this article, and it's readily apparent that Leifern has turned up mainly to be unpleasant (he doesn't make even a tangential reference to the article). So it's a delete-without-prejudice to a proper, non-soapboxed, genuine article that makes the case for the notability of its subject without leaping into the very shady territory this article inhabits. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:31, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>POV non WP:BIO. Not encyclopaedic. There are very very many retired civil service doctors in England and the only thing adduced about him is that he was to have been one witness in a trial which will not occur since the legal aid board determined it had no chance at all of success. Basically this is yet another attack page on immunisation presented as a biography - possibly we should decide that these are speedy delete candidates. <b>DELETE</b> <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 10:27, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, well, perhaps you two might to be willing to begin discussing the actual science after all. Doubts about that aside, the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogy.html" title="Analogy">analogy</a> above was offered as an attempt to get you two to see that paving over the Wiki with the preservative-laden spam of medical establishment <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma.html" title="Dogma">dogma</a> necessitates all the more, in a <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-evolution.html" title="Co-evolution">co-evolutionary</a> sense, the need to protect the wilderness of medical dissent, lest the Wiki might end up needing to <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outsource.html" title="Outsource">outsource</a> remedies for the lack of content oriented to mere carbon based life forms. Beyond the Wiki, the predominance of such spam can be traced, in part, to the economic inequities and intellectual iniquities caused by the conspiculous <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> consequences deriving from the fact that big pharma now has a cash flow of over a trillion dollars a year, and profit margins that even illicit drug cartels would envy. Asimov, like the 'humble' Imperial garden caretaker and Fletcher, never seemed to be hamstrung by such conflicts. Asimov wrote hundreds of academic texts, many dealing with biochemistry, and his depiction of Trantor evidences his intuitive understanding of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systems_biology.html" title="Systems biology">systems biology</a>. At the macro systems level, Asimov recognized Trantor's unlikely capacity for supporting an inordinately large population, and that the concrete and steel straightjacketed seat of a galactic empire would necessitate the outsourcing of agricultural support from twenty worlds. At the micro level, there is a verisimilitude with the compound cumulative effects of vaccines, which a number of scientists have shown to be inextricably associated with <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoteny.html" title="Neoteny">neotenized</a> neurological development -- short on carbon based compounds and long on alkaline metallic compounds, resulting in the overbuild of relatively simple neurological infrastructures at the expense of the complex enzyme mediated superstructure necessary for a more normal sequencing of neurodevelopmental events. Asimov would understand that, just as he would understand that what you two have been doing, by substituting the gracile spam of orthodox dogma in the place of robust content on the scientific insights of dissenters, is tantamount to injecting the Wiki with the equivalent of <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjuvant.html" title="Adjuvant">adjuvants</a> that, if unchecked, would cause the equivalent of arrested, neotenous neurodevelopment which is characteristic of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a> disorders. Say what you will, but Asimov would look askance at this AfD, just as he would look the same way at the deletionism that you two relentlessly push, and he might even compare your efforts to the lead-poisoned elite of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, upon whom he modeled the rulers of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decadence.html" title="Decadence">decadent</a> Trantor. No small irony there, given the poisonous effects of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metals.html" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a>. Indeed, Asimov portrayed the Imperial garden caretaker in reverential terms, and undoubtedly would have compared Fletcher with the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardener.html" title="Gardener">gardener</a>. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 00:52, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Trantor had to fall (if only to allow for a trilogy). For it to do so, Asimov made it depend upon shipping in of food (the sums really don't add up) It is a plot device. Real life is less pliable, and in particular, causes do not derive from the result desired.

<li>Added comment: searching PubMed for "Fletcher P vaccine" gives no results. Googling for the same combination only results in hits from blogs describing his testimony. Do we need a page on every person who ever testified for an English court? Some may characterise him as "eminent scientist and high ranking authority on vaccines", but this is not quite borne out by generally used indicators. Oh, and since when has the autism epidemic spanned the globe, and what is the source of the statistic that "untold thousands of UK children [who] have become autistic and developed <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_enterocolitis.html" title="Autistic enterocolitis">autistic enterocolitis</a>"? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 19:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ombudsman's patronising attitude is typical. I'm better at searching medline and google than you, Ombi. Really. And using the quotes had occurred to me. In fact, your search yields 384 results, all from secondary sources and none giving proof that Fletcher has published anything of use in the field of vaccination. Since his testimony he's an "expert".

<li><b>keep</b>: An eminent scientist and high ranking authority on <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine.html" title="Vaccine">vaccines</a>, Fletcher has shattered the illusion that the medical establishment is united in its refusal to acknowledge culpability for triggering an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> that spans the globe. For political and economic reasons, other medical authorities have been entirely unable to regognize and acknowledge the global catastrophe caused by <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_injury.html" title="Vaccine injury">vaccine injuries</a>. Simply because the bulk of Fletcher's career predates the advent of the internet, there is no reason to assume his contributions to medical science are anything less than extremely noteworthy. Fletcher is noteworthy not only for the prestigious position he once held overseeing vaccine policy in the UK, but also for breaking ranks with medical authorities loudly and clearly as an expert on vaccine issues, and his statements have been reported around the world. Beyond that, he was chosen as an expert witness and played a primary role in the high profile UK lawsuit on behalf of the untold thousands of UK children who have become autistic and developed <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_enterocolitis.html" title="Autistic enterocolitis">autistic enterocolitis</a> following vaccination. He presented reports, inexplicably ignored by the court in its decision to derail the litigation, that supported the clinical evidence and observations by thousands of parents "that a triple vaccine (MMR) was causally related to the damage suffered by the children." Fletcher has been quoted widely by journalists around the world who have covered the <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">vaccine controversy</a>. Ironically, Midgley himself has said the only thing that he dismisses about the case presented on behalf of the children and their parents had to do with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> concerns.<a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7472/939#80648" class="external autonumber" title="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7472/939#80648" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> However, the only expert testimony in the case where such concerns could easily be dismissed would be that of a retired vaccine expert and recognized authority, such as Fletcher. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 18:02, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> One of the things about courts, at least English courts, is that very little of what they do is <i>inexplicable</i>. Hardly any of it is even unexplained. It isn't always trivial to obtain the actual text of the explanation, but it is perfectly clear here that the Legal Aid Board had the opportunity to consider Dr Fletcher's comments, and decided, in the light of that and the other avaialable elements of the case the bringing of which was proposed, that the case was hopeless - hence their explicable decision to not fund it further. That case has been funded IIRC to around £10M from public funds already, and I think that it was reasonable to pay to bring such concerns to law, but it is not reasonable to go on and on and on. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 18:21, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

In fact, there is more biographical information in that newspaper article than on Peter Fletcher (for example, he was Chief Scientific Officer in the 1970s). Further, the original text of the page is extremely emotive (e.g., "In early 2006, Fletcher reignited the smoldering MMR vaccine debate", "political firestorm"), and seems incongruous with the evidence. The Daily Mail article was published on February 5, and appears to have triggered fewer than 10 other articles in a month <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=peter+fletcher+mmr&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;scoring=d" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=peter+fletcher+mmr&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;scoring=d" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which does not fit with "reigniting" a debate. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 22:43, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>As noted above, Fletcher's career pretty much predated the internet, so the article was originally, and will be, a little more difficult to flesh out. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 17:39, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>His career certainly did pre-date the internet. However, while it's possible that there is no information on the web about him is because of that, it could also be because he was not particularly notable. One of those news articles suggests his tenure with the Department of Health was not very long. Perhaps the best defence you could make for this article would be to find some actual biographical information and evidence of notability. If he is notable, 20 minutes in a public library should demonstrate that. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 22:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps either the cast list should be on that page, or there should be a list of such people with a brief note against each of why their involvement ins interesting, and a brief note on the page of the comon features. As given thus far, the former notes would be very short, and the latter could be quite short as well, not least since it would not need to repeat the contents of the other pages. I know WP is not hierarchical, but these people have not been presented as articles about individuals, rather as examples of a corps. My own stylistic preference is actually for a little box to one side of a page or section, giving the capsule for a person referred to. It is a very different if one wishes to discuss his scholarly papers, taste in Claret, role in medical service development, the furniture in his restored Georgian house in the Home COunties, the difficulties of financing a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_building.html" title="Listed building">listed building</a> or civil service <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pensions.html" title="Pensions">pensions</a> none of which instances are at all specifically relevant here.<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 14:13, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Fletcher is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">not notable</a>. This article is just another attempt by Ombudsman to spread more anti-immunisation idiocy around wikipedia. <i>WHY</i> hasn't Ombudsman been banned for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">using wikipedia as a soapbox</a>? Ombudsman is just as bad as John Gohde (who will be back in little over a month after his year-long ban, what fun!), but Ombudsman makes admirable use of a thesaurus, and he's certainly got his foot in the door now with his countless POV edits on vaccine conspiracies/autism conspiracies/9-11 conspiracies/you-name-it conspiracies.

<dd>Don't go. TO be fair though a senior civil servant <i>could</i> be notable. WHat is clear is that he is not notable for anything listed in the article, IE the article is not about him, nor is it to inform. I think Ombudsman is the antithesis of an encyclopedia autor, and although the WP credo offers a hope that by uniting thesis and antithesis we might achieve synthesis, I think it would be simpler and more effective to dispense with Ombudsman.

<li><b>Aside</b> Clifford Miller whose comments are in the BMJ rapid - but not <i>published</i> - responses referred to above, and who I had commented on, is one of the candidates for being the User:86.10.231.219 whose <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.10.231.219_17ac.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.10.231.219">contributions</a> and history are somewhat consistent with that idea and whose IP address is geographically adjacent to the address Mr Miller gives. (He is probably not notable, but is certainly persistent. Unaccountably, the college he examined in law at had forgotten him when I enquired of them, but I do not for a moment doubt that if they searched all their records they would eventually find him.)<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 18:29, 7 March 2006 (UTC) Restored after Ombudsman edited my comment into something he preferred to respond to.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've seen Wikipedia articles for people who own ad agencies, not to mention creators of favorite anime. The bar for who is notable enough to be included in Wikipedia is not all that high. This is a professor who obviously has a following. He seems to be important to supporters of alternative medicine, so mobbing on this for deletion could be considered a political/ideological action. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPansophia_6cf6.html" title="User:Pansophia">Pansophia</a> 02:00, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>This is a professor</i>. As this is apparently intended to be a biographical article, and you have a source that suggests he is a professor, shouldn't that be included? --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 02:42, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is just another attempt by Midgley to remove information that is inconvenient for his opinion.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is ad hominem, untrue, irrelevant to this, and part of a spree Leifern has gone on using WP as a platform to attack me. Leifern, are you sober? Please see my more detailed remark on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Boyd_Haley_93d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Boyd Haley">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Boyd_Haley</a>. This sort of thing is certainly against several WP policies, but is there any actual remedy to be applied in real time?
