<p>Well the New Orleans area is being run by unsung heroes. There is a service group headed by Bossetta called YRNO (Youth Rebuilding New Orleans). There have been several articles in the Times Picayune about this. YRNO has spread to other catholic schools other than Jesuit.

<p>I thought the point of Wikipedia was to be the source if none other were available. Bossetta exists, YRNO exists, and peolpe who know Bossetta are the ones who will spread the word about him. If you are supicious because the article is humorous in some ways, then that can be toned down. But everything in it is true. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.227.149.242 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.227.149.242.html" title="User talk:68.227.149.242">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.227.149.242_5608.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.227.149.242">contribs</a>) 23:25, July 14, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I'm sorry but you seem to misunderstand the "point" of Wikipedia.

<li>I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding here. Yes, you copied the text and added citations showing where you copied it from. The <i>problem</i> is that it is illegal to copy text like that <i>even if you say where it was from</i>. You have to write your articles yourself: you are not allowed to copy any text at all, except in the form of short quotations, which must be clearly identified as quotations. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:38, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sufficient to verify that they exist? Sure. Sufficient to verify things like <i>Orange Star tanks are M2 Bradleys and M1A1 Abrams, Blue Moon uses old Soviet T-34s (arguably 34/76) and Cold War-Era T-80s or IS3s, Green Earth sticks to Jagdpanthers and Jagdtigers/Sturmtigers while Yellow Comet relies on ancient French FT-17 models and old Soviet KV-2s</i>?

<li><s><b>Merge</b> into something. It's gotta go somewhere. As the original author of this article, I'd be inclined to say keep, but I have really no way to justify a keep, and too many people are saying delete to sway consensus to keep.</s> <b>Keep</b> When writing it, I tried to make it not be a game guide by using as little statsitical info as possible (which was eventually added in and later removed). The thing with video game articles is, the source is pretty much always the game, especially when talking about the actual game itself. Since apparently electronic media can't really count as a source (which I guess is understandable), most game articles have to include content such as reviews or things like development history, with "valid" sources such as books, web links, magazines, etc. that count.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/a/k/User%7EGakon5_821a.html" title="User:Gakon5">Gakon5</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/k/User_talk%7EGakon5_4f71.html" title="User talk:Gakon5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gakon5_24c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gakon5">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Add comment:</b> I'd like to point out two reasons why I think this couldn't be considered a game guide, and thus should be kept:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Accesability: What I mean is, even if you had never played Advance Wars you could still get something out of it; and if you did it's basically all stuff you learn from just looking at the unit summaries in-game. Heck, it really has little value to someone who's familiar with the game's units already; the article has very little in the area of solid tactical strategy (some spots, such as the Recon section, do have some game guide-ish things in them).</li>
<li>Little statistical info: At one point in this article's lifespan tables with statstical info about each unit were added in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Units_in_Advance_Wars&amp;oldid=39816848" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Units_in_Advance_Wars&amp;oldid=39816848" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> I later removed the tables on the grounds that Wikipedia is not a game guide. I think at that point it had probably crossed the line into game guide territory (although there was still very little in the way of things such as game strategies). The article basically just provides a general summary of what each unit does (ie it shoots this, it's more powerful than this, etc).</li>

<dd>Since the article begins by connecting the issue to sexual abuse, it's hardly an article about "professors and students sometimes date each other". Mary Kay LeTourneau used the same techniques, as do other predatory teachers. (I've revised the article to include relationships with underage students.) The "Mother-father figure" outlined on the <a href="http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/TypesOfHarassers.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/TypesOfHarassers.html" rel="nofollow">SHS Types of Harassers</a>page would be a good inclusion here as it outlines how these types of personalities operate. I think the article should stay, but be expanded upon to include the effects of such relationships, the psychology of the teachers who engage in the behavior, and all information should be sourced.<a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a> 00:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually the direct sexual abuse connection is one of the statements I have a problem with, since there's nothing <i>inherently</i> abusive in a teacher-student relationship. It's good that you're interested in the subject, but maybe there should be a more general article, or subsection of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abuse.html" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a>, dealing with power differentials in general. This title is a total neologism and the article history has more removals of dubious content than additions of good content. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 01:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Good point, and one that should be added as there are some good student-teacher relationships, and even some happy marriages that have come from student-teacher relationships. A move to sexual abuse would be very appropriate for the type of behavior that this article is <b>really</b> discussing. Either way, if the editors decide to do this move or not, I volunteer to flesh out this section myself, using good source material, and there is quite a bit of it. <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a> 01:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep,</b> legitimate topic, move to better name, mark for cleanup and as needing references. The first thing that came to mind when I saw the title was the novel (no, I haven't read it) <i>Professor Romeo</i> by Anne Bernays. Anne Bernays, apparently a redlink, was the daughter of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Bernays_21ec.html" title="Edward Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>, and her novel was a bestseller in 1989. In fact, Bernay's novel got <i>two</i> reviews in The New York Times. One of them speaks of "an old and familiar analogy: that teaching is a surrogate love affair, a complex form of seduction. Throughout history (remember the <a href="../../../p/a/o/Paolo_and_Francesca_3457.html" title="Paolo and Francesca">Paolo and Francesca</a> affair) there have been teachers who have taken that analogy all too literally. So on occasion the professor or tutor has been the Don Juan, doing with the body what he (or sometimes she) hopes to do with the mind. Universities are always strangely erotic as well as intellectual communities. That, presumably, is why they have become one of the principal battlefields in the gender wars of the 1980s."

<p><b>Deletion nomination</b> Here's the reason I gave <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Ultimate_Sitcom" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Ultimate_Sitcom" rel="nofollow">the first time round in March 2006</a> which ended in no consensus: "This is a list from another one of those trivial cheap-to-make "list of the best" TV programs - typically a collection of clips and talking heads of B or C-list celebrities. It has no real authority. Wikipedia shouldn't have an article for every "list of the best" produced out by these tv programs or by popular magazines." Same this time around. Though I want to add in <a href="../../../l/27/e/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier.html" title="L'esprit de l'escalier">L'esprit de l'escalier</a> (I was distracted and neglected to pay much attention at all towards the end of the first afd) a response to what during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Ultimate_Sitcom" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Ultimate_Sitcom" rel="nofollow">the first afd</a> was JJay's reply to my rolling out the rating figures for this program (ratings which I believed to be not very impressive). JJay found those ratings to be impressive and said that we have articles for most of the other programs mentioned in my excerpt. I would now point out out that the one-off show The Ultimate Sitcom's (1.5m viewers) closest peers Get Famous, Get Fit, Get Rich: Celebrity Fitness Videos ... Exposed (1.3m viewers) and Larger than Life - Eating Themselves to Death (2.1m viewers, a program about obese people who can't stop eating) still do not have their own articles, and I hope they never do. The only argument I see coming from the keep voters in the first afd was "the program was probably seen by a huge number of people". There are many trivial programs on TV which get low ratings that still translate to large numbers of people but are insignificant by encyclopedic standards. This is a one-off clip show which is one of these programs. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a comprehensive survey of industry insiders. It's just the group of insiders (including actors, not just writers) who agreed to be on the show.

<li><s>Keep</s> I agree that it needs extreme improvment in style, syntax, references, etc., but speaking as an expert in the field, this topic is completely different than any mentioned that could include it. <s>It could be expanded to include the history of the marketing decisions made, the impact on Intel, the problems that it caused compared and contrasted to the benefits it provided. Basically it is a completely different computer platform of its own.</s> Another article already exists and is well referenced. There isn't anything to merge that is referenced. To avoid any POV fork, etc., if the other article can be improved, then there isn't any reason not to simply do so. I am changing my vote to <b>Delete</b>. Ste4k 22:24, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Neither of the reasons for deletion given in that section apply here. The article goes beyond merely defining the neologism (although I would like to see it go a bit farther). Also, it is not an attempt to track the emergence and use of the term itself, but provides an (admittedly brief and incomplete) treatment of the subject itself. Furthermore, it is already used by reviewers (i.e., (i) experts writing in (ii) popular media) and is thus doubly well-established and not a neologism. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 13:11, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I meant to link to the next section, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html#Reliable_sources_for_neologisms" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO#Reliable sources for neologisms</a>, to show that the presence of "pulp noir" on the Internet, even its use by film critics (Ebert notwithstanding) is not grounds for an article on Wikipedia, which was your previous assertion. A reliable source is needed, and no one has provided proof that in <i>Cornell Woolrich from Pulp Noir to Film Noir</i> (the current article's main secondary source), a book about Woolrich and his writings, pulp noir means anything other than <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulp_fiction.html" title="Pulp fiction">pulp fiction</a>, in this case <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardboiled.html" title="Hardboiled">hardboiled</a> crime fiction. The uses on the Internet you link to seem to reflect this: that pulp noir is hardboiled crime fiction, in literature or film, nothing more. The past and current versions of the article indeed define a new term (see <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#What_is_excluded.3F" title="WP:OR">WP:OR#What is excluded?</a>), one meant to indicate a "sub-genre" of film noir, and there is no <b>reliable</b> source to support this. The article only finds instances on the web where the term is ascribed to <i>something</i> when the WP:NEO policy reads:</li>

<li>Ahhhhhhhh-hah. The last sentence. Now I understand your objection. Perhaps explaining this in the nom would have stopped the keep votes. And although the quality of writing has improved and it is better sourced, tt is now a list of uses and thus tracks the term's emergence, rather than discusses the subject itself. Oh, well.

<li>Okay, have to chime in here since I am responsible for the rewrite (not the original article, I might add). First, I want to address Jonathan F's issues. You can see my Talk page for his full "review" of my edits. I removed the Renzi reference completely since it seems questionable and I admit I misinterpreted what the book is about from the excerpts I have. I have only selected readings from the book, back from a film class I had. If someone has the whole book, maybe they can add it back later if any of it applies to this article. I also rewrote the lead paragraph to more accurately summerize the context of this term as I found it in the other references. As for Jonathan F's other point, I accept it as a valid argument but I disagree that this is a neologism to begin with. It is for this AfD to decide that point, and I still recommend keeping the article. I think "neologism" implies that the term is specialized within a certain community or interest group, but my references clearly indicate widespread usage across different communities and in reliable media. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 14:20, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> I think it is indeed a different topic. I recently created a disambiguation page because "2+2" redirected to "Two plus Two publishing". I think the original AfD came before I did that cleaning up of redirects and disambiguations. [EDIT: In response to question 2, the article mentions several vehicles which specifically include the term in their model name.

<li>Why do you believe it to be notable, Mr. Vader? Because it was awarded a not particularly notable award by the "alternative" weekly press publication that sponsored the event? It looks like that is the only year they seem to have given out that award. Do the winners of their "Best Drag Queen Award" also need their own articles? Aside from this award, I don't really see any of assertions of notability, unless you count the "one of the largest festivals of it's type in the US", which is both unverified and vague. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:58, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi again. More notability evidence: Here's another mention of HZ in the City Paper, the second paragraph of which confirms other press the festival has earned: <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/music/story.asp?id=8280" class="external text" title="http://www.citypaper.com/music/story.asp?id=8280" rel="nofollow">2001 city paper reference</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first two years drew press attention from fringe-oriented music magazines such as Cadence and The Wire, but the fest also won the notice of more mainstream outlets such as The Washington Post and National Public Radio's All Things Considered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, City Paper is an alternative press weekly, but I doubt it's lying.</p>
<p>To confirm the Washington Post references, please visit the <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/search.html" class="external text" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/search.html" rel="nofollow">archive search</a> and type "High Zero" in quotes, or use <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/results.html?st=basic&amp;uid=&amp;MAC=50a23aa1f3f5c6104e90e36051420d61&amp;QryTxt=%22High+Zero%22&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON" class="external text" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/results.html?st=basic&amp;uid=&amp;MAC=50a23aa1f3f5c6104e90e36051420d61&amp;QryTxt=%22High+Zero%22&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON" rel="nofollow">this link</a></p>
<p>Notability of performers: In 2005, <a href="http://www.efi.group.shef.ac.uk/mminton.html" class="external text" title="http://www.efi.group.shef.ac.uk/mminton.html" rel="nofollow">Phil Minton</a> performed (<a href="http://www.highzero.org/2005_site/the_musicians/index.html#minton" class="external text" title="http://www.highzero.org/2005_site/the_musicians/index.html#minton" rel="nofollow">listing in performers</a>) and directed a Feral Choir at the festival. He's internationally known as a vocal improvisor who has developed extended vocal techniques since the seventies. If you web search his name, you'll come up with a variety of mentions on jazz sites, sound art sites, and listings in discographies.</p>
<p>On the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_festivals.html" title="Music festivals">Music_festivals</a> page, observe that many genres (Jazz, Reggae, Country Music, Dance, etc) have festivals with articles in Wikipedia. However, the avant-garde genres are lumped together (Electronic/Electroacoustic/Experimental/Industrial/Noise/Sound Art) and only given links to outside sites. This may be a case of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">Systemic bias</a> against these genres.</p>
<p>While editors may consider certain avant-garde genres obscure, their communities and musicians pursue them with as much dedication as in more popular genres. The material may be obscure to some music listeners, but is not a danger to wikipedia. It helps maintain a comprehensive representation of music across stylistic boundaries.</p>
<p>Thanks for the welcome. The quality of my writing will hopefully improve with practice. --<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavelite_0fb1.html" title="User:Ravelite">Ravelite</a> 01:49, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> A few points:
<ul>
<li>the evidence you cite for notability needs to be included in the article</li>
<li>you are free to edit the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_festivals.html" title="Music festivals">Music_festivals</a> page to change the layout and links. It's less likely to be systematic bias than lack of interest in these categories from previous editors.</li>
<li>Lack of notability isn't a deletion policy (see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). Personally I have a bias against deletion in cases where the article has an active champion unless it fails other tests, as it can be demoralising for editors to spend a lot of time on an article just to see it swept away (regardless of the advice not to be disheartened). Where a notability policy does apply, as with <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> we should apply it, but it seems a shame to remove articles on non-policy grounds when notability is arguable. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 11:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There can be a fine line between explanation and promotion though after perusing the article I do not believe it has crossed into that territory. Save some minor adjustments that should be made the piece stands on its own and the content, quality of writing and expression is of a commendable calibre. I refute entirely the concept of notability so this is a moot point IMHO. At the end of the day the individual has been influential in particular circles and his views appear sufficiently different from theological Gnosticism that a separate article elucidating these is hardly excessive or indulgent, so the article should stay.

It would be the final decision. Here is a quote from FEWiki: "A major factor in the decision to start the FEWiki is the increasing amount of Fire Emblem content becoming available on Wikipedia. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is supposed to provide detailed information about almost anything, but the amount of non-encylopedic Fire Emblem content there was getting beyond a joke. And thus it was decided to create this wiki dedicated to Fire Emblem, to allow that sort of content and more." <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Decimus Tedius Regio Zanarukando</a> 01:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Many people in the Fire Emblem fandom agree that most of the "archetypes" listed are not really true archetypes. Therefore, not only is it debatable whether it's encyclopedic, but its reliability concerning its subject is questionable. --Kzer-za 02:53, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Much of the content is contentious or outright fabricated. --144.137.32.87 02:55, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep Jeigan (archetype)</b>. "Jeigan" is very much a widely accepted and used term among the Fire Emblem fan base, and while its specifics are debated, the core of its definition is agreed upon. The Jeigan article does at the very least an adequate job of making clear what is accepted by and large universally from what is debated over. However, Character archetypes in the Fire Emblem series is full of partial contradictions to its own wording and defines several terms in a way many would very openly disagree with. It further gives definition to terms effectively never used by even the niche group of the public which it should supposedly be pertinent to, and as such, should definitely be deleted.

<li><b>Keep Nabarl and Oguma sections</b>. Like "Jeigan", "Nabarl" and "Oguma" are also widely accepted and used term among Fire Emblem fans. Nabarl and Oguma are analogous to Swordmaster and Hero.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Basically, everything that's not POV-pushing in that article can be condensed into three or four sentences. And those three or four sentences already exist in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html#Nomenclature" title="Persian language">Persian language#Nomenclature</a>. By the way, the article should surely also describe who <i>does</i> use "Farsi" (e.g. <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a> and other linguists); the lack of such references clearly mark the POV agenda here. And I sense a contradiction: The article implies the problem only became one after 1979, whereas Spectheintro above notes that it had occasioned official declarations earlier, so the problem must have been around for much longer. (Implying that an opposing viewpoint is very recent is of course a well-known cheap propaganda trick of POV-pushing.) <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 05:29, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Re:<a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGaming_King_0455.html" title="User:Gaming King">Gaming King</a> This site isn't unique. There are numerous NDS friend code sites out there. As mentioned below, DSMEET is one of them who had a Wikipedia article deleted. In fact, if I recall correctly, it was the creator of WiTendoFi that asked for it to be deleted. As mentioned in the discussion regarding DSMEET's Wikipedia article, Wikipedia is not a web directory... nor is WiTendoFi a notable enough site to warrant such an article. This article is nothing more than an advertisement for WiTendoFi and as such fails to meet Wikipedia criteria. Even you admit it's only "somewhat important." That's definitely not notable enough to be here.<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisMax_b1e2.html" title="User:NisMax">NisMax</a> 13:58, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Aside from the initial (unsourced) claim that he was "one of the greatest gnostics and spiritual leaders of his time", the article does little to assert the importance or significance of this man above any other run-of-the-mill Islamic scholar. It's actually quite hard to pick out any relevant bits from the article, because it seems to be 90% waffle. Much seems to focus on the achivements and positions of this man's relatives. The subject was politically active in the '60s, but so were a lot of people.

<p>Non-notable biography: the name returns only 26 hits on Google, while "Daniel Koshute" returns only 55. I see no other evidence for notability. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>raves</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RandyWang_7371.html" title="Special:Contributions/RandyWang"><b>rants</b></a></sub>) 08:22, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I whole-heartedly disagree. I decided to look up Dan's bands and make a page on Wikipedia because people ask me about Dan Koshute and want information on him. Everything I wrote on that page is absolutely one-hundred-percent factual. You say it's not a notable biography, but people can't look for him if we don't have something for him. He's done a lot of studio recording and he's an unfathomable talent. He plays with lots of people and does tons of gigs, so people would very much benefit from having a source of info avaiable on Wikipedia. If it gets deleted then there's nothing I can do about that but I will be deeply personally insulted as I put a lot of heart and soul into that webpage. There's no word for it other than injustice. I'll puke if in a year Dan Koshute becomes a popular radio artist and you guys deleted my page on him. How big do you have to be to be on Wikipedia? I know artists with ten well-selling independent albums, but they don't get play on VH1 or Clearchannel, does that mean that no one would want information on them or that they're unworthy of being talked about? I can't concieve of any serious ill that having this informative available would do. It's not a vanity piece what-so-ever since I'm not Dan Koshute and I don't even know him personally. I've just seen him perform. I'm nothing but a passionate fan, case in point see the glowing review I gave to <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/ramblinron" class="external text" title="http://cdbaby.com/cd/ramblinron" rel="nofollow">Rambling Ron Boone</a>. --AboveGroundSound 08:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please remember, I'm not disputing the factual accuracy or validity of any of the information in the article: I'm arguing that Dan Koshute is not a notable enough artist to warrant an article of his own in this encyclopedia. Whether he is famous in a year's time or not is irrelevant, really, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>: we live in the here and now, so we need to look at the situation as it is at present.

<dd>On that note, please don't take offense at these proceedings and their outcome, whatever it may be. They are in no way intended to be a personal insult or slight on your ability as a contributor - I, myself, have had more than a few of my edits reverted and/or deleted entirely. Nearly every long-time contributor at Wikipedia has.

<p>More google results might come up for The Rhodora as far as the many places they play. Though I tried it and it's also the name of a poem. If I merged Dan with pages on The Rhodora and/or other related bands or rising stars would that be any better? --AboveGroundSound 08:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a worthwhile suggestion, but I don't believe that would be an adequate solution. Eliminating various search terms from the above search leaves less than a thousand that don't <i>explicitly</i> refer to the Emerson poem, with an unknown number of those remaining relevant to Mr Koshute. Since The Rhodora's only relationship with the band is in name, they aren't close enough to warrant a page merge as suggested.

<p>Under what condition can I prove that Dan Koshute is currently notable? It's obvious to me based on the amount he's done.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm the creator of the OmniCode, and the test used in the AfD is flawed. It makes the assumption that only English speakers use this, while the community this started with at User Friendly is extremely international. Further, that Google search only finds those whose sole language is English.In addition, a Google search for "omnicode site:userfriendly.org" turns up 17,300 hits, showing the popularity within that community.Searching Google and including the last few version numbers ends up with well over 1000 hits. In any case, I won't argue further the AfD, but votes on this should not be based on the flawed logic of Zetawoof. --<span style="background: #CCEECC;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a></span>-<span style="background: #CCCCEE;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User_talk%7EKickstart70_36c5.html" title="User talk:Kickstart70">T</a></span>-<span style="background: #EECCEE;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kickstart70_b60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kickstart70">C</a></span> 15:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that the criteria being offered as basis for deletion are flawed. The users of the code are multilingual, so a restriction to English skews the search result, and a simple Google search shows approximately 24700 hits. Ayelmar 09:06, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

Unfortunately the list at <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInternet_self-classification_codes_55ab.html" title="Category:Internet self-classification codes">self-classification codes</a> is rather empty.

<li>There is an undertone to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> that suggests that the subject of an article should be noteworthy - not merely valuable information, but information that would be valuable in an online encyclopedia. (To quote the section on abuse of deletion process: "The deletion processes all focus on whether an article meets the criteria for existance on Wikipedia. That is, <i>its subject matter is notable,</i> its central information is verifiable, and it is capable of achieving a neutral point of view with good editorship.") I think OmniCode does reach that threshold and that a deletion isn't warranted, and said as much; other editors believe it doesn't and is. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavyphotons_e8e6.html" title="User:Heavyphotons">Heavyphotons</a> 11:58, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article isn't forward-looking in any way, nor does it meet the "meme" criteria. I fail to understand how the date of the geekcode article is relevant. Fortunately, notability isn't a policy, and probably the meme proposal will fail to become policy also. We must argue this case on its merits, not resort to distortion.

<li>Funny enough, if OmniCode falls under Internet meme, Wikipedia itself falls under Internet meme, too. "An Internet meme (also called an Internet phenomenon) is any kind of media that gains popularity through the Internet." - cite from the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">Wikipedia:Notability (memes)</a> page. Wikipedia is nothing without the Internet, it would not have started, it would not be there, it just spreads via Internet. So, should we AfD <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> then? No, of course not, since both are just *there* and the Wikipedia article is just about that. Both are more. Both are not an Internet meme. About the Chrystal Ball theory - where do you see any "future prediction"?

<li>Let me place this in context. The games list the species of each Pokémon, on a little-used "info" screen that also lists such trivia as weight, height, and color. It's not exactly an important fact in the games.

<li><b>Delete</b>. If this were a list of pokemon by some useful criterion like what real-life species they resemble, it might be useful; I can imagine someone wanting to find "that one that looks like an owl". (Similarly, the colour list could be useful as a way of identifying a pokemon.) But more than half the pokemon seem to have unique and arbitrary species like "longevity pokemon" or "thrust pokemon" that are not actually a useful way of categorising the creatures. So this does not appear to be the kind of list that is going to help people find information, and as such there is no reason to keep it. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 21:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, good info about where I can buy the book - point taken. But nonetheless this is a spam. It is asking you to decide to buy the book and telling you where from. It even lists how much the darn thing costs. If I look up 'Gone with the Wind', I can find a lovely article, but not that I can purchase it from Amazon for $9.95-. If the article contained detailed info about what the stories were about, then maybe. But as far as I can see, this is spam, pure and simple. Of course, the great thing about AfD is that I'm simply asking for a Delete. Everyone can have their say etc. Please vote for a Keep if you disagree that the article is spam.

<dd>Better, but it is still encouraging people to buy the book, i.e. spam. I would vote to keep if the article simply indicated who published the book, when it was published, a synopsis, the contents (which is currently fine), critical reviews maybe etc. Place an external link for the company who published. Unfortunately, IMHO, the last section 'why you should buy the book' / 'why you shouldnt' is a dead give away as to why this is still spam. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob-nick_12bd.html" title="User:Rob-nick">Rob</a> 04:08, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Most of the top Google hits seem to be about the musician. I don't see any evidence this term is anything other than a loose blanket term for various scientific, philosophical, religious, et al ideas (possibly) coined by the author of the <i>Wired</i> article. This is reflected in the Wikipedia article, as it's just a listing of articles on such loosely related ideas. At this point, that puts it in the category of uninformative neologism. <a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> 08:00, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This theory is not a generally recognised notable scientific theory. It doesn't meet Wikipedia policy for notability for scientific theories, not having been published in a proper scientific journal.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, the way it is written is almost completely unintelligible, with too much jargon that is unique to the theory the article is meant to explain.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> The deleted article was insufficiently referenced and contained only a few paragraphs, none of which were reproduced in the new article. Since the articles were not "substantially identical", the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Criteria" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">recreation of deleted material</a> criterion does not apply. The current title includes a hyphen because the name of the theory includes a hyphen; see <a href="http://megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf" class="external text" title="http://megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> My original approach <i>was</i> to try to edit the article. However, Asmodeus, DrL and others simply reverted absolutely every attempt to try to make it more legible and balanced, even referenced concerns, as being "vandalism". As they made the article completely uneditable, and even removed tags saying that there was a dispute about quality/neutrality/factual accuracy (when it was empirically obvious there <i>was</i> a dispute like that), this seemed the next logical move: that article is being used as a soapbox. In my sandbox is an alternative, more balanced article following the usual layout for these "disputed theories": if you have suggestions, do add them to my talk page. --<a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 10:31, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Bergenwulf, there are a lot of people interested in the CTMU. Take false and unsubstantiated accusations (e.g., "socks") to the discussion page (or, more appropriately, to the trash). Your attempts to "edit" the article began with the insertion of links to "pseudoscience" and "crank" and escalated to attempts to equate the CTMU with "Creationism". When the other editors wanted you to slow down and discuss changes, you balked (after all that might have taken hours as opposed to seconds) and threatened to call in the moderators. When the moderators didn't respond to your editing emergency quickly enough and you were thwarted in your attempts to insert your anti-Creationist platform (into an article that has nothing to do with Creationism), you threatened to nominate the page for deletion. Interestingly, you started out by saying the article belonged in Wikipedia, just needed a few changes (according to you). So clearly you have used this Wikipedia procedure in a totally coercive manner and because you were unsuccessful with regard to both the speed and content of your anticipated wholesale changes, we now have this page and this debate. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 11:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Anyone who wishes to see the sordid details of this petty little saga is more than welcome to review the history, and the talk pages, of the CTMU, and count how many times I mentioned "creationism" (none). I did go in heavy-handed at first, but I rapidly toned it down. But, as usual, we aren't debating the theory, we are debating the article. My major complaint is that "disputed" tags were just removed, on the grounds that they were "vandalism", and not an empirically true description of a state of affairs. This is soapboxing, and an attempt to take out the fly swatter to squelch critics (a metaphor Langan once used about those who disagree with the CTMU). Why not address the article itself, DrL, instead of me? Do you deny that it is in need of revision? Moreover, while at first I thought the article did merit inclusion, my subsequent reading of Wikipedia policy, guidelines, etc., as well as a consideration of the popular press attention (focusing on Langan, not his "theory") has convinced me otherwise.<b>BTW</b>: should this and DrL's comment not be moved to the talk page as well? I'll leave that to someone more experience than I.--<a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 11:45, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>WARNING REGARDING THE FOLLOWING TABLE</b></p>
<p>The following table has been identified as a confused or dishonest attempt to mislead the Wikipedia community. The problems with it are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Langan is not "discussing" the CTMU in Wikipedia. Langan is the AUTHOR of the CTMU, and is notable in his own right. It is those who wish to dispute the CTMU, or declare it non-notable, who must show their credentials and prove their authority.</p>
<p>2. Again, Langan is the AUTHOR of the CTMU, not merely the owner of a website which talks about the CTMU or which contains archived materials regarding it. This is a very important distinction which the table fails to reflect.</p>
<p>3. Langan did not write the Wikipedia article on the CTMU. Langan is the AUTHOR of the CTMU, the notable, widely-publicized theory ABOUT which the article was written.</p>
<p>In short, the table below is irrelevant or worse, misrepresenting the situation at hand and encouraging the misapplication of Wikipedia guidelines.</p>

<dd><b>Response</b> If you actually think that the CTMU is "nothing but warmed over Neoplatonism", Tevildo, then you obviously have a few holes in your knowledge of philosophy. Similarly, if you think that the CTMU ignores 2000 years of progress in metaphysics, then you should have concentrated a bit more when reading Langan's paper(s). As you probably know, you couldn't even begin to coherently justify either of these assertions. By making this kind of sweeping, unwarranted statement here and now, you're merely encouraging others to vote down an article whose only crime is that it takes a bit of honest effort to understand. By the way, the disputed article contained plenty of links confirming notability and verifiability; they've simply been disputed and tampered with by those who don't appreciate their content. ABC News, Popular Science...come on, give us a break. Either those are reputable sources, or Wikipedia is really just an appendage of academia which limits its sources to a small set of journals under direct academic control. I don't think that's the case, and if you reflect on it for a moment, I think you'll have to agree with me.

<dd><b>Response</b> I think one of the biggest problems with CTMU is that the bombastic and needlessly sesquipedalian language in which it's worded does lend credence to the theory. However, it seems most of the criticism of the theory arises from this single complaint, which says nothing of the theory's validity. Regardless, it has garnered considerable media attention and is certainly noteworthy in that respect. Furthermore, the Wikipedia article provides an overview of the theory which is free of the needlessly sesquipedalian language, and in that respect I also find the article useful. Those who wish to criticize the theory should create a "Criticism" section, not simply request to delete the article. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarcieri_5f20.html" title="User:Tarcieri">Tarcieri</a> 07:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Christopher Langan and his theory, the CTMU, have been the recipients of extensive media coverage. Sources include ABC News, Esquire Magazine, Popular Science, and other journalistic periodicals and television documentaries which seriously investigate and employ fact-checkers regarding the material they cover. Both Langan and the CTMU were featured in virtually every instance. The CTMU is a complex, and in my opinion valid, theory. While some laymen complain that they cannot understand the CTMU, there is no reason to believe that this does not owe at least in part to their own negative attitudes and low level of expertise in its subject matter (logic and metaphysics, with broad implications regarding science in general). While there is no expert consensus on the CTMU, neither has it been found wanting. The theory has been out there for a number of years and is therefore eligible for peer review; if this has thus far been inadequate, that is certainly not the fault of the theory or its author, and does not detract from the theory itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The editor calling himself "Byrgenwulf" appears to be negatively obsessed with Christopher Langan and the CTMU. What began as an offhand attempt to tar the CTMU and its author with misdirected, unverifiable and decidedly non-neutral epithets like "pseudoscience" and "crank" has now seemingly escalated into a full-time vendetta, to the extent that one wonders where Byrgenwulf finds the time to eat and sleep. He appears to have no understanding of Wikipedia policy; even when various aspects of this policy are patiently explained to him, he attempts to restore past edits, or rewordings thereof, which have already been found in violation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although Byrgenwulf has repeatedly claimed that he could effortlessly rip the CTMU to shreds were he so-inclined, he has been caught red-handed in a number of critical errors regarding that theory; and although he claims to have thoroughly read Langan's paper in PCID, he has boldly denied that it contains things which it can be plainly seen to contain (sometimes after falsely stating that he has carefully searched for them). Unfortunately, he appears immune to the sort of embarrassment that anyone else would feel under similar circumstances, merely redoubling his destructive efforts in retaliation. In short, he seems to have no idea what the CTMU is, what it does, how it does it, or for that matter why it doesn't do it (if that is indeed the case), and perhaps for these very reasons, appears hell-bent on sabotaging its Wikipedia entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I understand it, Wikipedia does not consider this to be acceptable behavior for its contributors. I can't speak for anyone else, but I do know that I have better things to do than ride this article 24/7 to keep Byrgenwulf from corrupting it, and to reverse the falsehoods, innuendos, and accusations he nevertheless manages to plant in it against Wikipedia policy. It seems to me that if the Wikipedia moderators were to read this discussion and explore the history of edits, they would quickly verify the truth of everything I've just written, and deal with Byrgenwulf and his accomplices as they deserve. But meanwhile, in apparent denial of this very possibility, Byrgenwulf persists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Needless to say, the personal misgivings and bad feelings of Byrgenwulf et al are not enough to justify repetitive attacks against an accurate, legitimate, and informative Wikipedia entry. And now, to make matters worse, after Byrgenwulf has tallied a string of edits the likes of which Wikipedia has seldom seen, we have an additional flurry of negative edits, dispute tags, and so on, claiming that, for example, ABC News - which repeatedly ran a 20-minute segment on Langan and his theory - is an "unverifiable source". Such protestations are utterly ridiculous. It seems that a tiny handful of critics (or sockpuppets, or fellow travelers trying to strike a blow for their pet philosophy, or whomever) have taken it upon themselves to change history, declare all of Langan's media coverage one big "unreliable source", pretend that the CTMU was not mentioned in those articles and television segments, and so on ad nauseam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This article was carefully reviewed for verifiability and NPOV well prior to Byrgenwulf's initial incursion. It was one of the best sources for a lucid overall introduction to a unique and arguably very promising theory which has nothing whatsoever to do with Creationism or "Intelligent Design Creationism" but merely had the misfortune to be published in an ID-sympathetic journal. In fact, as its author states, the theory was intended to give both sides of the evolution debate a common framework for ultimate reconciliation, something which is very badly, and very obviously, needed by all concerned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I therefore vote for NON-deletion, and request that the moderators do something about the situation ... preferably sooner rather than later. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 15:49, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep - DO NOT DELETE</b> The CTMU is a valuable intellectual contribution which has been erroneously, and in my opinion foolishly, targeted for attack on philosophical and opinionative grounds. It's not easy to understand without the proper background, but that means absolutely nothing, since the same can be said of many of the other legitimate theories covered in Wikipedia. For anyone who knows the relevant technical fields, it displays adequate conceptual integrity - probably far more than the vast majority of what one encounters in the paradox-ridden field of analytic philosophy and the modern philosophy of science - and is unquestionably unique in both form and application. On the other hand, if you can't understand it, then why not do everybody a favor and leave it up for those who can? [By the way, I think it's important that voters know that this vote has not been presented by a "professional philosopher of physics", as Byrgenwulf claims to be on the discussion page. On searching the web, I got a couple of hits on "byrgenwulf". One of them leads to a registered contributor on an anti-ID website. In his personal bio, this person describes himself as a 22-year-old college student from South Africa. Now, while I grant that this may not be the Byrgenwulf that is currently wreaking havoc with the CTMU entry, it is highly probable on orthographic grounds alone (not to mention that he lists "the philosophy of physics" among his interests). This tells me that Byrgenwulf is probably not a professional philosopher of physics, as he claims to be, but just another college kid, perhaps a first-year grad student, drunk on the seemingly boundless knowledge that he has greedily guzzled from the brimming well of academe, no doubt including an introductory course on modern philosophy which devoted almost an entire class period to Godel, whose writings Byrgenwulf has egregiously misapplied to the CTMU (see discussion page), thus displaying that he understands precisely nothing about it. Personally, I find this perfectly consistent with his puerile behavior and the kindergarten level of his criticism. So much for the motivation behind this up/down vote.] <a href="../../../a/s/m/User%7EAsmodeus_3d16.html" title="User:Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> 16:54, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep - Do Not Delete</b> - Its controversial nature is already noted in the article itself, and the text of the article reinforces this notice through the use of Langan's name throughout it. I don't know why the author's carefulness with regard to highlighting the controversial status of the CTMU through the body of the article itself should be held up as a strike against both it and him. What has not been noted in the argument over this article is whether or not <i>Progress In Information, Complexity And Design</i> is a peer reviewed journal, regardless of what institute publishes it. If McDonald's, for whatever reason, began publishing a peer-reviewed journal of mathematics, its mathematical contents would still be peer-reviewed. I don't know why complaints which amount to a request for recategorization have to take the form of a motion for deletion. As far as the jargon issue is concerned, the external links should supply the needed information. I would, however, advise that the link to the "20/20" interview be removed, as its text is somewhat inconsistent with the content of the CTMU itself. --Danielmryan 18:08, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> To present the CTMU as correct, we would indeed need references of other than these two types. The question at hand, though, is not whether we are to <i>assert</i> the theory, but whether we are to <i>describe</i> it. To verifiably and justifiably describe the CTMU here, we need references to (1) its claims, and (2) its notability. The references in the article satisfy these requirements: Langan's writings provide his claims, and the mainstream media coverage establishes notability. (<i>Popular Science</i> focuses <a href="http://megafoundation.org/CTMU/Press/PopularScience/PopSciArt.pdf" class="external text" title="http://megafoundation.org/CTMU/Press/PopularScience/PopSciArt.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> specifically on the CTMU, and other articles describe both Langan and his theory.) <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 22:51, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Hogwash.</b><br />
Mr. Smith, you stated, <i>"The question at hand... is ... whether we are to describe it."</i> Only if it is something <b>notable,</b> which apparently it is not (see big, red letters below). Wikipedia is clear that it is <b>not</b> an indiscriminate collection of items of information. I might <i>describe</i> my grandmother's theory of Quasars, and she might have even been featured in <i>Bluehair &amp; Fitness Magazine,</i> but that hardly makes her ideas Wiki-worthy.</li>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><b>THE POPSCI ARTICLE SEEMS TO BE A FORGERY</b></font><br />
Mr. Smith, you (and the CTMU article) seem to rely heavily on the PopSci article "Wise Guy," by John R. Quain. But something fishy is going on here: The "archived" PopSci piece - ostensibly the best Langan-independent citation (read: the only reference to an outside "scientific" periodical) - is quite different <i><b>from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011015064515/http://www.popsci.com/science/01/10/14/brainiac/" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20011015064515/http://www.popsci.com/science/01/10/14/brainiac/" rel="nofollow">actual, archived article</a>.</b></i> As you know, archived web pages from the <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayback_Machine_934e.html" title="Wayback Machine">Wayback Machine</a> have been deemed as <a href="http://www.researchtheworld.com/CommentariesVersion6.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.researchtheworld.com/CommentariesVersion6.pdf" rel="nofollow">admissible in court</a>, so I tend to think the Wayback Machine's archived version of the PopSci piece is what PopSci actually printed, and the megafoudnation-version of this PopSci piece has been manipulated.<br />
Briefly, the <i>real</i> "Wise Guy" article makes <b>no mention</b> of "Robert Seitz, a physicist and former NASA executive," who "admits that he 'doesn't fully understand Langan's theory,'" and who goes on to say Langan is "'perhaps the smartest individual'" he's ever met. Indeed, the <i>real</i> "Wise Guy" article <i><b>does not even refer to the CTMU.</b></i> It does, interestingly, recount Langan's interest in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_chicken_or_the_egg.html" title="The chicken or the egg">The_chicken_or_the_egg</a> dilemma.

<li><b>Comment</b> on a few issues here. Claiming that the CTMU is philosophy and not science is an attempt to hedge the issue. It is not the case that "science" has standards while "philosophy" is a wishy-washy field where anything goes. The CTMU claims to be a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_everything.html" title="Theory of everything">theory of everything</a> (a physical concept), and claims to offer a new <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">interpretation of quantum mechanics</a>, and has a notion of "conspansion" which contradicts much of what the mainstream scientific <i>and</i> philosophic community acknowledges relativity to be. Moreover, all the popular press articles are about <i>Langan</i>, the originator of the concept, not the CTMU itself. They may mention the theory, but they are not about it. As such, these articles and references can be put on Langan's bio page. And besides, the nomination has nothing to do with whether the CTMU is philosophy, sophistry, science or pseudoscience. It is about the <i>article</i> as it appears here, and whether or not it is an encyclopaedic article.--<a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 21:04, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response to Comment</b> Caveat emptor. Byrgenwulf needs to tell the truth for a change - he attacked the article, and proposed this vote, because he's an anti-ID fanatic who baselessly disputes the content and quality of the CTMU, a theory which he doesn't even begin to understand. There's a record of this on the discussion page, where Byrgenwulf fraudulently intimated that he is a professional philosopher of physics and then proceeded to make elementary errors that no expert in that field could possibly make, and which have now been seriously compounded. In fact, the article IS encyclopedic, or at least was before Byrgenwulf took it upon himself to monkey it up. Indeed, it had been carefully reworded to comply with NPOV and was provided with all of the verifiable source material it needed. All that Byrgenwulf is doing here is attempting to win the game, and get rid of the article, by propagating pathetic misconceptions about science and philosophy that a freshman in English Lit wouldn't lay claim to, thereby polluting the air and muddying the waters as is evidently his habit. (Anyone who thinks that Byrgenwulf knows the first thing about philosophy or science, let alone Wikipedia policy, need merely take a stroll up this page to be disabused.) As far as Byrgenwulf's specific comments on the CTMU, conspansion, and theories of eveything are concerned, forget about them - he has repeatedly been shown not to understand the first thing about the CTMU or anything related to it. <a href="../../../a/s/m/User%7EAsmodeus_3d16.html" title="User:Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> 01:00, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The <i>Popular Science</i> article cited appears to be on the CTMU and not on Langan himself. It even includes a quote by a physicist and former NASA executive who (without passing judgement on its veracity) considers the theory worthy of "serious and open-minded review". While I have reservations on a theory presented in such a jargonized manner, many accepted theories have been presented in that fashion, too, unless or until someone good at explaining the theory comes along (a la Schwinger versus Feynman on QED). The CTMU may turn out to be total garbage, but it has received sufficient press and is a significant part of a high-IQ subculture surrounding Langan. <a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> 07:11, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That article is titled "Wise Guy"! It is a less-than-two-page article mainly about the person and his theory. It is <i>not</i> an article about the theory, such as one might see in a serious journal, like one of the Physical Reviews. This is nothing like QED: it hasn't shown up anywhere in the legitimate scientific community, or any any reputable journal. It only has a handful of popular articles that, if they are not mostly about the person, are initially started because of the novelty of the person's IQ. The opinion of an <i>ex</i>-NASA "executive" who appears to be involved with the person somehow ("the smartest guy I ever met") doesn't really make the subject notable. The fact that the "executive" apparently doesn't merit his own Wikipedia article and doesn't show up in the first few pages of Google results makes me question the word usage of Popular Science writers, and makes the support even less important. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 08:21, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

In fact I am quite leary of it. It is only my steadfast commitment to open-mindedness that does not allow me to reject it until I get around to serious analysis of it. Which is precisely why I'd like to see a Wikipedia article (not written by Langan) on the CTMU: so I have a decent overview of the theory to look at. Anyone else wanting to know about it would find such an article useful, too. So, if the article is flawed, then fix it, don't delete it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The mainstream media attention has been directed at Mr Langan himself (mainly due to the incongruity between his IQ-test scores and his line of work), not to his theory. I agree that he, as a person, deserves a Wikipedia article, but not that his theory is notable in its own right. The existing description of the theory at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Michael_Langan_7c4b.html" title="Christopher Michael Langan">Christopher Michael Langan</a> might be capable of slight expansion (emphasis on _slight_), but I don't believe it deserves its own article, especially when any attempts to edit that article are repeatedly over-ruled by certain individual(s) who seem bent on preventing it reaching an unbiased state. If the version of the article on Byrgenwulf's user page could be safely used, then, although I would still regard the article as superfluous, I would have no objection to its retention. However, I don't believe that we can ensure its integrity. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 11:05, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Byrgenwulf's first edits were "admittedly over the top" (his words) and made for a poor entrance, leading other editors to believe his motives were political and less than sincere. I did delete many of his edits but mainly because he was pushing them through too quickly. I repeatedly asked him to slow down and discuss edits on the Talk page first and indeed thought we were negotiating changes to the Controversy section, but I guess we weren't moving quickly enough (it was taking hours as opposed to seconds). He is not the only editor on Wikipedia and should know enough about Wikipedia etiquette to negotiate changes more slowly and reasonably with the other editors and readers. He only came upon the page, and Langan's work, a few days ago. Shouldn't one spend a little time absorbing the material before editing any article on Wikipedia?</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What you are suggesting (that the article be retained but it be Byrgenwulf's edit) is coercive, whether or not you mean it that way. While some clean-up may be in order there was not much wrong with the article as it stood when Byrgenwulf came on the scene (or, indeed, when Tim Smith originally posted it). Further, Byrgenwulf's version is misleading on many points. For example:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is categorized under "pseudophysics" and "pseudoscience". This makes about as much sense as categorizing a Brahms concerto as pseudoscience because it doesn’t follow the "scientific method". The CTMU is a logical model that is not claiming to be empirical science. Such categorization is designed to lower the perceived credibility of the work.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The CTMU has close ties to the Intelligent Design movement." Here, "close ties" implies political involvement and I see no evidence of that. What I see is an openness on the part of ISCID toward Langan's ideas and a response to that from Langan by submitting his material for publication. After all, he may perceive himself cut off from mainstream academic venues due to his lack of degrees and see ISCID and PCID as an opportunity for at least some level of peer-review. If you read his chapter in Uncommon Dissent, he clearly criticizes aspects of both ID and strict neoDarwinism (mostly in terms of limits of interpretation).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"While not being of quite the same order as the time-cube, the CTMU can nonetheless be categorised as pseudoscience." By even putting a concept in the same sentence as "time-cube", you are eroding credibility. Again, the CTMU is erroneously categorized as pseudoscience.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"This is an intelligent design journal, the content and nature of which has been the subject of a large amount of criticism by mainstream scientists, including in US courts. This is because these scientists feel that the journal lacks impartiality and rigour in its editorial policies[1]. As such, any paper published in this journal cannot be regarded as being part of established scientific thought.[2]."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that PCID is an ID journal is fair enough for inclusion but this rant against intelligent design journals should be contained in the article on PCID or ISCID, not here! This proposed text links to two footnotes featuring anti-Creationism material. What on Earth is that doing here? The CTMU has nothing to do with "Creationism". In fact, I would expect that Creationists might not care for the CTMU at all. I feel that Byrgenwulf's motives are political. His dogged insistence on the inclusion of these two articles is odd and it almost seems as if he has been given this material along with instructions to push it whenever he has the opportunity.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>These are some of the most glaring errors and the points I was hoping to be able to negotiate with Bergenwulf. It would be nice if they could be fixed, but I expect that there is an underlying political agenda here so I don't hold out much hope. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a></dd>

<blockquote>
<p>A cross between John Archibald Wheeler’s Participatory Universe and the Stephen Hawking-James Hartle "imaginary time" theory of cosmology proposed in Hawking’s phenomenal book A Brief History of Time, the CTMU resolves many of the most intractable paradoxes known to physical science while explaining recent data which indicate that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate.</p>
</blockquote>
. This seems to indicate that it is <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmology.html" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a>: philosophy doesn't deal in expanding universes or "conspansion", really. And, a bit of a slip up here, the Hawking-Hartle model wasn't "proposed" in Hawking's pop science book, but in Phys. Rev. D28, 2960 (1983). <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 18:03, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> You know, I hate to seem impatient. Really I do. But if you don't stop it with these howlers of yours, I may end up climbing the walls of my office. Let me spell this out for you. The only kind of theory capable of "resolving an intractable paradox of physical science" is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables. Say that one of your college professors were to ask you whether this new theory is "scientific" in the same sense as the scientific theory which generated the paradox. You just answered this question "yes!" But unfortunately for your grade point, the answer is "no". By definition, the paradox has been generated BY a theory of science; in effect, one train of scientific reasoning is slamming into another within a single theory (or conjuctive set of theories), with no chance to avoid the collision. Hence, one needs a metalanguage of that scientific theory (or set of theories) to resolve it...a higher language in which the trains can be re-routed and the collision avoided, with one train passing around the other. Sometimes, it may happen that we can extract falsifiable observation statements from this higher-level theory and thereby construe it as science in its own right...a higher level of science than passed before. Otherwise, it remains interpretative and therefore philosophical. But no matter which way it turns out, the theory remains valuable for resolving the paradox. So here's an extra-credit question for you: given that you call yourself a "philosopher of physics", why don't you appear to understand the first thing about your field of "expertise"?

<p><b>Comment.</b> The mainstream media coverage is about both the person and the theory, and features the theory prominently. <i>The Times</i>, for example, begins its article (Wigmore, Barry (February 7, 2000); "Einstein's brain, King Kong's body") with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every age has its great thinkers: Plato looked at metaphysics, ethics, and politics; Descartes tried to rebuild human knowledge; Bertrand Russell gave us mathematical logic; from Stephen Hawking came <i>A Brief History of Time</i>. Now there's Chris Langan, the brainy bouncer, with his Cognition-Theoretic Model of the Universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>20/20</i> uses the theory as a framing device:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...I found arguably the smartest person in America in eastern Long Island. [...] His name is Christopher Langan and he’s working on his masterpiece: a mathematical, philosophical manuscript, with a radical view of the universe.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000818083819/http://www.abcnews.go.com/onair/2020/transcripts/2020_991209_iq_trans.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20000818083819/http://www.abcnews.go.com/onair/2020/transcripts/2020_991209_iq_trans.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Popular Science</i> header says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He's a working class guy with an IQ that's off the charts. What does he have to say about science? Everything -- a theory of everything, that is.<a href="http://megafoundation.org/CTMU/Press/PopularScience/PopSciArt.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://megafoundation.org/CTMU/Press/PopularScience/PopSciArt.pdf" rel="nofollow">[46]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The caption of the article's photo reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christopher Langan spends his downtime coming up with a solution to a problem that philosophers and scientists have pondered for thousands of years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the CTMU has not just been "referenced in at least one major mainstream publication" as the proposed <a href="../../../f/r/i/Wikipedia%7EFringe_theories_37ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Fringe theories">notability guideline</a> for non-mainstream theories requires, explicitly allowing "large-circulation newspapers or magazines", but has received prominent, attention-getting placement in many such publications, with circulations in the hundreds of thousands or millions.

If you were asked to prove that Langan is a "random individual" or the CTMU "a flight of fancy", you could not offer a single verifiable source. In fact, you'd find material indicating that Langan is decidedly non-random - indeed, several deviations above the mean in intelligence - and that there are clearly written, publicly available papers regarding the CTMU. You would also find reportage on Langan and the CTMU from verifiable sources like ABC News and Popular Science.</dd>

<li><b>Holy Megalomania, Batman... 52 Times!</b> It’s a Vanity Article<br />
<i>Wikipedia: “Vanity information... can come in the form of an entire article... Such information usually detracts from the direct illumination of the central topic of any article.”</i><br />
The CTMU article seems to focus more on Langan than the <a href="../../../c/t/m/CTMU_a520.html" title="CTMU">CTMU</a> itself. <b>In fact, the word “Langan” appears <i>52 times</i> throughout the article;</b> "CTMU" only 34. A quick check of other Wikipedia articles shows this figure is highly unusual: “Twain” appears in <a href="../../../h/u/c/Huckleberry_Finn_28f2.html" title="Huckleberry Finn">Huckleberry Finn</a> 14 times; “Gates” in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> 27 times; “Hawking” in <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawking_Radiation_62fd.html" title="Hawking Radiation">Hawking Radiation</a> 21 times; “Einstein” 19 times in <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Relativity_1cb0.html" title="Special Relativity">Special Relativity</a>; and the word “Darwin” appears in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> 12 times. <i><b>Pathetically, in the CTMU article, each of the words “for,” “as,” and “in” appear fewer times than the word “Langan”!</b></i><br />

<dd><b>Response</b> Now, now, no need to try to impress. Most university instructors do not allow Wikipedia articles to be used as a references, precisely because they are too often found in error; hence, you are not citing verifiable sources, and even if you were, you'd need to prove them relevant. But of course, you can't; otherwise, as a conscientious Wikipedia editor, you'd have done so already. Right? Now, I personally don't care whether you think the topic of the article under dispute is "bunk"; that plus a dollar will get your windshield wiped at 5th and Lex (maybe you'd like to start a blog about it). But when you say the CTMU is "just plain wrong" in a forum like this one, you incur an editorial burden. You can either meet this burden or you can't; personally, I'd bet a grand you can't, and that you can't understand the paper you say you read either. But that's neither here nor there. The fact is, if you want to talk this way, you need to put up, or clam up. By the rules of Wikipedia, we can't simply take your word for things when making editorial decisions; believe it or not, you're not sufficiently notable for that, and probably not sufficiently knowledgable either. You need to verify your sources, just like all the plebes. <a href="../../../a/s/m/User%7EAsmodeus_3d16.html" title="User:Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> 01:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> I have plenty of energy these days, so don't worry about it. You seem to be saying that the article is poorly written, but at this point, it has many authors. So we can't exactly blame the original author for that. As nearly as I can determine, the article was (prior to all the pseudoediting) faithful to the material it covers, albeit highly condensed. Maybe, if it stays up, I'll add my bit. But meanwhile, we have to be careful not to make statements about the theory we can't back up with reputable, verifiable sources.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It is true that my primary focus has been article deletion. My fields of expertise are relatively well-represented on WP at this time, and so I have felt that my time and resources are better spent contributing to keeping WP free of articles that violate its standards (and defending those that do). I am not a sock of any of the actors in this issue (or any other accountname, for that matter). I have no personal stake in the article's fate. For what its worth, as full disclosure, I think the theory is a lot of pseudo-scientific claptrap cobbled together by its creator in an effort at one-upsmanship versus the physics community. <i>But even if my opinion is proven true</i> in future, that does not mean this topic is not appropriate for inclusion. It has generated mainstream media press and no small amount of critical discussion, all of which makes it a plausible searchbox entry and a notable topic. WP is about documentation, NOT validation [[[User:Serpent's Choice|Serpent's Choice]] 05:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC) edit due to failure to proofread own post]. Theories that got it wrong are still worthy of encyclopedia space, especially in an encyclopedia with only the vaguest of space limitations.

The idea seems to be that if there is to be criticism, it is to be entirely on the theory's proponents' terms, and no-one else is allowed to make substantive changes to the article without the proponents' prior vetting, while the proponents may write whatever they like there (even the "reception" section they have belatedly decided to include is grossly slanted). WP is neither a soapbox, nor has the theory itself (as opposed to its creator) earnt much noticeable attention. And while DrL is quite happy to class "conspansion.com" as a crank site (which features an idea either stolen from Langan or which Langan stole or some other sordid little saga), she is adamant that the CTMU does not have a "disputed science" infobox attached to it. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 09:38, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - ScienceApologist deleted 80% of the article after another editor (not me) had just spent an enormous amount of time setting references. Editors should really respect the work of others. Editing implies constructive changes, not sweeping deletes. That is really all that the CTMU article editors are looking for in an article cleanup. No, a "disputed science" infobox is not warranted. If there is a "disputed philosophy" or "disputed model theory" infobox, one would still need to verify the nature of the dispute (i.e., that it was from a reputable source, content-driven and not political) and that such a dispute was beyond the normal controversy and discussion that goes hand-in-hand with new ideas (and old). The page should not make any claims regarding empirical science, but discussion of the nature of science is fair game (it is part of the philosophy of science). Yes, it's true that I labeled conspansion.com as a crank page because it is void of meaningful content and more than likely put up by a Langan detractor just to bug him.

<p><b>Comment.</b> Haven't seen this many socks since my last trip to JC Penny's. I just read the main article's description of "Expansion QUA Contraction," and had to laugh. No offense, guys (sic), but I'd bet plenty of people on psychedelic drugs have come up with more convincing "alternative" explanations of e=mc2 than this one.&#160;:)</p>
<p><b>Keep.</b> It meets the notability requirements. Whether or not it is currently accepted by a majority of philosophers, what one considers to be "gibberish," whether one personally accepts the theory, what one's philosophical persuasion is, and what one's opinion of a theory's author is have little to no relevance here.68.122.147.181 05:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If the artcle does have notability and critism outside of bar bouncers or their apologists, the article should stay. I am not a sock, I am an apologist for Berkley Idealism; neither opinions affect me unless I see the argument in real time. I can see this becoming a vanity decision (purely based on the number of socks) deleted on that basis. There is no need for paragraph after paragraph of debate. All interested editors have expressed opinions now (Disregarding ppl who have socked). I can only see what i see now, but it would make it very difficult to decide other than a delete. With the original editors continually rejecting rewrites - a blatent <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. Without allowing other editors to edit text what is the point of the article? Blog it somewhere. With constant RV of critism sections the article it is a shambles.</p>

<dd>If the primary problem is that efforts to make the page acceptable and inclusive of appropriate criticism are being reverted with prejudice to the improvement of the article, then that is a reason to escalate to dispute resolution, rather than a reason to delete. Indeed, given the widespread sockpuppetry (as well as allegations of the same) and divergence from the topic in this AfD, that may well be the best course of action in any case. Any acceptable version will quite probably require protection. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 07:58, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment to closing admin.</b> The CTMU article was created in September 2005 and proceeded peacefully and largely unchanged until last week, when it erupted in controversy. Since then, the article has seen over 220 edits, over 140 of which were during this AfD. An edit war has waged for the whole course of the AfD, with users inserting and deleting huge blocks of text on less than a moment's notice, and reverting each other just as quickly. The size of the article has ranged from 9 KB to 27 KB, the number of sections from 7 to 12, the number of references from 5 to 12, the number of footnotes from 0 to 42. The version of the article that is now protected bears nearly no resemblance to the one originally nominated for deletion.</p>
<p>The AfD discussion itself has obviously also been chaotic. It is filled with one-edit users and IPs, loud accusations of forgery, a large anonymously-added table, personal attacks, irrelevant debates about the validity of the theory, an anonymous user having a conversation with himself, and so on. Many of the reasons given as justification depend crucially on which transitory version of the article the user saw: a user dissatisfied with 5 references might have approved 12, a user calling the article unverifiable with 0 footnotes might have accepted 42; a user calling the 27 KB version gibberish might have found the 9 KB version more understandable.</p>
<p>In short, it is impossible to extract an informed decision from an AfD conducted during an edit war of this scope. At this point, the only option I see is to close with no consensus. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 04:23, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

(It does have a cow on top, and I'm not sure if Wikipedia has ever deleted an article involving a cow on top of a building, if that counts for anything.) <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 13:49, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, if there were an overall article which talked about a number of buildings which looked like shoes, ducks, snowmen, etc, then this could be merged into that one, but we don't have such an article. From doing a google search, it looks like this is indeed referred to as "mimetic architecture". I've added mimetic architecture to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">Wikipedia:Requested_articles</a>, but unless anyone wants to write such an article in the next few days, I can't see how we can keep this. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 23:26, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

WP:MUSIC goes on to say that in this case "...it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such...", but I'm not sure if a redirect is usable here since another member joined a different group (Firecracker 500) which I think has an album or albums and may also be notable. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 13:40, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Google Test (using <i>"alien technology corp"</i>) gives 20,000+ hits. Among them (without doing an exhaustive read), there seem to be "multiple non-trivial published works" by independant sources. Though this isn't a rigorous test of Criterion #1 for corporations, it shows that Alien Technologies at least comes pretty damn close at worst. The article should be improved per Zos above, and I do think the listing of the Board should be removed as non-notable. Additionally, the exhaustive listing of "investment partners" should be removed as non-notable (as far as Wikipedia is concerned) and replaced with a prose section on <i>major</i> partners of significance outside the walled garden of RFID tech.

<li>Saxifrage, could you cite a Wiki policy regarding your note? Why does it has no bearing? Specifically: <i>"These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus."</i> StanMan 20:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those policies guide what we may <i>write</i>, not what we may write <i>about</i>. I can't cite you any policy because there is nothing in the deletion policy about this. It doesn't mention bias because bias isn't relevant to the deletion policy. The closest I can find that even mentions the difference between what problems warrant deletion and what problems warrant fixing-by-editing is the second paragraph of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>:

<li>An article being edited by a biased editor doesn't fall under inclusion criteria, verification policy, or copyright policy. Furthermore <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">User:Bschott</a> is not the sole contributor to the article, only the most recent of many according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alien_Technology&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alien_Technology&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">article's edit history</a>. Even if he was, that would not warrant deletion. Consider an example: if the sole contributor to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<li>No one is scapegoating you. Editing an article on a character you created is a violation of a Wikipedia standard itself (the vanity guideline mentioned above). This article also doesn't cite any outside sources other than the stories themselves. If no other sources exist, then it violates the verifiability policy mentioned above. Has it occurred to you that maybe your character just shouldn't have an article? It isn't as if Wikipedia has a ton of articles on fan fiction characters. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 13:23, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm well aware that Wikipedia hasn't many fanfiction characters, but just because Chuck Bodgers exists in fanfiction does not mean that he is a fanfiction character himself. I have written other stories in which he appears solo, as well as in my own spin-off science-fiction series <i>Dash Daring and the Starchasers</i>. I think it unfair that I give up most of my time writing such a thing, and the largest internet encyclopedia in existence refuses to recognize the characters' existence due to a violation in its' rules and regulations. As much as I respect these rules, I think it a little unfair how my work should be put under pressure in such a situation. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrablogger_6f54.html" title="User:Crablogger">User:Crablogger</a> 7:24 18 July 2006 (GMT)

<li>Are you sure about "pressure"? It could just be that you didn't know a lot of Wikipedias' rules when you created the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.35.227.148 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.35.227.148.html" title="User talk:82.35.227.148">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.35.227.148_86bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.35.227.148">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. 92 distinct Ghits, which includes a few mirrors and USENET archives. This total may be somewhat fluffed since it seems there was a BBC cartoon character of the same name (which <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrablogger_6f54.html" title="User:Crablogger">User:Crablogger</a> seems to indicate his creation is taken from). No notability stated or implied, in particular no third-party non-trivial articles about the character. The BBC site doesn't list the cartoon at this point. Please note I do not dispute the character exists, that is not the issue. In fact, if the character is based on the BBC cartoon, there maybe copyvio issues. I request wiser heads cogitate on the last point, thanks. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 13:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the lot of them. Any article which starts "...particularly at the website, The Bucky O' Hare Fanfiction..." doesn't have a frog's leg to stand on.

<li>Alright, I give up. If we can't come to some agreement over it, then I don't see the point in carrying on this arguement. As long as we agree that the character does exist, but the information is too sketchy for an article, then I am satisfied with that. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrablogger_6f54.html" title="User:Crablogger">User:Crablogger</a> 7:21, 19 July 2006 (GMT)</li>

<li>Unfortunately that reference doesn't help. I"m not disputing that melted/grilled cheese on toast is a specially known national snack. I am asking (and I think Nae'blis is too) for sources showing that <i>unmelted</i> cheese on toast is a specially known national snack. The "Griller Thriller" slogan of the British Cheese Board suggests that their cheese on toast <i>is</i> melted, as you don't need a grill just to make toast with non-melted cheese.

<li>It should help. It and the further reading section of the article contradict the article's assertion that cheese on toast and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_rarebit.html" title="Welsh rarebit">Welsh rarebit</a> are two different things. What you <i>should</i> be looking for are not sources showing that unmelted cheese on toast is a specially known snack, but sources showing that cheese on toast is actually in any way distinct from <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_rarebit.html" title="Welsh rarebit">Welsh rarebit</a> — as has been claimed, but for which no sources have been cited, and which is contradicted by the sources that actually are cited. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:36, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Either <b>Delete</b> or <b>Keep</b>. The distinction is that Welsh Rarebit is a cheese/spices paste(made out of shredded chedder cheese that's put in a blender with butter, milk, spices, and other ingredients) that is heated into a liquid cheese sauce with a texture+taste somewhere between American white gravy and American nacho cheese, while cheese on toast is simply a slice of cheese(any type) put on a slice of bread and toasted. I don't know whether the latter is notable enough for an encyclopedia article, but if it is it deserves its own page or a section under <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese.html" title="Cheese">cheese</a> or something.

<li>Oxford English says Welsh Rabbit is "A dish consisting of cheese and a little butter melted and mixed together, to which are added ale, cayenne pepper, and salt, the whole being stirred until it is creamy, and then poured over buttered toast: also, simply, slices of toasted cheese laid on toast". Maybe we could <b>merge</b> bits of the Cheese on toast page into Welsh Rabbit rather than just delete it if that's the consensus...--<a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavie78_5eb5.html" title="User:Cavie78">Cavie78</a> 14:24, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Currently we have solely two Wikipedia editors' say-sos, and <i>no cited sources</i> to say that cheese on toast is in any way distinct from Welsh rarebit, whereas we have three sources that say (or at least imply) that they are the same.

<li><b>Comment</b> The size/importance of a mall that determines notability on Wikipedia has been debated for quite some time on AFD. The NC list seems to be pretty fleshed out, more so than other states. I created lists for a few states (but not NC) that actually survived AFD a few months back (back then most of them were redlinked), but as most of them have articles created about them, I think they can be replaced with categories if needed. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 17:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Do not redirect. The phrase is wrong and the translation is wrong.

<li>Interesting, looking around the web, I see both versions attributed to Suetonius, though it looks like a lot of entries were copied from each other. Maybe I'll see if I can track down an actual Latin text somewhere.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<b>Delete</b> As far as I can tell, this article describes original research by Bowers that has never appeared in print. I do think that this is worthwhile mathematical research performed by trained mathematicians, but I don't see that it fits the mission and policies of Wikipedia. Bowers' web page is an appropriate place to share this research with the world (and by setting up their own installation of mediawiki, the authors could transfer these page to UniformPolytopeWiki without much difficulty).</p>
<p>Here is my assessment of the literature. I was unable to find Bowers' name on mathscinet. I was able to find some papers by Norman in the 1960s on uniform polytopes. There is a vague promise at <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/polycell/uniform.html" class="external free" title="http://hometown.aol.com/polycell/uniform.html" rel="nofollow">http://hometown.aol.com/polycell/uniform.html</a> that a book by Norman on uniform polytopes will be published by Cambridge press, but Google returns no other information on the book. There is no indication that the terminology here will appear in the book. That page claims it is currently “<i>the only place in the world where you can find this information!</i>” which supports the claim that the work on uniform polytope classification falls into the wikipedia original research category.</p>

<li><b>Strong oppose</b> (I de-prodded and I'm not Bowers). First a little history about this article. As part of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyhedron.html" title="Polyhedron">Polyhedron</a> pages we developed a set of templates to allow the same information to be repeated in various pages to eliminate mistakes with the many technical data on the polyhedra. For these templates we needed a short key to represent each of the polyhedra. Originally I devised my own system but another user <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomruen_a194.html" title="User:Tomruen">User:Tomruen</a> suggested that we use Bowers acronyms instead, which were a considerably more established system. So the templates were created and it seem natural to include the Bowers names in the various templates, for a while there was a lot of red links until I finally got round to creating the page. The names themselves probably have more relavance to 4D polyhedra or polyclora. Bowers has worked with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform_Polychora_Project_a915.html" title="Uniform Polychora Project">Uniform Polychora Project</a> which also included <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Johnson_d5c1.html" title="Norman Johnson">Norman Johnson</a> perhaphs the most significant figure in recient work on polyhedra. Bowers himself has discovered most of the know Uniform Polychora. His names offer significant advantages over long form names which become very cumbersome when 4D polytopes are considered. As an example of the spread of these names a couple of new Polychora have been discovered by <a href="http://www.geocities.com/stonemason89/scaliform.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/stonemason89/scaliform.html" rel="nofollow">Mason Green</a> and he has used Bowers system for his names. In effect Bowers names are becoming the defacto standard for 4D uniform polytopes, also as discoverer of the polytopes I guess Bowers gets the right to name them. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 18:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

The question is: do you have some good, verifiable source citations meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that shows that <i>sirco,</i> <i>girco,</i> and <i>snic</i> are in reasonably widespread current use today? Do current geometry textbooks that discuss the uniform polyhedra use them now? Why does Google Books, which at the moment is heavily weighted toward recent books, have 39 hits on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22snub+cube%22+polyhedra&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22snub+cube%22+polyhedra&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"snub cube" polyhedra</a>, while a search on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22snic%22+polyhedra&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22snic%22+polyhedra&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"snic" polyhedra</a> returns only the query "Did you mean: 'sonic' polyhedra?"

<li>I don't know what to make of this debate. The acronyms are ACTIVELY used verbally as much as in writing by members of a (nonpublic access) polyhedron email list started by Magnus Wenninger to promote collaboration in polytope research.</li>
<li>Bowers "invented" the names for the purpose of faster communication and a critical mass of active researchers, amateur and professional have supported the clarity of the notation. Certainly it would be good for a print published source for these abbreviations, and it ought not to be the place of Wikipedia to defend or promote these names any more than any others.</li>
<li>Myself I find them a little cryptic, and for polyhedra, prefer a numeric <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertex_configuration.html" title="Vertex configuration">vertex configuration</a>, and I wrote up an article on this notation, taken from a singular book "Geometric Foundations of Nature". It could be equally questionable to defend any specific notation over any other.</li>
<li>Others support the <b>Wythoff symbol</b> which demonstrates the symmetry and truncation form of a polyhedron. They're ALL helpful in different contexts.</li>
<li>For ME, my purpose is to be HELPFUL and do my best to cross-reference names, notations, indices, so these beautiful shapes can be appreciated (As I tried to do in the table <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_uniform_polyhedra.html" title="List of uniform polyhedra">list of uniform polyhedra</a>.) Someone like Bowers, who has spend YEARS of his life carefully documenting these uniform polytopes, deserves recognition, even if a book is never published.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This notation is as valid as any other used to describe polyhedra, whether in a printed book or not. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomruen_a194.html" title="User:Tomruen">Tom Ruen</a> 02:10, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But consider for an instance, subject to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, that the whole world of polyhedra is not one where a lot of traditional publication goes on. People write software to visulise the polyhedra, distrubute the code and maybe write a manual, people write copious webpages on the subject, Hart mentioned in citations for one. People exhibit the polyhedra at various colaqula. They make a lot of discoveries and the word gets out. Probably the most extensivce bibliography is at <a href="http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/references.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/references.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> much of the published work is old, or rehashing old material.

<dd>I believe the criteria that many would apply to these articles is that of mathematics, where publication ususally <i>does</i> occur. This criteria improves wikipedia's quality, especially in mathematics. The charter of wikipedia does not include publicizing new research. I cannot see why some believe that wikipedia is the correct forum to share the research on polytopes, rather than an independent wiki or a journal. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> 15:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The criterion <b>I</b> apply is the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. If "the whole world of polyhedra is not one where a lot of traditional publication goes on" than I'm sorry, but it is not a world whose knowledge is ready to go into Wikipedia. It is not infrequently argued that a certain article should not be subject to the verifiability policy because it is a subject area about which little has been published, but I see nothing in the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy that makes exceptions for such topic areas.

<li>Listing one website does not mean the article is sourced. Nothing is cited in the entire article. Futhermore, I decided to look at the website given and found that most of the article is a direct cut and paste job from that website. As such, I have tweaked my nomination.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Original research" is (for Wikipedia purposes) research not documented by a reliable source. So, OK, I concede the point: Newton does not count as an OR purveyor because his research is (now) documented by a reliable source (maybe a couple&#160;;) ). I still don't think "purveyors of OR don't get in" is a sensible position. If a purveyor of OR is verifiable and notable and meets our other policies and guidelines, who cares about whether any research he's done is documented by a reliable source? But I guess this is probably not what GWO meant (although I don't understand what he did mean), and I feel like I'm derailing this thread, so I'm going to shut up now. —<a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesura_ad40.html" title="User:Caesura">Caesura</a><a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaesura_b24c.html" title="User talk:Caesura"><sup>(t)</sup></a> 00:09, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep at least the large numbers page</b></s> (retract vote, see below). (no opinion on the rest). I cleaned up the large numbers page so that it actually looks marginally presentable to someone seriously interested in large numbers. It may not seem to be all that interesting, until it is reviewed in the context of Robert Munafo's work (see the url in the article Jonathan Bowers' large numbers). The Munafo page is a legitimate and mathematically interesting page, at least to anyone who's read through Conway's <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Numbers_and_Games_c64f.html" title="On Numbers and Games">On Numbers and Games</a>, which is a rather amazing book.

<dd>Retract my vote. On closer inspection, the first section describes the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyper_operator.html" title="Hyper operator">hyper operator</a> (and more or less states that).

<li><b>Keep</b> Appropriate listing of minor characters. When I first read the AfD it sounded like this is a re-organized list of characters who are listed elsewhere (i.e. listcruft). That is not the case, this is actually a piece of the main character list - the characters listed in this article do not overlap with any other lists and most do not have articles of their own. - <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickning1_9f12.html" title="User:Wickning1">Wickning1</a> 19:15, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't see how this is any different than any other character list on Wikipedia. Also, you say it's redundant, but I don't see how that's so.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I'm no fan of Yu-Gi-Oh, in fact, I hate it with a passion. But on an encyclopedic level, if this minor character listing is removed from Wikipedia, it justifies the removal of thousands of other minor character listings from equally notable animes, TV series, movies, books, and more. Considering the article conforms to the standards for listing minor characters, I see no reason to delete this. In addition, one cannot justify the deletion of an article based on its content: if it is a copyvio, one can remove the copyvio, and if it is original research, one can add citations and remove the original research. An article can only be justifiably deleted if the <b>subject matter</b> does not belong in Wikipedia. Otherwise, it should simply be revised. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 21:19, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Here is an article about a colorful figure in US politics, whose activities have been as diverse as they are bizarre. This the sort of article that makes Wikipedia a joy to read. Would Wikipedia be improved by deleting this article? No. Would it be diminished? I think so. Schoonmaker filed to run for President of the US in 2005, and announced in March 2006 that he is running for mayor of Newark, New Jersey. This doesn't make him famous, or important, but given his colorful background, it makes him an amusing addition to the wonderful world of Wikipedia. What value is there having a <b>third</b> AfD just a couple of weeks after the second? If you have nothing to do, you could try <i>creating</i> some articles, or <i>adding content</i>, instead of wasting time trying yet again to delete an interesting article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 18:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Coining "Gay Pride" appears to be his only claim to fame - not enough to be encyclopedically notable beyond a mention and an external link to his claims in the Gay Pride article. The other stuff is just crazy crank one man party politics. I'm sure most crank political parties have pretty interesting manifestos - it doesnt automatically make them encyclopedic enough for their own article though.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. The last AfD's lack of consensus seemed to hinge on whether deletion based on notability was consistent with WP's deletion policy. Personally, I'm not opposed to using notability in such a way, as I see it as an extension of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> criteria. However, I wouldn't be opposed to a mention of the man if his claims of coining "gay pride" could be verified, and its unfortunate that more time wasn't given between AfD nominations to allow for sources to be found and the article to be rewritten. Still, even that wouldn't merit an entire encyclopedic article--if anything, a blurb in the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_pride.html" title="Gay pride">gay pride</a> article would cut it for me, and he's already been given that much. I went back and forth over this (as this comment probably indicates), but ultimately he fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>--even his major contribution, if he made it, isn't "widely recognized" and in fact isn't yet verifiable. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 23:54, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A web forum - the most visited FF forum on the web! According to the webmaster, anyway, and surely she would have no reason to exaggerate? Apparently "Because it was not recorded as it happened, the history of Final Fantasy Shrine is convoluted and difficult to accurately report". So we can't. Oh, but we do! Btw, I have an unsatisfactory life and dress up as a little girl to pleasure myself with my wand of justice. Just with speculation instead of fact. And that sets the theme for the whole article, I'm afraid. It is possible that an article on this web forum might be worth having, not that it matters at all to anyone, but then again I seem to have an inferiority complex, due to my lack of female attention and outbreak of acne. (although a para in the FF article is almost certianly sufficient). Almost all of this, though, is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Who defines what is notable? What constitutes an in-joke? Why should anyone outside the forums care about that anyway? So: I say delete this, redirect to FF and then keep an encyclopaedic para on the forum in that article. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:14, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi! Haven't done this before, apolgise if i don't stick to the correct format. I'm just a member of the forums. Firstly, agree about the in joke and jargon sections, for obvious reasons. One things, though. "I have never come across this one." - that's pretty amazing! <a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffshrine.org" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffshrine.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffshrine.org</a> seems pretty high, almost in the top 10,000, which s apparently a big deal. compare this to &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffonline.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffonline.com</a>"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffinsider.net" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffinsider.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffinsider.net</a>"&gt;big&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eyesonff.com%2F" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eyesonff.com%2F" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eyesonff.com%2F</a>"&gt;fansites&lt;/a&gt;. Those are the biggest three I can think of, and none of them even comes close. It's arguable that alexa is a bad metre stick, but this still accounts for a substantial amount of people. I think the article should probably be trimmed down, but considering its popularity at least deserves a stub. but do what you like, it's your encyclopedia, eh. --83.142.184.86 19 July, just before dinner.</li>
<li><i>Keep</i> but cleanup where appropriate. The site clearly does have a pretty large presence on the web, as can be seen from alexa, bigboards, and even their ranking in google for "Final Fantasy"</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How about no.</b> This is a 100% informative article on probably one of the most active FF Fansites on the web. While a fair few of the general regulars share less interest in the series, there are still very high amount of interest expressed in the Final Fantasy forums. The writer of the article was explaining that the people that post for General Chat have already aired their views on the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>The reason the forum has in jokes, is because a lot of the General Discussion based members are a closely knit community.</p>
<p>I say leave this alone and stop complaining when there is no reason to.</p>
<p>- Lewis, or Rapture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Rapture has said before me, the article is highly informative. The information contained within it can be used by almost anyone, be it a new member to the site looking to find out some history, someone considering joining the site and wanting to have some knowledge of the place to help them decide or even a long-time regular member wanting to reminisce.</li>
</ul>
<p>First off, I don't really see how this point: "I have been a fan for many years and read many fansites, I have never come across this one", can really be seen as vindication for the deletion of the entire article. By that logic almost every article on Wikipedia ought to be deleted because I haven't come across their source topic before. Pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>The next point made for deletion refers to a nonexistent contradiction. Whilst it is true that much of the regular members hold no desire to stage discussions about the Final Fantasy franchise, an awful lot still do and with a steady flow of around 40 members joining everyday, almost without exception to discuss Final Fantasy, the Final Fantasy forums remain a hive of activity.</p>
<p>As for the "who defines what is fact" argument, surely this applicable to absolutely every piece of information on the planet. What is a fact to one person is a lie to the next, and it's just a matter of perspective. And while it's undeniable that there is an amount speculation within the article, everything written has been thoroughly researched, and how is the researched-as-far-as-possible speculation in this article any different from say, the speculation in the Bible entry, and I'm not for a moment suggesting that that be deleted as the information contained in that entry is, like this one, as accurate is can possibly be.</p>
<p>"Almost everything from the Jargon section is part of normal web/game lingo and not unique or especially prominent to FFShrine." This is of course true, but just because there is an overlap between the Jargon section and any sort of web lingo dictionary does not make its documentation any less relevant. These are the most commonly used pieces of jargon on the site and that was what the author was drawing the readers' attention to, and not trying to suggest that there were FFShrine originals, unique to the site or anything remotely like that.</p>
<p>The suggestion that the article is "spam" is clearly incorrect in my opinion. It would be spam if upon opening the article you were greeted with "LOL, JOIN US ON FFSHRINE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!1", or something along those lines. However, the article is presenting the history of the site in an informative manner with there clearly being a lot of effort on the part of the author(s) to keep the article as respectable as possible and totally avoid straying into spam. Or maybe my definition of spam is incorrect?</p>
<p>In all, I see no real reason for the deletion of the FFShrine article, at least not more than I can see real reason for the deletion of almost every article on here.</p>

I don't really give two fucks, tbh. But the fact that you made the effort just to put some tiny article up for deletion and have a bunch of cretins vote on it should give us some indication of how small your penis is. And how often I have to rip into your wife just to keep her satisfied. Leave the fucking page alone, you touchy, over sensitive fuckrag.</p>

<p>No, you should not delete this very interesting and imformative article. Why? Because: Final Fantasy Forums is fastly becoming one of the world's biggest forums based one of the world's biggest thing. With nearly 24,000 signed up members, and a fascinating history that spans for 5 years, people are bound to want to know more about the history of FFShrine Forums.</p>
<p>Anyway Wikipedia has thousands of articles that are only a few lines short! Search Sumatra for example. With an interesting, informative and humourous article, I see no point in deleting this one. A lot of eventful things have happened to Final Fantasy Forums, though I have not been here to see all of them happen. And everyone one of those events brought FFShrine Forums to a closer relationship. We are a very tight community, and if you want to bring us down, we will hold our ground!</p>
<p>What is fact? Well almost everything you hear could be a lie, well at least not the whole truth. People exaggerating to make themselves better, stories or information being passed down and leaving out small bits, non accurate calculations etc etc etc. Not you hear is 100% true. Sit an apple infront of you and say its just an apple is lying to yourself because there is much more than just an apple. There is living bacteria and a whole lot of other stuff there as well. Why i'm talking about apples i do not know. They are healthy ^^ Remember guys 5 serves of veges and 2 serves of fruit a day!!!</p>
<p>P.S Rezo is such a good drawer. Go to www.kiwisbybeat.com The only place you can see his amazing Minus Strips ^^ It is very, very, very very very, very ,very worth your time and effort.</p>

<li><b>Delete contents but Keep page</b> I apologize to everyone who took offense from this page. I didn't create it as an attack page, nor do I endorse or take responsibility for the contents. I agree that the contents are extremely problematic and subjective, and I do not agree with them. It was simply copy/pasted directly from the article <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_08be.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in American media">Ethnic stereotypes in American media</a>, where it has a subheading (I was making independent articles for all the subheadings in the article). I was hoping to create a page where portrayals of Jews in media, literature, news, society (etc). could be explored in a thorough and scholarly way, and where all the pages like <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_american_princess.html" title="Jewish american princess">jewish american princess</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_mother_stereotype.html" title="Jewish mother stereotype">jewish mother stereotype</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice_Jewish_boy_45a9.html" title="Nice Jewish boy">Nice Jewish boy</a> (etc.) could be organized and/or linked to in one place. Would it be possible instead to keep this page as a placeholder but delete all the contents, leaving only links to related articles until better content can be created?

<li><b>Delete</b> the current content as original research, but keep in mind as a good topic for an article someday. As per the talk page, this was a cut and paste from <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_08be.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in American media">Ethnic stereotypes in American media</a>. That page has an original research/unverified warning box at the top for a while. It's had cleanup/NPOV/NOR problems for a while, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_8c0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ethnic stereotypes in American media">survived an AFD</a> that closed July 6th. There was a <a href="../../../e/t/h/Talk%7EEthnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_023a.html#Splitting_the_article" title="Talk:Ethnic stereotypes in American media">short discussion</a> on its talk page with low participation about splitting, and this is one of seven split pages that were started. I think the nominator should have read those explanations before nominating. (Timestamps show they were already there.) Had that been done, the nomination would have been worded differently. Splitting was also suggested by at least one contributor to the AFD of the originating article. As that AFD concluded, stereotypes can be a worthy subject for an encyclopedia article. This content is using "<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotype</a>" primarily in its use as "a form of dramatic shorthand for '<a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_character.html" title="Stock character">stock character</a>'." Natural given where the text came from, but not what we expect to see first. I conclude that it is <i><b>not</b></i> an attack page. It is original research, and not the topic people expect to be seeing under this title. I haven't looked at the other six pages split out to know what should be done with them, someone with time on their hands could go do that. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, this really does qualify for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> at the moment, and the current content should be wiped away. However, I find it hard to believe that there aren't neutral, well-conducted studies and articles on this topic that could be referenced in a good WP article. I only vote "delete" because I think the page, as Drenched's intentions indicate, would be better-handled under another title (perhaps "Jewish Stereotypes in American Media" or something of the like, if it doesn't already exist). It would be a POV magnet to be sure, but it's still a valid subject of interest, and what is Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">if not bold?</a> -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 23:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> without prejudice against a sourced, neutral article. Good idea, poor execution this time around. Usually I'd say just to stub it and take out all the problem material, but that might just encourage malicious reverts. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 17:13, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Question: What does it mean to userfy an article? I think stubbing it and removing the current contents minus the intro explanation &amp; links might be a good idea. Of course, people might vandalize the article or just add their own POV/OR content to it (which will always be a problem for any article about a topic of this nature), but it would also give actual scholars a place to add valid researched content as well. I don't think there would be any malicious reverts though; I certainly wouldn't revert it (and at the moment it looks like no one else has contributed to actual content of this article), and the original authors of this content from the mother page are probably fully aware of OR/citing sources problems. Also, if you look at the original page <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_08be.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in American media">Ethnic stereotypes in American media</a>, you'll see in the introduction paragraph that people were writing about stereotypes with a tone of exposing racial stereotyping in the media, rather than one of maliciously attacking each of the ethnicities, so I doubt anyone would revert an article that sounds racist out of context. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 17:37, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Userfying just means that the artcle's contens were transferred to your userspace, as they will likely be deleted from mainspace.

<li>Okay. Thanks for the good faith effort, but there's no need to keep this page in my userspace if you all want to delete it. I am not very invested in this page; like I said before, I have nothing to do with the contents; I just happen to be the person moving preexisting content, and I have no intention of personally researching this topic further to create scholarly content. I do think that the topic itself is valid and researchable and should have its own article, but I have no interest in writing it. So if you all want to delete it and not have an article until someone comes up with scholarly content, that's fine with me.

<li><b>Comment</b>, my vote hinges on the whether the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_Music_Awards_5236.html" title="Native American Music Awards">NAMMY</a> is considered a "major music award." Right now I'm leaning towards delete; the notability of an awards' recipients does not necessarily make it a "major" award. Considering how little has been written in the NAMMY article in the year since it was created, I'm having a hard time seeing how it would be considered a major award. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 23:28, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>...which was basically wrong, though, understandably, it was honored by sysops twice.

None of this matters except on a honesty level (it is obvious to me that he is in it for the profit, not for the charity. The charity thing is a sales pitch.) Even if he were an honest non-profit though, my vote would be the same. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaner1_0920.html" title="User:Beaner1">Beaner1</a> 11:42, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That's billion percent, not dollar. And, I have seen the shoes. He is selling a pair of shoes for $38 that would wholesale for about $2 if that much. I have seen similar shoes RETAILING for under $5. The company BRAGS about the fact that these shoes are based on the type of shoe that dirt-poor farmers wear in South America. Just how much do you really think that they wholesale for?

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. While counting votes gives a 75% delete count, there were several opinions expressed that this could be a valid topic, and the article has also changed significantly since the AfD so that it is not an advertisement and demonstrates notability (as mentioned as reasons for deletion by some voters). It may be best to give the article some time, and renominate later if it can be shown that it can't cut it in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:09, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b>, the article makes some small claim of notability, and a lot of Ghits for the company ("platespin vmware"). However, I'm reluctant to vote "keep" without confirmation from someone familiar with the industry who can state whether or not the company and/or its product is well-known in that field.

<dd>I'm not saying the companies have a close business relationship, or that any of the products involved share a common lineage, but they're both in the virtualization field. Anyway, my main argument for keeping is that people in the tech industry are writing about their products. Also, for what it's worth, they won something called a "Stevie Award" <a href="http://www.stevieawards.com/pubs/iba/awards/171_1829_12988.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stevieawards.com/pubs/iba/awards/171_1829_12988.cfm" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> - however I admit I'm not familiar enough with this to say whether it's a legit award or merely the equivalent of being listed in a "Who's Who".

If any of the listed guidelines can be met, WP policy requires that this be reflected in the subject's article with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">citations</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> What you wrote is considered here on this earth as slanderous and uncalled for. You are free to your views, yes, but not to the detriment of another, which is clearly what has been written by you, which is why I edited what you wrote. This really shows the kind of person that you are and if you are to call me a vandal it is only because who you believe I am being is a mirror of who you are being. And it seems this assessment is to be so considering if you go to your page here <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> people can read all about your vandalism, thus you are correct, the fact do speak for themselves. I stand by what I have written in all of my remarks here, editing yours and otherwise as again it is free from being about me vandalizing, as I am free from being so, I am merely assisting all souls on this earth. Even you who are here being invited to learn this life lesson or soul remembering through this exchange here. I used to be as you are choosing to be right now, and I am free from this any longer. Thank you for showing me who I used to be and who I am free from choosing to be any longer. Thank you for bringing these life lessons and soul rememberings to me and to all to see and learn, remember, embrace, and treasure. You are a beautiful, wonderful soul.

<p>I am disputing the pseudoscience comment not the author. To consider either claim requires verification, not opinion? I have several websites with observed cellular structures that could not be otherwise seen without nm magnification. www.microscience2006.org.uk/cgi-bin/press_view_details.cgi?press_id=erg49719053 which is the press release at the Royal Microscopical Show at Excel London 2006. www.grayfieldoptical.com - a company who sell the nanoscope and have video records. www.improvision.com/products/rtm/ - who sell the Richardson version of the nanoscope with resolutions down to under 100nm. Yes, as a Graduate Physicist, I was more than sceptical of the claims knowing of the 300nm wavelength resolution limit of light. But there are references from the 1940's where respected institutions (articles available if required) considered there might be ways around them. When my son was diagnosed with Diabetes last month I began to search for causes and a cure. This led to the Rife claims which were initially preposterous. However digging up all the literature (I do mean all including Court Cases!) led to a simple premise. How could he have obtained his images? How could his frequency methods work on Lymes disease where antibiotics fail? ("When antibiotics fail--Lyme disease and rife machines" by Bryan Rosner). There are numerous unsupported claims for his machines but surely the real proof would be to reproduce his high powered microscope? To this end I decided to view the Rife #5 microscope (Ex Dr Gonin of University College, London) to try to understand it better. Hours of research on the internet led to the Erganom microscope of Kurt Olbrich which was synchronistically on show in London the following week! You can see 30nm data spacings on the new DVD discs live. Astonishing! So I think the evidence for optical nanoscopes is very strong. It is also very important that the data on Wikipedia is accurate. Let me know what more evidence is required? If you just think about it for a moment the medical possibilities are revolutionary. At the moment the electron microscope sample has to be dead and in a vacuum. The optical nanoscope allows one to see live cellular phenomena down to viral sizes. I have not put it in this article but you can see the action of cancer causing particles as described by rife. How slightly alkaline blood reduces their mobility. You can also see the destruction of pathogenic cells. Even more importantly you can see where Rife was wrong! With modern equipment you can see viruses evading frequencies and needing multiples, so all in all a remarkable discovery that the world needs to know about. There is even perhaps some mileage in a possible cure for type 1 diabetes. Two patients have been cured using retrodifferentiated stem cells with ongoing research at Cambridge University. I cannot be bothered with the hassle of placing a challenged article but I am following the research closely. There is currently one (yes one!) nanoscope in use in the UK which to my mind could actually show how the body destroys pancreatic beta cells? Is this sort of work important? Of course it is and accurate articles on Wikipedia will help the process.

<p>There seems to be genuine confusion over this new topic. A microscope magnifies to micrometers with a max effective resolution of x2000 limited by wavelength optics. A nanoscope magnifies to nanometers. Most nanoscopes use smaller wavelengths to achieve this (X rays, etc) but this destroys live cells. An electron microscope also shows nanometric sizes but has it's own category. An optical nanoscope breaks the conventional light wavelength barrier and allows the observation of live cells. (At nm levels viruses can be seen). The literature on this subject is sparse (but I will find some) because it is considered impossible in Physics Books. Now you have the logical description of the products? This is not how they are described! The high resolution optical microscopes that show nanometric sizes should then be called nanoscopes. They are not. They are still called microscopes due to their historical method. Confusing or what! The Erganom 500, used at University College, is still called a microscope when surely the correct term is a nanoscope? I take your reasonable point that hard evidence is required before insertion. This will be provided. Thanks</p>
<p>The concept for this nanoscope (which is called a microscope) was developed in the 1970's. Perhaps understandably, but regrettably, it was decided by users that secrecy outweighed scientific knowledge. However letters confirming it's qualities are as below: Institute for Immunology, Witten University, Germany . www.grayfieldoptical.com/microscience/e500/expertise.pdf . Dr Greenberg, University College, London . www.grayfieldoptical.com/microscience/e500/greenberg.gif . Professor Gerd Binning, Nobel Prize winner 1986 for electron microscope . www.grayfieldoptical.com/microscience/e500/Binning.pdf . This is quite good verification but presumably not enough! Let me know what else is required! I will obtain originals if that is what is required.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Also continue reverting the efforts to support this in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Rife_74d0.html" title="Royal Rife">Royal Rife</a> article, and the one on Erganom. A paper in Nature would produce a different response, and if the claims made appraoched performance a paper in Nature would be the least I'd expect out of it. Resolution is a size not a multiplication, there isn't a barrier to "break" and this 2004 discussion is relevant to the devices and individuals involved. <a href="http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.techniques.microscopy/2005-01/0003.html" class="external free" title="http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.techniques.microscopy/2005-01/0003.html" rel="nofollow">http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.techniques.microscopy/2005-01/0003.html</a> It doesn't look to me like ignorance or confusion, it looks to me like an effort to use WP to support a scam for commercial gain.

<p>Fair comment. Please check the latest updates including a verified article from Science 2004 on the work of Dr Brinkmann of the Max Planck Institute on Neurophils. Also there is a letter from a Nobel Winning physicist Professor Binnig. It doesn't come any better than that!? Yes, you are correct there is some laxity in the use of terms for microscopes (or nanoscopes and whatever else they might be called). There is resolution and magnification and how the human eye detects these. Magnification is the multiplication of the original objects size and is often referred to lenses. You can magnify an image on a photocopier but you don't increase the definition, or resolution. The key measure, as you say, is the resolution or the size of the smallest two points that can be distinguished. This is defined in the classic Richard Feynmann Physics text (Lectures on Physics Vol 1:27-8) as distance "d = lambda(wavelength of light)/nxsin(theta). The smallest things that we can see are therefore approximately the wavelength of light", or 400nm. If you can see objects smaller than this then that theory must be wrong? That is the method of science. This wavelength 'barrier' is the limit that has been broken and now allows the observation of live cellular phenomena. Coincidentally it also opens up the new field of electromagnetic medicine to scientific experiments. To me it is more than strange that human and animal electrowhatever phenomena have not been clinically examined. They exist. They are powerful. They are a part of what makes us think.</p>
<p>Quite correctly you question my motives. It's simply the only one you can ever have. Truth.</p>
<p>Is there a real result in these new optical nanoscopes? I think so and appreciate your questions to show evidence. It is not even clear at the moment what they are called!</p>
<p>You might sense that I am pretty well pissed off with the Medical Establishment. My son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes just before his A levels. This marvellous and costly Health Service of ours didn't know what caused it and considered it incurable. Bollocks! Get off your overpaid complacent fat arses and find out why. Do I really need to do it!!!????</p>
<p>I am a trained Theoretical Physicist from Imperial College and have spent my lifetime solving problems that were considered impossible by those too feeble to look. I know the limits of science and nature. You don't get any more fundamental than the observational limits of Quantum Mechanics. Everthing else is just detail, including the human body. I look, and I mean really look with a passion that brooks no obstacle, and I find that a Drugs Based medical establishment oversees most research and is not looking for cures but ways to make billions of dirty dollars. Disgusting. Tell that to a 5 year old with daily injections. Tell that to a Food Industry that knowingly sells products containing damaging cheap products to children. I hope to see the day when it is considered a crime.</p>
<p>I find that a billion sheep with two legs blitley believe the pseudoscience tag of rife WITHOUT the brains to examine it. EXAMINE IT STUPID!!! Simple logic indicates a measurable phenomena. Have a look. Prove or disprove the results. It couldn't be simpler really. As Jeremy Clarkson so aptly says "why are people so stupid and slow!".</p>
<p>You look and find that you can see these phenomena, and it has been known for 30 BLOODY YEARS! F***ing ridiculous!!</p>
<p>Next time you are in hospital just think how many illnesses could be solved by such technology. Then ask yourself what you are doing about it.</p>

<dd>"a trained Theoretical Physicist from Imperial College". Not a lawyer and correspondent in the BMJ's rapid response columns as well by any chance? Physicists were well ahead in moving their references on to the Web, and it would not be surprising to see even a BSc easily giving precise references to Science articles and letters. I'm unconvinced. I'm also unimpressed with either the invective, or the discussion of a child with type 1 diabetes, which as is comonly known was rapidly fatal until Banting and Best sorted out the durg that provides extra decades of life, and is a classic piece of "drug based" medicine now. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 19:33, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think everyone here is completely missing the issue here. Prehaps, it is a crystal ballism listing it as a future release. However, it is a confirmed song that is from a notable album and said song was used in a motion picture<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458352/soundtrack" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458352/soundtrack" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>, as far as I can tell. If this article hinged on the fact of the song being released later on, then yes, this is a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ballism</a>. However, the fact that it was used in a movie, and a notable artist co-wrote it, it appears notable enough to remain up for now. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 04:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> What proof is there to suggest that "Jump" will NOT be released as a single?

<dd>We don't need to prove that "Jump" will NOT be released as a single. You cannot prove that it will be. What you can prove is that it is rumored or expected to be released as a single.

<dd>On further research and reflection, I agree with <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> on this basis: The song is on the album and assuming that it was in the movie as reported, then it is arguably notable. What needs to be addressed is the "crystal ball" nature of the prediction that it will be released in Autumn 2006. The website reference to "Ask Billboard" does NOT say that. It simply says that "Jump" will be the fourth single released from the CD. Find another reference that says that it is rumored or expected to be released in Autumn 2006.</dd>

As someone who's never heard of Zazz before (or Woot), I'm neutral, though the store concept is definitely interesting. If it doesn't survive the AfD, perhaps a small portion can be added to a section in <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woot_%28retailer%29.html" title="Woot (retailer)">Woot (retailer)</a>, and Zazz can become a redirect to there. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransUtopian_743a.html" title="User:TransUtopian">TransUtopian</a> 23:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Despite repeated statements, it appears the company fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for not having the multiple non-trivial citations - the links go to forum posts, the MX article is a reprint of a press release, and the APC article mentions Zazz as one passing mention out of five others, scarcely non-trivial (essentially, one of five places that sell things cheap). And even if I accept one or the other, this fails the requirement of <i>multiple</i> non-trivial published works. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 16:41, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As it appears most people want this article to be deleted, does anyone know of a name for "one item per day online selling" so that an article can be created describing this method of selling? -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 23:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
