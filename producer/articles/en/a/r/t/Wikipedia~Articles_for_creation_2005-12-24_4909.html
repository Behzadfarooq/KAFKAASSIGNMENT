<p>The story begins when the fisherman caught a flounder and it offered him anything that his heart desires. He returns to his wife and told her of his unlikely encounter with a flounder. She then told him to go back and wish for a better house for they live in a small hut and along with it, a garden full of vegetables so he did. and when he arrived home their house was so lovely and there in their backyard were vegetables. but his wife wasn't contented so she asked him to go back to the flounder to wish for a palace and for her to be a queen and so he did but then again his wife wasn't contented she said she wanted to be pope and then pope she had been but then she wasn't contented still and still and in the end she wanted to be god. but the flounder this time hadn't granted her wish and instead it returned everything to what it was before. their house became small and crowded again and they were poor and miserable again...</p>

<p>First proposed in 1977 in their book by the same title by Robert Jewett and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Shelton_Lawrence_0629.html" title="John Shelton Lawrence">John Shelton Lawrence</a>, the American Monomyth is a reiteration of the classical <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monomyth.html" title="Monomyth">monomyth</a> as proposed by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Campbell_2650.html" title="Joseph Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>. Campbell's monomyth described the journey of the hero as one of searching and cultural redemption within a societies moral universe. Jewett and Lawrence define the American version as the journey of an American hero in which normal democratic institutions fail to protect the community and a non-democratic and extra-legal hero saves the community prior to fading into obscurity.</p>
<p>In their 2002 book <i>The Myth of the American Superhero</i> (with Lawrence as first author) and their 2003 book <i>Captain America And The Crusade Against Evil: The Dilemma Of Zealous Nationalism</i> (with Jewett as first author), the authors extend the thesis by using examples from both American popular culture and the American religious tradition, respectively.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the American Monomyth posits a level of cultural belief in American society that helps to explain the desire in American government to "save" the world. This thesis explains in detail why America went to war throughout its history, especially after the events of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001.html" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a>.</p>

<p>Between Lofotodden, Mosken and Værøy, we find the maelstrom of Moskstraumen, a 4-5 km wide area of the sea, which is known to be one of the strongest ‘maelstroms’ or ‘whirlpools’ in the world. This sea is veracious, but also bountiful for fish. It was first described more that 2000 years ago by the Greek historian Pytheas, and later, it was marked on many nautical maps with warnings and dramatic descriptions. None of the other features of the Lofoten have been described with such imagination – and exaggeration – in so many languages.</p>
<p>Moskstraumen and the surrounding sea between the edge of Lofotodden and Mosken is between 40-60 metres deep and substantially shallower than the sea further out in the Vestfjorden. The tides fill up the Vestfjorden twice every 24 hours and the difference between flood and ebb tides can reach 4 metres. The current changes its direction between flood and ebb tides, and the strength of the current varies according to the phases of the moon and the direction of the wind.</p>
<p>The Swedish bishop Olaus Magnus published his Carta Marina in 1539, and published an account of the history of the Nordic People in Rome in 1555, both in which the Moskstraumen is mentioned. The current is described as a whirlwind, which runs to and fro on the sea and swallows large ships and throws them up again! He tells the story of this whirlpool with text and illustrations, and called it 'Charybdis' (see the illustration to the right). The magistrate of the area wrote in 1591 that '…when the current is at its strongest you can see the sky and the sun and the waves because they go as high as mountains…'</p>
<p>These writers write about a sea that yells and thunders like herds of buffaloes over the prairie, ships that are being pulled under and smashed to pieces against the bottom of the sea! Huge whales scream when they have to give in to the whirls of the maelstrom, and the houses shake due to the powerful movements!</p>
<p>Many an author and artist have let themselves be inspired of the Moskstraumen, of them Petter Dass, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Christian Krogh, Edgar Allan Poe and Jules Verne. The latter became so fascinated by the powers of the maelstrom that he let Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus end their journey and disappear in the maelstrom in 'Forty leagues under the sea'. Also the American author Edgar Allan Poe wrote his description of Moskstraumen after having been to Lofoten: '…half screams, half yells and so powerful that not even the Niagara Falls can lift its voice so high up to the sky…'</p>
<p>The people of the outermost villages Hell and Refsvika were the closest neighbour to the maelstrom, and they were annoyed by these exaggerations. They felt a strong respect for the powers of the sea, and adapted their lives, work and journeys after it. But still, the maelstrom took many a victim.</p>
<p>The current was mighty and powerful in its wildness. It was exciting to watch from the shore, and people used to climb the mountains to get a better view of it. Some of them say today that 'Moskstraumen was our TV!'</p>
<p>The village of Helle is a deserted fishing village at the edge of Lofotodden with the maelstrom as its closest neighbour. People have lived here for several hundred years with a population of 60 people at most. They lived off fishing, bird catching, and had a few farms and cattle. They had a school, a public house and a sewing-club. Their relationships with the people of Værøy and Refsvika were close and of great importance. Shipwrecks and losses of human lives were common events, and many a dramatic story took place outside people's doors. The village was abandoned in 1950</p>

<p>I was a member of the US Navy Armed Guard crew on the SS John Dickinson, one of the ships in Convoy UGS-40. On 11 May 1944 we attacked by 62 JU-88 torpedo bombers, several Dornier 217 and Heinkel 111 bombers, plus a 4-engine Kondor FW-200 bomber controlling radio guided glide bombs. This was probably the most massive single air attack against a merchant ship convoy during WWII. The screen of war ships were under command Of US Navy Commander Jessie Sowell aboard USCGC Campbell. The Bermans dropped at least 91 torpedoes and many bombs at us. There were some glide bombs used , also. We shot down more enemy planes than any other Merchant ship convoy, in a single engagement, during WWII. We shot down a at least 22 German planes. There were NO ships sunk, nor did any suffer a direct hit, in the convoy. The Germans broadcast the next day an extensive list of ships they claimed to have sunk and damaged. Roy W.
