<li><b>Keep</b>. Info on the cult accusations have been added to the objectivism articles recently to make them more NPOV. However, there has been a bit of inconsistency between them, and I recently suggested that we create a central article for this controversy to improve the situation. Please do not delete such a needed article; we can always improve it to fit a better standard. If we do delete it, we will only allow the objectivists to get away with making another POV deletion to clean up their cult's image. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:33, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article was nominated before it had a chance a develop. The racism allegation is ludicrous, if the cult had/has little or no African American members, or Hispanics, or Asians, it's <i>not</i> the author of the article who is to blame (but rather the <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vast_Right-Wing_Conspiracy_f756.html" title="Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy">vast right-wing conspiracy</a>&#160;;)). I do however think that the change from "white, young men" to "inexperienced youth" was an improvement.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> On the one hand, I have a philosophical disagreement with Rand's philosophy of self-interest uber alles (Why can't self-interest and altruism ever be merged?) but the article reads as being too POV. I would like to see a source, for instance on the "prohibited books" list that Rand was supposed to have kept. And besides, calling them a cult in the title itself is just asking for POV charges, as it makes them sound like the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Temple_183c.html" title="People's Temple">People's Temple</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat_Payne_b797.html" title="User:Pat Payne">Pat Payne</a> 21:02, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please note that Objectivism's name is POV to begin with. They're hardly objective, despite what their name implies, and that alone is highly controversial.

<dd><i>Comment'</i> Almost every philosophy or ideology's name is POV by that standard, but there never was anything called the "Ayn Rand cult" anymore than there was an Evil Atheist Conspiracy or a <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vast_Right-Wing_Conspiracy_f756.html" title="Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy">Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy</a>. Should we have an article called the Existentialist cult because existentialists allegedly belive that Sartre and Camus are the aribiter of "final truth." Should we pretend there was something called "Existentialist psychology" used for "thought control." (There never was "Objectivist psychology.") Are Hegelians and Kantians also part of a cult? Let's leave the cult term for actual religions, not merely any philosophy with which many people disagree. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 19:37, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Was there ever any controversy surrounding Existentialism claiming it is a cult? Objectivism is unique in philosophy in that not only is it rejected by academia (which makes calling it a philosophy POV as well), but in that there <i>is</i> a controversy over whether or not it is a cult. This is a <i>very</i> <b>real</b> controversy, unlike you hypothetical Existentialist cult; there's actual cited sources in this article to prove it. If Wikipedia were to ignore this then we would have a serious POV problem on our hands beyond anything this article presents. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 22:48, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
