<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was MERGE. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 00:16, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The votes were: 4 keep, 6 merge, 5 delete. Since "delete" was in the minority, I've decided to interpret "delete" votes as meaning "delete or merge". The two positions are in agreement that the information at least shouldn't be <i>here</i>.</p>

<p>Oldest building on campus. That doesn't seem notable enough to me. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">LeeHunter</a> 23:39, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a tough one. Certainly, the university is notable, but is this individual building? There's nothing I see in the article which makes me think it is. Perhaps there are significant events which happened here which made it notable, but if so, somebody's got to put them in the article to make it worthwhile. The age of the building isn't enough in my mind; it's worthy of a mention in the main university article (I assume there is one), but that's about it. The link to <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sather_Tower_c41b.html" title="Sather Tower">Sather Tower</a> makes me wonder if somebody is thinking of writing articles for each and every building on campus. I'm going to call this a <b>Weak Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 00:51, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with campus article. It's a nice building, but not especially notable.

<li>Oh, definitely the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_76d5.html" title="University of Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a>'s <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Hall_0a2b.html" title="South Hall">South Hall</a>, built in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, making it nineteen years senior to the California parvenu, yet only the second oldest building on the historic UW campus. (North Hall is the oldest). South Hall is the headquarters of the College of Letters and Science, a fabulous and colossal entity larger than many other entire universities, proudly boasting thirty-nine (39) top-notch departments and five (5) first-rate professional schools. South Hall is strategically located on the lovely glacial drumlin known as Bascom Hill, within a short distance of the famous Statue of Lincoln and the historic Sifting and Winnowing plaque. In springtime, the grounds surrounding the building afford excellent views of attractive young women disporting themselves on the green lawn. A firebombing during the era of campus protest thankfully left no visible scars on this elegant structure (apart from security mesh on the first-floor windows). Go Badgers! <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:16, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's more the significant bit than whether it's the most famous or not. I'm happy with, say, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Palace_5465.html" title="Winter Palace">Winter Palace</a> pointing to the building in St Petersburg rather than any other Winter Palace, as it is significantly the most famous. Where there isn't a clear front runner in the notability stakes, we probably shouldn't hand out the title on a first come first served basis. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:10, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and delete. There's lots of space for short notes about buildings on the University's own page right now.

<li>Update: Now it's an article about the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> neighborhood of Southall, which has <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southall.html" title="Southall">its own article</a>. This article's like an extra Random Page button.

<li>The current version ought to be merged into <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southall.html" title="Southall">Southall</a>, which is a bit stubby right now, and the UC Berkeley version into that article. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 02:47, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Process Issue</b>. The Southall version rv-ed, as a fork and simply an impediment to the VfD under consideration. (Yes, merge the Southall material into <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southall.html" title="Southall">Southall</a>, and if its advocates want <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Hall_0a2b.html" title="South Hall">South Hall</a> as a redirect (or maybe someday a Dab if a worthy South Hall comes along) they can ask for it after this VfD completes.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The middle-school one also rv-ed, as this title is not suitable for it. (Write an article like South Hall Middle School if you really have nothing better to do, and that will get its own day on VfD.)</dd>
<dd>The question at hand is whether UC's South Hall should have an article, and others for which this name is not the ideal one are irrelevant to that discussion. There is such a thing as a "save" on VfD, a rewrite that turns a deletable article into a keeper, but that requires a rewrite that deserves exactly the title under consideration; articles that might want or deserve redirect or Dab-link from it need not apply.</dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. No evidence that the UC South Hall (already under this title upon VfD) is notable, and the others don't belong under this title (either) and are therefore not eligible as rewrites to "save" it. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 03:29 &amp; 03:37, 2005 Jan 24 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is not paper. Allow this article the opportunity for organic growth. GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 19:23, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
