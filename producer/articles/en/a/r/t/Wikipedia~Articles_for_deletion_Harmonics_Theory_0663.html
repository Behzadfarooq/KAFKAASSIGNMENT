<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>This thread was made more difficult than normal to sort out by the movement of comments and the multiplication of relevant discussions on several different talk pages. I think I finally found all the relevant facts and comments. Taken together:</p>
<p>I count 12 clear "delete" votes in this discussion, 7 "keep as is" votes (but four of them have to be discounted as anonymous or very new users), 2 explicit "keep only if rewritten", 1 "abstain" and 1 that was too ambiguous to call. In addition, 4 users took the time to separately endorse the "Sandbox" version.</p>
<p>My own investigation is confirming the original allegation that the theory remains "original research" at this time. It has not met Wikipedia's standard of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verified</a> external sourcing. A great number of web-based links were provided and were dutifully researched by several Wikipedians. The results were ambiguous at best. Two of the people who reviewed the links concluded that they actually worked against the author's claims.</p>
<p>The original author has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the Sandbox version and has created a Sandbox2 version. This makes it seem less likely that it will be possible to keep a balanced and neutral article on this topic. My conclusion here is tempered by the author's behavior during this discussion. While diligent in the defense of his article, he has remained polite and fact-based. The dispute is only an interpretation of Wikipedia policy on the standards for inclusion of an article topic.</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "delete" as original research. The article in full probably should not be re-created until it the theory has been independently published in accordance with the "no original research" guidelines or until it has reached a level of notoriety equivalent to some of the other pseudo-science theories mentioned below.</p>
<p>After deletion, I am going to move the sandbox version to the main article space. Noting the controversy, however, I am going to immediately tag it as a procedural nomination to VfD so that a separate discussion and decision can be made on that version. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:06, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's the problem - I _haven't_ been able to reproduce the list of references. Mr. Tomes claimed several hundred links to his site from people who weren't him, but the first several pages of searching for "harmonics theory" and "ray tomes" on google contains only material he produced. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 15:53, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Update - searching for "ray tomes" and "cycles" gives mostly RT's work, but a handful of other references to it. <a href="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Physics-Cycles-Harmonics-Universe.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Physics-Cycles-Harmonics-Universe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Physics-Cycles-Harmonics-Universe.htm</a> seems to be a similar write-up by a different author that cites Mr. Tomes' work. Other references I've dug up so far are mostly newsgroup posts and the like. So, still not looking Notable. I'm trying to prod the vocal supporters in the Talk:Harmonics Theory page into digging up the bona fide references they say exist and posting them here, but no response so far. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 19:03, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The lack of actual mathematical derivations makes it seem less credible to me. (I like the rewrite at Harmonics Theory/Sandbox and would be happy to see that stay.)

<li>Yes, the phrase occurs most commonly for my theory, but also quite commonly for general theory of harmonics of a regular type, and also some for an astrological meaning (which has an "indigo ray" with it - that is not this Ray!). I fail to see how you can criticise a lack of mathematics when I put a simple program to show the exact logic of the calculation. And PRF Brown has confirmed that my calculations are correct and added some additional note. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 04:19, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no connection with Bruce Cathie, but he does live in the same city&#160;:-) Although his UFO grid does have harmonic 2880 around the earth, which is a strong harmonic in harmonics theory. However that side of harmonics theory is not in dispute (I think) as it has been found by PRF Brown to be a known mathematical equation. But Cathie uses the word "harmonic" to sometimes mean a numerological one, whereas my meaning is always mathematical/musical/physical. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 04:19, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The phrase "original research" in this context refers to untested theories; data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication;' The people that are putting this have been badly informed by Gazpacho.

<li><b>Cleanup</b> Firstly i should say that I have known Ray Tomes (on the internet) for past 7 years and I have found him to be a polite and genuine 'alternative' theorist with interesting ideas. I do not agree with everything he writes, but think that Harmonics is an important subject that should be investigated and published on Wikipedia. ... discussion moved to talk page</li>

<p>This is my rambling few cents worth on why i think the article deserves to be kept, but should be cleaned up to have the more speculative areas removed. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaselhurst_1b1f.html" title="User:Haselhurst">Haselhurst</a> 10:03, May 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dcfleck, I request that you look at Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2 which has incorporated a lot more wikifying and also has additional references etc. The emphasis has also been changed to show that the theory arose out of cycles studies. Unfortunately there are no peer-review journals in cycles studies, so FSC proceedings and cycles magazine are the best available. The FSC was the most reputable organisation in the field. As far as it relates to physics and cosmology the problems of new ideas in peer-review journals has been raised by a nobel prizewinner, Josephson, as being almost insurmounrable. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 02:10, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of the two sandbox articles (Harmonics Theory/Sandbox and Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2), I think that Harmonics Theory/Sandbox is both better written (from the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Wikipedia</a> standpoint) and is more successfully <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>.

<li>What are the rules on this discussion closing? It seems to have run its course. I suggest that the best thing now is to remove the original pages and do a page that follows the rules as far as possible. I would prefer that to be done by someone other than Christopher (no offence intended, I appreciate your efforts, but several things I think reflect your POV) making changes to the sandbox2 article, because there are some serious errors of fact in the sandbox version and some important extra references in the sandbox2 article, I am happy to accept your judgement on NPOV, but would like to see the correct facts retained (as regards e.g. Tifft, Arp etc). <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 06:35, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What will happen is that one of the Wikipedia administrators will review the votes and take action as they see fit based on what people here have suggested (which will either be "delete" or "replace with NPOV rewrite", depending on how many of the "keep" votes they consider valid). This is supposed to happen a week after initial listing on VfD, but took about two weeks the last time I was involved in a VfD.

<p>Keep: No theory is ever complete. The expectations of too many is that theories need somehow to be legit before they should have space in the public domain. Nothing could be further from the truth. Peer review journals have been proven to not perform in the publics interest. They along with their organizations get caught in the rightness of their dogma and let nothing challenging in. It takes a revolution to displace them. In the meantime it takes spaces like this to communicate ideas toward individuals of different minds to come up with concepts to replace wholesale the prison yards of dogma. It is unlikely that any single subject will make the difference. But what will make the difference is someone that just happens to wander inside this space and with a few other ideas makes a whole new idea of the ages. That will not happen if you take that opportunity away from them. Doing so is almost always a bad idea. Why take the chance? James Conway May 29 2005.</p>
