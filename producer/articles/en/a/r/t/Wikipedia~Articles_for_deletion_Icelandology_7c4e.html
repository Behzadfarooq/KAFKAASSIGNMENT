<p>This article is a recreation of an article that has already been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Icelandology" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Icelandology" rel="nofollow">deleted three times</a>. The term itself is a nn neologism.

Why there should be a made-up term for the study of Iceland when there is not such a term for the study of any other country does not make sense.

<li><b>Comment:</b> History of article: First created in May last year, then prodded in May this year. Was re-created in slightly reworded form, so prod contested. The re-creation was then speedied on July 13 as nonsense - which I don't think was the most appropriate. Later, it was speedied as repost. Hence this probably should not be deleted as repost, despite the nomination; let's give it its day(s) at AfD. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 19:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Save:</b>The first article was deleted because of suspect of the promotional purposes. I have fixed this problem, but someone delete it automaticly without discussion.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The first article was the result of the work of some contributors (not only me) so I think that the term is needful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Iceland is unique country. The history, environment, culture and location of this country causes that some reserchers want to group all the sciences about Iceland in the one term.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Scientists create neologism every days. They call new stars, new chemical compounds, new plants and new animals. It is normal situation. So the term "icelandology" should be listed in Wikiepdia similar to a new plants names.</dd>
<dd>The term name is build in the same way as "sinology" or other country-sciences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Geography is the only part of the icelandology, because icelandology include also humanistic sciences. Geography is too narrow science to use in this case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because we are scientists and we study all problems about Iceland, we call ourselves "icelandologists". This simple name is enough good to describe what we are doing and what we are interested in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Icelandology seems to be a perfect term for such purposes and we use it from some years in Poland (Polish: islandologia).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Occurence in Google is not a proof that new scientific word should not be included in Wikipedia. New chemical compounds are very often described only in one article, but it is not a reason to forbid publication in Wikiepdia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before someone decide to delete this page, please discuss it before... Deletion is fast and easy, the creation and writing of new articles is more laborious. I hope you understand our reasons. Instead of deletion you may still put any warning that this article is controversial. If you have got any questions, please feel free to add your comments. Discussion is a better solution than deleting.--<a href="../../../y/u/i/User%7EYuiul_eebd.html" title="User:Yuiul">Yuiul</a> 19:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike> - next to no appearances in Google, most of them that do appear are wiki derived.

<li><strike><b>Move</b>&gt;</strike> to icelandic studies, as perUppland. It should probably get a heavy rewrite once it gets there so that it's not quite so poland-centric. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 21:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually justplain <b>Delete</b> it... icelandic studies would seem to have a different meaning and I'm sure that if it is necessary as an article someone can create it without refering back to this one. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 23:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Is there an article on the subject in the Icelandic Wikipedia?

<li><s><b>Keep and move</b> to Icelandic studies. No reason to delete just because of the title. There are in fact plenty of area study disciplines like this one. This just happens to be a too literal translation from Polish, where the discipline, as the Polish author points out, is called <a href="../../../../pl/i/s/l/islandologia_fcfa.html" class="extiw" title="pl:islandologia">islandologia</a> (20,400 Google hits). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 20:48, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would agree with the move idea, except that as it stands, the article would have little or no meaningful/distinct content once the Icelandology neologism/protologism is removed. The article could be "XXXX studies" of any country - an entirely generic description of the broadest possible research coverage in a country context, without any specifics. Of course there are many area/culure studies disciplines, but they have specifics. If it is moved, I would suggest <b>stubifying</b> the article, or <b>totally rewriting</b> the current content. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s><b>Modified suggestion</b>: Move to User:Yuiul/Icelandic studies, and let the author expand the article with more useful information on the history of Icelandic studies, where it is pursued (not limited to one particular university in Poland), which the important journals are, etc, before it can be moved back to mainspace. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 21:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li>Hmm... There is indeed such a thing as Icelandic studies,<a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22icelandic+studies%22&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22icelandic+studies%22&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which I suppose could be article-worthy but I think that term refers primarily to studies of Iceland's mediaeval literature. Apart from that I have nothing to add to Uppland's comments. Let's just try to be nice to what seems to be a good-faith contributor. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 22:02, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Creating any unnecessary term by connecting a word with -ology is senseless of course. But in the case when the term may be used instead of other many words, it is useful, advantageous and justified. The "icelandic study" refers to language study only. Icelandic is the language used in Iceland.--<a href="../../../y/u/i/User%7EYuiul_eebd.html" title="User:Yuiul">Yuiul</a> 23:06, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> What other research centers focus on Iceland, maybe under a different name?

<li><b>Comment:</b> There is only one center which use the term "icelandology".
