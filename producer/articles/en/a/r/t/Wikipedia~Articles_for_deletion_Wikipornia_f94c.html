<p><b>Keep it.</b> You can't seriously be considering this. I can think of no more gross an example of subjective morality's continued stranglehold on mass media than this insurrection into the collective free-knowledgebase that is Wikipedia. We've got issues on this website, and we don't need to be judging an ACCURATE, popular article when there are several incomplete, poorly written, and largely false articles existing on the site daily. The "neologisms" argument is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It denies the global community the ability to have its say in what information should be readily available to mass audiences, which is what Wikipedia was made for. Last time I checked, we're not Microsoft. This timid argument is ridiculous.</p>
<p><br />
The idea of banning "Neologisms" is faulty policy to begin with, and that's what this debate boils down to. The gap between 'current' neologisms and legitimate terms is only bridged by apparent common usage. Common usage is related to popularity, which is, in most cases, due to nothing more than personal exposure to the word. Wikipedia is special for many reasons, not least of which is its ability to disperse new--yes, even BRAND new--information to a large, international audience. To deny that Wikipedia facilitates society in this exciting learning process is to depreciate <i>our own website,</i> and self-impose a <b>lower standard</b> of value and influence on society than traditional media. We're peeing on our own feet, folks.</p>
<p><br />
This article strikes at the heart of the faulty "Neologism" policy. We can't just say <i>"wait we don't allow these because we say so,"</i> if it appears as though there is a legitimate reason for the policy ITSELF to be reviewed, which I believe is the real issue here. If you expel the ability of Wikipedia to help new concepts make it as quickly as possible into the marketplace of ideas, you're destroying what makes this site unique and extremely important.</p>

<p>Ok, so "Wikipornia" isn't exactly the most important and valiant example of the flaws inherent in the "Neologisms" policy; that DOESN'T mean that the flaws don't exist. If you outlaw the Wiki-community's ability to help new concepts come to the forefront, <b>you're stunting the vast potential of Wikipedia, and railing against the very concept behind the internet itself.</b></p>
<p><br />
If we decide to delete this, and other similar articles, I wish you good luck in your quest to make Wikipedia as dry, boring, linear, and immediately out of date as a regular encyclopedia. Why don't we just publish a book if we want to exclude the idea of <b>timeliness,</b> completion, community, and open-source R/evolution that began this site?

<li><b>Comment</b> I tend to agree this is <i>not</i> a <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> problem (and if it was, I don't think such is basis for deletion, only a rewrite). To quote the policy, "Wikipedia can, of course, write about Wikipedia, but context is important." I think if everyone and their mother used this term (or for instance, newspapers) then there would be no problem. As it is, however, it is a new idea and needs to gain popularity before being included. Existing on google is quite different from being widely used (as might be <i>demonstrated</i> via google). That is how I read it at least. Thus I claim it <i>is</i> a relatively unused neologism and should not be included as such. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 01:20, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I vote for deletion. Wikipedia is not a slang guide. Anyways, this isn't popular slang at all. "Thousands upon thousands" being familiar with the term is maybe a few thousand people out of "millions upon millions" that speak English. And anyway, like the article says, this term was coined and used about 5 times on Collegehumor.com. Wikipedia does not and should not have articles about inside jokes or slang terms used by every single website's userbase on the web. It's simply unrealistic. Articles about internet subculture are valid articles (think 1337) but Wikipornia is not common enough to merit having its own article. Used 5 times on one website? Please. The only reason this is being debated is because CollegeHumor linked to this article requesting users to "Save Wikipornia." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDapperDan_cd66.html" title="User:TheDapperDan">TheDapperDan</a> 21:52, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no reason not to keep this article. Everyone here citing Wikipedia's "A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide." Needs to read the next sentence of that policy. The next sentence says "Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used." This article, although is a slang term, is not a guide on how this term is to be used, but rather an explanation of the term itself, which is Wikipedia worthy, because it explains a phenomena, not mearly a straight dictionary word with a meaning and definition.

<li><b>Delete</b>. To everybody from collegehumor.com and LUELinks, chill. Wikipedia's rules say that among other things, articles on neologisms are not allowed. Slang is fine when it enters general usage, but new words or phrases that are not a part of common usage are not. For example, we have articles on <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a>, but not Longcat or RICK JAMES, BITCH! because these memes are not in common usage.

We can't include every <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">little thing</a> someone makes up -- it's not feasible, and other sites (such as <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dictionary_cc65.html" title="Urban Dictionary">Urban Dictionary</a>) cover that niche sufficiently.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is a continously evolving format. It offers more than standard encyclopedias because it offers certain, less scholarly points of view than say Britannica would. You get a more complete sense of a subject through Wikipedia, rather than be restricted by select facts that are approved by a select community. I believe that by censoring popular trends in culture because "they are more fitted for urbandictionary.com" you are only depriving Wikipedia of one of its inherent advantages over standard encyclopedias.

<li><b>Thank You</b> As the creator of this much controversial article, I would like to thank those who have supported the upkeep of not only the word "wikipornia" remaining in wikipedia, but the integrity of wikipedia itself. Whether or not this article will stay has everything to do with the consensus, and we are making it clear, with valid arguments nonetheless, that this is a worthy article. Dirty Sanchez, Rusty Trombone, Cumfart, Creampie, and even ideepthroat...if wikipornia is more of a neologism than those, I believe WIKIPEDIA will lose a lot of users, both new and old. Ahhh I love work. --Onestudlyomelet 23:34, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Oddly Enough, that link goes to a page explaining that the phrase either has to be 'verifiable' or not to plainly obvious. No one can say that "wikipornia" is unknown or that its existence can't be verified. --Onestudlyomelet 21:44, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you are refering to the <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">WP:BALLS</a> link, that one goes to a policy page. Wikipornia is not, to the best of my knowedge, policy (nor is WP:BALLS, for that matter, an article in the encyclopedia). --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 21:50, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I really don't understand why people don't want to keep this entry. People are citing two policies which have no baring on this entry at all. The "Wikipedia is not 'A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide.'" states specifically that the artical should not deal with the <b>usage</b> of the slang, not that the article should not be about a slang term itself. "Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used." The article makes no mention of the idea that slang terms themselves cannot have an article.</p>
<p>The citing of <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">WP:BALLS</a> is simply rediculous, because the article itself states that it is NOT Wikipedia policy. The policy which states that Wikipedia can not be used to publish original research cities that coining a neologism in an article is a way of establishing that the article is original, and therefore unsuitable for Wikipedia. AGAIN, the policy does not specifically ban neologisms, and because this article is not a reasearch paper, or an attempt to publish any kind of theory, data, etc, as stated on the Policy page about no original research. Therefore, it doesn't fall into that catagory, and the fact that it may be a "new" word doesn't mean it's excluded because it does not pertain to new reasearch. There is a "content guide" which seeks to have users aviod neologisms, "unless they have realistic evidence of existence via verifiable usage data or, at the least, search engine hits." As the wikipornia article itself states, there are google hits pertaining to the word.</p>
<p>Many people also are saying that it's too new and/or not widely used enough to warrent a Wikipedia article. My question to them is, at what point does it become old enough, or widely used enough to be deemed Wikipedia worthy. If anything this article should be kept because it pertains to something that exists on Wikipedia. It is not a straigh dictionary definition, nor is something not noted or unworthy. The fact that so many people have visited this page and put in their two cents (rightly or not) shows that this article is well known and widely used. I urge the administrators to keep this because it is an example of what is best about Wikipedia: the ability to evolve and be crafted from the ideas of its users. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrlecter491_f1a1.html" title="User:Drlecter491">Drlecter491</a> 00:11, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>In many cases, neologisms get deleted. Protologisms are almost always deleted. It could be via speedy deletion or the Articles for deletion process.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But this is not a court of law, and although citing policy is a good idea, we should always be sure to <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">ignore all rules</a> (see also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_bureaucracy" title="WP:NOT">this policy</a>). There are dozens if not hundreds of neologisms up for deletion at the present moment. We have the neologism policy (and similar policies) because we are building an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, not a phrase book, certainly not a free for all content host. This is undeniably a neologism. It is a routine deletion, one of more than two hundred nominated per day (and this is nothing new). It is wonderful that so many people have taken an interest in Wikipedia, and I hope they stay. But we can not turn Wikipedia into a host for every person with access to the web to post their ideas. If "wikipornia" becomes commonly used (think thousands of google hits), then it should be included. But until then, we leave it (and the thousands of words like it) out. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 01:11, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
