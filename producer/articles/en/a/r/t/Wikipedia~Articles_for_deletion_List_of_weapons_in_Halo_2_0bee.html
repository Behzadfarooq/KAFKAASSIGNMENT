<p><a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">Gamecruft</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">game-guide</a> <i>in extremis</i>. This article is <i>unverified:</i> there's no source for any of this information in this article, other than the implicit primary source. Additionally, this article is <i>unverifiable</i>: there's little to no independent commentary on these weapons, outside of how-to guides.</p>
<p>There's constant how-to advice; a couple examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Human weapons, however, are more effective than plasma-based weaponry against skin and flesh, making them more useful when shields are down, and ideal against the Flood."</li>
<li>"As with other weapons, the sniper rifle is most effective when used for head shots, which kill targets in one hit."</li>
<li>"Similarly to other human weapons, turrets are best used in bursts rather than prolonged periods of fire."</li>
<li>"The Battle Rifle is largerly considered the better of the two, but if fired with accurate aiming and precise timing, the Carbine can technically kill faster than the battle rifle can."</li>
<li>The entirety of List of weapons in Halo 2#Balance, complete with color-coded table highlighting the merits and weaknesses of each weapon</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply editing out this advice would leave nothing but paraphrased descriptions of the history of the weapons, and Wikipedia is not the place to abridge the source material from the manual.</p>
<p>There is relevant precedent in other AFDs, such as those for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Weapons_in_the_Resident_Evil_Outbreak_Series_3931.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Weapons in the Resident Evil Outbreak Series">two similar articles for the Resident Evil series</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Weapons_of_Doukutsu_Monogatari_129d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Weapons of Doukutsu Monogatari">a list of weapons in Cave Story</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_attacks_2_20a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Pokémon attacks 2">a list of Pokémon attacks</a>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:18, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even though I am an avid Halo 2 player, this doesn't belong here - it works better on the <a href="http://h2wiki.halowiki.net/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://h2wiki.halowiki.net/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Halo strategy wiki</a>, which has more and better information than this anyway. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><font color="green">des</font><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">at</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">talk. o.o;;</a></small> 04:22, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Quite a few links directing to this article, so it may be more important than you think (this includes a lot of redirect pages, which should be deleted as well should the consensus here be delete). Also note that there is an article on weapons in the first Halo game: List of weapons in Halo: Combat Evolved The nominator may want to put this list up for deletion as well. <font color="green">—</font><b><a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl"><font color="DarkGray">Ed</font><font color="DarkKhaki">Gl</font></a></b> 04:28, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Part of the reason for all the links, I would imagine, is that this was a merge target for a whole bunch of stubs with similar gamecruft/gameguide problems. As for the other list, I'd really rather keep these AFDs separate whenever possible so that issues with each article can be discussed on a case-by-case basis. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There is nothing wrong with including this information. It's well presented and there is nothing here that should offend wikipedia users. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 04:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure how this addresses my argument above. I didn't claim that the presentation was problematic, or that the content was offensive; rather, I claimed that this article doesn't fit into Wikipedia's mission, as it is largely an abridgement of source material and a instructional guide, both of which fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and that it is not and cannot be sourced. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:56, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I happen to disagree with some of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, as it is my prerogative to do so. I don't see a difference between the inclusion of individual weapons from Halo and the inclusion of individual kangaroo species, or individual Supreme Court judges. A user may have a need for information on any of these, and regard all of them as noteworthy. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 05:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Individual kangaroo species are widely discussed in peer-reviewed sources; likewise for Supreme Court justices. Not so for this article's subject. If you're conceding the point that this fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, though, there's not a lot more to discuss (seeing as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is still binding policy). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - While difficult to source certainly, I would say that the weapons of Halo 2 are much more important to the game than <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_Chief_b8f6.html" title="Master Chief">Master Chief</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html#Plot" title="Halo 2">the plot</a>, and certainly any other character. I've removed the charts, which were certainly OR. I have removed/altered the sections of text you labeled as how-to advice, which some of them most certainly were. While there are probably other content issues and weasel words, these don't constitute deletion. While I am in favor of deleting cruft (I've been doing some of the work on Proto's list), such as RuneScape holiday items and articles for every single CS map, I think that a single (hopefully sourced in the future) article describing the most important (imho) aspect of a popular game can be non-cruft. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:07, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How can this possibly be sourced, though?<br />
As for rewriting this article, is there a single sentence in this article that isn't advice on playing Halo 2 or abridged from the game's manual? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Incidentally, all you removed was the "Balance" section, which was particularly bad, but the article is still studded with game-guide-style advice. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:18, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With a limited amount of searching, I was able to find a review from <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> mentioning some of the info presented in the article. While there is certainly much unsourced material, I do believe it <i>is</i> possible to cite portions of it, though I don't know how much. I do believe that there are indeed sentences that don't fit the bill of a how-to guide. Stuff like (paraphrasing here) "unlike other covenant weapons, the carbine needs to be re-loaded" or the "magnum is a semi-automatic pistol that can be dual-wieldable" seems acceptable to me. Certainly a lot of stuff claiming "the magnum is most effective when used with the plasma pistol" or whatever needs to be removed, but I think if that stuff is removed, there is still an article there. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:28, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How is "The carbine needs to be reloaded" not instructing people how to play the game? Eating an orange isn't any more acceptable per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for being phrased "The peel needs to be removed" instead of "You need to remove the peel" or "It is a good idea to remove the peel." - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the article for <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_%28fruit%29.html" title="Orange (fruit)">Orange</a> says <i>"The fruit is commonly peeled..."</i>. So how about if the example carbine sentence said "The carbine is reloaded" or something more elegant. My phrasing was poor in the previous carbine example where I used the word "need". Clearly not every sentence discussing an action performed by a human is a "how-to" or instruction. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_%28fruit%29.html" title="Orange (fruit)">Orange</a> has content other than that brief mention of how one eats it. This article, other than abridgement of the game's manual, does not. It's a matter of degree. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:43, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tomorrow, I'm going experiment and try remove all the stuff that can be construed as how-to and see whats left. I'd of course like to hear your opinion when I finish that (I'll drop a message here). Also, for hilarity's sake, check out the article before I greatly reduced it a month or so ago: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_weapons_in_Halo_2&amp;oldid=53977482" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_weapons_in_Halo_2&amp;oldid=53977482" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b>.</s> Crufty, but harmless. I suppose someone interested in looking up information on fictional weapons might be interested, Halo 2 is widespread enough to be notable, and I don't see a problem with this article as long as it's NPOV (original research and advice removed). As I see it, the biggest downside is that it might be a chore to maintain as all the would-be experts re-submit POV comments. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 07:36, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've reconsidered; individual fictional weapons <i>might</i> be notable, but the list probably isn't.

<li><b>Keep if extremely pruned</b>, I'm as opposed to gamecruft as anyone else, I even listed for deletion practically wikipedia's entire orbiter game guide, but this article has a significant potential to exist as a collection of verifiable, non original research data. I'd think of it as analagous to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_droids_dcc6.html" title="List of minor Star Wars droids">list of minor Star Wars droids</a> or List of recurring robot characters in Futurama--every member of the list has verifiable data documenting its contribution, however minor, to the larger plot of a major, notable work, and knowledge of the individual members adds to an understanding of the greater work. The weapons of an FPS are surely as critical to it as the characters of a film like star wars, and being able to see what sort of weapon the "needler" is will help me understand halo in the same way knowing who 4-LOM or IG-88 refers to will help me understand star wars. We shouldn't be giving out gameplay tips, but a collated description of the weapons, referenced to sources like game guides and reviews, and limited to that content, is useful and not a mere indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 10:58, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay,I remember reading when first joined here that if one could not only include basic information about poker, but also make a poker-game guide there was no problem with it, I see the same situation here. Still if it seems too much of a guide then making a renovation should be enough, or even merging it with another halo page, but I think that deleting it is excesive--<a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuan_Anselm_cede.html" title="User:Juan Anselm">Anselm</a> 14:51, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'd personally argue that the examples of "advice" which you're citing are less hints than extended descriptions. For example, "the sniper rifle is most effective when used for head shots, which kill targets in one hit" seems like a very reasonable way to summarize a sniper weapon in general. More generally, though, this article is indeed a little bit gamecrufty, but is well within reasonable limits, particularly for a game as popular as <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I support covering balance, though as it's part of gameplay and design, which are topics we're supposed to cover according tot he computer and video games project.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Interesting and pertinent point. Game design is a valid subject to cover, so this sort of material is worth keeping - the array of weapons and comparisons does indeed reflect game balance and design. For instance, the even more detailed and stat-heavy List of weapons in Halo: Combat Evolved would be non-cruft by that standard. At the same time, the information being necessarily stated as fact would appear as a game guide. I'd argue the descriptions here are facts (about fictitious weapons) and not a how-to guide. Besides, the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_strategy_and_tactics.html" title="Chess strategy and tactics">chess strategy and tactics</a> article would be an even more in-depth "game guide", by comparison. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 07:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're dramatically overestimating the number of articles nominated for deletion on Wikipedia, and underestimating the size of Wikipedia. Excluding speedy deletions, about 100-200 articles are nominated for deletion daily. This is a drop in the bucket , given the total size of wikipedia. I would guess that when I'm regularly active, I participate in around 3-8 afds daily. I also generally choose to only vote in discussions which are not foregone conclusions, or on which I have long-standing views on. I concentrate my efforts in arguing cases which are tightly fought. I'm deletionist, but that certainly does not mean I want to delete everything as you suggest - it just means I favour higher general standards of inclusion. I vote for keep perhaps 1 time out of 15 - but that's because most of the afd nominations are good ones. Examples of very recent (i.e. in the last week or 10 days or so) afds, where I have not only voted keep, but actually been one of the main arguers for keep have been <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twink_%28gay_slang%29.html" title="Twink (gay slang)">Twink (gay slang)</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gosh_Numbers_89c2.html" title="Gosh Numbers">Gosh Numbers</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_sex_tourism.html" title="Female sex tourism">Female sex tourism</a> and <a href="../../../z/s/a/Zsanett_%C3%89gerh%C3%A1zi_0128.html" title="Zsanett Égerházi">Zsanett Égerházi</a>. In the first case, I was an early keep voter who identified the nomination as likely to be bad faith. In the last three (with the caveat that two are still active), I believe I was instrumental in swaying debates (that were originally majority delete) towards keep or no consensus through researching evidence. Deletionism does not mean we want to delete everything. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:39, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
