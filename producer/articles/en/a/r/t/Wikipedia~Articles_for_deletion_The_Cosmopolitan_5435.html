<li>How is this a "crystal ball" article? The project is going on right now, and can be easily seen by anyone. As for notability, Las Vegas is visited by millions of people around the world, and many are interested in the ever-changing face of the strip...which this is a part. Furthermore, there are already several links to the article, which will go red, causing the article to be recreated sooner or later. Do we just keep deleting and recreating the article until this opens? Finally, what about motion pictures in production. <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a> has an article, and it's not released yet...should that deleted too as a "crystal ball" article?</li>

<dd>Actually, now that you bring it up, yes, articles about future movies, future Mars missions and future gadgets should be deleted too. The future doesn't exist. Books and movies about the future exist, so those articles should be retained. In summary, delete articles about the future but retain articles about movies about the future. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Endomion</a> 18:59, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The preparations for the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Tower_a8ea.html" title="Freedom Tower">Freedom Tower</a> have received national press coverage. Those for The Cosmopolitan have notâ€”or, if they have, you have not cited any of that coverage. I personally do not think <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Tower_a8ea.html" title="Freedom Tower">Freedom Tower</a> comes under the "crystal ball" rubric. <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a> is borderline. If someone were to nominate it I personally <i>would</i> vote to delete it. But I won't bother proposing it myself because my experience is that once a movie has a listing in imdb there will not be consensus to delete. If you honestly believe these articles come under the "crystal ball" policy you or anyone else can nominate them for deletion. However, I would advise against doing so merely out of retaliation or pique; see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:30, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> because the whole thing could go down the toilet tomorrow. This is an encyclopaedia, encyclopaedias are backward-looking.

<li><b>Comment</b> Online search of The New York Times from 2000 through yesterday for articles containing both exact phrases "The Cosmopolitan" and "Las Vegas" turns up no relevant hits. (There were four hits, but in each of them "the cosmopolitan" was simply a phrase, not a reference to the new resort; e.g. "Geoff Hampson of Los Angeles snatched a victory that seemed destined for one of the cosmopolitan teams in contention.") <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:39, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I should note as a matter of record that I was the creator of the article. However, it was created only because the property was already included in the Las_Vegas_Strip template, and I thought it looked bad to have a broken link in an otherwise informative template. I have no subjective attachment to either The Cosmopolitan or the article itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, I don't think that the crystal ball argument for deletion holds water. This is a major project that is already funded and has already broken ground. It is not "going down the toilet". I don't believe Wikipedia needs an article about every proposed condo project in the Las Vegas Valley, but this is a major undertaking on prime property on the <b>World Famous</b> Las Vegas Strip. It has an appeal that reaches far beyond the local. It will surely merit an article once it is completed, so why delete it now? I can see a use for the article as it exists now, say if a visitor to Las Vegas witnesses the construction and is curious as to what lies in the future of the ever-changing Las Vegas Strip. What better place to sate her curiosity than Wikipedia? <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuck_O%27Nollege_791e.html" title="User:Buck O'Nollege">Buck O'Nollege</a> 07:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I can understand that if this was a rumored project or a minor construction, then maybe it would be CFD. But this is a MAJOR construction project that has already BROKEN GROUND. Las Vegas casinos are considered landmarks, they are more than simply hotels. Therefore, when a new casino is currently being built, it is very big news. <a href="http://www.cosmolv.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cosmolv.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.rubbermag.com/news/050406_13n.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rubbermag.com/news/050406_13n.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.hotelinteractive.com/index.asp?page_id=5000&amp;article_id=5194" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hotelinteractive.com/index.asp?page_id=5000&amp;article_id=5194" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/cosmopolitan.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/cosmopolitan.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.vegas4visitors.com/accom/frames/preview_cosmo.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vegas4visitors.com/accom/frames/preview_cosmo.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBreakFastClubb_c90b.html" title="User:BreakFastClubb">BreakFastClubb</a> 10:33, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a $1.8 billion project. How many cities have a private construction project that large? The <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boardwalk_Hotel_and_Casino_0440.html" title="Boardwalk Hotel and Casino">Boardwalk</a> will be closing next week to be replaced by <i>Project City Center</i> to be completed in 2010, likely the most expensive private construction project in history. I suspect that project will get an article also. Projects in Vegas do fail! They also can change a lot before they are actually completed. Many interesting facts about these projects are only easly available during construction, so that is a great time to write the article when many of the technical details are readly available. Much of this data would be encylopedic. Construction projects like <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuttle_Ptichka_630b.html" title="Shuttle Ptichka">Shuttle Ptichka</a> that never were completed are considered encylopedic after they failed, should we delete these? Maybe the question is under what conditions do construction projects become encylopedic? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 07:33, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per MisterHand. Ridiculously hasty nom. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 09:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">a crystal ball</a>. Which states 'Wikipedia is not a collection of unverifiable speculation. All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred.' This opening sentance clearly allows article about major projects. One could even argue that the Ivan Condo, which looks like it has failed, could still get an article. Even if press coverage is minimal, how many people can say they saw it under construction? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 18:38, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
