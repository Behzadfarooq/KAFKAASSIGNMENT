<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Very Strong Keep</b> - Delezio is notable in NSW and Australia. As pointed out he is a significant fundraiser and advocate for disabled people. This is a bad faith and petulant nom by the deletionist nominator who didn't like being challeged vide his/her statement in my talk when challenged on the earlier peremptory deletion <i>I am an editor; I can make decisions. I don't need permission.</i>. This idiotic statement should be enough to rule out the AfD nomination although the article does need expansion. One reason it has not been expanded is that as the article relates to a living person who lives a largely private life but does some notable things (albeit in an Australian context). <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 08:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The text in the article regarding Day of Difference Foundation is incorrect due to omissions. He actually created the charity after his daughters accident, and is the chairman. <a href="http://www.dayofdifference.org.au/Founders_2006.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dayofdifference.org.au/Founders_2006.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> While I applaud the man for his efforts, the charity is only notable due to his daughter's plight. Also, the father of the year award is not reason for notability in itself; the award is primarily about raising funds for charity. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 22:45, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Jayvdb's comment is. frankly, rubbish. The Father of the Year award is a fund raising vehicle BUT if you look at the list of the recipients you will find that almost all of them have articles in Wp or ought to because of their prominence in Australian history. That is to say the award is taken seriously by the award committee, the recipients and the Australian public perhaps even more than the Australian of the Year award which has been somewhat devalued by the continual awards to nondescript sports people. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 00:00, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
