The two sources used here (e.g. www.answering-ansar.org) mention only the verses, but not the phrase "hadith of loving and hating" or any similar concept. Perhaps there is a notable concept here, for which the creator has chosen an unusual translation. If so, it should be sourced and renamed. As it is, I see no evidence that the concept of "Hadith of loving and hating" exists outside Wikipedia.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 19:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe I should explain that I created this title only yesterday. Previously, the article was titled "Hadith of the equality of love and hatred" which is both misleading and horrid English. I merged the article "Hadith of loving and hating Ali" into the article and changed the title into the current one, which is at least a bit better linguistically. However, the title of Ali article seems uncommon as well, if you haven't found anything by that name (with or without Ali). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 21:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Stong keep</b> concept is very real and the hadith of Loving Ali is frequently referenced by Shi'as.

<li>May be you are right. I do not know it because I am sunni. But you should provide strong references (of secondary sources, not primary sources) in the start of the article. Otherwise, it looks like an original research based on some primary sources only. Also I do not understand that why you have to create so many partisan articles?

<dd>The start of the article is an original research. It says <i>There are various Hadith that talk about loving or hating someone or something being equal to hating someone or something else. The most famous are the Hadith of loving and Ali.</i> That is the base of the article. Do not you find it an orginal research without good references? One CANNOT have an article only on the bases of primary sources. Secondly we should not create article by grouping some Hadiths. Many hadiths are already group in seperate chapter in their original books. An article should be on real topics instead of topic created by collecting hadiths. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 03:16, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Drivel. There's no requirement of balance. The requirement of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is that we cite what sources there are. If there's no Sunni sources, too bad, should have thought of that before the Internet was invented. There's no Islamic sources on the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn_1b4b.html" title="Invisible Pink Unicorn">Invisible Pink Unicorn</a> (pbuh) so the article may indeed be unbalanced but what are you going to do?

<li>Al-Mamoon once asked him why the Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali (A.S.) is called the divider of Paradise and of Hell, and how that attribute came to be applied to him.

Have you not narrated from your father from his forefathers quoting Abdullah ibn Abbas saying that he had heard the Messenger of God (S.A.W.) saying, `<b>Loving Ali (A.S.) is iman, and hating him is kufr?'</b>" Al-Mamoon answered in the affirmative, so the Imam (A.S.) said, "If the distribution of Paradise and of Hell is done according to loving or hating him, then he is the distributor of Paradise and of Hell."

<li><b>Keep</b> - It could use improvement and references, but it's got the basics of a good article showing Shia and Sunni perspectives on the issue. Seems notable. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 00:59, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Look closely, there are several different traditions referenced here, some of which have no direct relation to the others besides the juxtaposition of "love" against "hate" in relation to Ali. The organization and labelling of them as "Hadith of love and hatred" is a dubious basis for an article. Apparently, Striver has created a number of articles consisting of a single Hadith, e.g. <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith_of_Uthman%27s_modesty_4228.html" title="Hadith of Uthman's modesty">Hadith of Uthman's modesty</a>. The trouble is that Striver becomes Wikipedia's de facto interpreter and labeller of Islamic scripture. Because the articles are so short and distributed all over the place, it is difficult for other editors to exercize any oversight, or for readers to find the informtion they're looking for. I was going to suggest merging this one into Shi'a veneration for Ali, only to discover to my amazement that no such article exists. I am also amazed that there is no category for Shi'a Islam. It's desirable that this information is presented, but this method of (dis-)organization is appalling.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 02:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - i really don't like having any of these "Hadith of..." articles, if there is a <i>concept</i> meriting discussion then surely it can be done in a manner other than this. i feel that almost all of these "Hadith of..." articles are simply proxies of <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a>: extensions of sunni vs. shia internet polemics (used to 'prove' one set of beliefs over another) which we can do without. it wouldn't be fair, however, to opine "Delete" here whilst dozens of other similar articles currently exist and serve as a precedence for this one. the wider issue of such articles in general must be addressed. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It looks that we've a significant problem on our hands: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Allpages/Hadith_of" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Allpages/Hadith_of" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> (please do follow this link.) How can we delete any of them, if the existence of others is the defense for any particular one? Most (if not all) of these are attributable to one particularly energetic editor. The question is, how can we re-channel this energy into a policy-compliant direction? Deleting these articles must be a component of the solution. It's simply unacceptable for Wikipedia to serve as the platform for any one user's exegeses, however good-faith and worthy these might be.</dd>
<dd>While I personally have sympathies with the Shi'a perspective, it does seem that Itaqallah's "proxies" charge has validity. Articles which promote, implicitly or otherwise, any particular religion or religious faction are unacceptable.</dd>
<dd>The author seems well-intended and mostly fair-minded, but it is not up to any of us to designate the Shi'a view vs. the Sunni view, or the Muslim view vs. the non-Muslim view; this is an inherently and needlessly divisive way of structuring articles. Most of these are mostly uncited, and suffer from the same problems noted here.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:06, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, isnt all hot Shi'a - Sunni topics in one way or another an extension of the Succession to Muhammad? I mean, even the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffin are extension of it, even the succession to Abu Bakr is a extension to that. Why is the list of hadith being addressed as an unaccaptable extension, while all the battle and other controversies are viewed as acceptable? Isn't the point to show notable controvesies? I have already shown with ample evidence that this hadith is notable, and i can do the same with most other hadith i have created. And btw, please do remeber that i am not just "an energetic editor", i am the only active Shi'a editor, and i have the support of every single Shi'a editor on wikipedia. -Striver <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.64.242.133_5811.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.64.242.133">213.64.242.133</a> (talk) 13:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>I mean, somebody pointed out above that non-notable hadith are not worth having here on wikipedia, and i agree. So why is there anyone surprised that the notable hadith are the controversial, and that the controverisal are those that Shi'a and Sunnis do not agree on`?- striver</dd>
