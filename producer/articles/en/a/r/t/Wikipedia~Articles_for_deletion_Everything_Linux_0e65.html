The company retails Linux.

There are a number of other companies with similar notability. I believe that if this shop retailed lingerie or books it would be deleted, retailing computer software, even Linux, should not be treated differently.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is an online retailer as well as a shop front. So far as the online side of it goes, it also happens to be one of the largest in Australia - I can only think of two (this and LSL) off the top of my head. (If someone wants to write about one of the countries biggest lingerie or bookstore, such as Bras N Things or <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_%26_Robertson_45e1.html" title="Angus &amp; Robertson">Angus &amp; Robertson</a>, that would probably be less likely to be nominated for deletion as they have a bigger market than an online Linux store.) -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 21:47, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Guideline 4 can be met by almost any corner shop for a suitably narrow definition of "market area". Bras N Things and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_%26_Robertson_45e1.html" title="Angus &amp; Robertson">Angus &amp; Robertson</a> are both chains/franchises, not a single store. The chain may be notable, but an individual shopfront is not. The best argument I've heard for notability for this one is if it can really be a profitable business running on online store <b>selling</b> freely-downloadable software! --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 00:04, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<li>"Market area" in this case is "Australia" - wide enough?

<li>(Answering since you felt ignored below) Their <a href="http://www.elx.com.au/delschedule.php" class="external text" title="http://www.elx.com.au/delschedule.php" rel="nofollow">website</a> claims their market area is the entire western Pacific including China and Japan. If I want a book about Debian Linux (for example), I'll shop at a bookshop. If I want Debian Linux, I go to debian.org and download it (or install online). If the article is extended to show how they can make a profit from selling things online that people can just as easily download for free, then I might change my vote. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:34, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>People who don't have broadband; people who have low quotas; people who like the fancy pressed CDs; people who want to try several different distros and would rather receive the CDs overnight instead of wait for a week to download them all; people who want to purchase one of ELX's custom people who want a distro AND a book, or other merchandise in one order; people who want to buy hardware guaranteed to work with Linux; but seeing as they have been in business for 6 years, I don't think discussing their business model is really relevant - it obviously works fine for them and several others. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 00:00, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have commented/replied to many of the objections here, but been ignored. I don't want to repeat myself, but I will. <b>62.5% of Australian Linux users, when asked to name a Linux online retailer, name <i>Everything Linux</i> as the first and sometimes only one they know.</b> Yes, its a very small sample size, but 62.5% is significant, qualifies (for me) as the biggest in the country, and implies that the store definitely passes company inclusion guideline #4. It's a bit hard to prove what is common knowledge in a certain circle, but no-one has gone out of their way to prove in the past.
