<p>Editors, you are hereby served a cease and desist letter. Forget about deletion. Every word of the entry is factually true.</p>
<p>Below I enumerate my options: - Trying to Slashdot.org the news of this delete attempt. The /. site is read by a million plus geeks (free-as-in-speech advocated) people daily. They would be grossly enraged about such low in their beloved Wikipedia. - Telling BBC. They are not fond of the US humanwrongs-wise.</p>

<li><s>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinal apparently has a series of stories (e.g., <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/racine/aug04/252571.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.jsonline.com/news/racine/aug04/252571.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.jsonline.com/news/racine/aug04/252571.asp</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> — an ugly story, but it doesn't seem notable in and of itself. This VfD discussion needs to be monitored for edits by 195.92.40.49. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 16:02, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Yes, an ugly story, but I've found no indication that this is some sort of "international scandal" or even that this woman's case is being used as a reason to get the law changed. Either of those things would make this story (and thus the victim) notable. As an aside, the original author's reaction to this nomination is rather amusing. Neither Slashdot nor the BBC would care about a single article being deleted from Wikipedia, and using this threatening tactic in defense of an article isn't going to change anyone's mind. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 16:15, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If the story is false, delete as hoax. If the story is true, delete as not notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not an exceptionally notable crime, as it doesn't seem to have attracted <i>extensive</i> media attention. Obviously most rape and murder crimes that don't happen in very large cities will garner at least some notice in local papers. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 18:26, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Starblind. The story happened, but sadly, it's simply not notable and the article is not encyclopedic - it's more a news story like one might read on Slashdot. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 00:20, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If we have article about the criminal bitch PFC Lynnie exploiting detainees like animals, than we should have article about a detainee being exploited. If we only carry the criminals, then Wiki is aiming for a new low. Wiki is supposed to be an encyclopaedia, so the amount of media attention is not a measure for inclusion. If it were, Wiki should be called Reader's Digest instead. But as far as news go, Jackie's federal venue civil rights violation lawsuit series will certainly make it into the big news sooner or later, so why not have the article now?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As for Slashdot, they already the carry the news from yesterday, that wikipedia is starting to censor officially (read it here: <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/08/05/2012229.shtml?tid=187&amp;tid=95" class="external free" title="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/08/05/2012229.shtml?tid=187&amp;tid=95" rel="nofollow">http://slashdot.org/articles/05/08/05/2012229.shtml?tid=187&amp;tid=95</a>). I think this Jackie Noyes article is perfect example why wikipedia will fail. People delete info they find disturbing and the majority of netizens are in USA, so only US-pinkglasses info can be posted and wiki has less and less to do with reality over time. However, I need to warn, that it is EN.wikipedia.org and not US.wikipedia.org, so you cannot sanitize this wiki of all US-condemning info.</dd>
<dd>By the way, the Jackie case was an international affair, because it was the AI who did most to get her and the baby out of prison. They secured the support of a european monarch, mother herself, who contacted the wisconsin governor via a mutual friend, an influental lobbist-businessman and this really set things in motion. But this is not offical info that could get into wikipedia. — <i>(Unsigned comment by 213.178.101.126; user's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.178.101.126_dad8.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.178.101.126">1st</a> edit.)</i></dd>

<li>The Slashdot story you link to describes <i>greater editorial control</i>, not censorship, and if you would bother to read the comments, many Slashdotters think this is a necessary thing to add to Wikipedia. I'm personally ambivalent about the idea. Please point out above the voters you think wish to "censor" this particular article based on finding the article "disturbing."

<li>Prisoners, and mental patients, get raped in prisons and mental institutions around the world every day. It's sad. Scandalous, even. It would be instructive, and encyclopedic, to have information on the incidence of such events in various countries around the world. Anons and slashdotters, feel free to make such an article and include this person in it on an equal NPOV basis with other identified victims of prison abuse worldwide. This person, alone, is unencyclopedic for reasons of disproportionality in view of her non-notability. Oh, and in view of the last anon post, add to the reasons for deletion: conspiracy theory. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 17:02, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. I think, given the media coverage, that this is notable enough for Wikipedia. However, it really needs to be cleaned up, and should be linked from <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custodial_rape.html" title="Custodial rape">Custodial rape</a>. Lots of girls go missing each year - what makes an <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_kidnapping_5fe8.html" title="Elizabeth Smart kidnapping">Elizabeth Smart</a> notable and not a Nicole Morin is the relative media coverage in each case, and if Jackie has become some sort of media figure representing custodial rape, by all means we should include the article. Blackmail is unfortunate, but it shouldn't factor in our decision to keep an article unrelated to the perpetrator. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYelyos_5db4.html" title="User:Yelyos">Yelyos</a> 07:07, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>
