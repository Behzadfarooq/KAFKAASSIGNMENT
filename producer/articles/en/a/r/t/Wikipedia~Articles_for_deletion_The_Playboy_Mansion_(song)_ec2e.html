<li><b><s>Keep</s></b> - all listed. They are U2 songs, not some by some unknown. People are interested in them even if the nominator may not be. Admittedly more work could be done to work up the articles, including interpretations - there is enough sources around - but that can't be done if they are deleted. Gone and Wake Up are in a select group of songs to have been cited by singer Bono as among his favourite U2 songs.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 13:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Merge</b>. Yes, I've given this some thought and want to change my suggestion: these articles are excessive and this information should be merged into the Pop album article. (it will improve the Pop album article). However, I do not want to see this information deleted and lost. I may have time in the next few days to merge - but if it gets deleted, could the deleting admin please save the info somehow (and let us know) for merging. Deleting admin: could you please keep me informed. thanks <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 03:19, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Question</b>, could you point out what part of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> these songs satisfy? <tt><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></tt>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> refers to musicians and ensembles, not songs. If you're referring to the proposed <a href="../../../s/i/n/WP%7ESINGLE_146b.html" title="WP:SINGLE">WP:SINGLE</a> guideline linked to from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, these songs meet none of the criteria listed there; being songs by a "very notable" act is not enough. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 13:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> all into <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_%28album%29.html" title="Pop (album)">Pop (album)</a>. That U2 are notable does not mean that every song they have recorded is notable. The vast majority of album tracks are non-notable, and these articles fail to establish the significance of these songs (apart from the sentence-long mention of the <i>Q</i> magazine list in the "Miami" article that could easily be merged into the album article). Readers of a general encyclopedia will not need to know that "If You Wear That Velvet Dress" was played at nearly every show on the Popmart Tour, or that The Edge used a Rickenbacker 360-12 to perform "Gone" on the Elevation Tour. A bigger problem here is the presence of original research and editorial opinion in these articles. Apparently "Miami" is "perhaps the most experimental track the band has released under its own name" - according to whom? "["Wake Up Dead Man"] is written as a plea from Bono for Jesus to return and fix the world" - who said this? "The opening notes [of "The Playboy Mansion"] strongly resemble that of a pornographic movie soundtrack" - again, where is this information coming from? None of these articles are referenced either. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 13:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep Gone (U2 song) and Miami (U2 song) under any criteria</b> - "Gone" is one of the most visible <i>Pop</i> numbers in later concerts, and is included on the group's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_of_1990-2000_cbf8.html" title="The Best of 1990-2000">The Best of 1990-2000</a></i> compilation. "Miami" is one of U2's most controversial and liked/disliked numbers, as the article indicates. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 13:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep the rest under pragmatic criteria</b> - U2 is one of those artists at the pinnacle of critical and commercial success and fervent fandom where eventually, every song is going to have an article. Examples already exist in WP: every song of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> has an article, even those like "<a href="../../../h/o/l/Hold_Me_Tight_c1cc.html" title="Hold Me Tight">Hold Me Tight</a>" that McCartney no longer remembers. Every <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> song seems to have an article, even ones like "<a href="../../../h/o/t/Hots_on_for_Nowhere_4fd8.html" title="Hots on for Nowhere">Hots on for Nowhere</a>" or "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wanton_Song_b07f.html" title="The Wanton Song">The Wanton Song</a>" that don't have much to say (the article <i>or</i> the song!). Every <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> song has an article, even for albums before <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, even for songs like "<a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_%28Pink_Floyd_song%29_a930.html" title="Stop (Pink Floyd song)">Stop</a>" that are only 30 seconds of connecting music, or songs like "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hero%27s_Return_6fc6.html" title="The Hero's Return">The Hero's Return</a>" that are unremembered tracks from failed albums during the group's breakup period. And so on. U2 isn't quite there yet, but it will be, and that's ok. It comes with the WP territory, like every Simpsons episode and every minor Star Wars character and every stupid video game all having articles. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 13:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have nothing against U2, I happen to have the CD that these songs are off of.</li>
<li>If the articles are deleted, they can be readded later with citations for interpretations. They can be worked on in a User subpage. Although the fact remains that they are just songs that were never released as singles.</li>
<li>I realize now that there are articles for every song by notable bands but I don't have the time to go around and tag everyone of them. I'd also rather avoid making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>.</li>
<li>The articles consist of mainly technical details, such as the time of the song and its track number, which could and do already go on the article for the album, as well as tour details like how often it was played, if at all, which really should go on the article for the specific tour. If this info is taken out since it's already in those articles, all you're left with is a sub-stub.</li>
<li>I'd like it if this whole song thing didn't devolve into <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>.</li>
<li>And finally, "The Hero's Return" is not unremembered. It happens to be a favorite song of mine. &#160;:-)</li>
