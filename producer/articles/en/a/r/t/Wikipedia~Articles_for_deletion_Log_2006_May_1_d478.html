<p>Dear Wikipedians: First, thanks very much for welcoming me to Wikipedia. It is a great place and serious environment. We are lucky that we have Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Re "Emre Gurkan" article, I think there is a misunderstanding:</p>
<p>I am a management consultant and a thinker, trying to publish in local Turkish newspapers. My articles are usually about the Turkish family life, how young Turkish population can improve themselves (education-wise, personal and professional perspectives). I think I am in the mid-way through and there is a long way for me to become a prominent philosopher with a significant impact on Turkish literature. If this is too much, I would like to apologize from all and mention that I did not have any bad intention at all. My content reflects the truth but being prominent as a little too much at this stage. I agree and sorry for that.</p>
<p>Regards, Emre Gurkan</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not that impressed with a society that has been around for only eight years (there is a History society at my university that was founded in 1862), the award is just local, and it is highly debatable whether anything in this article is verifiable through any sources, let alone reputable ones. This society has <a href="http://www.skynet.ie/~history/?nav=main" class="external text" title="http://www.skynet.ie/~history/?nav=main" rel="nofollow">a website</a> where every page contains nothing but the words "Content goes here", and it has a <a href="http://www.clubsandsocs.ul.ie/socs.php?no=22" class="external text" title="http://www.clubsandsocs.ul.ie/socs.php?no=22" rel="nofollow">minimal entry</a> at the University of Limerick clubs &amp; societies website, which does not even support the content of the Wikipedia article. If it is actually kept, please <b>remove that current-and-recent-official-cruft</b> that seems to pollute every article on student societies. I think it is fine to mention members prominent for other reasons or to have separate lists of historical presidents or other officials going back a century or two, where at least some non-negligable proportion of these have gone on to do something notable (e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Cambridge_Union_Society_Presidents_fda2.html" title="List of Cambridge Union Society Presidents">List of Cambridge Union Society Presidents</a>), but listing some student who was treasurer last year is really just vanity (nothing personal against that individual in particular, I just took that as an example). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 07:51, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think this a POV title which needs to be altered at the very least if the article stays because it inherently condemns the official outcome of the controversial events which are listed within in the article. Secondly, the "Officiating decisions" is inherently violating <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in that it will be inherently selective and incomplete of the incidents which are considered to be "scandalous/controversial". For example, regarding Kitajima doing a dolphin kick in breaststroke, this was the most prominent as he was fighting with Hansen for the gold medal, but there were many other murmurs about all sorts of breaststrokes bending their legs underwater etc. Also the section on which gymnastics performances cannot possibly be POV. Perhaps the Drugs Tests section will stay, but should be changed to "Drug Testing at the 2004 Summer Olympics".<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">review me</a> 01:19, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The problems identified should be dealt with by bold editing, at Cleanup, or through some other appropriate process. I don't think the title is too bad, but would be happy if the nominator or someone else could offer a better one. Some word like "controversies" might be better than "scandals", but I think "scandal" has just come to mean that there was some sort of furore in the press - which is verifiable in principle. It doesn't necessarily mean that the wrong decision was made. In any event, we don't need to go to AfD just to change a title. The appropriate first port of call is the talk page. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 01:55, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – Unlike the preceding contributors, I see no overlap between <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_computing.html" title="History of computing">History of computing</a> and this article. The material of this article is handled in two other articles though, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_computing_hardware.html" title="History of computing hardware">History of computing hardware</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_computing_hardware_%281960s-present%29.html" title="History of computing hardware (1960s-present)">History of computing hardware (1960s-present)</a>.

<p>Criteria for companies and corporations A company or corporation is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>
<p>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. This criterion excludes: Media re-prints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company. 1 Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations. 2 The company or corporation is listed on ranking indexes, produced by well-known and independent publications, of important companies. 3 4 The company's or corporation's share price is used to calculate stock market indices 5 6. Being used to calculate an index that simply comprises the entire market is excluded.&#160;?</p>

<p>Keep it why would you not keep it it's a very popular saying no reason to get rid of it it sheds light on the phrase</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll tell you why. For one, despite it's "popularity", I've yet to hear it outside of the show itself. It has not seen any significant use in pop culture I'm aware of. It's not even really a catchphrase, as Adam himself doesn't really repeat it. Second, everything witty or famous that's said doesn't get its own article. Even famous lines like "<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_the_Force_be_with_you_9cd3.html" title="May the Force be with you">May the Force be with you</a>", which might deserve thier own article, don't get one. Finally, it doesn't even really shed light on the phrase. All it says is "Adam said it, and he probably pulled it from an obscure movie". There's nothing that can really be added to that. Heck, the page was created with the quote attributed to the wrong guy. How can it be notable if the page creator doesn't even know who said it? --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 00:13, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It <i>is</i> notable. You must not be hanging out with nerdy enough people who watch movies like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dungeonmaster_1198.html" title="The Dungeonmaster">The Dungeonmaster</a></i>. My brother went crazy when he heard Adam say that. Not only that, but I looked it up as an adjunct to the Adam Savage article just now, because I wanted to see the full history of the phrase itself.

<dd>From my experience, this phrase it particularly well known and directly associated to MythBusters, as well as being quoted enough to enter Pop Culture quotes. However, I think this page <b>should</b> stay, as I think the quote needs to be properly referenced as not originally coming from MythBusters. Alternatively, chuck <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dungeonmaster_1198.html" title="The Dungeonmaster">The Dungeonmaster</a></i> link in the main <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythbusters.html" title="Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a> article ~ <a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnklepants_70cc.html" title="User:Anklepants">Anklepants</a>
<dl>
<dd>You guys keep saying that the article explains the "history" of the quote. I'm sorry, but there is no real "history" besides "it came from a movie made in 1985. Adam said it 20 years later on his TV show, maybe borrowing from that movie". That's it. It's not even something he says all the time, like a catchphrase. Unless you can pull out a source to prove it's gone beyond just Adam, I'm not convinced it's worth a whole article, expecially one this small that will never really grow. I agree with the Merge votes. That can be easily done, and won't deprive anyone of information. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 06:13, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Delete.</i> I nominated the page for deletion because the article doesn't make any claim for the restaurant's notability; from the article text, it seems to be just another burrito shop. In addition, the article was created by someone with the username "BTB," which, as the article states, is the acronym for the restaurant; this (along with "BTB"'s edit summary of "Big Ten Burrito is SOOOO good") leads me to think it's a vanity page by the owner or manager. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 03:25, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Basically, you are questioning the idea of an article on a future event. Look at a page on a future award show for example. Should we delete the page on the next Oscar Awards because we don't have enough information to fill it in as of now? It's more of a reference, which is encyclopedic. In practice on Wikipedia, if a character gets a flashback episode, they get a page. Articles with confirmed future events are on Wikipedia and should should remain to be. Desmond will get a flashback episode on May 24th, just as the <a href="../../../7/9/t/79th_Academy_Awards_75a7.html" title="79th Academy Awards">79th Academy Awards</a> will be held on February 25, 2007. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 21:18, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jtrost is right, it makes no sense. We can't cite an official source that Turbine Guy won't have a flashback episode either, but that's not an excuse to give him his own page. I'm starting to think, I hate to say, that keeping <i>Lost</i> pages free of fancruft is almost impossible, given its immense popularity and the endless supply of enthusiastic newcomers to Wikipedia at the same time. Having these recurring debates about fundamental Wikipedia tenets (e.g., verifiability, not a crystal ball, etc.) is utterly exhausting. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 00:58, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point PKtm was making was valid: you've asked for a "proof" of a negative proposition, which is logically not possible. Please understand, those who are arguing for deletion aren't trying to block new and interesting content from Wikipedia just 'cause we don't like someone or something; rather, we're aiming to keep the information in articles accurate and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, based on the most <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> we have available. This is as important for fictional material, such as <i>Lost</i> as for non-fictional ones. Many times, the sort of things someone might like to include here is actually closer to what's on personal/fan sites than what should be part of an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">encyclopaedia</a>. Not <i>everything</i> is necessary to be written up as a separate article immediately; some things, such as minor fictional characters, should wait until there's enough notable information to warrant their presentation as individual articles. I would ask that you give such material a bit more time to be developed, with appropriate deliberation and consideration. There may be a time for this article; that time is just not yet. —<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 05:02, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Wait</b> at least until the end of the season, which is only a couple of weeks away, and then decide in the interum. It would be stupid to delete an article and then re-add it two weeks later just because. Two weeks won't kill anyone, it won't hurt anyone, and no one will remember this conversation anyway.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hey I'm the Thomas Robinson that the article is talking about and, while I do have aspirations as a writer, I have no reason to have my own wikipedia page. This page was written by one of my friends without my knowledge. I'm sorry for the problems it may have caused, and please feel free to delete away. Tmr04a WAS my username, but I was dumb enough to share my password with others. I wrote a couple of serious articles that, in my opinion, do not deserve deletion, but any written under that username that seem rediculous should be deleted quickly. Again I apologize for the inconveniance, and I wish there was some way I could clean up my own mess.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Djfrolikk (<a href="../../../d/j/f/User_talk%7EDjfrolikk_df5e.html" title="User talk:Djfrolikk">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Djfrolikk_1334.html" title="Special:Contributions/Djfrolikk">contribs</a>).</small></li>

The article says that they have an EP scheduled for release some time this year, but they apparently don't have any singles, EPs, or albums out yet. <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 04:40, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Kimchi.sg. Oh wow, a bit of software written by ASwartz. Before we do this, we need an article about that one letter that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote to that one guy. In other words, just because <i>you're</i> notable doesn't mean everything you <i>do</i> is notable (and the other way around).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even if it is the only thing he is famous for, his notoriety was significant enough for his death to make all the wire services. The Associated Press refers to him as <i>a hero</i> in their article on him. Why wouldn't an 89 year old hero rate an article? If I were reading about someone risking his life to rescue a billionaire, I would want more info on that person. Who was he? What happened to him? Was he rewarded or otherwise offered compensation for his efforts? Such an event has often changed the outcome of an individual's life. What happened in this case?

<p>There are far more esoteric and useless entries on Wikipedia than this. At least some people reading this article may be inclined to try out a new game. I see no reason to delete it. At worst, it could potentially be merged with the existing <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robopound.html" title="Robopound">Robopound</a> page. infix 23:08, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. It's a drinking game, after all, and it seems an interesting one at that. Just because it was created this year doesn't mean it should immediately be deleted.</p>
<p>The game is gaining popularity and is already widely played at Princeton University. An article on Flobo should be in Wikipedia. If anything the article needs judicious editing. If there is an article on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robopound.html" title="Robopound">Robopound</a> there should be an article on Flobo.</p>

<p>Prod removed by article's creator, no explanation given. Redirect to movie's main article reverted by article's creator, again with no explanation given.

<li><b>Keep</b> You are attempting to suppress the truth. This fictional character <i>is</i> sufficiently notable as to have warranted the drafting and entry of the subject article. This fictional character's existence is at present constituted by the one specific scene. This character was deemed important enough to be depicted photographically on the packaging of the Region 1 DVD of the film. You fail to distinguish <i>objective</i> notability from <i>subjective</i> notability. The purported standard "not notable enough" is void for vagueness. Other notable fictional characters are listed and described throughout Wikipedia at discreet entries. The article is neither misleading, nor is it inaccurate. The content of the article is not profanely expressed. The article is therefore of sufficient merit. <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahbie_b23b.html" title="User:Hahbie">Hahbie</a> 10:39, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>No, I am not stating that the character is only notable because I say it is, and for no other reason other than my own caprice. I state that this fictional character is also notable on an objective basis because (1) this fictional character was depicted within a significant scene; and, (2) the depiction of this fictional character's role advances the backstory of a more prominent character depicted in the movie; and, (3) this fictional character was given a name in the screenplay; and, (4) this fictional character was depicted in a speaking role within the movie</i> per se<i>. The fat that I deemed the character notable only demonstrates the subjective component of the quality, without additional reasoning and explanation demonstrating the objective component. I have indicated several reasons why this fictional character is notable on an objective basis.</i> <i>This fictional character is no less notable than Noonien Soong of</i> Star Trek: The Next Generation <i>was after the character's first appearance in that work. I am also stating that the even the expressed WP-FICT guidelines are therefore vague. Also, in general, I state that simply because a fictional character appears in and is developed within a movie which is of the comedy genre does not diminish its notability compared to fictional characters depicted in other genres and media.</i> <i>I, myself, have never heard slurping and squishing sounds when actually witnessing the body morphology and body kinesiology of obese persons. If I agreed to and did appear in such a role within a major Hollywood motion picture, and such sound effects were subsequently dubbed in after my participation in principal photography, and without my assent, I might consider bringing an action in tort for invasion of privacy against multiple and deep-pocketed named defendants--because my agreement to appear in a motion picture in such a role would not make it legally impossible to exceed the scope of the implicit consent thereby. It would be deemed to constitute an unlawful misappropriation of my likeness and image. The foregoing statement was not nor was it intended to be legal advice. Ms. Denberg's career will probably be diminished from what it could have been as a result of this appearance.</i> <i>Also, I agree that, from what I know of them, Canadians would have even less tolerance and appreciation for such a character than Americans would. I have heard anecdotal evidence that the various Canadian government-provided health plans do not cover the various bariatric surgical procedures at all. In general, Canadians are as obese as Americans, but tend to adopt what they think is a Britishesque disdain of such a medical condition. Also, in contrast to the character of Martha Johnsone, which is developed by and as a speaking role within the movie itself, the character of "Gordon's wife", played by Suzy Nakamura, is not, and is thereby and therefore, for the purposes of cataloguing the facts of this movie, less notable, because that character only had spoken lines within the deleted scenes included in the DVD.</i> <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahbie_b23b.html" title="User:Hahbie">Hahbie</a> 02:08, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Are you done? Because it sounds like you haven't been giving us the <i>real</i> reason you created this article. Taking a stand for the rights of the obese does not constitute enyclopedic content. You can't compare a joke character to Noonien Soong from ST:TNG, who has the important role of having created one of the main characters.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He appears notable from the linked text (even taken into account its character of a speech at a dinner in honour of Luntz). But it appears that both his <i>Torts: Cases and Commentary</i> and his <i>Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death</i> have been published in at least four editions. It seems likely that he would even pass the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a> guideline for authors ("Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more"). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 12:06, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a>. He's a distinguished academic who has written some of the standard legal texts in Australia. I'd be very surprised if they haven't sold 5000+ copies. Also was a full professor at Uni.

<p>Possibly a borderline one... a Samoan cricketer. Samoa is only an afficiate member of the ICC (not even an associate member, so about as low as we can get on the scale, and there are probably only half a dozen entries for associate nation players on WP). And cricket is hardly a big sport in Samoa - it's not even the dominant form of <i>cricket</i> in Samoa (that's Kilikiti). Also, given a quick glance at who created this article, it has a strong whiff of vanity. I'd put it <i>below</i> borderline as a delete. Oh, and only two google hits for "Tumua Ioane"+cricket, although there is a <i>different</i> Tumua Ioane who plays rugby league for Wellington (who gets quite a few more hits). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 12:55, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not supporting this article just because I am its author. The only reason I wrote the article in the first place was because Wikipedia never had an entry about Aleksandra Wasowicz. I agree that there is not a lot of information on the Internet pertaining to this specific academic. However, her contributions to academia should be noted no matter how "minor" they may seem. The purpose of Wikipedia (or any encyclopedia) is to provide information so that people are aware of who is who and what is what. I apologize for utilizing the name "Alexandra Voskowitz" when I first created the article. However, I took the time to rectify this mistake and tried to help verify the existence of the Polish archaeologist. Wasowicz deserves a place in Wikipedia and therefore I vote to keep the article. - Deucalionite May 2, 2006 1:11 P.M.</li>

<p>The theory of refraction attributed here to Plato in his Timaeus does not appear in the Timaeus, nor is it attributed to Plato in the mainstream literature on the history of optics. The account seems to fit the experiment described by Ptolemy in his optics, and most accounts see it as a case of typical Ptolemaic "data smoothing," in which measured data is smoothed in terms of Ptolemy's prior assumptions about the bending of light. This article should be deleted. It conceivably could be revised and retitled "Ptolemy's theory of refraction," but this is too small a part of Ptolemy's work to merit a separate entry. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveMcCluskey_1bdc.html" title="User:SteveMcCluskey">SteveMcCluskey</a> 15:05, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, rename, and repair</b> - I spent several weeks in one of my Science, Technology, and Society classes at MIT replicating this experiment. I checked my course notes, and the theory was indeed of <i>Ptolemy</i> and not Plato. I'm not sure how that mistake made it into the encyclopedia, but it's good that it was finally caught. This is an excellent and well-documented example of a non-scientific method, and I think <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-experimental_science.html" title="Pre-experimental science">pre-experimental science</a> should mention it.

<p>Thanks to Lambiam for filling in the original source of Beland's essay. I still see two problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the judgemental tone criticizing early science for not measuring up to the expectations of modern science. Such judgemental attitudes violate the Neutral Point of View standards of of Wikipedia. Incidentally, such judgemental attitudes are also criticized by historians -- and especially historians of science -- as "Whig history" and by anthropologists as "ethnocentrism." Any rewrite will have to seriously address this judgemental tone.</li>
<li>Second, as Beland notes, he reproduced Ptolemy's <b>experiment</b> in an STS class at MIT. This suggests something is lacking in any discussion of it as an example of "pre-experimental science." I've already suggested on the History of Science Project that the "pre-experimental science" article be rewritten with a more neutral title -- perhaps something like "ancient science."--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveMcCluskey_1bdc.html" title="User:SteveMcCluskey">SteveMcCluskey</a> 22:56, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>These are indeed problems, but they are repairable; for example one can "neutrally" observe that apparently the methods of earlier natural philosophers are not precisely the same as those of modern scientists. They probably did not keep proper lab notes either&#160;:) In any case, not a ground for deletion. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> The nomination claim wasn't that the subject isn't worth a stand alone article (ie, non-notable or non-encyclopediac) - it was that it is inherently POV and mostly OR - a very different pair of statements.</dd>
<dd>As to the short duration bit, the first three sentences are a rough syllogism. Short duration + being improved = too soon to judge.</dd>
<dd>WP:BITE is relevant because the original author is a newbie, and this nomination fails to do any of these: "Observe for a while and, if necessary, ask what the newcomer is about before defining what he/she is doing as 'wrong' or 'substandard'."; "treat newcomers with kindness and patience"; "Don't slam the newcomer; remember, this is a place where anyone can edit and, in a very real sense, it is therefore each person's responsibility to edit, not to criticize or supervise others."; and "Assume good faith on the part of the newcomer. They most likely want to help out. Give them a chance!"

<li><b>Response</b> -- Alright, I'm still curious. In which way does the nomination <i>fail</i> to treat the newcomer kindly, <i>not</i> assume good faith or <i>slam</i> the newcomer? I rather hope you're not one of those that presume WP:BITE requires us never, ever to do or say anything that any newcomer might conceivably be construed not to like. There is nothing in WP:BITE requiring us to ignore WP:NOR or WP:NPOV so long as an article is written by a newbie, and it does newcomers (and, as to that, Wikipedia) a huge disservice to try. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 02:59, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Because the content is impossible to fix, as it now stands. In certain circumstances, we need to start from scratch. This is an enormous field of study, and there is a vast amount of published research, none of which is cited, and much of which uses a completely different structure from the OR approach in this article. Thus, an ideal deletion candidate. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 14:04, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally I'd like to delete articles like this. However, I have seen a great many comparable articles on Wikipedia.

Can somone point me to a previous discussion of what the minimun standards of notablitly are required for places of worship? For instance, membership in the tens or over ten thousand people? W/R to JG 'lack of substantial information' claim, I am not aware of size of article ot age of stub tag to be reasons for deletion. Will try to get more info soon to fill in the blanks.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Info on the cult accusations have been added to the objectivism articles recently to make them more NPOV.

Please do not delete such a needed article; we can always improve it to fit a better standard.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article was nominated before it had a chance a develop.

<dd><i>Comment'</i> Almost every philosophy or ideology's name is POV by that standard, but there never was anything called the "Ayn Rand cult" anymore than there was an Evil Atheist Conspiracy or a <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vast_Right-Wing_Conspiracy_f756.html" title="Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy">Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy</a>. Should we have an article called the Existentialist cult because existentialists allegedly belive that Sartre and Camus are the aribiter of "final truth." Should we pretend there was something called "Existentialist psychology" used for "thought control." (There never was "Objectivist psychology.") Are Hegelians and Kantians also part of a cult?

<dd>Was there ever any controversy surrounding Existentialism claiming it is a cult? Objectivism is unique in philosophy in that not only is it rejected by academia (which makes calling it a philosophy POV as well), but in that there <i>is</i> a controversy over whether or not it is a cult. This is a <i>very</i> <b>real</b> controversy, unlike you hypothetical Existentialist cult; there's actual cited sources in this article to prove it. If Wikipedia were to ignore this then we would have a serious POV problem on our hands beyond anything this article presents. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 22:48, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The nominator has asked that the reasons behind the decision to keep be clarified. The article was correctly identified as a copyright violation and nominated for deletion in good faith. That the subject of the article was sufficiently notable to warrant a Wikipedia article was not under dispute. During the debate the article was rewritten from scratch, thus removing any grounds for deletion. Therefore I closed the debate as a speedy keep. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 23:42, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Unfortunately you did not log in, so wikipedia only recorded your computer's IP address, making this effectively an anonymous statement. Can you log in with your user name and password and confirm this? And sign your statement by typing 4 tildes like this "~~~~" which creates an automatic timestamped signature.

<li>That hardly makes a difference. He is not less anonymous just because he logs in with a username such as User:Wallacekoehler; he would be only if the username can verifiably be connected to the real-life Wallace Koehler. In any case, the IP belongs to the State of Georgia/Board of Regents, and WK works at a state university in Georgia.<a href="http://books.valdosta.edu/mlis/cv/cv.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.valdosta.edu/mlis/cv/cv.pdf" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> I don't see much of a problem here.

<li><b>Delete</b> Term returns 12 google hits even before we go to uniqueness. Most of the hits are forum posts. One or two of the hits such as [www.cs.caltech.edu/cbsss/2002/pdf/quantum_morali.pdf] look like they are from genuine sources. I however, have never heard the term before and I have some (minimal) knowledge of the area.

Or if this is indeed the most common term (even if rarely used), just <b>keep</b> this name for better or for worse; it might help though to add a note that this "entanglement" is not related to quantum entanglement. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:45, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Generalized Uncertainty Principle</b><br />
The uncertainty principle does not just apply to position and momentum. In its general form, it applies to every pair of conjugate variables. Two variables are conjugate if the associated operators do not commute. An example of a pair of conjugate variables is the x-component of angular momentum (spin) vs. the y-component of angular momentum. In general, and unlike the case of position versus momentum discussed above, the lower bound for the product of the uncertainties of two conjugate variables depends on the state the system is in. The uncertainty principle becomes then a theorem in the theory of operators (see functional analysis). The uncertainty principle also applies to the pair of variables time and energy, but the mathematical treatment of this case differs somewhat from the operator approach mentioned above.</p>
</blockquote>

<dd>The terminology used here seems a lot more plausible. As to time and energy, here is an interesting exposition: <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/uncertainty.html" class="external text" title="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/uncertainty.html" rel="nofollow">The Time-Energy Uncertainty Relation – John Baez</a>.

<p>I think the entry should remain. There is a growing significance with her character and her relationship with Gary Troup. It would see that his nonfiction work and discussions about Hanso and Valenzetti will also have more significance. Also, her place in the lexicon of Lost hasn't fully been realized. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.23.34.232 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.23.34.232_cf11.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.23.34.232">contribs</a>) 06:36, 5 May 2006.</small></p>

<dd>I dont know about you, but right now it doesn't look like the series is going anywhere near this character (just an occasional reference to Troup's script). IF her involvment is growing, it won't be significant enough in this season anyway, and since it is about to end, I foresee 6 months of no mention of this woman. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 12:04, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article has been periodically attacked by whitewashing or blanking vandals.

It claims to be a British university, but appears to be operating illegally in the UK (possibly catering more to American and other foreign students), has no legal right to award academic degrees in the UK, and it has stolen a significant part of its website content from the website of a real (if obscure) British university.

<p>Well everybody is talking about the Canbourne University, once again, does anybody has any proof against the University&#160;? And again It's not politically correct to accuse without any proof, if the University was really a fraudulent university, why the UK or Us government did not closed down the University&#160;? It is really easy to go out and accuse all you may think that is not correct, but without any proof I can not really proof anything, Do I&#160;? I could go and put up an website, perhaps saying that the Wikipedia is a fraudulent site, based on the following: Wikipedia can be altered by any individual. I have registered with Florida state and got approved for my CPA, now If was fraudulent, the Florida state should not refused me? For me that is ridiculous.

<li><b>Merge</b>, maybe I'm mistaken, but a lot of this info doesn't appear on the Characters of Lost page. So I think we should put most of these characters <i><b>intact</b></i>, into Characters of Lost. I do think though, that it is overkill to keep a section on some of those random characters that only appear in one episode. So for the one-liner characters, the table in Characters of Lost is just fine, but for characters like Christian Shepard and Helen, I think we need to keep the info from this page. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 23:07, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On the Trinity College Page on Bebo, theres a Dark Echelon club with (currently) 19 members, and a seemingly associated club called the "Cult of the Chosen" with 159 members. Most of the conversation in the "Cult of the Chosen" forum seems to involve the fact that none of the members actually made an application to join. Both clubs "homepages" on Bebo can only be accessed by members and the Trinity page only by members of that College (as per typical Bebo college club configuration). A Recent posting seems by a Moderator suggests that some of those in the Cult of the Chosen will gain membership to the Dark Echelon via some unspecified exam. <a href="../../../1/3/4/User%7E134.226.1.136.html" title="User:134.226.1.136">134.226.1.136</a> 22:41, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
